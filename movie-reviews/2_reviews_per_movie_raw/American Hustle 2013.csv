","The performances are the safeguard for this movie to have a very long life. I couldn't care less about the characters but I loved the actors playing them. They, the characters, make choices that are as coarse as their wardrobe. Thank God for the people wearing them .Christian Bale is absolute perfection. His character is disgusting and irresistible at the same time. brilliant performance. Amy Adams is superb and Bradley Cooper an unnerving hoot - also the brief moment with Robert de Niro is simply delicious but it is Jennifer Lawrence who made me want to see the movie again as if to confirm what I seem to remember. Yes indeed. She is spectacular. A performance of such maturity - her laughter alone belongs to one of the great ones of yesteryear. - Totally present. A character actress/star."

","With a current user rating of 8.3 and with ten - yes, 10 - ratings of 100 from the critics, I feel crazy not liking this movie. Critic Richard Roeper writes that ""I can't imagine anyone who loves movies not loving THIS movie."" <br/><br/>I wanted to leave the theater and do something else after 45 minutes. No one else felt this?<br/><br/>When flipping through a friend's screen writing book recently, I read that the most important thing a movie has to do is have a main character that the audience sympathizes with, a main character that the audience roots for. Even in a complex case - such as the protagonist of August Wilson's wonderful play ""Fences"", whom we both detest and sympathize with - the audience must be drawn into actually caring about the main character.<br/><br/>This film didn't have a protagonist (that's not a fault - Shakespeare's ""Twelfth Night"" doesn't either), but still I could not have cared less about any character in this film. What was very strange, and a little unsettling, to me was that I felt this immediately, within the first five minutes of the film. <br/><br/>Another thing you'll learn from screen writing books is that amateur screenwriters use too much dialogue. This movie is a classic case in amateurish, dialogue-heavy scenes. Constant, ceaseless dialogue really bogged down the film for me. This film didn't have a single bone of subtlety in its entire body. Dialogue, dialogue, dialogue.<br/><br/>I saw in one of the trailers that this is a comedy - really!? I chuckled twice, and one of the occasions was in the film's first 30 seconds. There were several jokes that not a single person in the movie theater laughed at. <br/><br/>So, in summary, I guess I'm the only person in the world who didn't care for this one. Contrary to Mr. Roeper's assertion at the beginning of this review, I love movies but I strongly disliked this one. My favorite movie is Stanley Kubrick's ""Barry Lyndon"" - so maybe that explains it.<br/><br/>jacobnunnally.blogspot.com"
"peibeck","6","506","744","24 December 2013"," Don't be ""Hustled"" by the reviews. ""American Hustle"" is okay and nothing more
","Despite it's stellar cast and great production creds, ""American Hustle"" is little more than a sinners-with-a-heart of gold story. YAWN!!! It plays like a particularly sad Woody Allen movie without the jokes. The film is definitely not a comedy, though Jennifer Lawrence provides not only the best character but most of the few laughs the film has. <br/><br/>Christian Bale and Jeremy Renner are particularly effective in their parts. Bradley Cooper does a solid job with the most complex character in the film. Amy Adams is fine, but not award worthy for a change. <br/><br/>Watch ""The Grifters"" if you want a devilishly clever con-film, because it is 1,000,000 times better.<br/><br/>Honestly, the NY Film Critics Assn. must have gotten a con-sized pay off for calling this the best film of the year. Is it awful? No. But neither is it memorable. Fun soundtrack, great costumes, hair/make-up and photography can't make up for a plot which is dull and characters who are so uninteresting."
"SSSusin","4","224","332","20 December 2013"," Disappointing
","I went into this movie with the highest of expectations simply because I did these type of gangster, conman, dramatic type of movies. However, about 20 minutes in I was waiting and waiting for that big climax, the first killing, the twist, etc etc. However, I was left empty and unfulfilled throughout the entire movie. <br/><br/>This movie was advertised and promo'd as a serious crime, corrupt drama and it came across as a comedy moreso than a drama. It was difficult to take Bale and Cooper seriously, and the only time I really felt connected to the movie that I thought I was going to see was when Deniro hit the screen. He gave the movie a little bit of credibility, however it was short lived. <br/><br/>The story is fictional enough, and it kept somewhat interested, however it was too long and should have been shaven back a good 20-30 minutes. It was difficult to follow Bale's character because you could barely understand a thing he's saying. I understand that's his character, however it doesn't add any clarity to the story. It just makes it that much more confusing to understand.<br/><br/>The acting was nothing to write home about. I enjoyed Lawrence's performance, however I enjoyed her comedy and humor, and that was just disappointing as I didn't want to laugh in this movie. I wanted to take it seriously and I wanted to see more crime, killing and drama. It didn't deliver this unfortunately.<br/><br/>Anyways, if you go to see this movie, just don't expect to see a top quality, Scorcese type of crime / drama, because this isn't it. It's a weak attempt at trying to copy movies such as Goodfellas, The Town, Italian Job and Oceans Eleven. <br/><br/>It does have a sweet sound track, but that's not enough to save this one."
"cwaynec2001","4","271","450","28 December 2013"," No plot, no acting, no drama, no fun
","I really wanted to like this one. <br/><br/>But when a movie must resort to clothing its female lead for the entire movie in a dress whose neckline plunges to her waist, the viewer may conclude: (1) the actor cannot act and/or (2) the film is beset with massive script problems. Well, Amy Adams is a fine actor. (In Charlie Wilson's War she more than held her on with co-stars Tom Hanks, Julie Roberts and Philip Seymour Hoffman). Wish I could say the same about the script for American Hustle. Full of holes, meandering, lack of focus (do we really need flash backs every five minutes?), no tension and ends in a whimper. <br/><br/>When the director chooses to open his film with his male lead (a ""brilliant con artist"") gluing on a ridiculous toupee which is not part of a disguise, and which makes said lead appear more buffoonish than brilliant, the viewer may conclude (1) the script is scraping the bottom of the barrel for laughs, (2) the actor is sadly miscast. Well, we know all about the script. As for the male lead, I like Christian Bale, but he is out of his debt here. His role demands a brilliant, conniving, charismatic, fatherly, arrogant and essentially flawed soul. The movie cries out for Tom Hanks or at the very least Brad Pitt and reduces Mr. Beale to wondering through the scenes in a state of confusion mumbling his lines like a zombie. <br/><br/>Plot and acting problems aside you long for some good lines like:<br/><br/>Vincent Lauria (Cruise in The Color of Money): ""I've been telling her that. I got natural character.""<br/><br/>Eddie Felson (Newman): ""That's not what I said, kid. I said you are a natural character. You're an incredible flake. But that's a gift. Guys spend half their lives inventing that.""<br/><br/>Or from the Sting – the gold standard of hustler movies: ""I don't even know you."" ""You know me. I'm the same as you. It's two in the morning and I don't know nobody."" --Loretta (Dimitra Arliss) and Johnny (Robert Redford)<br/><br/>But alas all we have is a character who impersonates an upper class British woman yet only uses her fake British accent when she's introduced to someone. Really, who is she going to fool? Well, an FBI agent for one. He falls for the rouse, and you are not sure who is dumb and who is dumber. (Isn't the word ""background check"" in his vocabulary?)<br/><br/>None of this would matter if the movie garners a few laughs or gives the audience the vicarious pleasure of getting back at the SOB's of the world. But in the run time of 2 hours (30% too long), I heard the audience laugh (chuckle, really) for about a minute total in 3 or 4 of the scenes. And as for revenge on the SOB's, the target of the scam was the nicest guy in the movie (Carmine Polito, the mayor of Trenton played by Jeremy Renner). The real SOB's were the scam artists and the FBI. <br/><br/>In the director's chair sat David O. Russell, whose ""Silver Lining Playbook"" I really like. Jennifer Lawrence did well and Robert De Niro's cameo gave the cast an acting lesson. Bradley Cooper, the FBI guy, should have paid more attention to De Niro. <br/><br/>American Hustle has generated many reviewer kudos and Oscar buzzes, but I would save my money and buy popcorn at some of the other offerings out there. This one should find its proper home on a non-premium cable channel in the near future. <br/><br/>Disclaimer: Taste in movies is as individual as finger prints. You may love the ones I pan, which is terrific. Find someone who's judgment you share, or even better, watch as many as you can – the good, the bad, and the ugly. The best critic is always the one between your ears."
"beglenrice","4","221","368","16 December 2013"," Bells and Whistles but Nothing to Care About
","There is a very simple way to put this: I didn't believe it. That sums up the movie for me. Yes, there is all the razzle dazzle you can imagine. But there is nothing at the heart of this film. In Silver Linings Playbook and The Fighter, for example, I was an instant believer, I bought in immediately, and loved every second of the ensuing ride. Maybe I could tell from the trailers that we were going back to LaLa land territory. Schmooze, slick, and schtick. That's what this movie is. I was literally falling asleep. Because I never cared for a second, because I knew it was fake, the world never invited me in. Perhaps opening the movie with the old 'start halfway through the movie and then go back and show how they got to that point' tactic failed at bringing me believably along. I don't know, and it doesn't matter. The bottom line is I feel like I was never invited into a believable world. I guess it's just not that kind of movie. I had come to have high expectations after Russell's last two outings, which were basically celluloid cocaine. In those two, I was emotionally invested, in the reality, of how believable it was, and then everything else clicked. The snappy dialogue, the electric energy, the rockin' soundtrack, etc., all supported and enhanced the story, because there was a foundation laid. The believability comes from the characters and their relationships, set up by a story, or plot. Apparently Mr. Russell has lost the need for a plot as he is purported to have said when asked by Christian Bale whether the impromptu dialogue would change the story. While having a passion for characters and relationships is great, the story is an equally important element, and one that is lost here. This movie is thematically all over the place. There is little gravitas or gravity that keeps pulling us in its direction. We wander aimlessly through it, like a pimply teenager, awestruck at the glamour, not noticing that nothing is actually happening. This movie is all fluff. My favorite W.H. Auden quote also sums it up: ""What the mass media offers is not popular art but entertainment, which is intended to be consumed like food, forgotten, and replaced by a new dish."" The same could not be said about The Fighter and Silver Linings Playbook. So far 2013 is a bad vintage."
"iraz","4","576","996","28 December 2013"," Disappointed beyond belief!
","First of all David O. Russell is one of my favorite directors. I've enjoyed his films and absolutely loved ""The Fighter"" and ""Flirting with Disaster"". This film also boasts an incredibly talented cast including Christian Vale, Jeremy Renner and Amy Adams.<br/><br/>The problem is with the story, the film's pacing and length. Of course if I was enjoying the film the length would not be an issue. The film did not hold my interest and I was bored for most of it. I read that most of it is improvised, and I think this lead to it feeling very fragmented and disjointed. My mind drifted often and I checked my watch many, many times. What should have been a compelling, interesting movie was turned into a bore fest with several funny moments.<br/><br/>I am surprised at the overall extremely positive reviews and will watch it again when it is on cable but expect my reaction to be the same."
"svicious22","3","507","888","27 December 2013"," Self-indulgent mediocrity
","This movie, while containing decent acting performances for the most part, was difficult and just not very enjoyable to watch. It felt as though it was in love with itself and its whole depiction of 70s east coast disco Guido ""culture"" when in fact it was just an empty, pointless piece of bombast not half as clever as it thought it was. It felt fake, contrived and half-baked from the first scene to the last, and as others have noted you just didn't care one bit about anyone on screen.<br/><br/>The performances were decent except for the lead FBI guy (sorry but neither his screen nor real name is worth looking up) who tended to overact. But ultimately the poor plotting & pacing and the cliché ridden visuals made this one I wish I would have missed; if there was ever a movie that proves how useless so-called professional critics are, this is it."
"hardenlk","9","87","141","26 December 2013"," Brilliantly Shines in the Gray Area
","Many films nowadays fall victim to the trap of self-sacrifice--sacrificing characters for the sake of the plot, sacrificing the plot for the sake of characters, sacrificing intelligence for a visual escape, etc. The list runs long. 'American Hustle', on the other hand, sacrifices nothing. It is greedy in terms of wanting everything and achieving a step more. It is ambitious in being ambitious. It is beautiful. It is the best movie of 2013. <br/><br/>Many viewers claim to be confused and/or bored by the plot. This is a grievous misstep on their part, in my opinion. The brilliance of the plot lies in the thematic mists of the 'gray area.' From the very beginning of the film, deceit, deception, and a wildly fantastic British accent flourish on screen--and that's for the ""good guys."" The opening scene of obsessive hair care illuminates that point. Throughout the film every character continually re-invents themselves in order to survive. Alliances are never a sure thing, and suspicious eyes view the character's choices from beginning to end. The movie does an unparalleled job of making the audience realize that life, and choices, are not black and white. We live in a world of gray. This is cleverly referenced in Rosalyn's sickly sweet nail polish, the downfall of Carmine, who is a guy with good intentions and is punished accordingly, and the unorthodox work relationship under which Richie operates. This is off-putting to some people, I reason, who do not wish their own demons so blatantly danced across the big screen. Perhaps, it is time they drop their own phony accent, and own up to life. <br/><br/>The acting was out of this world. Every single one of them--Christian Bale, Amy Adams, Bradley Cooper, and Jennifer Lawrence--deserved their nominations. Bale is subtle and brilliant as Irving, the main conman. He is unappealing and dubious, yet you can't help but like him. His later soft heart towards Jeremy Renner's Carmine is icing on the cake for the dabbling in the gray area. Amy Adams shines, literally at times, as Sydney, Irving's con partner. She is the most volatile and hardest character to read for most of the film. Adams embodies the cocoon that Sydney has created with elegance and fiery deceit. Cooper is entirely convincing as the Richie, the FBI agent whose own ambition proves to be too much. Cooper brings the same electrifying energy he put on display for 'Silver Linings Playbook' (2012), and doesn't miss a beat between howl of laughter of roar of frustration as his plans become convoluted to a maximal degree. Jeremy Renner is also an absolute winner as Carmine, the mayor, despite not receiving an award nod as of yet. Renner is the consummate politician, and you can't help but sympathize with his character (even though you wonder if you should be, 95% of the time). Last, but certainly not least, is Jennifer Lawrence's Rosalyn, Irving's hysterical, deranged wife. The hype around Lawrence's role is well-deserved, she solidified herself among the elite with this role. Each of her scenes brought laughs and anticipation as you awaited what sort of screwball situations her character would stir up next. Standing ovation to all of the cast on this one--you stand far high above the rest. <br/><br/>At the core, this movie is more than just a dazzling spectacle of throwback clothing and crazy hairstyles. It speaks to an era. It speaks to human emotion and ambition. It speaks to the world we live in today. It speaks sometimes with an infectious British accent and sometimes adroitly American. Most importantly, it speaks. Go out and listen to what it has to say."
"kunalkhandwala","6","223","385","27 December 2013"," Do not get ensnared in the hype surrounding this hustle....
","In the late 1970s, while America was swinging to rock n roll, exposing all its flashy jewelery over plunging necklines and under unruly hairdos, a scandalous entrapment planned by the FBI threatened several political figures and rocked the nation in its most oddly alluring time. David Russell reunites his cast from his previous best movies including 'The Fighter' and 'Silver linings playbook' to tell us the story of con artists who are led by the FBI to trap bigger fish in an attempt to expose corruption at high levels. This highly fictionalized version of the Abscam sting by the FBI has some meaningful conversations, witty dialogue and glorious nonsense in its overlong narrative. <br/><br/>In an era of resurgent wealth and dynamic lifestyles, success is achieved with compelling ambitions amidst increasing competitiveness, only through some hustle. Right through his childhood years of conning people for his father's business, Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale) used the guise of legitimate businesses such as dry cleaning to conceal his beguiling loan schemes. Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams), initially suspicious of Irving's businesses, soon becomes his partner in bed and crime. Her fake identity as Lady Edith Greensly not only attracts investors lured by her supposed British financial contacts but also by her revealing attire. Soon enough however, the con-artist duo is in the grips of FBI agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper) who intends to entrap a New Jersey Mayor along with several Congressmen. Aided by a wire operator and a bogus Sheikh Abdullah (Michael Pena) who was to provide the funds for the redevelopment, the hustling of mayor Carmine (Jeremy Renner) begins with Richie, Sydney and Irving hustling each other in the process. If that wasn't enough, Irving's loud mouthed, cleavage flashing housewife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence) gets them all on the edge with her erratic outbursts and ignorance of the entrapment. This sexy looking inspiration of the Abscam operation lacks a fast-paced plot and intrigue that made other conman films such as 'Catch me if you can' and 'Argo', exciting movies. Loud characters protract several insipid sequences that outlast their importance from the script. The seriousness of the entrapment plot is often overshadowed with the digressed focus on the characters and their relationships and while this dilutes the story-telling, it isn't such a bad thing when you have such a talented cast. However, one can only go so far with just acting, good looks, sexy styles and 70s tunes. David Russell fails to engage the audience with a tight script and twists in a con-artist's story that are only few and far apart. Clearly, style over substance was his approach here with entertainment left solely upon the actors' talents. <br/><br/>Christian Bale put on 40lbs for this movie. It isn't the first time he has transformed himself on-screen and won't be the last. This con-man draws a line on his wrong doing and hesitates on going too big with the plan. His love for Sydney grows through the movie but always comes second to his son's well being. Irving has everything likable about him, even his weirdly meticulous wig. His softer, more intelligent character is a sharp contrast to his unabashed wife. Jennifer Lawrence plays everything that is wrong and right with the film. Rosalyn can be a big mouth, whining incessantly and trying hard to prove her worthiness. But she can also be the one character whose presence just makes you nod in disbelief about what she will do next. That uncanny ability and its unpredictable deliverance is surely Lawrence's talent at work that doesn't fail to impress. Bradley Cooper is a hot-headed FBI agent whose ambition gets the better of him. There are many scenes where he clearly improvises, such as enacting Louis C.K.'s agent Thorsen and the epic moment when Sydney lays herself out on the table for him, he gets so close and simply can't handle it. The most striking aspect of Cooper's performance is that his character is so unconvincing. He is ambitious and he has the con-artists by their necks in his elaborate plan but he is still an amateur who is guided by instinct rather than experience. Jeremy Renner's Mayor Carmine shows his devotion to his city and while it took some major hustling to draw him into the plan, those interactions with Irving were quite a delight to watch. Amy Adams looks sensational and sizzles in the chemistry she builds with Irving and Richie. She portrays wit, grace and spontaneity as they adapt to changing scenarios during the sting operation and remains ever focused on the plan. Adams may not be as loud as Lawrence nor as multi-dimensional so to speak but her screen presence is equally alluring. <br/><br/>David Russell hasn't showcased his fine talents in a script that needed to be funnier, wittier and tighter. The actors improvise on their greyish characters and provide more entertainment than the script possibly could. That certainly isn't the film-maker's achievement but he did choose the right cast that could pull that con off on the audience. Perhaps that is the year's biggest hustle from Hollywood that bends the audience into liking material that is portrayed to be far greater than it should be accorded for. Enjoy it for the gorgeous women, the committed actors and the stylish times but do not get ensnared in the hype surrounding this hustle. <br/><br/><ul><li>6.701 on a scale of 1-10.</li></ul>"

","'American Hustle'. A amazingly entertaining and engaging experience. A successful (in my opinion) juxtaposition of art and entertainment. A wonderfully acted and directed film.<br/><br/>Full disclosure: I loved both 'The Fighter' and 'Silver Linings Play', plus the cast are some of my favourite actors working in motion pictures today. So, I went in with a bias and a high level of anticipation for this film. This can sometimes work against you as a viewer as your expectations are too higher and you are disappointed with the results.<br/><br/>I can say that I was not disappointed and absolutely loved the film. People take different experiences and sensibilities with them when they see movies, and mine led me to be engaged and empathetic towards the characters. Their story interested me and I came out of the cinema thoroughly enjoying myself.<br/><br/>My only criticism is that it felt it lacked a little something with story. After seeing the film I did read that a lot of the film was improvised and Christian Bale commented to David O'Russell that this would change the story. His response was that he cared about the characters more than the story (paraphrasing). On reflection this is evident as the characters and acting are first class.<br/><br/>I by no means acclaim this to be a perfect movie or the best movie ever made, but it worked for me. I loved it!"

","How in the hell is this one of the most loved films of the year by the critics? The answer is, you just got hustled. You just got hustled if you paid to see this trash that is. The hype, the glitz, and almost no substance whatsoever seems to be the main theme of this film, also confused and senseless characters are another main theme.<br/><br/>We have come to an age where film critics are set up in four star hotels and wined and dined by the Hollywood film industry before red carpet events in order to help them make record profits. The critics and big film producers these days sleep in the same bed so to speak, and that's why you can't trust most modern day critics anymore than you can trust a two bit hustler, because really when you get down to it, they are one and the same. Only money separates what is good and bad for many of the pathetic sheep of society today.<br/><br/>To me Bale was the only thing that really stood out in a good way in this film. He delivers a highly consistent and believable character, in fact I would say he was flat out great. Amy Adams was also pretty good and Renner was again strong in a limited role. Did Cooper and Lawrence even have characters? Their character's were so unbelievable and terribly written that they just basically ruined the film for me. Lawrence pulled off the terrible character fairly well, but I couldn't help but cringe almost every time Cooper tried to play his terribly written part. I always liked Cooper in other films, but here his character is just too unbelievable, it's like he's an inconsistent cartoon man or something. I've heard that much of the film was improve, so perhaps the writing isn't all to blame.<br/><br/>The plot itself is so tired and here almost completely pointless. I would say that their is a two layered plot here and the inner hustler is the only interesting aspect of it, however it isn't nearly enough to save the film. The story lacked depth and the film had virtually no feeling to it at all, the direction is totally jumbled in my view and just went for appearance and flashy scenes. There really is nothing here besides a few good performances and a half-ass inner hustler aspect to the plot that mostly falls flat because of it's lack of depth and consistency.<br/><br/>Don't get hustled by the Hollywood hypsters, watch this film for free, if at all.<br/><br/>5.5/10"

His physical transformation into a slightly overweight conman with a bad comb-over was enhanced by his believable character portrayal, and I have renewed respect for him now as an actor that can be damn interesting to watch.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper was brilliant, as was Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner, Jennifer Lawrence, and Louis C.K.. There wasn't a single person that didn't pull their weight, and it makes the film's more-than-2-hour-length fly by.<br/><br/>There's not much in the way of physical action...in fact, I can't think of anything any action at all really...but the drama of the film is so well handled that action simply isn't necessary. Even the comedic moments were handled superbly.<br/><br/>I'd love to criticise something, cos no film is perfect, but this is a tough one to find fault with...maybe I would have left out Lawrence's dance scene when she mimed to Live and Let Die, cos it felt slightly at odds with the rest of the film in my opinion, but that's being seriously harsh.<br/><br/>So, to sum up, if you want a movie with top acting, big stars, brilliant dialogue, no over-the-top action and a well thought out story (with some historical truth mixed in), then this one is for you.<br/><br/>Trust me, you won't be sorry!"

","Set in New Jersey, American Hustle follows con man Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale) along with his partner and lover Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams) who get caught in one of their schemes by FBI agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper). However, instead of imprisonment, DiMaso convinces the two to pull off their biggest heist yet on political operator Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner). Rosenfield agrees, while also trying to keep his eccentric wife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence) under control and unable to blow their cover.<br/><br/>Under the fabulous direction of David O.Russell, American Hustle looks and feels like a 70s con/mob film through and through. Everything from the set pieces, the costumes, and even the soundtrack completely brings you out of the present and thrown into the world being portrayed on screen. The story itself doesn't exactly bring anything new to the table as far as con artist sub genre, but everything else about it sets apart from any other film you'll see this year. We are given a group of characters that each have their own story to tell in the way they are presented to us. Even if a person viewing the film isn't exactly sold by the story, it's the characters that really help move the film along.<br/><br/>Along with the engaging characters, we have an outstanding cast that help bring them to life. Christian Bale does a good job as the lead as the slimy con man who thinks he's on the top of the world. Amy Adams plays his partner and lover and portrays the seductive role with ease. However, our two other leads give the best performances of the film. Bradley Cooper provides a lot of the comic relief in the film as the cop who coaxes the two con artists into the situation. He plays the cocky and at times crazy character who tries to use his charm to get what he wants, and Cooper nails it. Also providing comic relief is Jennifer Lawrence. At 22-years-old she's playing a role that requires her to act so much older than she actually is. As the wife of Bale's character, she plays the snooping and eccentric character so perfectly and just over-the- top enough to really believe it. She once again proves that she is the most talented young actress of her generation.<br/><br/>American Hustle is an excellent addition to the sub genre with excellent direction and a solid cast that help bring the story and setting to life and completely take you into the world you're watching portrayed. <br/><br/>My Rating: 9/10"
"darius-azadeh","8","46","77","3 January 2014"," If seeing Jennifer Lawrence clean a house to 'Live and Let Die' is on your bucket list, then this your kind of movie
","'American Hustle' is another movie that I've really wanted to see for a long time. It's probably because I love the 70s, or whatever. When it was finally released in good ol' England, it did not disappoint. <br/><br/>Coming into this with only having seen 'Silver Linings Playbook' as some of O Russell's previous work, I didn't really know what to expect. Although that was very good, it is completely different on many levels, so whatever this was, it was going to be fresh. <br/><br/>As not to spoil anything, I won't go through the film scene by scene, but I have to say this film met and (to an extend) exceeded my expectations. There was noting I didn't like about it, because everything and everyone was just so brilliant. First off, the acting was superb. The improv that the actors pull off made it all so much more real, because you felt that they were just letting themselves run with the story and script. When the tensions rise (which frequently happens during this film), you feel for these characters, because for a second they really are Riche Dimasso or Irving Rosenfelt. It also added a lot of the humour, which showed that, although it primarily felt like a drama, it didn't take it's self too seriously, which is so fresh and needed in Hollywood right now. <br/><br/>For me, J Law's acting talent stole the show. I saw her in 'Silver Linings' and the first 'Hunger Games' a while back, so again I didn't have any real preconception of what she would be like. But in this movie, her acting was just on another level. Every scene she was in carried so many emotions, and you'd couldn't tell if she was going to explode at any point (a'la the bathroom scene with Sydney). The things her character gets herself into in this film, even while she's still at home, are just out right slap your knee hilarious, especially the argument scenes. <br/><br/>Direction was a large positive for this. The way the camera moves is so subtle yet so effective. There are a lot of clichés that it could have fallen into, but O' Russell was very clever, and everything about the way he directed it was planned out perfectly. The camera seems to interact with the characters emotions, so you're really seeing this on more than one level. <br/><br/>The story was another element that made it so brilliant for me. Well, that was at the end. I loved the way it ended. It's just as the film plays out, you're so engrossed in the amazing performances, style, characters and humour, it gets hard to keep track of the story. Not on the level of the new 'Doctor Who' episodes, which have plot lines so ridiculously convoluted. You weren't supposed to get it at the start, as your just thrown into this world of eccentric, self absorbed con-men. You get the general idea throughout, with what's happening and what they're aiming to do, but when it got to the end, I didn't get some of the things they were taking about that seemed important ('Did I miss all of that? Was that when that old guy walked in to the cinema with a 20 year old something girlfriend and I lost focus for a bit?'). I heard that O' Russell was more focused on the characters, and lost a lot of story to allow room for Improv, so I guess it's OK if you don't get all of it. I didn't and still thoroughly enjoyed it. There are times during the film when I thought ""Wow, that's a brilliant way to end a movie"", and then it suddenly carried on and wasn't over, and the story got even more compelling. The way it wrapped up was a feat of true story telling. <br/><br/>I'm not one for movies about money and mafias and cons and all that, but aside from that, it's just as much a tale about relationships and what people are really like. The story of Irving's relationship with his family and Sydney plays out so well, and you feel things for them as their relationship changes, and when Cooper's character enters their unique workforce. <br/><br/>This film really benefited from the actors improvising, as it lead to some very funny moments. Obviously meaning to be funny, like the scene on the the jet and Roselyn's explanations for everything Irving throws at her. I meant that scene where she cleans the house to Live and Let Die is hilariously awkward to watch, with her little son just sitting there and watching his mom give an angry yet powerful rendition of the Wings song. <br/><br/>Bale portrayed Irving brilliantly. When things get tough for him, he excellently shows how a man of his status and ideology breaks down, bit by bit. You start the realize that even though he's so eccentric and rich, he still only human. I think Jeremy Renner deserves credit for that too. Not in the sense that his character goes through the same stuff as Bale's, but in that he was played with so much heart and honesty. <br/><br/>Something that hasn't been seen for a while in Movie-Land, 'American Hustle' is a unique film that gets in the audience up close and personal with every main character they see. The story could have been clearer, but heck, 'Badlands' had little story and that was brilliant too. It makes way for the improvisation, which adds so much and another dynamic to the story and experience."

","I am absolutely astounded by all of the fantastic reviews this movie has gotten by the critics and users on this site. Did we not watch the same movie? I was so bored about an hour into this show that I almost fell asleep watching it. This movie was at least 30 minutes too long and so over acted it was ridiculous. It looks to me like the only reason this movie had all of the big name stars in it (Jennifer Lawrence, Amy Adams, Christian Bale, Robert De Niro, etc.) was to insure a big box office draw because they could have done this film just as easily with mostly unknowns and saved themselves about 30-35 million dollars. <br/><br/>The critics made such a big deal about Christian Bale's physical transformation but as far as I'm concerned... WHY??? What was the point of him gaining 40 pounds for this role? It did not add one single thing to the plot of this movie. He could have done the exact same performance in his natural state and it would not have made any difference to the movie or his character. <br/><br/>Usually I love Jennifer Lawrence in anything. She is so talented and beautiful, but her character portrayal was way too over the top and cliché as a self absorbed, loud-mouthed New Jersey housewife. You might as well have been watching an episode of The Real Housewives of New Jersey or watching Snooki on Jersey Shore. <br/><br/>Then there is Robert De Niro playing (shocker) a mobster! Talk about type casting, I'm surprised they didn't just include Joe Pesci and Michelle Pfeifer as his sidekicks.<br/><br/>I understand that this movie is up for some Academy Awards. They should not award this movie or any of the actors awards for this. I would not recommend this movie to anyone unless they have about 2 hours and $10 to just throw away. When I saw the teaser for this movie I said to myself, ""I can't wait to see that"". After seeing it, I said to myself ""I want my money back""."

A vague lesson spoon-fed to the audience during the first 20 minutes is I'm guessing what is supposed to excuse the senseless and bumbling bore of a circus for the next 100.<br/><br/>I absolutely do not understand the praise of the acting in this film. I never bought into the actors as their roles, though, honestly, there was not much else holding it together for me. Was there a script? Was there a director??? The entire sad excuse for a film seemed to be the improvised work of the actors themselves contrived in a garage somewhere after a long night of drinking.<br/><br/>I never was really motivated to read into the movie, and I was never really fully engaged or entertained by the shallow antics, long-hanging scenes that go on way too long, or 70's retro-obsession. I'm not sure if I'm supposed to be mesmerized by watching makeup applied to Christian Bale's head or how cool walking into a 70's themed wardrobe would be. It seemed none of the actors could keep their accents. I would never label this as a comedy-- I did laugh from time to time because of how badly I wanted it to be over.<br/><br/>For a respectable story about individuals trying to reinvent themselves please see The Great Gatsby, The Departed, or The Town (and I'm sure there are many more)."

","Two key words for this movie: boring and ridiculous. I feel like because of the a-list casting for this movie the director felt like they could get away with an awful a movie, and unfortunately they probably will. I watched the film with the rest of my family, and not one of us enjoyed it. We wanted to stop watching halfway through, to be honest. Here are some of the main things (aside from a story told badly) that I found wrong with the movie: 1. Yes there were loads of actors that we all know, but the casting was still off. I thought Amy Adams was the wrong choice for this ""bad girl"" role, it felt weird to watch. Jennifer Lawrence I thought overacted. The rest of the actors however seemed to do what they could with the ridiculous script. 2. Some of the most ridiculous scenes I have ever had the displeasure of watching. The point where I started out-loud laughing at the stupidity was when the FBI agent, Richie DiMaso , bashed up his boss, Stoddard Thorsen, and it was all fine. Oh man, that was some ridiculous stuff. Anyway, I could go on but I can't be bothered, I'm sure this movie will get loads of rewards and great reviews which it does not deserve, but people are easy to give in to the hype."

","There are no spoilers in my review:<br/><br/>I have never been so disappointed in a film. With all the hype, I expected another House of Games (1987) or Grifter (1990) or maybe a hard edged drama like The Departed. Instead I saw a very boring film that had no idea what it was. Before I went in, I read that it was a drama. Others said a comedy. Others said a dark comedy. It attempted to be all of the above and succeeded at none. The movie was so boring, after 45 minutes I started to watch the reactions of the viewers around me in the packed theater. It was very telling and far more entertaining than the movie. Over and over, we would be presented a dramatic scene with deep consequences to the plot and to the characters that is then immediately followed by what was supposed to be a funny scene. For example, we have a deep complex scene of someone worried he is going to get killed at anytime. Well done writing and scene. You'll be invested. It's then IMMEDIATELY followed by a housewife cleaning her house while humorously singing and dancing to the song ""Live & Let Die."" Do you laugh? What just happened? At the very end of the scene when you realize the director is holding up the ""laugh"" sign, you uneasily chuckle- just a little. In another scene, you have a character do harm to his superior. The superior is beaten badly. Not only is the subordinate not punished, it's played for laughs. Not knowing what reaction I was supposed to have (laugh, cry, be concerned, be worried) actually made my stomach queasy - and I eat habaneros for breakfast! I said several times to the people I was with that this is boring and bad and made no sense. This is not well done. They all agreed.

"keelan_ruls","10","131","256","12 December 2013"," A Cetinich Review (#2 - American Hustle) - Brilliant Throughout
","American Hustle, starring Christian Bale, Amy Adams and Bradley Cooper, is about two con artists forced into working for an FBI agent as he pushes the two into a world of New Jersey mafia. Directed by David O. Russell, the director who brought you Silver Linings Playbook and The Fighter, American Hustle is most probably Russell's best movie he's ever put together.<br/><br/>American Hustle is set in the late 1970's - early 1980's, revolving around the Abscam scandal, where FBI agents and con artists would join together to take down politics for illegal cash. The casting and acting is brilliant. You couldn't really picture anybody else playing the characters that have been casted. Each actor gets their own chance to shine in the spotlight, and nobody is left out. Jennifer Lawrence blows everybody away once again - she really is a rising star in the industry with her performance as Rosalyn Rosenfeld. This might be Bradley Cooper's best movie so far as well - he really brings his A-Game for the movie as Richie DiMaso.<br/><br/>The movie has cleavage, drugs, money, quirkiness, great actors, comedy, drama and lesbian kisses which makes for an amazing and unbeatable combination. Five losers who all think they are winners, American Hustle is up there with great movies like Goodfellas, but is definitely an original creation. <br/><br/>Acting: 10/10 <br/><br/>Writing: 10/10<br/><br/>Directing: 9/10<br/><br/>Setting: 9/10<br/><br/>Overall Rating: 9.5"

"zpct","Null","72","136","12 December 2013"," Hustle, Hustle, Hustle.
","American Hustle is built as the 2013 revival of classic Scorsese gangster pictures like Goodfellas and Casino, but without the gangsters. It has the plot twists, the plethora of pop tunes, the conniving characters, the backstabbings, the high life, the low life, the disgruntled females merciless attached to crooked husbands, the stranded children, and so on. But it's new. Fresh out of the oven. Baked with wonderful performances and tight scriptwriting. And it has characters who inhabit the story and make it their own.<br/><br/>The movie begins in medias res, with two con men -- and one con lady -- attempting to buy out a Jersey mayor. There's a lovely opening shot of Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale, almost unrecognisable) carefully and painstakingly combing over his thinning strands of hair. This scene reminded me very much of the opening of Richard Linklater's Bernie, where a plump but serene mortician played by Jack Black joyfully lectures a scarce hall of students on the process of embalming. It's a slow scene, maybe too slow to open up a movie, but we are never bored, because we are given insight to a skill that we've never seen before, or don't know much about. It's the same with this scene. I've never seen anyone cover up bald. It's always bald being uncovered; wigs and toupees accidentally being ripped off, or blown away by strong winds. The scene also informs us that Irving is a certain kind of character.<br/><br/>After jumping to a series of flashbacks, in which the history between Irving and his long-time girlfriend Sydney (Amy Adams, almost unrecognisable without her makeup) is revealed to have blossomed over a shared love of Duke Ellington, the plot begins proper. Irving and Sydney -- now posing as a wealthy British banker named Edith -- have been arrested by Richie (Bradley Cooper, fully recognisable despite his hairdo), an ambitious FBI agent who thinks he has the wit and skill to take down corrupt congressmen and casino gangsters with flimsy, ill-conceived plans. He ropes Irving and Sydney into his little schemes, and soon has them taking on an entire network of illegal tradesmen.<br/><br/>Caught in the middle are two people: Mayor Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner), and Irving's wife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence). Carmine is the mayor whom the trio wanted to con at the start of the movie. He becomes integral to the plot when Irving develops a friendship with him. Do I tell him that I've been conning him all along, and that my innocent little scheme might get him arrested in front of his wife and six children? Or do I stay quiet, maintain the friendship, and face my conscience alone? What he does, I will not say.<br/><br/>Rosalyn is an interesting character. Yes, she skirts dangerously close to the Sharon Stones and Lorraine Braccos of the old Scorsese pictures, but Jennifer Lawrence is able to lift her away from them by being more grounded. Stone always seemed to operate on her own terms in Casino. She was a third wheel, functioning outside of the overall story. Here, Rosalyn is fully aware of the situation at hand. She's right smack in the middle of the story. She doesn't love Irving. Irving doesn't love her. But they both love their son, and Rosalyn doesn't want a divorce tarnishing her solid family marital integrity. But she knows that the love festering in the household is only producing toxic fumes. Where her character goes is a place best kept hidden.<br/><br/>And then there's a mix of other secondary characters, including perhaps the best cameo I've seen (not because of the cameo itself, but because of the meaning of the cameo). All of them dip in and out of this intelligent story with impact. Why, even Richie's boss, Stoddard Thorsen (Louis C.K.), is a lovely guy. He provides much of the movie's humour, and there is much of it. Director David O. Russell has said that his goal with American Hustle was to focus on the characters instead of the plot. Indeed, what a good decision. It's a rare moment when not a single character seems out of place. They complement each other, whether they're kissing, punching, clawing, or scratching. And they share so much chemistry that you could select any two of them at random, chuck them into an empty room, and watch them chatter till their throats went dry.<br/><br/>I attended a screening of this movie in Mandurah, which is a lovely place. The cinema had maybe nine other patrons (weird, considering it was opening day). I'd been to Mandurah a few times before, and I watched The Counselor there. That was a poor movie, but the screening was smooth, which is more than I can say for the screening of this film. With about 15 minutes to go, the video jammed and stuttered slowly to a halt. It's the first time I've seen digital video jam. And it couldn't have happened at a worse time. The projectionist eventually rectified the problem, but I had already been sucked out of the moment. That's a pity, because American Hustle was shaping up to be one of the best movies of the year. You know what? Screw it. It still is."

","from http://bbman94.wix.com/brandonsmoviecorner<br/><br/>The power of filmmaking; that is the proved power David O. Russell seems to have over his viewers. His last two Oscar nabbing films (The Fighter & Silver Linings Playbook) combined dramatic storytelling and comedy to us through strong characters with top notch actors. American Hustle; O Russell's newest film, delivers upon every aspect of filmmaking, giving us a gripping comedy with fantastic performances. American Hustle will no doubt 'hussle' for the golden statues this year; and other nominees better beware.<br/><br/>The movie moves at an electric pace, jumping to and from different character arcs. We are introduced to plenty of great faces, but our main heroes are daring con artists Irving Rosenfield (Christian Bale) and Sydney Prosser. (Amy Adams) Their affair is heartbreaking and their performances are phenomenal; leaving you wanting no more or less out of their characters. They are eventually forced to team up with hot headed Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper) who is an out of control FBI agent trying to take his biggest case yet; bringing down powerful political figure Carmine Polito. (Jeremy Renner) DiMaso's eagerness in the act leaves all of our characters with major problems and the movie becomes a stimulating narrative with surprises around every turn. By the time you've thought you've had your fun, Jennifer Lawrence enters the scene as Rosalyn Rosenfield; Irving's pretentious, loud mouthed, b**** of a wife who adds extra tension to the story and even after all of the stuff she does you still root for her to come out okay in the end.<br/><br/>All around American Hustle was a fantastic film, easily one of the best of the year. It delivers well on dramatic storytelling, light hearted comedy, and stellar, Oscar worthy performances. Amy Adams and Christian Bale stood out the most to me, and the supporting cast was great. American Hustle was definitely another superb ensemble film from David O. Russell and his talents; and his newest film was so good that I already want to sit down and relive it again."

","Based on true events from the 1970's Abscam case, this is an ingenious con movie and Russell's best film to date. This film has excellent direction, screenplay, cinematography, editing, costume, soundtrack and acting. The entire cast are in top form. Bale, Adams, Cooper, Lawrence and Renner deliver outstanding performances with Renner offering the best of his career. Bale's method acting is unparalleled. The plot revolves around a conman, Irving Rosenfeld and conwomen, Sydney Prosser who are professional at short cons such as art forgery and loan sharking. They are apprehended and are recruited by FBI agent Richie DiMaso to bring down crooked politicians in order for immunity. The target is New Jersey Mayor Carmine Polito. That is where the real fun and long con begins. Along the way Richie who fancies himself a hot shot is being seduced by Sydney and Irving's jealous and semi-psychotic wife Rosalyn is threatening to expose Irving's con without even knowing she is doing so. There are so many memorable scenes and quotes in this film it's hard for this viewer to choose a favorite. If I had to pick two scenes first would be when Irving comes clean to family man Carmine whom he has truly befriended that he set him up. The second would be the look on Richie's face when the long con is revealed and he realizes he has just been hustled by the best. The film is witty, clever, insightful, duplicitous, blazing, ingenious and has a cathartic ending. It is a nearly flawless and mesmorizing film that keeps the viewer guessing throughout.

"axel-koch","3","14","22","2 March 2014"," Ridiculous, boring, uninteresting - seriously, who enjoyed this film?
","The vast majority of critics and (thus?) moviegoers reacted differently, but I actually consider American Hustle to be an effective argument against improvisation in films. Because, whereas I'm a great fan of it when it's executed amusingly by talented stand-up comedians, unscripted babble can thoroughly blacken a film's quality – and that's exactly what happened with this one.<br/><br/>David O. Russell has an increasingly strong penchant for preferring characters over plot, which he and his actors have stated numerous times and which worked in some of his earlier stuff. However, the New York writer/director oversteps the bounds of aforementioned conversation technique in his 2013 release and makes it a hopeful contestant for the most boring ""comedy"" I've ever seen in my life. The almost two and a half hours of running time have a promising start with a ridiculously long take of Christian Bale adjusting his hair, but the only thing American Hustle remains after that is ridiculous. Each and every role is cast with a talented actor or actress, but in my humble opinion, this is irrelevant, as none of them are realistic, likable, or even interesting and impromptu doesn't suit any of them.<br/><br/>I haven't had a tittle of insight in the making of this surprising Oscar nominee, but, from what I saw on screen, I assume that the actors had a great deal of fun with it. Be that as it may, none of it relayed to me as an audience member and I was merely at awe how Russell could possibly neglect his task of directing that much, apparently delightfully accepting all ideas he was presented with, regardless of their absurdity. Some scenes, for example Robert De Niro's one and only, are totally void of sense and some of the biggest ""Plot? Screw that."" moments I can remember to have seen in all my life. The abundantly great amounts of improvisation would have led to something wholly incomprehensible and thus, Russell (due to his producers' demands, maybe) reacted the way you could expect: filling a perceived third of the film with explanatory voice-over, a trite and overused compensation for poor storytelling.<br/><br/>Granted, American Hustle does have good-looking costumes and set design as well as fine cinematography and editing, and if you find joy in the over the top of over the top portrayal of characters– well, go ahead, watch it. I just think that most of the people claiming to like the film are being overtly pretentious and following critics' opinions, since there isn't really anything about it to enjoy."

","this film, to me, is a joke and an ultimate insult to the viewers who still got some reasoning abilities and basic taste buds enough to distinguish between good and bad film. first of all, very bad casting that none of the characters looked convincingly enough to be who should be or would be. if you tried to con rich and powerful people, you must let them to believe you were who you were, the con and the scam must allow them to believe it was true enough and profitable enough, because rich and powerful people were not naive and stupid, otherwise, they would never got to the top of the social ladder. the rich and the powerful pack were a special species who usually got a very sensitive nose to smell fishy deals, they were always on the fence to protect themselves, and they always knew they might become the marks of scams. partner with a low class woman and claimed her with London banking connection was the first pitfall of this stupid film, because she didn't have the least believable ingredients to fool people that she was a British, she didn't look like a British, she didn't talk like a British, she didn't show anything that could prove she got the foreign financial connections. it was laughable that she could con any man just by wearing some expensive clothes or showed people with some fake deposit certificate. then, again, all the make-up works were horrible, the hairdos of the cons and the marks, especially the so-called mayor, what funny cartoon character! the horrible screenplay just took everything so conveniently granted, feeding stupid scenarios and plots to viewers like they got no brains, carelessly put together. the male and the female cons only gave you an impression that they were white trash from the trailer parks. the politicians and the mafia, all looked like characters from the disneyland. the storyline, nothing but a project from a high school student, submitted a homework overnight. there's nothing worth praising at all for this film, and after a whole year's viewing experience and the last film watched end of the year, it has spoiled and ruined all the good memory of some good films of 2013. we viewers should be always picky and always got the attitude of not so easy to be pleased or satisfied to any film, because only with such principle, the Hollywood movie industries would take us seriously and never take us for granted as brainless morons that they could keep dumping garbage on us. you should always treat the gangs from Hollywood as con men or scammers, always suspect they might treat you as stupid mark. only by such serious once-bitten-twice-shy viewing attitude, they might have the luck to fool you once, but never twice."

","Let me say at the outset that I am at odds with the majority of critics and IMDb reviewers to date in that I thought that American Hustle was an ordinary movie. It's not that I didn't want to enjoy it. I really like Christian Bale and Amy Adams, I think that Jennifer Lawrence is destined to become the best actress of her generation and I like Bradley Cooper, Jeremy Renner and Robert de Niro. From a cast level, I wanted it to succeed.<br/><br/>Perhaps my mistake was in viewing it as a drama. True, there were some humorous lines but I thought that essentially the movie aimed at the dramatic, with some violent scenes adding weight to that view. Now I find out from the Golden Globe nominations that it was a musical or comedy. (The soundtrack was good, so maybe the nominators have viewed it as a musical??)<br/><br/>Seriously, though, I was expecting more action. I thought that the movie was too long and some scenes were far too tedious, and as a result I became bored. In addition, I didn't much care what happened to any of the seedy characters, which added to my level of apathy.<br/><br/>I am out of step with the majority, as I have admitted, but I felt that the alternative view deserved to be aired."

","What a horrific movie this is! Yuk!!! Get away from this monstrosity of a picture! Kidding! Just conning you because everyday I'm hustling LMFAO!!! I am no pun hustler, well maybe a little, but one thing I know that is real is that ""American Hustle"" is one of the best if not the best movie of 2013. Director David O. Russell strikes gold again with another impressive playbook in orchestrating a motion picture. ""American Hustle"" stars a top-of-his-game Christian Bale as Irving Rosenfeld, a lifelong New York con artist who teams up with the beautiful Sydney Prosser to con desperate men asking for loans. Amy Adams plays Prosser with exact precision. Not to mention, Amy has never looked better in a movie; Will Larry Flynt be calling Amy for a Hustler cover? Who knows? But she is better than that. Anyways, when Irving and Sydney get busted by FBI Agent Richie DiMaso (masterfully played by Bradley Cooper), the con game goes into a governmental level. DiMaso uses Irving and Sydney to seize elected officials in taking bribes; this was all based on the real life Abscam scandal of the late 70's. The movie is set in the 70's and it is presented also as a love letter to that ""won't play by the rules"" decade, and that is the way uh-huh uh-huh I like it. Jennifer Lawrence also is on target here as Irving's showy wife Rosalyn. Jeremy Renner contributed a major Mayor performance as the targeted Mayor Carmine Polito. The entire acting ensemble of ""American Hustle"" was spectacular, but my favorite performance of the movie was of Cooper's as DiMaso. David O. Russell co-wrote the screenplay with Eric Singer, and what a money script it was. Sure Mr. Russell did incorporate a few Scorseseisms in his direction and writing of ""American Hustle"", but he did inject his own Russell muscle to it also. This movie should garner a plethora of Oscar nominations for Acting, Screenplay, and Direction among many other categories; and if it doesn't, there has to be some type of con going on in the Academy. So get on your Con-Air vehicle to witness the cinematic brilliance of ""American Hustle"". In other words, do the hustle!!!! ***** Excellent"

","Frankly, the movie itself does not live up to its hype. I never was fully engaged with any character even though it takes more than enough time and delivers a tedious and often painstaking pace. Honestly, it felt to me like the film dragged and that the ending would never arrive. Even though not fully engaged and not empathetic towards any character depicted, there is enough style that I somehow cared about how the story ended. Every scene seemed to me like an exercise in an acting class. It feels like a professor took a group of talented actors and gave them this over-the-top 1970's assignment. Everyone gets an ""A"" because they are that good but it barely felt like a coherent film to me. It's like their assignment included constant references to try and deliver a ""Goodfellas"" type tone without having a script to back it up. The events of the conclusion were so easy to spot that I'm sure most everyone will see it coming a mile away. <br/><br/>Overall, interesting but there is far less substance than I was expecting.

Yes, there moments of genuine intensity, and yes, the final 15 minutes or so go quite well, but for nearly two hours of running time the only thing keeping me in the theater was the fact that my wife didn't want to leave.

","In American vernacular, ""hustle"" has several definitions. One of the definitions is ""to cheat"". Another reference is a type of dance, popular in the 70s disco craze. ""American Hustle"" is about a con job that is choreographed better than any dance move you can think of. The first screen capture read ""some of this actually happened"". The true part of the film is easy to recognize. During the waning days of the 70s, the US Feds operated a sting operation meant to capture corrupt US politicians. ABSCAM generated a lot of headlines and, if you're interested in the details, Google is your friend. The good part of the film, though, is a fictional story of how a couple of grifters get recruited by the Feds. Robert DeNiro is on screen less than a minute, in an uncredited role of a possibly corrupt casino owner, and he's substantially more menacing than his role in the execrable celluloid cesspool ""Malavita"". Jennifer Lawrence portrays a completely out-of-control wife, and her performance reminded me of Elizabeth Taylor in ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf"".

David O' Russell is not a good director. Don't watch it."
"GrandThanksReviews","6","6","8","5 January 2014"," Strong performances and early promise proved to be the film's greatest con.
","WARNING: Potential plot spoilers ahead.<br/><br/>Originality is rare in Hollywood these days. This is clearly evident in the emerging trend of taking true stories and injecting them with wacky dark comedy in an attempt to charm audiences. Judging by the trailer, The Wolf of Wall Street will attempt to succeed with a prototype that first fell short in Pain & Gain and now sadly, with American Hustle. A clue of the picture's direction is given right before the opening scene when the words ""some of this actually happened"" appear on the screen.<br/><br/>David O. Russell adopts the 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it' approach to casting, with several of the actors having worked with him before. It was a decent decision, as these performances, along with Russell's slick, fast-paced directing style, save the film from pure mediocrity. The basic subject matter, of which it is based, provides just enough substance to not let the style smother the film completely. It is just a pity that the much of the focus was aimed at the parts that didn't actually happen.<br/><br/>The story follows two con artists (Christian Bale and Amy Adams) who are, through the errors of their ways, recruited by an ambitious FBI agent (Bradley Cooper) to use their skills to implicate politicians and mafia in accepting bribes. From the opening moments there are threats that Bale, along with his comb over and pot belly, will overpower the film with another huge performance. However, it was the over-the-top 1970s fashion and decor that intoxicated the movie, compared to quite an understated offering from Bale. The entire cast excels, with Jennifer Lawrence particularly shining as Bale's manipulative, but foolish wife.<br/><br/>The film begins from the middle of it's story arc, helping to provide clarity on the dynamic between the leading characters. It then slickly tells the back story, cleverly sharing the narration between Bale, Adams and Cooper. The quick pace and intrigue continues up until the opening scene is revisited. Hereafter, the tone of the film changes, as proper plot development is sacrificed for humour.<br/><br/>Ultimately, it is the script that proved the film's weakest component. It had the audience laughing, particularly the ongoing gag about ice-fishing between Cooper and his boss, but the subject matter deserved a more serious delivery. Despite the genre identity crisis, American Hustle is likely to do well in the upcoming award season (particularly the actors), but it is not a film I will look back on fondly in years to come. Worth a watch on the small screen, but I wouldn't recommend parting with your money at the cinema.<br/><br/>Neil M. (Grand Thanks Reviews)"

","I was really expecting a lot given all the hype. Wow, what an overrated movie. A lot of talented actors does not a good movie make.<br/><br/>First, the story itself is not all that interesting. You got this mayor in Camden, NJ who wants to invest in Atlantic City's casinos. Not really sure why he had to be from Camden as opposed to Atlantic City, but OK. Anyway, you end up with corruption, etc. but the whole thing looks to be engineered by the FBI. In the middle is a sleazy financier running a one-man one-woman what looks to be a Ponzi scheme. Why anyone would invest money with this guy I don't know, but I suppose it's barely possible.<br/><br/>Next, as uninteresting as the story was, you have a really weak script. The whole movie feels like going from scene to scene. It's disjointed and some scenes are way over the top. For example, in one scene Bradley Cooper starts screaming for no apparent reason, Amy Adams smack him with a picture frame for no apparent reason, and out of nowhere Christian Bale shows up with a gun. Another one: FBI guys partying like frat boys which felt 100% out of place.<br/><br/>Direction was generally OK except for the camera tilting to show Bradley Cooper's and Robert De Niro's hands when they were talking.

Jennifer Lawrence is very good, but just a bit over the top. She's the only one where you ever ""see"" the acting. The others - as great as they are - disappear into their characters, especially Bale.<br/><br/>The overall direction of the plot is constrained by the fact that the movie is loosely based on the ABSCAM sting of the late 70s. However, if you remember the news from that time, it was a very controversial operation. Even many members of the law enforcement community believed that the FBI crossed the line into entrapment. As a result, it is very natural that this movie about con-men helping the FBI con public officials into taking bribes has a wonderfully calculated unevenness. The line between good guy and bad guy is a lot less clear than the line between legal and illegal.<br/><br/>A con is all about improv, and this movie feels like it. Great characters making it up as they go along. The classic con movie of all time, ""The Sting"", was beautiful for its ultimate sense of how well the plan was choreographed. The joy of American Hustle is that it doesn't feel choreographed at all - it feels natural, reactive. And that's brilliant filmmaking."

","While American Hustle absolutely has some significant flaws, it's just so much fun to watch and with such great acting that I can't help but love it. This is probably my favorite actor (Bale) and actress (Adams) at their best, and Cooper is also phenomenal. The characters are intense and layered and the actors bring emotion and investment into each of their interactions. Each relationship in the movie felt uncertain and volatile, and each had real weight to it. The plot and themes are also both very good - many of the ideas of morality and what one is willing to do to succeed, and how to use other people to have your own success, really hit home. The final con did surprise me and was a fitting ending, encapsulating the bizarre, unfair, and dishonest world of politics and financial dealings. One of my big problems with the film was its oversexualization of women, as they were too often used as purely sex objects, and this took me out of the story several times. I also thought some of the relationship drama with the very blatantly polyamorous dealings going on and nobody really confronting each other about it, just accepting it as normal was strange to me, though that may have been more normal in the 70s? The story progression could've been a bit more precise and demonstrative in the major plot points, but between the wonderful performances and the fun, unpredictable nature of the plot and characters, American Hustle is a fun, wild ride from the feet up."
"xcisics","10","7","10","20 September 2014"," A great movie in an quiet genre
","Let's face it; the crime genre has been pretty much dead for the past few years. However, American Hustle brought it back in a much needed reinvigoration; and a great one, for that.<br/><br/>David Russell's movie is a great portrayal of the Abscam scheme, something which was brand new territory for me before I watched American Hustle. Despite it being very much of a dramatization of the scam, American Hustle captures the real essence of political crime in the 1970's.<br/><br/>The characters in the movie instantly interested me; I wanted to know how this unusual group had come together, other than the obvious reason of an imminent hustle. These characters were well portrayed by their actors and actresses, which was expected when I saw the well known and reputable names of the lead cast. <br/><br/>Despite this, I felt that Jennifer Lawrence seemed to be a little out of place in her role as Rosalyn - moreover, Rosalyn seemed like a slightly unnecessary character, placed only to drag out the plot.<br/><br/>Overall, however, the movie is great. The directing performed by Russell is fantastic and captures all the emotion of the movie, something not commonly seen in this genre. American Hustle is an excellent movie, and, despite it's lengthiness, a great watch for those interested in the crime/drama genre."

","If upon learning this was a con artist story you were expecting ""Ocean's 11"" or ""Now You See Me"", prepare to be disappointed. It began with Christian Bale's shirtless fat guy body gluing his ""elaborate comb-over"" to his scalp, and didn't get better. 10 Oscar nominations? I don't get it. I will say the acting was rather good: Jennifer Lawrence was great in her role and deserved the Golden Globe (though I didn't see any of her competition). Bale and Amy Adams were believable, but I can't see ""best actor"" for either (though I realize Amy already got the GG). Though I like her, I think she might have won on the basis of cleavage - everything she wore was open down to the waist (not complaining). I've seen magazines from the 70s and I can't recall every outfit looking like that.<br/><br/>There was a story, such as it was, but it wasn't very cohesive, and the writer and/or director seemed to empty the film cliché toolbox, utilizing a myriad of rehashed techniques (flashbacks, starting the movie in the middle of the story, 1st person narration, the surprise con twist), but didn't really stick with any of them and therefore none of them really worked. But the dialog was the worst part of the movie. Many of the characters changed direction without notice or circumstance, and not because they were switching things up as part of the con. Other times they would say things as if they were in 2 conversations at once. It almost felt like there were 3 or 4 versions of the script and someone shuffled them all together (maybe it was just bad editing). And for all the press ""Wolf of Wall Street"" has gotten for the number of F-bombs, this film had no shortage. Jeremy Renner has gotten no press for his involvement, and it's deserved. He plays an Italian American mayor in New Jersey but he just looks and sounds like Jeremy Renner wearing a pompadour wig. One of the best performances is from stand-up comic Louis CK who is barely acting, but has some of the best lines. Though he never does get to tell the end of the ice fishing story."

","I went to see American Hustle and expected a lot. With that cast, who wouldn't? Especially with Bale, as I cannot recall one single bad movie he ever did. Well... now I do! This movie is terrible. The script is meaningless: These guys ain't con artists. They are small time crooks. The story is based on a con by those con-artists, but you just cannot buy it. No cons are shown, nothing to impress us. <br/><br/>And the acting... they are all just yelling. Just like a really bad Almodovar movie. After seen 50minutes of the movie, with all the yelling, stupid acting by great actors, actors that also played in the equally terrible 'Silver Linings Playbook' (Jennifer Lawrence, Bradley Cooper, Robert DeNiro) I connected the dots. It was Mr. David O. Russell that did the directing!! I did not know that before going to see the movie. After 'Silver Linings' I must have erased this director from my personal universe, a mistake I will never make again. <br/><br/>This movie is a great example of huge marketing and a bad bad movie, that will even go to the Oscars, just cause people are so idiotic to think they actually liked it, cause it was promoted so much. Silver Linings Playbook did not belong to the Oscars... did not belong to the theaters either. Neither does this movie. <br/><br/>Avoid at all costs!!! Don't watch it even for free, cause your 2 lost hours cannot be paid off. Don't buy every shitty movie they are trying to sell you."
"aciessi","9","24","45","28 December 2013"," This movie is no con.
","American Hustle tilts its head high and proud to lead the pack of ambitious, brilliant movies of 2013 to their fate on Oscar night. But why does American Hustle feel so highly of itself? and why does it seem even more likely that David O. Russel has created his cinematic magnum opus? The answer is, he just did. <br/><br/>American Hustle is without a shadow of a doubt the best picture that David O. Russel could ever make, and that says a whole lot due to the caliber of excellence already under his belt. Its a sprawling epic of a crime movie that hearkens back to some of the greatest cinematic techniques utilized by Scorsese and Altman. Its a brilliant screenplay of sorts that only increases with cultural flair and dramatic tension with every frame. Its easy to really pin down the plot of the film since this certainly isn't the first time a movie has been made about successful and or unsuccessful con men in the midst of their ""crime of the century"". But what makes this movie shine the most is its performances, which are without a doubt the greatest of the year, or any year. <br/><br/>Christian Bale is absolutely flawless. I want to say its his greatest, but movies like The Fighter and American Psycho challenge that theory.. and perhaps this role simply didn't trump those roles. But I think we can agree, it stands proudly among the two aforementioned roles. Amy Adams is captivating as a ferociously sexy redhead with an insatiable appetite for conning the people she holds closest to her. Jennifer Lawrence soars as the dimwitted wife of Christian Bale who just about ruins every possible chance of keeping this highly secretive con successful. But it was Bradley Cooper who shines the brightest in this masterpiece. This is the greatest role of his career. You could guarantee that this will bring him home an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. He's simply unbelievable as an unnervingly demented crooked cop on the verge of a mental breakdown. <br/><br/>American Hustle is an American treasure. That being said, I think it absolutely has a lock on many Oscars on Oscar night. However, so does Four Years a Slave. Regardless, do not miss your chance of seeing this film in the theater."

","Having read all the good reviews by critics, I cannot disagree more.. The movie is boring, and I literally fell asleep after 30 minutes of the movie. My friend tried to wake me up, and yes, I did try to make myself awake, but I just couldn't. The progression of the movie is really slow I fell asleep again. The first 15 minutes was fun, another 15 was boring - fell asleep - 20 minutes before the ending was great. Wasted £7.50 for cinema ticket.<br/><br/>The idea of the story is not bad (but anyway, it is not a super authentic story, its another ""based on true story"" movie). But I think people expected something more from this movie merely because of the casts and nothing more. Especially the youngsters, they go gaga for Jennifer Lawrence nowadays. <br/><br/>Lastly, the cast, however, did a good performance, especially Christian bale. But i do not think its the best performances of the year. There are many other actors and actresses who did a lot better job. So overall, it is pretty disappointing. The advertisements and trailer really did make the movie looked awesome."

While both a dramatic tour de force and a comedic parody, this film has all the grip of Godfather I or II which ever you favor. This stellar cast delivers A Sorkin-like plot with the comedic aplomb of an Apatow spoof, and left me wanting more.

From what I watched, this entire movie is just a sequence of narrated scenes. Also, way to overuse typical 70s music.

","I loved the trailer when it came out and immediately put it on my watch list. I really wanted to like this movie but instead wanted to leave half-way through it and struggled to stay awake through it. I heard the couple behind me talking about leaving and sneaking into another movie. And that was less than a 1/2 hour into the movie. I should know better than to believe any Oscar hype.<br/><br/>The movie drags on and on and on.... hence, my suggestion for it's title. The plot isn't that hard to follow, in fact, it's somewhat predictable. You know the players are going to get played. Maybe the movie would have been better without the narration. Just let the story play out on it's own.<br/><br/>The acting, taking individually, is good. But there is zero chemistry among the cast. The ""best"" on screen chemistry exists between Renner and Bale. I usually like anything Amy Adams is in, but this part did her no favors. In fact, her part doesn't make sense at all. She is shown in one of way too many flashbacks as a stripper. And we learn that she wants to be anybody other than who she is. Yet for the entire movie she's dressed as a stripper/whore. And did we really need to see her on the toilet??? She could have been a smart, sexy, player without the stripper costumes.<br/><br/>And please, every time you need a mobster, quit dragging out DeNiro. (See ""Family"") It's a discredit to his legacy. Granted, he had a small part, but I wasn't sure if I was supposed to laugh at him or take him seriously.<br/><br/>Oh, and speaking of laughing... I never laughed once, nor did I hear anyone in the theater laugh. I've noticed that when people seem to like a movie, they linger in the theatre to the very end. Through all of the credits. Not this time. Everybody immediately got up and left."

So much fill you won't believe it: people listening to music, people lip syncing, people dancing, people making out, lots and lots of boring make out scenes, people picking out and trying on clothes, personal grooming, pretty much anything to kill time without advancing the plot. The movie just drags to the point where you're screaming at the screen. It honestly is like anyone could just randomly come up with an idea for a scene and they went with it because they needed to fill time. The actors' behavior seems random and unmotivated at times. The characters are all pretty unlikable. And it honestly would not be possible to find an actress anywhere who would be more miscast in her role than Amy Adams.

I think Mr. Russell needs a lesson in humility, so does Mr. Bale and Ms. Lawrence. What is this movie? a con movie, a movie about struggle to survive, a movie about revenge, It's hard to decide.

So, I saw this 7.8 rating on IMDb and thought this one is just going to hit the spot for the week-end, especially after Wolf of Wall Street, I thought there is another surprise in store for me. For a movie that is supposed to be all about con-men and con women, the only thing they managed to con was the money you spent to watch this drivel.<br/><br/>It seems the directors themselves were not very convinced of the script that's why the lame precautionary note in the beginning reels, ""Some of the events depicted in this film are true"". They spent too much time trying to build a background for those characters and those irritating voice-overs didn't help matters. I was deceived into watching this crappola as the trailers were misleadingly interesting: turns out they used up all the funniest portions in the trailer itself. The rest of the movie was as boring as watching a cat take a poop next to your neighbour's window. <br/><br/>Know what, the only character that was remotely natural and convincing turns out to be Jennifer Lawrence in her role as a housewife suffering from attention disorders. She outdid the other veteran actors like Christian Bale and Bradley Cooper and was not an eyesore exactly. The other girl, some Italian actress I suppose, all she does on screen is trying to pretend to be a ""con-woman"" and flash her two little assets whether or not the occasion calls for it. And that Arab Sheikh played by a supposedly Mexican guy, I didn't understand the twisted logic but they should have just picked a mannequin and covered it with those thawbs that Arabs wear, it was as unconvincing to the audience as to the supposed con victims. <br/><br/>In all fairness, for Jennifer Lawrence alone, this movie deserves maybe a 3 or 4 stars but I'm giving it a 1 to somehow balance out all those outrageously false ratings.<br/><br/>Don't waste your money and time, you'll thank me for it."

","This may be a case where heightened expectations play a factor, but I found American Hustle disappointing. The narrative feels kind of obtuse/unfocused/sloppy...pick a word. It just seems disoriented, and not in a deliberate, effective way. So a lot of flash and interesting shots, but not a very sharp-feeling overall effect.<br/><br/>The Good - Christian Bale. Amy Adams. Christian Bale. Nice 70s aesthetic in the look, feel and sound of the film. Christian Bale. This is the first time that I have truly enjoyed Jeremy Renner in a film (I still do not buy into the ""star hype"" with him, but this is a good, affecting performance). The humor, while spotty, comes through very well here and there. Did I mention that Christian Bale is superb in this? Man.<br/><br/>The Not So Good - The combination of directing, writing, scoring and editing muddies the narrative unnecessarily. This film could have been better if those aforementioned things had been conducted more sharply and cohesively in concert with each other. But hey, maybe the way it is is absolutely intentional on David Russell's part. If so, then it is just not to my tastes. I found Bradley Cooper's character to be unremarkable and lacking in genuine punch, and Jennifer Lawrence's performance to be awkward and unconvincing for the most part.<br/><br/>The Takeaway - This film is okay. But the trailer had me expecting something dazzling, something great. Make no mistake, there is some serious spark from Bale and Adams, and a heavy dose of 70s aesthetic. But more than anything else, this is a lesson in how you cannot always trust the hype machine to deliver on its buildup (or other reviewers, for that matter)."

"C22Man","3","4","5","4 May 2016"," Glitz and Glamour
","American Hustle saw acclaimed director David O. Russell gather a group of actors he'd previously worked with and attempt a looser take on a con/sting movie. Very loosely based on the real life Abscam operation, the film tries to have fun with the characters it crafts and place them with in an elaborate setting with the hope that sparks will fly. Russell's films regularly drift between being mildly serious and darkly comedic with American Hustle being no different. Even though the film does benefit from its visual prowess and attention to detail, it frequently leans into an area where it is too offbeat and sprawling for its own good where characters become less defined as the film struggles to build on its narrative. <br/><br/>Straight out the blocks the film has major issues with its plotting. Apparently there was a great deal of improvisation and the storyline was tailored to fit that as things progressed, and you can tell. The whole film revolves around a sting involving two con artists, the FBI and a local mayor which is pretty thin for this genre of film. Yet there is a lot of stuff about Arabic investment where a fake Arab Sheikh is used and how corrupt casino owners from out of town are trying to get involved. It all gets muddled and confusing very quickly, with the film doing little to explain what is actually happening. The characters motivations seem misguided as more is added to concoction and by the climax it's hard to tell what anyone actually wants, which I assume is linked to the improvisation.<br/><br/>On to the acting itself and it's a mixed bag. Christian Bale is clearly channelling De Niro and for the most part he does a good job, making what is a sleazy and uncertain character engaging. His physical transformation deserves credit too. Jeremy Renner was very impressive, creating a mayor that was warm and charismatic despite his dark underside. Jennifer Lawrence simply provides an okay performance as Bale's mouthy wife, though she certainly looked way too young for the role. Two big blotches are Adams and Cooper. Adams is just an extraordinarily bland actress and its more of the same here, her blank expression never changes throughout and she has no chemistry with either male lead. Cooper can't do serious acting. Any time he has to show emotion he ends up yelling and there are many moments where he goes unnecessarily over-the-top that drags you out of the film.<br/><br/>From a visual and production standpoint it's hard to fault the film. Its style and glamour are definitely one of its strong points, with colours leaping off the screen and many of the sets looking especially beautiful. It certainly captured the essence of the late 70's time period, but managed to add a spark to it all. Russell's directing is hard to fault too and he knows how to create a stimulating shot simply by the positioning of the camera. The costumes and make-up are terrific, particularly on Bale, by providing a nice legitimacy to the story playing out. The use of music of the time can often hurt a film, but the soundtrack was smartly picked and many of the tracks used complimented what was taking place on screen. <br/><br/>On the writing side I certainly think the film suffered. The lack of cohesion does the film no favours and at times I think the film gets so dialogue-heavy that things get cluttered. There was also a distinct lack of laughs despite the film being partially labelled as a comedy. There was plenty of potential for some really funny moments or dark comedy to creep yet it's like the film was holding back on the laughs in an attempt to retain the already faulty legitimacy. The dreaded issue of boredom also rears its head at times, which is disappointing given how stylised the film is trying to look. There's a lot taking place on screen and often the dialogue will keep on coming without a pause for thought, but certain scenes don't go anywhere in particular and listening to these characters ramble on can get difficult. <br/><br/>So while I do admire American Hustle from a production stance and for its elegance, I think it failed to deliver on its potential. It is undoubtedly a messy film which isn't a surprise given the lack of cohesion in the plot and the claimed improvisations. Worse than being messy, I think the film gets dangerously close to being boring a number of times which is never a good sign. Despite good performances by Bale and Renner, both Adams and Cooper are black holes of charisma which makes it hard to get involved in the characters' struggles. Despite Russell's intentions, the film needed to be clearer about being a more serious or more comedic and much more structure in its storyline. Instead, what we end up with is a film that looks great and can entertain, but struggles all too frequently."

I am not sure why Amy Adams perpetually wore a plunging neckline. Interestingly, each one of the people I saw it with commented that it was distracting in that during the movie, instead of engaging with the content of the scene, we found ourselves wondering why she never wore anything else. It was just odd.<br/><br/>As for the story itself, it had a lot of potential. However, I found that the storyline got diluted by unnecessarily long (and at times, irrelevant) scenes and excessive dialogue. I was thankful when the movie ended and left dissatisfied, although the ending was (in my opinion) quite good. It was just a hard slog to get there and I really don't think it was worth it. I felt it was a lot of effort to sit through the movie and for little reward at the end.<br/><br/>As I said, I went in there expecting a great movie and actively trying to enjoy it because I knew I should.

It's a nice try, but it doesn't live up to the challenge. <br/><br/>Sure, there are a couple of memorable lines, but the timing is off. Sure, there is some great period music, but it is at times awkward and plays because ""we need a song here"" and not because it fits. Sure, the costumes are great. They are also great costumes in San Francisco's Castro on Halloween. Sure, the characters are whack, but we don't care about them. <br/><br/>You don't have to care about the characters in a movie, but if you don't care about them, they have to be interesting. The characters in American Hustle are neither empathetic nor fascinating. They are retread characters from an old seventies television cop show like Baretta or Kojak. While that's not bad, it's not enough for a major Hollywood film to sustain it. <br/><br/>The movie starts at a climatic scene at the end of the second act and cut back to the beginning of the story, not unlike Good Fellas. However, unlike Good Fellas, there's no payoff, so to speak, at the end. The beginning is confusing and it lacks back story and development. The film is at once overly complex and predictably simple.<br/><br/>Sure, this movie will get its share of nominations for acting and Danny Elfman's sound track (a bright spot), but it's just not that soulful, ground breaking or hard hitting. Nor is it that entertaining. <br/><br/>Rating: Rent it. <br/><br/>It's not terrible, and the costumes are fun. However, unless you need to see wide lapels, bad comb-overs, caked on eye-shadow and long lashes larger then life, see it at home on the cheap.

"Hellmant","10","14","25","27 December 2013"," It's really impressive how O. Russell has became such an 'actor's director'!
","'AMERICAN HUSTLE': Five Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>Writer/director David O. Russell's new comedy/crime drama film (set in the 1970s) about a con man, and his partner, who are forced to work with a crazy FBI agent as part of a sting operation. It stars Christian Bale, Bradley Cooper, Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner and Jennifer Lawrence. Lawrence and Cooper recently starred in O. Russell's 2012 hit 'SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK' (which is my all time favorite movie) and Bale and Adams co-starred in his film before that 'THE FIGHTER'. Bale and Lawrence won Oscars for their parts (Cooper and Adams were nominated). Lawrence, Cooper and Bale are likely to be up for Academy Awards again this year (Lawrence is a frontrunner and a win would be back-to-back Oscars for her). The film is also a major Academy Awards contender itself (as is David O. Russell) and has received almost universally positive reviews. I love the film and think it deserves every bit of the hype and praise it's been getting!<br/><br/>Christian Bale put on 40 lbs to play the role of Irving Rosenfeld (based on real life conman Melvin Weinberg). Rosenfeld was an intelligent and successful con-artist in 1978 when he met Sydney Prosser (Adams), a stripper who was also very good at the art of 'hustling people'. The two teamed up and became lovers, despite the fact that Rosenfeld was married and had an adopted son named Danny (played by Danny and Sonny Corbo). Danny was the son of Irving's dimwitted wife Rosalyn (Lawrence). All went well for Irving and Sydney until they were caught in the act by an undercover FBI agent named Richard DiMaso (Cooper). DiMaso forced them to help him bust four bigger con-artists and Mayor Carmine Polito (Renner, who's character is based on Angelo Errichetti) got caught in their hustle as well. Adams' character Sydney Prosser is also based on Evelyn Knight, DiMaso is based on Anthony Amoroso, Jr. and Rosalyn is based on Cynthia Marie Weinberg.<br/><br/>Lawrence (my favorite actress) is a scene stealer in the movie (once again) and she lights up the screen every time she comes on it, especially the first time she appears, when she really takes the film up a notch! What's surprising is that the film continues to stay at the same energetic level even when Lawrence is off screen (which is a large part of the movie, given her part is a smaller supporting role). For the first 20 minutes or so I wasn't sure if I was going to enjoy the film that much but it really picked up in pace (and entertainment value) and I think that's largely due to O. Russell's flawless direction. While the movie is not quite as classic as 'SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK' it is O. Russell's most impressive directing job to date (in a visual and stylistic way at least). The performances are all excellent as well, especially Lawrence and Cooper (who are once again the two craziest characters in the movie). Bale and Adams make great straight men (and women) though; Adams looks more beautiful and acts better than she ever has before and Bale really went all out gaining the weight he did to play this unattractive balding criminal. It's really impressive how O. Russell has became such an 'actor's director' (especially given the history he has with actors he's worked with in the past, like George Clooney and Lily Tomlin). His script is brilliant as well (based on a screenplay by Eric Warren Singer, which is in turn based on historical events involving the FBI ABSCAM operation of the 70s and early 80s). It's yet another amazing masterpiece from David O. Russell and one of the best films of the year!<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDElhat3XPM"
"f-ullathorne","2","13","23","23 January 2014"," Is this a comedy or what?
","Watched this film in a packed cinema in UK about 10 days ago and can honestly say that this film did not raise one bit of laughter. You could even say it was unfunny. How this film could win an award for best film comedy beggars belief. Not only was it unfunny but it was boring to an extreme. The person next to me fell asleep after 10 minutes and my wife and I both struggled to stay awake. The answer may be in the difference between the UK and US sense of comedy but to see this film nominated for a BAFTA seems to suggest that the UK academy is just following the US academies like sheep and are not making their own minds up about the film. To sum up this was probably the worst film that I have seen in the last 12 months and is definitely not worth any awards when there are films like Gravity etc around"

","Okay, so I watched the first 15 minutes of American Hustle optimistically thinking it was going to take off, it did not. I gave it another 20 minutes of my time and still nothing. It would not have made a difference if they threw in Brad Pitt, or Tom Cruise in the nude. Dull and flat-lined right from the opening scene, and why Christian Bale had to gain upwards of 30lbs for his role is a joke, he could have been fitted with a prosthetic belly under his shirt. What a waste of great actors in this movie. I am guessing I made my point and that is don't be hustled into watching this deadbeat of a movie.

","There is a minor joke in the first 30 seconds (which goes on for another couple of minutes), then this film proceeds to bore the pants off you with some of the worst acting, direction and scriptwriting you will ever have the misfortune to experience. How the critics have fallen for this I do not know! Or perhaps, I do. Russell (Director) is seen as a mini great, so when he produces absolute rubbish of a script and film, then the critics have to back him or they will seem stupid for over-praising him in the first place. The film is very like 'Goodfellas' ( another pile of sh***) and there the critics had to praise Marty because he is a living God of US film directing. But, no, reputations are only as good as a last film, and this resides in the nether regions of totally awful. Plot - two smart conners - Bale and Adams - are caught by the FBI and turned to con corrupt politicians. Well, there is only evidence of their being mediocrities as conmen - their greatest feat being to con $5000 out of desperate people looking to borrow $50,000! Mad man Cooper plays an FBI agent on speed and falls for Adams as they try to frame Renner et al (New Jersey politicians). It all gets a bit heavy as the MOB appears ( you guessed it - Robert de Niro) and Bale has to con his way out (having spent the middle part of the film invisible!). The acting - Bale doing a bad impression of Quasimodo with back throat heehawing, bent frame, forever pushing up dark glasses, and a bad comb over (convincing no-one he is clever); Adams showing cleavage (not big) to show how men fall for her gets someway with her character, but not far; Cooper overacts and should never be allowed on set again until he has done three silent mime shows in the theatre; Renner an innocent who has too little to do; and Lawrence (seen for the first time by this reviewer) pouts and whines semi-angrily to get yet another Oscar nomination (what a totally limited actress she appears, but with this non-script I'll give her some slack). The script does not bear a nanoseond's consideration - was there a lot of improvisation?- because it simply is a mess - no proper characterisation, lines repeated, terrible voice overs for the thickest of the thick in Iowa presumably, and a plot that hardly holds any interest. Poor, poor, awful rubbish. It is a film that is about conning, and the critics and the Academy and BAFTA have all fallen for the con!!!!!!!"

","I don't know what it is with the Oscar nominated movies this year.

It is so boring it made me want to walk out of the theater 45 minutes in. I was surprised to see this train wreck of a film rated so high by critics. This movie doesn't deserve any awards at all.<br/><br/>As far as acting is concerned Bradley Cooper stood out for me. Rest of the ensemble cast are alright and nothing more. It baffles me as to how Jennifer Lawrence got a golden globe win for a 20 minute role which is the easiest to play of all the others. Although her character is good she doesn't deserve any awards at all.<br/><br/>Overall , I urge users not to get 'Hustled' by the critics reviews and Oscar nominations and just let this movie slide.

"Turfseer","4","16","30","17 January 2014"," Critics end up getting hustled by this cinematic ""Goodfellas"" wannabe
","David O. Russell, now a shining light in the American film industry, has returned after his recent success with ""Silver Linings Playbook."" His new entry for the Oscar competition is ""American Hustle,"" which is loosely based on the ABSCAM scandals of the late 70s and early 80s.<br/><br/>Russell's new picture aspires to be an updated ""Goodfellas;"" except here, the protagonists are not Mafiosi but low-rent con artists. The story begins slowly as a narrator fills in the background of the story's anti-hero, Irving Rosenfeld--part legitimate owner of a couple of dry cleaning establishments out on Long Island and part unsavory loan shark and middleman for art forgers. Christian Bale as Rosenfeld does the most convincing job of the principal actors in conveying just how this petty criminal fell from grace (notably Bale gained fifty pounds for the role).<br/><br/>Less successful is Amy Adams, who plays Sydney Prosser, Rosenfeld's con artist girlfriend who pretends to be a British aristocrat ('Lady Edith Greensley'). There's just something about Adams that prevents me (no matter how hard she tries) from believing that she can play the role of a true ""bad girl"" (others, of course, are free to disagree).<br/><br/>The break into Act Two occurs when the FBI catches Irving and Sydney perpetuating one of their loan scams and forces them to help flush out four new marks. Sydney wants to flee the country, but Irving refuses, since he's still married and has a young son. As it turns out, the film's antagonist really is Richie, played by an over-the-top Bradley Cooper--a belligerent FBI agent, who continually pressures Irving to cooperate and browbeats his own boss to accept some of his far-fetched plans.<br/><br/>Russell has been quoted as saying that he concentrated more on the characters' stories, rather than the overall plot. Nonetheless, a good deal of the dialogue is improvised and I found many of the interpersonal scenes to be unnecessarily drawn out (Jennifer Lawrence has little to do as Rosalyn, Irving's over emotional wife, who eventually comes to accept that Irving is no longer attracted to her).<br/><br/>Many of the principals' machinations are supposed to be comic in nature—-particularly those of Richie, who at one point slugs his boss in the face with a telephone. Ritchie reminds me of Cooper's character in ""Silver Linings."" who also can't control his temper.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, it's really the ""Hustle"" story itself that leaves quite a bit to be desired. It's a story virtually devoid of any high stakes. The whole idea of course is that this is a story of low stakes-—and we're supposed to feel bemused by the characters' pettiness. But much of the pettiness simply isn't very compelling at all.<br/><br/>We have such low moments in Act II, as Sydney convinces the FBI secretary to make the $2 million unauthorized wire transfer and then Richie's boss' boss, Amado, inexplicably green lights Richie's escapades. The bulk of the machinations involve Richie's quest to entrap Polito, the corrupt Camden, New Jersey mayor. The closest we get to high drama is when Polito brings Irving's fake sheik to a casino party, where they end up meeting a real mobster, Victor Tellegio, a former Meyer Lansky associate played by Robert DeNiro. Tellegio tries to outfox the ""sheik"" by speaking Arabic, but Irving's friend turns the tables by showing that he knows Arabic too.<br/><br/>The rest of ""American Hustle"" is anti-climactic. With the Camden mayor's assistance, a number of Congressmen are taken down, after they accept bribes. The big ""twist"" at the end is too little and too late. It's not necessary to reveal the ending, but suffice it to say that the FBI's plan to fry some bigger fish, goes awry.<br/><br/>I'm not sure whether it was that I didn't really care too much about the principals and their back stories, or whether the twists and turns in the plot amounted to nothing more than ""small potatoes."" I do know that the film's Hollywood happy ending has nothing to do with what happened in real life (the wife committed suicide and the mistress divorced Mel Weinberg, Irving's real-life prototype, and no longer talks to him).<br/><br/>If there's anything good to say about this film, it has more to do with the re-creation of the late 70s era, replete with all those golden oldies on the soundtrack. It's too bad that most of the characters here never rise above the level of caricature.<br/><br/>The subjects of the real hustle appear to have been all those critics, who lapped up this overrated cinematic sleight of hand, in their desperate desire to discover a new Scorsese-like auteur."

Everything is focused on Amy Adams and thats why Christian Bale gained that much weight for this movie. If u wanna watch a woman's body you can go to a strip club we are not paying money or we don't spend our time for that. If this movie takes more than 7 at least there has to be something that can keep you watching but there was nothing can make u curious about the film. There was no remarkable acting in any scene of movie just dialogs and Amy Adams' little boobs. Showing nude bodies doesn't make a movie qualified. This is stealing money and time from people thats all. That's also waste of good actors like Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence, Lawrence wasn't bad but i didn't feel like they could engage their roles because there was no character development. I couldn't even watch it more than 40 minutes i am really disappointed and angry because this cast is just to fool people you think that you are gonna watch a good movie but all u will see is totally BULLSHIT. The movie goes nowhere you wait for something to happen to make u excited about the script but no nothing happens.

"Mobithailand","3","5","7","8 April 2016"," The American Oscar-Hustle, the biggest hustle of all
","The American Oscar-Hustle, the biggest hustle of all<br/><br/>I was looking forward to seeing American Hustle, as it had received very good reviews and was nominated for a number of prestigious awards, including many Oscars. It sounded like a star-studded caper that would provide an enjoyable 2 hours viewing. With stars like Christian Bale and Amy Adams, together with the pair that I loved in 'Silver Linings Playbook' – Jenifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper – and to top it all, being directed by 'The Silver Linings' Director of the moment, David. O Russell – how could it fail?<br/><br/>Well, the answer to this question, according to box office receipts and a vast majority of professional critics is that it didn't fail – in fact you could call it an unqualified success. After all, most reviewers gave it at least a 4 out of five stars, using such gushing language as:<br/><br/>""The bizarre and hilarious situation rattles along, never entirely diverted or derailed, with plenty of comic set pieces.""<br/><br/>And<br/><br/>""It's all rangy and loose, with scenes that look as if they could be re-cut and re-edited every which way. It could easily be two or three times as long, and there is enormous pleasure in Russell's sustained riffing.""<br/><br/>And finally<br/><br/>And at the end, we feel dizzy and disorientated, like marks who don't know we've been had. It is pure style from David O Russell..<br/><br/>It all left me wondering if I was watching the same movie. Maybe I was simply in a very bad mood, but whatever it was, I remained unamused, totally confused, but most of all, thoroughly bored. The characters did absolutely nothing for me and I completely lost interest in what they were trying to do – all that I did feel was a total lack of empathy for these silly con-people. I confess that I became so bored that not only did I find difficulty in following the gibberish plot lines, but in moments of sheer tedium, I actually fast forwarded through some of the over-long, verbose dialogue. I cannot recall another occasion when watching a movie when I have resorted to doing this. It was almost 'wall-to- wall' talk, talk and more talk, which I found to be neither fascinating, nor amusing. It was just a load of 'west-coast-speak' diatribe. <br/><br/>I couldn't even begin to tell you what the plot was about as it is a while since I saw the movie and it was so forgettable, that nothing – not even the parts that I was able to follow – has stuck in my memory. If the movies should be judged by the sum of its parts, then by rights, American Hustle should be right up there, as there is much good acting, clever cinematography and stylish direction, but to what ends? Even if I am the only person who didn't get the jokes and was bored by the stupid capers and unlikely twists in the plot, did this film about a group of American con artists who lead glib, clever lives deserve to be crowned as the finest film made in the English language in 2013?<br/><br/>I think not.<br/><br/>Again, as with Birdman, the professional reviewers seem to be totally out of touch with the cinema going public. Sure, their rave reviews have meant that millions have flocked to see it, but what did they think of it? In many years of reading about movies on the Internet Movie Data Base, (IMDb), I have never seen such a litany of negative public reviews. Usually, the punters will rave about movies on IMDb, even when the critics have panned them, but this time it is the other way around. I am talking of review-headlines such as:-<br/><br/>'Just not understanding the hype',<br/><br/>'Looks Like I'm the Only One Who Didn't Like It',<br/><br/>'Don't be ""Hustled"" by the reviews'.<br/><br/>'American Hustle"" is okay and nothing more',<br/><br/>'Disappointed beyond belief!',<br/><br/>'No plot, no acting, no drama, no fun',<br/><br/>'Bells and Whistles but Nothing to Care About',<br/><br/>'Disappointing',<br/><br/>'Self-indulgent mediocrity',<br/><br/>'Do not get ensnared in the hype surrounding this hustle...'<br/><br/>Believe it or not, these are the first 10 headlines that I copied – in order – from the IMDb 'user-review' section. Looks like it's not only me after all<br/><br/>But in spite of all this, as at 4th April 2014, it had grossed a whopping 150 million dollars in the USA alone, thanks, no doubt, to the rave reviews from the critics and the early garnering of 44 awards plus, of course, no less than 10 Oscar nominations.<br/><br/>The Oscar-Hustle, the biggest hustle of all<br/><br/>Read more about this reviewer at mobithailand.com"

"Paradox-Warrior","1","5","7","2 April 2014"," Hollywood really needs to stop telling us these movies are gold
","Along with Wolf of Wall Street, this movie got such a great deal of hype, not to mention Oscar awards, that I figured I'd give it a shot. Just like with Wolf of Wall Street, I was quite disappointed by it. The story itself seemed to just jump around all over the place, flashing from scene to scene before the first one was finished. The characters as well seemed very uneven as well, making emotional leaps and nosedives all over the place without any real clear reason why.<br/><br/>You have our two ""leads"", Christina Bale (who I can't take seriously anymore after Batman) and Amy Adams, that are very close one second, then hate each other the next, then are back in close again without any real explanations as to why. They are supposed to be very smart con artists, and yet they don't utilize any of their skills to get out of the jam, or even try to, until the absolute last five minutes of the movie. Not to mention their ""chemistry"" seemed more like distilled water as opposed to any kind of fiery heat. I honestly couldn't care less if they ended up with each other or not by the end of the movie. And as far as the ""friendship"" between Bale's character and Renner's character, I only have Bale's voice over to tell me about this, because other than when Renner's character discovers what Bale's really been doing do we see any real emotion regarding the relationship between these two. Oh yes, and we have the film opening things with a shot of Amy Adams' character being a stripper, something that is never even mentioned again. So my question is, why even bother telling the audience about it? It brought absolutely no weight to the movie and quite honestly I forgot about that tidbit about the character five minutes later. The same could be said about Bale's character. The movie opens with him talking about how he shattered windows so his father would get business for his glass company so he wouldn't get ""taken"" anymore. Exactly how was his father taken? It's never even explained. Was it done legally or illegally? And, of course, there's his dry cleaning business, which is essentially pointless to this movie other than being a set piece in the beginning for Amy Adams to have a fashion show. Even Bale's art scam was pointless, as it had nothing to do with the rest of the movie. Hell, the scam he and Adams come up with made absolutely no sense. It was never really explained. What exactly were their marks giving them $5,000 for to begin with. Was it an investment, was it supposed to be money laundering? We're never told.<br/><br/>You have the FBI agent (Bradley Cooper) who is so obsessed with going higher and higher up the criminal food chain that the entire character becomes a cartoon. When he beats the living hell out of his boss because he wouldn't give him an incredibly expensive hotel room for a sting operation, and is then given accolades by his boss's boss instead of being thrown out of the Bureau and charged with battery, at that point the whole movie had jumped the shark. And that's not even talking about his inexplicable use of cocaine in one scene that is never even hinted at again, regardless of his manic behavior throughout the movie.<br/><br/>Jeremy Renner did do a fine job in the role he was cast. The character seemed rather sincere and wasn't a typical dirty politician, which was just fine for this movie. I can't say I have any complaints about the character other than it and the actor were wasted on this film.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence was fine, I suppose, though instead of being conniving and sneaky in her own loud way, she seemed like she was either a sociopath or someone with bi-polar disorder. Seriously, I doubt you'd have much trouble convincing a judge, even one from the late 70's, that she was in no condition to take full-time custody of her child.<br/><br/>Then there were the accents. I was actually OK with Adams' British accent. It wasn't great but it wasn't too terrible either. The problem I had is she was supposed to be from New Mexico and yet she would inexplicably shift into a New Jersey or New York accent when not using her British one. This is after, in the opening scenes, we hear her normal accent which sounds Midwestern. It just makes no sense. That and Alessandro Nivola, Bradley Cooper's boss's boss sounded like he was trying to do a Christopher Walken impression the entire movie.<br/><br/>About the only thing this movie had going for it was wardrobe, and by that I mean having the two leading ladies (more Adams than Lawrence) wear outfits that showed off their curves to the utter maximum without being vulgar for the entire movie.<br/><br/>Overall, I just found the movie to be pretty bad and find it very disheartening that this and Wolf of Wall Street are what is considered wonderful, powerful movies these days. It seems that the people in Hollywood really know their audiences now and know they can cram any kind of garbage down our throats, as long as their PR people tell us it's the finest cut of fillet. Do yourself a favor and skip this one, or if you have to watch it make sure you don't pay a dime to see it, it's a waste of your money."

","This movie develops itself in a captivating atmosphere of conning and swindling that involves not only the conning characters but also such types as FBI agents, mafia men, Congressmen and a mayor of New Jersey. The performers act very well in their roles convincing us of the portrayed figures. The set schemes are too complicated and sometimes their details become somewhat incomprehensible for the unguarded viewer. A FBI agent obtains the help of a couple of conners (a man and his smart and cunning girlfriend) to catch some corrupt politicians red handed but this generates a lot of complicated relations that involve the sentimental relationships between men and women with some unexpected consequences to the planned schemes. These conners and swindlers are not presented like the usual stereotypes of bad people but like normal people instead with human feelings and reactions from love to anger. The story is quite believable in terms of reality and well directed and acted in filming terms."

","Some hustle for respect. Some hustle for love. Others hustle for truth. But we all hustle to survive. American Hustle was one of the most anticipated films of the year & even though it turned to be a very well made crime drama, I really doubt if it's a great one. It had all the ingredients & potential to become the best film of 2013 but in the end, it still felt short of complete on the satisfaction level for me & was definitely missing something, probably a more tightly structured plot.<br/><br/>David O. Russell is one of those directors whose number one priority while making a film isn't the film's plot or its progression but the intricate study of its characters. The screenplay makes brilliant use of humour, the character arc is nicely developed and the film is greatly helped by its cinematography & more so by costumes & hairstyles to create that 1970s ambiance. And when it comes to casting, American Hustle boasts a cast that's far more star-studded than what any other film of its year had to offer.<br/><br/>Christian Bale looks immensely convincing here as the con man Irvin Rosenfeld with that slouch posture, combover & huge tummy but in the end, it wasn't him who was the best thing in the film. Bradley Cooper is steadily turning out to be a rising star. And Jeremy Renner plays his part well. But this time, it's the ladies who stole the show. Amy Adams gives a strong & enthralling performance here but even she is overshadowed by the new tour-de-force in cinema today, Jennifer Lawrence. The part played by Lawrence here is so spectacular that it might bag her another Oscar this upcoming season & in case it does, it's a well deserved one.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, American Hustle may not have lived up to my expectations from it, due to the script's inconsistencies & minor flaws, but thanks to David O. Russell's kinetic direction, its finely developed characters, superb use of sly humour & its star-studded cast's exuberant performances, it is nonetheless an incredibly entertaining motion picture that lives up to most of its hype, if not all, and is fine enough to satisfy majority of its viewers.

","I really do have mixed feelings about the film. There are some superb performances Jennifer Lawrence and Jeremy Renner are nothing short of superb especially Jennifer singing. Hilarious.<br/><br/>But at times it is fairly confusing and I found some parts hard to follow. And hair rollers appeared rather too frequently! I have been told that these were to show that everything is a superficial image but I am not sure that the film is that deep.<br/><br/>There is great attention to detail in so many aspects of the film that it is unfortunate that they neglected the women's fashions of the 70s. The ""women's wardrobe"" on this film need to do some SERIOUS study on 70s fashion! I don't understand how they can get the room sets looking so authentic and then have 21st century glamour sitting in a 70s set.IT was anachronistic.<br/><br/>Although the film is a fictionalised account of a real event, I feel that Jeremy Renner's character was not sufficiently sympathetic to the real person on whom it is based; the man was a hero who just ""fell of the box "" and paid for it."

The music aside - and there was a peppering of some much loved golden oldies - everything about this film is second rate; I found myself wondering if this was a spoof, or an attempt at some sort of weird comedy - but, alas, nothing funny or even remotely amusing ensued throughout. And, by the way, De Niro is becoming just sad with these typecast cameos, they simply don't work any more. Avoid this film if you value your time ( I actually aborted as soon as the long-awaited ""scam"" was revealed), and if you want to see hustle, watch again David Mamet's Heist, or Fabian Bielinsky's Nine Queens."
"punishable-by-death","5","8","13","6 January 2014"," Extremely disappointing
","I don't get excited for movie releases. I've not allowed myself to, after so many disappointments. But seeing the trailer and reading about this movie caught my attention. Instantly I was looking forward to it. It looked like a Goodfellas style movie but with con men and politicians. It sounded interesting.<br/><br/>The problem with this analogy is that Goodfellas excelled in displaying family values, the brutality of man at the peak of greed and power, an amazing score, unforgettable camera-work; the works. The only thing this movie shares with Goodfellas is Di Niro.<br/><br/>The script seemed very under-written (it was very cheesy at times, very forced at others). The actors all looked like they weren't really trying, with the exception of Jennifer Lawrence who, despite the idiotic online musings of her being miscast, was the only memorable, eccentric character. Bale hid behind his disguise. Brad Cooper was Brad Cooper. I hadn't seen the other lady before but nothing she did impressed me. In fact, with such idiotic lines, she excelled in propelling the implausibility of this movie. Since when do Americans 'ooh' and 'ahh' over English royalty?! I also thought the director was a little too relaxed. Visually, it isn't anything spectacular, and there isn't really anything that makes the camera-work or directing/editing unique at all. In fact, the camera was so still, I needed to re-watch it to see if there were just a few interesting angles or moving shots.<br/><br/>And the story. Good God, the implausibility built up to a point where people were laughing at it. This film paints a very tainted version of real things, such as the FBI not firing an agent blatantly ignoring ethics and acting on his own accord, and mobsters stupid enough to invest in someone they didn't know and had zero reasons to trust, but had reasons not to. Apart from the opening 30 minutes, it was all too much and snowballed into a giant, idiotic force that managed to pull you out of the movie with constant, overblown plot twists.<br/><br/>And when people are laughing at the lunacy of it all, I know I'm not the only one. I have never heard so much giggling. It is also certainly not a movie you can watch twice either, which definitely is not a good thing. I tried.<br/><br/>As most will have heard, Robert Di Niro makes a one scene appearance, donning an absurd pair of glasses. His sudden appearance wasn't only pointless, it again totally shattered that fourth wall, that illusion that I'm in this fictional world. Pair this up with the impossibility of almost everything that happens. Just terrible. And you just know that this shite will clean up the 'awards' no doubt. I'm afraid I'll never see why, and I really tried to see the good when I went to see it the second time. But when Jennifer Lawrence wasn't on-screen, all I could see was average acting, absent editing/directorial technique, a forced script and a story that slowly becomes more and more impossible/laughable as the long running time of the film drags on.<br/><br/>A big disappoint for me, as I was looking forward to this flick. The 70's are easily my favourite decade for film. But it was so average, on so many levels, I can't help but feel cheated. Especially when the trailer made it out to feel like something that it wasn't remotely close to.<br/><br/>Don't be fooled."

","Il went to the cinema because of good critics read in the newspaper. Disappointing. I totally agree with Tango & Cash review. It's a comedy without laughs and a drama without tears-The director looks more confused than the plot,that looks flat, not really surprising. The characters are weak, the actors are hopelessly attempting to revitalize exhibiting all what they have learned in an - I don't imagine what - actor's school. I confess that I left after one hour and came back to pick up my wife after another hour. i am sure I didn't loose anything important.

","In Spain, this film was released under the title 'La Gran Estafa Americana', which translates to 'The Great American Fraud', and that's exactly how I felt about it upon leaving the theatre. <br/><br/>10 Oscar nominations for a film that gets boring 1 hour in, is at least 30 minutes too long, and presents us with characters, dialogues and plot events that are trying way too hard to come across as complex and intriguing, but that instead end up feeling irritatingly empty, superficial, unrealistic, and plain boring. <br/><br/>And as if this weren't enough, we get over-the-top performances by pretty much the entire cast (which is admittedly great, at least on paper), and excessive hype surrounding Bale's physical transformation for the role, which is not only completely redundant in terms of plot, but is far less impressive than what he has us accustomed to (if you don't understand what I mean, watch 'The Machinist' and then see him in the film he shot literally 6 months later, 'Batman Begins'). <br/><br/>What exactly was all the hype about? And the excellent critic reviews? And the award nominations? A real disappointment of a film, especially after O. Russell's solid 'The Fighter' and excellent 'Silver Linings Playbook'."

","I really wanted to like this movie. I'd seen all the marketing, the plot interested me and the awards buzz seemed to indicate that the acting was second to none.<br/><br/>On the acting, the film didn't really disappoint. Jennifer Lawrence was fantastic, and all the recognition she has been getting is well deserved. The other leads, Bale, Adams & Cooper also performed extremely well. However, the material fell far short of the hype.<br/><br/>The story was confused an awful lot of the time, and the screenplay was just bland (covered over with colourful language to make up for its deficiencies). I heard that much of the dialogue was improvised, which may explain why the plot was so unclear. The ending didn't quite allow me to forgive the dull spot in the middle of the film.<br/><br/>All that being said, the soundtrack and production design were both great, so it was an excellent film visually. It just lacked a gravitas and a depth which I was expecting."

'the great Gatsby' derived from novel with similar elements upscale life and crime, but execution and scripts in my opinion far out-compete American hustle.<br/><br/>allover, maybe it should have receive a 5 or 6 for its acting and others performance, but i will only give it 2 for it disgusted me so much."
"TMoney46","5","6","9","13 January 2014"," Dull & Disappointing
","Great actors do not always make great movies - Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence, Christian Bale, Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner. I thought the acting in itself was actually very good but the story - extremely dull & disappointing. I am at a loss as to how/why American Hustle is being hailed as such a great movie when it lacks any colour or imagination. The premise of the story on the whole is quite good. Reading the story on which it is based makes for very interesting reading and as this is an adaption surely some more hustle (pardon the pun) could have been added. Instead it seems they play the whole thing down. So Cooper's character doesn't get the credit for bringing down politicians? Hardly the greatest ending to a story. The whole thing from beginning to end is bogged down by dialogue. At every turn it seems things just drag on and on and on - the movie goes for 2 hours 18 minutes & could have easily squeezed into an hour and a half. I read that a lot of the dialogue was improvised - perhaps some sort of script may have been in order because it really killed the movie for me. The only reason it gets 6 is because I thought the performances of Lawrence, Bale & Adams were very good. It's just a shame about the story they were given to act to. Is anyone else getting a little tired of the Bradley Cooper ""I'm a little bit crazy but not so crazy that you don't like me"" routine or is it just me? I'm not sure if the whole thing just went over my head but I watch about 100 movies a year and I can safely say this won't make the top 20."

","Top notch cast, a good movie does not make. Truer words have never been spoken than when used in reference to this film. The thing i cant quite put my finger on is why this didn't work. Bale is very good (and pot bellied). Bradley Cooper excels. Amy Adams and Jennifer Lawrence are excellent too. So the acting is actually a plus. But the plot is just too long and too slow. I don't need a movie to be non-stop action, but i do want things to happen. There is just too much time spent by the directors when nothing, or close to nothing is happening. Just some silence. Or someone glowering grimly at the camera. The scenes are infuriatingly dragged out for no apparent reason. There is no frantic climax after a long protracted scene. Nothing. And there are plenty of them. The idea behind the movie seems good, although certainly not original. But it just takes too long for the story to go from A to B and then on to C. To put in perspective, my wife fell asleep somewhere between G and H.... I really wanted to like it. I liked the cast and I had heard good things. But I didn't. I certainly would not watch it again. The ending just happens, and then it's over and you're left wondering how you can get two hours of your life back again."

The story is unbelievable slow and drags like you can't believe. I was patient and sat through the entire film, hoping that the sh*t would actually go down in the end and compensate for the lack of entertainment throughout... But nope...none at all. I love drama and am not an action guy at all, but I was at least hoping for some intense scenes or serious drama to happen by the end of the film.

","At the tail end of what has been an undeniably great year for movies, American Hustle is a fabulously entertaining mix of great performances, energetic direction, and black humor. Director David O. Russell has made what is arguably his best film yet, and considering that his previous works include The Fighter and Silver Linings Playbook, that's a remarkable feat indeed. A semi-fictionalized account of the ABSCAM scandal of the early eighties, Hustle follows an overly-ambitious FBI agent (Bradley Cooper) who enlists the help of two expert con men (Christian Bale and Amy Adams) to expose a corrupt mayor (Jeremy Renner). What follows goes from being a relatively small-scale operation to roping in the American Mafia, a handful of state representatives, and a US Senator. All of which is presented with an abundance of wit and charm, brought on by the perfect cast and sharp script. Ultimately, despite the merest hints of incoherence, American Hustle is easily one of the year's best, a film that can be enjoyed by practically anyone old enough for the subject matter."
"margulanabutrlov","10","2","2","26 March 2019"," American Hustle Review
","1978. Seasoned confidence tricksters Irving Rosenfeld (Bale) and Sydney Prosser (Adams) cut a deal with FBI agent Richie DiMaso (Cooper) to dob in other offenders in return for clemency. However, Irving's loose-cannon wife Rosalyn (Lawrence) threatens to derail the plan.
This opens with a caption that claims its story is ""mostly true"", which has in the annals of crime cinema historically covered a spectrum of veracity and mendacity ranging from In Cold Blood to Fargo, but tries to position American Hustle as more significant than the average twisty con-inside-a-con crime movie.
Like Pain & Gain, it's as much a portrait of the excesses of its era as it is criminal reportage, with an unusual emphasis on 1970s hairstyles as symptoms of the Carter years. The opening shows Christian Bale, demonstrating his Machinist super-power of altering his body at will by sporting an impressive paunch, applying the toupee, glue, spray and hair-sculpting moves necessary to create his disco comb-over. Later, the film gives equal time to the tiny and huge curlers Bradley Cooper and Amy Adams' characters require for their respective 'dos.
However, American Hustle is a showcase rather than a truly great movie. The intricate, attenuated plot threatens to address corruption in America but any point keeps getting lost in its own trickery. Unrepentant con men, crooked politicians and (even) murderous Mafia bosses are more honest and admirable here than the FBI sting operatives out to take them down. The message might be to leave institutionalised crime well enough alone - Rosenfeld seems to express the script's message when he says that ""after Vietnam and Watergate"", the country doesn't need another disillusioning political scandal. Besides, the film keeps showing us that con men are fun - they have enviable dress sense, live large in a way the movies are hardwired to admire more than plodding decency, and aren't notably more deceitful and money-grubbing than the forces of law and order, just better at pulling the rug out from under the marks and waltzing away with a smile.
On a scene-by-scene basis, it's undoubtedly a dazzling film, albeit with many lifts from the Martin Scorsese and Paul Thomas Anderson playbooks. Casino and Boogie Nights are explicitly evoked, and one flashback might literally be a GoodFellas outtake. The camera prowls through '70s luxury hotels and suburban homes, wincing at the thick carpets and the eye-abusing curtains, pausing to relish the kitschy tableware or clunky furniture. It makes persuasive use of a double album's worth of 1970s chart hits, with major dramatic moments sold by selections from Elton John's back catalogue.
Meanwhile, Lawrence cements her current can-do-no-wrong status in an extraordinary scene, just after her character has set a fiendish revenge scheme in motion, as she sings along to Live And Let Die while aggressively cleaning her house in yellow kitchen gloves and gloating over the deadly pickle she's just landed her faithless husband in. Cooper is stuck with the least rewarding role, but keeps finding brilliant little bits of business to hold the attention: watch him do spot impersonations of his overly cautious (but smart) boss during a premature victory celebration. Bale, in velvet jacket, and Adams, in dresses so low-cut that double-sided Sellotape must be involved to preserve decency, play conners who are always on - Adams' Sydney poses as British aristocracy with a Diana Rigg accent for most of the film - but gradually show their real personalities and become appalled by what they've got into, though the film becomes less convincing when its brittly amoral double-dealers start showing a rudimentary conscience."

I forgot I was watching a movie several times, the humor was not laugh out loud guffaw type humor, this humor was instead very human, but also very melancholy and often bittersweet, very much like life...

Christian Bale did a Robert Deniro ripoff. The actors should have been reigned in by the director, but were given too much freedom. I'm surprised that the film has made so much money, but that doesn't mean it's a good film. It's a film that COULD have been great, but it failed in almost every way. <br/><br/>David O. Russell was trying to be Martin Scorsese: (1) Christian Bale was doing a Deniro imitation (2) Same narration style as many of Scorsese's films (3) Mob/Casino theme (4) Out of control wife and mistress (5) Similar music supervision style (such a Scorsese ripoff, it's embarrassing)<br/><br/>The cinematography was unfocused! Sometime the camera would pan slightly for no reason. Most of the actors' East Coast accents were borderline cartoonish. I suspect (and hope) that a lot of the dialog was improvised because it was distracting, slowed down the film and didn't help propel the storyline. Where were the producers? They should have demanded rewrites and a better edit. I can't believe this film was released this way. If this foreshadows the future quality of films, I'm going to stop watching films. In the hands of a different director, this could have been good.<br/><br/>This is a contender for the Oscars? It's all vapid hype! This film deserves no awards.<br/><br/>Deniro and Lous C.K's performances were very good, but not good enough to make me think the film was worth watching.

A Scorsese fresco (Taxi Driver, Ragging Bull, Godfellas and Casino) is not an achievement for your average director who thinks he's smart because he's hot on the market. American Hustle tries to dilute its over-long script with a mild teasing+flashback right from the start. But when the flashback gets started you begin to think - rings a bell, a good director, with a fine editor, keeps the audience from thinking: ""OMG! they are going all the way back to how everybody met (including some remembrance of Irving's youth...)!"" Then the story drags and drags along every detail of a pretty simple plot, boring us stiff with the zoo of its characters. Sure this was a great cast but only the focus on Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams) is consistently deep to keep you rooting for her. Most of the rest is about flashy caricatures. Christian Bale cannot play emotions, as usual (the actor's studio caricature) but it's in line with his character, a character that would only work as a funny obnoxious a**hole.<br/><br/>So it all comes down to this: is it a comedy? Not really. A thriller? Certainly not. Ensemble cast for a period piece? Sometimes. A satire? Of what? A nostalgia postcard? Nope.<br/><br/>American Hustle is a typical case of a director pretty full of himself, who fall in love with his story and wanted to show us all his ""brilliant"" ideas instead of constantly challenging them to know which kind of movie he was making."

Lets all wait for the 2014 year and hope that these actors and directors make better decisions and that we'll make up for the huge and greatly disappointing movie we all just had to witness like I said these actors have all seen better days and I'm sorry but they were ""conned"" into being in this one."

Sound track worth buying.<br/><br/>Everyone is a hustler with the exception of one supporting character. Everyone is trying to find a way to survive. The will to survive is the greatest of all desires and the characters show this.<br/><br/>My advice is that you go to the toilet before the movie as you will not want to get up and leave during the movie.

"jtindahouse","4","9","16","24 January 2014"," Focus too much on characters, not enough on story
","The Academy must be full of some very strange people. Every year they seem to love the mediocrity Hollywood spews out and completely ignore some of the brilliance that presents itself. I hear the process is all very political and I quite believe it. I did not enjoy 'American Hustle' much at all and yet there it is with 10 Oscar nominations and probably third in the running to win Best Picture.<br/><br/>I read something very interesting in the trivia section: According to Christian Bale much of the movie was improvised. So, during the shooting of the film he noted to David O. Russell, ""You realize that this is going to change the plot greatly down track."" To which the director replied, ""Christian, I hate plots. I am all about characters, that's it."" <br/><br/>I think the above is why I didn't like the movie. Russell completely sacrifices the flow and entertainment of the story just so that his actors could have a playground to present their characters on. The best directors don't need to make this sacrifice. It must be said though that with back to back films of his getting nominations in all four acting categories at the Academy Awards more and more actors and actresses will be lining up to work with him.<br/><br/>Of the four that were nominated I thought Jennifer Lawrence was the best. She just doesn't know how to give a bad performance that girl and it's impressive. In 'American Hustle' she was probably playing a character suited to a slightly older actress, and yet that only occurs to you as an afterthought because she plays it so damn well. Christian Bale and Amy Adams were excellent, and slightly lower down the chain for me was Bradley Cooper. His felt the least Oscar-worthy of the four for me.<br/><br/>Con man movies can be so much fun like 'Ocean's Eleven' but Russell has just managed to suck all the life out of this one. You can't do a movie like this without some kind of twist (the good ones have more than one), and there is a minor one in 'American Hustle', but it feels so phoned in and predictable that you can truly see how little effort was put into the story on this one. Very disappointing.<br/><br/>While watching this you can't help but compare it to 'The Wolf of Wall Street' (or the other way around depending on which you saw first). They have a lot of similarities and have obviously been released around the same time and are contesting for the a lot of the same awards. But one of them is infinitely superior to the other. One has a run time of 180 minutes but feels like it barely lasts an hour, while the other runs 138 minutes but drags on and on and on. Martin Scorsese has shown David O. Russell up big time this year."

","To say that this movie is overrated is an understatement. It is practically a scam to have a movie like this be given so many positive reviews. I have disagreed with the critics before, but never to this extent. The movie is a complete dud, it is slow and dull from the beginning until the end. You'll sit and wait for it to get better, hoping for at least a half-clever twist at the end, but you'll only be more disappointed as the credits draw closer. With a 92% rating from Rotten Tomatoes and a Metascore of 90%, it seems like IMDb finally has one of the most accurate ratings for once, but it is still highly inflated (currently at 7.9). Sure, the acting is good, and the story is OK, but the entertainment value of this movie is far below average. I have yet to find a friend or family member that watched and recommends this movie. If you still decide to waste your time watching it because of all the great reviews, at least save some money and view it at home. I'd rate it lower to try to offset the positive reviews, but an honest score puts it below average at 5/10"

","I went to see American Hustle yesterday for New Year's Eve and I admit my expectations were high since Jennifer Lawrence has a role and I am absolutely in love with this actress. The script is genius, the movie is funny, I laughed a few times and you get the plot quickly. The acting is incredible, especially Amy Adams, and you simply don't recognize Christian Bale in his character. However, it was hard to follow. I did not get why they were so against the mayor and how the money they transfered put Cooper's character in trouble. Maybe it's just me (my first language is french) but I think the actors were speaking incredibly fast and I could not understand what they were saying sometimes. I even felt sleepy during the movie.

Russell is a fantastic director, and the cast is top notch. Let me tell you I was not disappointed by the end result.<br/><br/>Right from the opening scene with Christian Bale, his performance pulls you in and leaves you in awe of his incredible acting. I may sound like I'm overselling it, but he is truly brilliant in this film. (Personally, I believe he deserves the Oscar for Best Actor, and I am aware of the tough competition this year - Still, he was fantastic) Everyone else - Adams, Cooper, Renner, Lawrence, heck, even Louis CK, are great, and you wouldn't expect anything less.<br/><br/>I realize this is a very positive review, but I enjoyed it so much I don't think I could bring myself to say anything negative about the film.<br/><br/>Sure, if you enjoy special effects and high speed car chases - this isn't the film for you. But if you love a great story along with great acting, you NEED to see this movie.<br/><br/>In conclusion, David O. Russell once again hits a home run with a great film, sprinkled with one of the best ensemble casts of the year in what I consider to be a top two or three contender for this year's Oscar race. Go see ""American Hustle."""

No chance that something would be revealed, since her upper body is almost as flat as a pancake. Jennifer Lawrence still has a pretty face. And that's it. Renner had a terrible haircut. And De Niro you'll see in a flash and disappears so quickly that you even begin to doubt whether he has starred in this movie. The only positive contribution was the fake Arab they had fetched.

","The very messy plot should be about a convoluted scam played by a couple of swindlers, ""forced"" to work for the FBI. The swindlers happen to be Irving (Bale) and Sydney (Adams), also involved in a torrid extramarital affair. Irving is married to Rosalyn (Lawrence) a single mum, whose son he adopted. Like most married men, he stalling divorce because the ""child would suffer"".<br/><br/>Irving and Sydney get busted by Richie (Cooper) an ambitious FBI agent who forces them to get bigger fish into the agency net. Or, at least this should be the plot, because it gets derailed in all directions, none of which even remotely interesting.<br/><br/>It feels like the whole movie is a scam played on the audience, starting with Lawrence. I understand that she is the present ""Hollywood-IT-hot"" girl, but her part is bloated out of proportion, when her character was at best a marginal one.<br/><br/>She is constantly on screen, shouting all her lines and going on endlessly about her relationship with Irving. Who cares? I wanted to see a movie about a hustle, not a dysfunctional couple in action, especially when their dysfunctions are not the core of the plot. We also get plenty of the Sydney-Richie relationship (and again, who cares?) <br/><br/>Everybody is exceedingly verbose, and situations that would require at most 30 seconds of screen time drag on for several minutes. Even considered as a ""character study"", the movie still does not work. Besides, the ""moral"" of the story is a murky one and an additional joke played on the audience: whoever makes more money (regardless of their methods) is smarter than anybody holding an honest job.<br/><br/>Corrupted politicians are portrayed as minor offenders, dealing dirty deeds for the good of the community. Richie is played as a fool, while mediocre Irving and Sydney are glorified as first-class tricksters. Even dumb and insufferable Rosalyn gets a happy ending of her own.<br/><br/>The best thing about American Hustle is the 70's atmosphere, with some amazingly tacky clothes and a good soundtrack, but it is definitely not enough to save the movie.

How on earth was Amy Adams better than Adele Exarchopoulos, Emma Thompson or Julie Delpy this year and so many others? What did Adams do that phenomenal to be nominated when compared to them? I won't object to Lawrence's nomination but I don't think she should win in her category this year either.

I was expecting high things, and still was until about 30 minutes into the film when I found my eyelids drooping and had to be nudged by my girlfriend to stay awake. It just didn't drag me in. Believable, yes. Interesting - I'm afraid not. It ambles along gently and without any real interest points for the majority of the film. For a while I wondered whether there was a bigger story I was missing, and this kept me occupied for a bit while I tried to work through the possible angles. Unfortunately I couldn't find any. The whole thing was telegraphed every time there was an 'angle' being played, and without the angles it just seemed to be a film about people who'd got in over their heads and didn't know what the hell they were doing. <br/><br/>'Some of this actually happened' states a one liner in the opening credits. This is probably true. People all over the world end up ambling through life with no clue. I've done it, and I'm willing to bet you've done it too. Ask yourself the question ""Would that be interesting to make a film about?"" My answer is no. If that was enough you could make a film about me writing a whiny review on IMDb. Somehow I doubt it would get great reviews but apparently if you picked great actors, set it in a nostalgic time period and filmed it well it might still have a chance at a Golden Globe.

"brickmoviereviews","5","10","19","9 January 2014"," American Hustle: Don't Get Hustled By This Con
","Everybody has to do what they can to survive, even if what they do lies on the illegal side of things. The same goes for Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale). A con-man for the majority of his life, Rosenfeld has quickly become one of the best in the business. Dabbling in fake loans and fake artwork, Rosenfeld makes a good living for himself. Business only gets better for Irving when he meets Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams) – the woman he quickly falls in love with, even though he is married to his wife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence). Sydney joins the business with Irving and things run smoothly, until they run into F.B.I. Agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper).<br/><br/>After DiMaso takes Prosser to jail and holds her there for three days, Irving cuts a deal. He agrees to run four cons with DiMaso to take down some criminals, and in return, Rosenfeld and Prosser walk. Their plan goes off without a hitch, until DiMaso gets addicted to and mentally sickened by the case when he learns that the lovable Mayor Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner), hailing from New Jersey, is as dirty as they come. With the con in full swing, Rosenfeld realizes he is in way over his head, and needs to hustle his way out.<br/><br/>There's really no need to sugarcoat anything – American Hustle is not a good film – mainly because of the acting. Before I begin ranting about all that was bad about the movie, I do want to quickly rave about two things: the story, and Christian Bale. First, the concept of American Hustle is really intriguing, and I do genuinely see the appeal that most of the country sees in the film. The hustling and con-artist world is a fascinating world and the story, not the script, the story is written very well. Christian Bale is absolutely fantastic. Bale easily saves this movie. His acting is brilliant and flawless. He is definitely deserving of an Oscar nomination, and has a legitimate shot, in my opinion, to challenge Tom Hanks. Also, it is worth noting, that Jeremy Renner also does a commendable and noteworthy job in the movie.<br/><br/>Now, to the problems. Starting off with Bradley Cooper: I do have to say his performance isn't terrible. It is, however, strange. I never once got a sense of who Richie DiMaso is. One minute he's calm and smart, the next he's a drunken maniac, and then the next he's a sobbing idiot. Normally, I would commend drastic emotional changes like this, however it comes across as confusing and weird. Next, onto Jennifer Lawrence. I cannot, for the life of me, figure out why she was in the movie. The director must still be drunk over the success of Silver Linings Playbook in 2012. Lawrence's character is completely unnecessary and sloppily written. I would bet a serious amount of money that David O. Russell created Rosalyn Rosenfeld for the sole purpose of having Lawrence in the movie. And another thing, to be honest, Lawrence is terrible in the movie. Her acting is obviously fake and forced, and, I'm sorry but it's just plain awful. Finally, to Amy Adams. Her character I liked, her I did not. American Hustle would have been much, much better if someone else was cast in the role of Sydney Prosser. I'm sorry, but Amy Adams plays the role in the same old, lifeless manner she plays all her other roles.<br/><br/>Also, to the director, David O. Russell: what were you thinking? Yes, The Fighter worked, and yes, Silver Linings Playbook worked, and I get it, many directors like to recycle the actors they use for many of their films (Christopher Nolan comes to mind), but that doesn't mean it always works. You cannot mush the casts of two movies together and assume it will work – and here, it did not. Bale worked, but Adams, Cooper, and Lawrence flamed out, which really made the movie suffer. Also, Robert De Niro has a miniscule part in the film which bothered me. Why? Why do you need to bring in a talent like De Niro to have him be in the movie for around five minutes? What is the point of that? Is it maybe because he too was in Silver Linings Playbook and you hoped throwing him in there would make things work again? If that's the answer, shame on you David O. Russell.<br/><br/>With all the ranting I've done, it sounds like I'm about to give American Hustle an awful rating, and I will not be recommending it. I'm not doing either of those things. I completely understand the appeal to American Hustle, believe me, I wanted nothing more than to like this movie. My major problem was the cast of the film, aside from Bale and Renner. All in all, Bale, Renner, and the concept saved this movie from being a tragic failure. As for recommending it, I cannot sit here and say ""see it"" or ""don't see it"" because I am in the middle. There are good qualities that bring it up, and there are bad qualities that bring it right back down. In the end, all I can say is, if you want to take your chances, go ahead, but be very cautious.<br/><br/>Rating: 5 of 10 BrickMovieReviews.wordpress.com @BrickFilmReview"
"Catrician","6","10","19","26 December 2013"," Mediocre yet not quite bad
","I don't usually try to buy into hype. It's led to some underwhelming results, both in life and in following the film industry. Life is full of disappointments.<br/><br/>Around a year ago, I posted my review for Silver Linings Playbook, joking about how with an all-star cast and a notable director, a film can still fail (even though I do like Silver Linings). Here we are, a year later, with a film more star-studded than Elton John's wardrobe that manages to be a disappointment on a number of levels, one of which being the acting.<br/><br/>Christian Bale is fantastic in his role as a leading con man, and while I never considered him particularly charismatic, he definitely retains that quality with Hustle. Bradley Cooper does what Bradley Cooper is supposed to do, and Jeremy Renner is fine, but the rest of the parts fall short on a number of levels. Amy Adams in particular is a letdown, with many of her lines seeming forced or clumsy. Jennifer Lawrence can't determine how to make facial expressions half of the time, and it's not due to ""indecisiveness""; it's a matter of not portraying emotions properly.<br/><br/>But still, Hustle retains an interesting plot that is ultimately lacking in depth but it makes up for it somewhat with scattered humour and The Big Sleep-esque plot maneuvering. I'm not one to complain about not sympathizing with lead characters, but I didn't sympathize with the lead characters. Yes, we see how an unexpected couple fall in love, and how someone from that couple falls in love with another, who is in love with another, who may or may not be in love with another, etc. There is no depth, however, to these relationships. There's a reason why the love- triangle is one of the most popular plot devices; it appeals to a broad audience, it creates plot tension, but also it allows for thematic depth. There is none of this in Hustle.<br/><br/>Still, the biggest issue with Hustle is perhaps its script. It seems like the script a 20 year old film buff would write. For some people, that's great. For me, I expect more out of my films than something oozing clichés and immature dialogue (immature as in lacking depth). The reason why Tarantino is an excellent writer is because he recognizes these tropes and is able to channel them into his highly unique style. Russel simply churns out a mediocre script that attempts to beat the audience over the head with the plot.<br/><br/>It's entertainment enough, however, and the costumes are convincing as is the makeup. Watching Christian Bale for an extended amount of time is always a good thing. But I couldn't see myself recommending it on any serious level beyond that."

"MartinHafer","7","6","10","21 March 2014"," Good but over-hyped.
","While ""American Hustle"" has some nice performances, I was very surprised how unexcited I was watching this film. After all, around Oscar time, this was THE film that all the hype seemed to be about and the movie hadn't even debuted yet!! Critics were abuzz and the film got all the major nominations--Best Picture, Best Director, all the acting awards and four other nominations! If I were to create a list of most overrated films of all time, I would include this one simply because of all this hype. No film could be as good as this hype would indicate...and it wasn't.<br/><br/>The movie is a HIGHLY fictionalized retelling of the Abscam affair where the FBI caught a lot of politicians on tape taking bribes. The ending, in particular, is pure Hollywood, not fact. But, instead of focusing mostly on the scam, the film tends to glamorize the characters involved in putting over this sting--the confidence people as well as the FBI. <br/><br/>So why was I so underwhelmed by the film? The biggest reason is that I didn't like any of the people. And, oddly, the one I liked the most was the mayor (Jeremy Renner) caught up in the scandal. Any film about Abscam, even one as fictional as this one, needs to show bad people-- this didn't bother me. But the film so glamorized them and was all about them--and this left me flat. <br/><br/>A few other things bothered me a bit. First, the f-word was not THAT commonly used in the 70s like it is used today. Historically, this is inaccurate, as it was used something like 27102391294 times. Second, while I liked the period music (as well as some new music by Jeff Lynne that sounded period), it was often too invasive--like a music video.<br/><br/>In closing, I think if the film had never been hyped, I might have enjoyed it a lot more and scored it higher."

","This kind of movie does nothing for me. It's not about story or characters. It's not even a showcase of any kind of craftsmanship or style. It's just a self-indulgent vanity project for various actors to play dress-up in retro '70s clothes and try to out-ham each other. The film is an awkward mix of drama and comedy with pretensions of being something akin to Goodfellas. You can tell as you watch that there is a lot of improv going on. Everyone acts in this overdone manner that gets old fast. Of the cast, Jennifer Lawrence comes out best. Amy Adams looks great and probably offers the closest to Lawrence in terms of an enjoyable performance. But the material (or lack of it) lets her down. It lets them all down, really. Christian Bale and Jeremy Renner are both fine, though much better than this film and the stupid hairstyles they are forced to wear to get laughs. Bradley Cooper is the worst, as he often is. He's such a try-hard and I am baffled by the continued push this mediocre actor is getting. Any movie where he is praised I automatically want to avoid it, as experience has taught me he is a very limited dramatic actor and only marginally better with comedy. David O. Russell is obviously the flavor-of-the-month right now so I'm not surprised at the amount of hype this film has received and how completely overrated it is. See it if you have a couple of hours to kill but don't expect much."
"CoolFilmUsername","5","6","10","15 February 2014"," David O. Russell attempting a Coen Brothers film.
","When I first saw American Hustle I went because it has a great cast, I liked David O. Russell and the critics seemed to love it. I left the theatre angry however because I felt I'd not only wasted my money, but my time as well. I very rarely feel like this about films because generally if something isn't good I'll let it go and just say ""oh well"". The thing that made me angry about this is that it has potential and David O. Russell was not the man that should have directed it. It was obvious that he was going for a Coen brothersesk feel which was his first mistake because only the Coen brothers can do the Coen brothers. Like Coen movies, there were big almost cartoonish characters and an elliptical story line in which the interaction or the Journey matter more than the destination. The reason why this style works so brilliantly in a Coen movie is because they have a tight control of what is going on. David O. Russell let all his actors improvise so much so that it felt like they were all more interested in out acting each other. It was difficult to follow what he was going for at times and not in an enjoyable way. There are times where you're not sure what's happening in a Coen movie but you don't care because the journey is fun. The whole thing although billed a comedy, was the furthest from it. Back to the Coens, they don't write jokes but let the humour rise from the script and the characters and the situations they're in. This is obviously what David O. Russell was going for but again without the control, it fell apart. He then also felt the need to throw in some of Scorsese's tricks.<br/><br/>The whole thing is vacuous nonsense and I wish David O. Russell would start making proper movies again. There's nothing wrong with using other directors styles but if you're going to do it, do it properly and understand why it works for them. He has had some decent films but now he seems more preoccupied with winning awards by pandering to the academy and the critics. This thing can win as many awards as it wants in the Hollywood popularity contests but it's not a great film. It's a shame really because it could have been great."

One night at a party he meets a woman named Sydney Prosser (Adams) and his life is changed. He not only finds a new lover but also a new partner. When she sets up a deal that goes bad they are forced to work for the FBI or spend their lives in jail. The opening of the movie states that ""some of this actually happened"" so this isn't really a true story just as a heads up. I wanted to see this movie for one reason...the cast. The cast in this is amazing and how can a movie with this cast be bad? The answer to that slowly revealed itself as I watched. It boiled down to the fact that none of the characters were really like-able at all and because of that I felt no connection to any of them. The cardinal sin for any movie is for the watcher not to be involved in the characters lives, if you don't care about them then it doesn't matter what happens in the movie. That is how I felt watching this. Bale did a great job in this but I found it really hard to get into the movie and couldn't find anyone to root for or even care for. That fact alone brought down the enjoyment of the movie and when it ended I was very disappointed by what I saw. Overall, a big disappointment, especially with this cast.

The movie could have saved about 15 minutes had the story been a little more crisp. One of the two saving graces for the movie, surprisingly, was Jennifer Lawrence who, apart from Christian Bale, provided some comic moments and little bit of substance in acting.

"nandoferrer","4","6","10","30 January 2014"," Utterly boring!
","I understand that the movie might appeal to American taste: after all heists and the mafia seem to garner some interest over there. However, as a movie about heists, I do believe there about one thousand better pictures about the subject in Hollywood than this utterly boring piece of sketches put together. It is saved only by Jennifer Lawrence, an actress to follow, and some Bradley Cooper moments. Otherwise Mr. Bale is boring to death (maybe that is the purpose in this recreation of the 70s 'delightful' atmosphere). The script needed a faster hand and different pace, and filmed as it was, it is boring, distracting and totally uninteresting. My 4 vote out of 10 is for Ms. Lawrence. Maybe it didn't help the fact that I did sleep about half of the movie's fastidious length, being woken up at intervals by my friends. As I said before if the movie appeals to Americans as far as winning some awards and probably because of its subject, I will be seriously disappointed if the Academy awards it some of the nominated Oscars. It deserves none, except for Ms. Lawrence. A total, absolute and accomplished bore. And it is not even a question of taste: this writer and reviewer is a great admirer of movies like 'Hiroshima, Mon Amour' and 'Last Year At Marienbad', not exactly fast-paced movies. But then again, as far as these are concerned, there is intellect and passion! 'American Hustle' is simply...boring."

On a similar theme, I have seen better episodes of Hustle and Leverage than this film. Also what was the 'bad hair' theme all about as there were a number of characters with real hair issues and none of it 'false' all real - weird. After about an hour in to this my wife and I looked at each other and said ""I thought it was me"" and we were pleased that we'd both come to the same conclusion.

Jennifer Lawrence did a mostly convincing turn as a ditzy blonde, but is that hard? And that actor from The Hangover never gives us a even slight convincing hint that he could ever be a FBI agent. Louis CK acts like himself, which is not anything like a FBI supervisor. The most convincing character is the Camden mayor, and he gets the shaft in the end. The lawyer's office scene is just not in any way credible. You know a movie is poorly thought out if it requires a lot, and I mean a LOT of voice-over exposition to paper over the weak ares.

(they all lose) <br/><br/>This movie one character wins everything and everyone else lose, and even when they try to make this character more likable by having him go legit, they give no real explanation as to why someone that has been a bad guy since childhood would just decide to go strait one day without any true modivation.

OR it is because despite all of its flaws this film is still probably one of the best films in terms of originality that Hollywood has produced in the last 2 decades - which says more about the state of Hollywood than this film.<br/><br/>Probably not worth going to the cinema to see this film (certainly not for a repeat showing), definitely not worth buying it on DVD (wait less than a year and it will be in the bargain bin), probably worth watching on TV.<br/><br/>Overall the film was relatively boring and the plot was as thin as a sheet of toilet paper...

","Okay... let me be honest... this movie was not good. It wasn't bad though... it was just... OKAY! I really do not understand where the plaudits are coming from. I wish that I can explain the movie but I can't. It was quite confusing. My guess is that it was based on the 70's of two con artists that become enamored with an opulent lifestyle, parties, and money? I don't know... again, it was not good. <br/><br/>I wish that I can find something great about this movie but the only thing is I'm glad that I didn't purchase popcorn because of all of the money that I would have wasted.

I feel as if the writer was trying to take on a ""Martin Scorsese"" route but failed miserably.<br/><br/>The acting: I would have to say that the best actors were Jeremy Renner and Bradley Cooper but that's not saying much. I honestly believe that if they were given a better script, they would have been dynamic. I wouldn't be surprised if Bradley scored a Best supporting actor Oscar nod because his role is ""out there"" but there really isn't much to choose from. Christian and Amy were okay but their roles were dull because of the writing. And Jennifer Lawrence... OMG talk about over acting. Some parts were good but some were just juvenile (i.e. the Microwave scene.) There's a lot of Oscar talk around her performance and that's okay.. but to win would be a travesty! She just won last year and the performance is NOT worthy of another one. <br/><br/>I thought that the movie would pick at some point and it never did. I take that back... it did once the credits started to roll. Overall, I am very disappointed in this movie because I was really looking forward to seeing this all year. I really do believe that the critics are too terrified to speak up and say how dull this movie was. I honestly think that because the Oscar season has some controversial films (12 years a slave: which is perfection, and Wolf of Wall street: great movie) they are looking for something that plays it safe and makes people happy. That is the only reason why this movie is getting good reviews and it doesn't deserve them. I would be more forgiving and less cruel if I could get my money back, but I can't.

"bob the moo","Null","6","10","9 January 2014"," Runs a little long but is stylish, well acted and generally engaging, but you need to leave the awards hyping at the door
","It is that time of year again, the time of year where films are talked up for their awards potential, where good films are hyped as the greatest films ever and so on – so it is a time to be wary of publicity. This is the case to a certain extent with American Hustle because it is a film whose marketing doesn't quite make it clear what it is, but does make it clear that it is probably the most brilliant thing you'll ever see. Of course it doesn't live up to this hype and I can understand why many viewers going in with these words in their brains came out disappointed, which is why it is important to try to leave this in the lobby and see the film for what it is.<br/><br/>This also helps because from the trailers it isn't clear what the film is; whether it is a slick caper movie, a comedy or a true-story drama or thriller. Part of the reason I think they struggled to really pigeonhole it when selling it was that it does rather sit across all of these genres and surprisingly it does so pretty effectively. The story is based on truth and this is something that the film makes pretty clear from the very start with the ""some of this happened"" legend. The film is also effective as a comedy since the characters and rather out of control situations are often amusing and sometimes very funny. However more than this, the film is a drama because although you laugh, you are not laughing at the characters because they never lose the tragic cores that so many of them have. Although the film does not quite have the heart that could have added more, this aspect does draw you into the characters and it supports the drama as it unfolds. The story does build well even if it is a solid pace rather than a thriller; ironically the weaker moments of the narrative come towards the end and it maybe doesn't have the climax one would have hoped for.<br/><br/>The strength of the film is the delivery. Much is said of the cast and they are all good because they do not let the period costumes, hair and narrative excesses turn them into caricatures. Instead all of them really seem to ""get"" the comic-tragic mix and deliver on this very well. Bale does it the best and is really good in a subdued role, giving his best turns opposite Renner, who himself is very good in a smaller role. I've no great love for Cooper but he is also good here. The two female roles are both very strong too, with Adams impressing and my opinion of Lawrence only increasing. Russell's direction and indeed the whole style of the film is very much owing a debt to others – in particular Scorsese and Goodfellas. Although these influences are very clear, I didn't really ever feel it was a copy because the film made it work for itself. The costumes, hair, sets and all aspects of the production come together really well to create a very effective sense of time and place.<br/><br/>The hype has not helped this film – well, maybe it helps for votes in awards but not for the viewer. It isn't as flawless as some would suggest, but it is still a well done film that walks a fine line and delivers a mostly engaging story. The mix of comedy with the tragic characters is very well done across the board, adding some grit into the film and preventing it from being just slick superficiality or comedic caricatures with big hair. Leave the Oscar hype at the door and you'll find this an enjoyable film for many reasons."

The things that annoyed me the most about this film? Firstly, not for one single second did I believe what I was seeing on screen. Most of the actors came across as though they were playing characters, but not once did they come across as real human beings, real people. You could tell every moment that they were acting. Never once did I not think, ""wow, that's Christian Bale with a really bad wig"""", rather than think he was his character, Irving. And I'm sorry Amy Adams, but revealing costumes do not automatically make an actress sexy and alluring. She had moments of brilliance but they were tempered with scenes where she seemed like a first-year acting student learning how to ëmote"". Bradley Cooper was enjoyable at times, when he wasn't overacting. I much preferred and believed his performance in Silver Linings Playbook.<br/><br/>Secondly, I thought this was so poorly directed and edited. The script was meandering, to the point of boredom. I've read David O. Russell allowed a lot of improvisation on the set. If that is the case, it was at the cost of a linear plot line that was sorely needed in a ""caper/con movie"". The audience needs to be carried along with the story, to be able to pick up on some clues, so the pay-off at the end was worth investing the audience's time. As it is, my reaction was more ""meh! so what?"", rather than ""wow! that was really clever"".<br/><br/>Having said that, there were things I liked about the film and why I'm giving it four stars: <br/><br/>One star for: Jennifer Lawrence. She stole every scene she was in. Although she was much too young for the part and her character was unbelievable at times, I forgave her because her performance was so good.<br/><br/>One star for: Jeremy Renner. The only character that was rooted in some kind of reality. I felt for his character of Carmine and he played it like he was a real person with a heart, not some kind of caricature. His performance was great.<br/><br/>One star for: the costumes and hair. They were brilliantly done.<br/><br/>One star for: the soundtrack. I felt like I was having a disco in my lounge-room.<br/><br/>In summary, a huge disappointment. Just because some professional movie critics liked it, it doesn't mean it was a good film."

At least I didn't nod off during this picture. That sole honour goes to ""Silver Linings Play-Book"". ""American Hustle"" isn't really worthy of a ten line review.

She plays a terrible person in this film that I wanted to see get hit or just die!. I think the most endearing character is the Christian Bale and he is a straight up crook. Anyway, it has many dull parts that take too long before you get to the payoff. I caught myself playing Roof Top Ninja instead of caring, but I came back around by the end. I give it a 5 out of 10.

","I didn't really want to like this movie. And after reading some of the reviews it seemed people were disappointed there wasn't enough action. Well - maybe because I detest action movies - this was a huge plus for me. Now we can concentrate on good storytelling and character development, of which there was plenty. The improvisational method with which the director chose to film was very fitting. As one reviewer mentioned, it made it more believable rather than a too perfect plan that doesn't let one piece slip up. The actors surprised me as well. Before I saw it I thought the roles of the wife and mistress should have been reversed. But Amy Adams and Jennifer Lawrence owned their respective parts and now I can't imagine each one playing the others character. And what can you really say about Christian Bale? He just excels in any film he's in - thereby stealing the movie. If I were an actor I would hate to share screen time with him. As far as the other common complaint here of why this movie is not like Goodfellas or the Grifters - well, there's a good reason for that - because it is not! If you're expecting Robert DeNiro blatantly blowing gangsters away - you won't find that. Instead what you will find is Robert DeNiro in one of the most chilling and intense roles he's had in a long time."

"Sergeant_Tibbs","5","8","15","15 January 2014"," A convoluted mess. Jolly, but not fun.
","In the past few years, David O. Russell found his voice and he's been talking loudly. While The Fighter is a bit too bland for me, despite great supporting turns from Bale and Leo, Silver Linings Playbook was one of the most pleasant surprises of 2012. It was funny, moving and very rewatachable. Despite all its flaws, it felt honest. American Hustle is not honest. It knows it, that's the point. As the opening caption dictates ""some of this happened."" Sure, that's fine, you can be inspired by true events and pull off a great film, but American Hustle doesn't realise how forced and dishonest it is in its character work. It's been frequently introduced as a story of survival, resilience and reinvention by its creators which is an overblown and pretentious way to approach the film. It could've earned those words by placing their characters in an honest and sympathetic dilemma, but it's simply the character's greed that lead them to this situation. There's not a likable or relatable one in the bunch. Now a film doesn't have to have those aspects, but it needs to feel true to life.<br/><br/>Gathering actors from his previous films with Christian Bale, Amy Adams, Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence leading the ensemble, it seemed like a reliable bunch at first. They certainly put effort into it too, there's shards of greatness in there sometimes, but unfortunately it's thwarted by the script and editing. Christian Bale feels like a parody of Jake La Motta, a good one though, given that Bale is a fantastic chameleon, but he simply doesn't fit the tone of the rest of the film. It's a different shade of silly. There's times near the end where I felt myself being sympathetic to him, but I swiftly realised it was to Bale and not his character. Amy Adams has the ingredients for a great performance here, but not the recipe. Her accent is poor and her performance feel like they're formed of a series of innocent or overwhelmed glances. It results in embarrassing unintentional comedy. Hopefully she'll get the right role one day. Bradley Cooper is nearly great as a charming and loose fast-talker, but his off-moments are the ones that stand out, especially with a character with such muddled motivation. I think Louis C.K. is the only actor I truly enjoyed watching here.<br/><br/>Critics and award bodies are finding themselves torn between the above 3, but it's Jennifer Lawrence who's garnering all the universal acclaim. Now officially planted at the top of the A- list, it's hard not to think her acclaim just comes from her position. I tried to imagine her as anything but miscast, but this character doesn't feel suited to her. The personality does, but not the character. While she was great at comedy in Silver Linings, the material she's given to work with here really misses the mark. However, she's given two dramatic reflective moments that she nails perfectly and its the highlight of the film. It's a shame that these two tones are so unbalanced. But the film seems to struggle with that in general. It's clear that David O. Russell has simply attempted to build a character with each actor and give them a situation to let them play around with and then shot it. It's a good style, my favourite director Mike Leigh utilizes this and it's what made Silver Linings feel so authentic. But with weak material like this, American Hustle ends up confusing and misguided.<br/><br/>Frankly, I wouldn't be able to tell you what the story was. But Russell doesn't care, he says it's supposed to be about the characters. In the film's first act while it introduces the characters it features voice-over that feels like it was hastily added to clarify stuff the test audiences didn't get. Even so, it doesn't dig into who the character's really are. Instead, we're given a superficial outer layer that thinks its sexier and cooler than it actually is. The only way the film could have achieved tension or laughs is if I was invested in the characters, but there isn't a reason to. Now a film can compensate for the fact that I didn't care by being entertaining, but American Hustle is too convoluted and messy. Perhaps it all hinged on the fact that I was never sold on the film's main plot device in Cooper's deal. Are Bale and Adams really that powerful or seductive? This is a very different and contrived world to the one we live in. And this is a film that tries to hustle its flaws and call it part of its charm. It tries to be full of life, but it lacks sincere heart and soul. <br/><br/>To compensate for the shaky script, American Hustle tries to be as flashy as possible in its design. It abuses punchy cinematography that glides into character's faces without rhyme of reason far too frequently, something that added a key dynamic value to Silver Linings. I'll admit, the costume design is great and stylish even if it clashes against the ugly production design too much. But perhaps that was a deliberate choice to reflect the characters. Fortunately, it has a great soundtrack. If there's any moments in the film that are genuinely cool, it'll be strutting along to these classics. It's a real shame that David O. Russell messed up this film so badly given that I was intrigued in him last year. Heck, last year he would've been my choice from the Oscar nominees for Picture, Director, Screenplay, etc, but that's only because they snubbed the best of the best. Now this will most likely be my least favourite of the bunch. American Hustle is too familiar to really be worth watching and too pretentious to be taken seriously or as something silly. Good thing is was just a mess and not cringeworthy. Everyone on screen is forgiven. Russell though, I don't know.<br/><br/>5/10"

"kapotts1","2","3","4","15 December 2015"," I wanted to like this film, but couldn't
","Going in to a film called ""American Hustle"", you would expect to see some sort of... well anything that the word ""hustle"" implies. Action, a fast pace of ""hustling"" around in the con man world, unexpected twists, actual run ins with mafia or dangerous people, some sort of con/heist to blow you away and separate itself from all the other con artist films and TV shows. Nope. This movie amounted to a whole lot of, essentially, business meetings and then a side plot of Irving figuring out how to handle his wife being overly depressed and perhaps having other mental illnesses. Seeing as the entire movie is showcasing how incompetent the main characters are because of their guilt, lack of humanity, or health problems, the last five minutes trying to wrap up the story in a happy, neat package felt rather out of place.<br/><br/>When the only person in the cast that's a likable, somewhat nice, person is the supposedly corrupt politician they're trying to entrap and send to jail, that's saying something about how the script fails at getting you to like the main characters. I would actually say Jeremy Renner did the best acting of the film too. He played his role as the altruistic New Jersey mayor who gets tricked really well. He is the only one who maintained his New Jersey accent the entire time without slipping up too.<br/><br/>The way the narration was, perhaps the director wanted us to feel sympathy towards Irving for being ""stuck"" with a mentally ill wife, but instead we feel sympathy towards Rosalynd for being with a lying, cheating husband who really was never there and was literally mad at her for having a mental illness or two. Rather than help his wife, he abandons her for another woman without ""problems"" and belittles her for her mental illness. The other issue with him never really being there at his home, is that we are supposed to believe his reason for staying married to a wife he doesn't love was to ""be there"" for her son. Laughable considering he showed up maybe two or three times to their house the entire movie and when he did, he shooed the son away pretty much instantly so he could spend his time yelling at the son's mom for being too depressed. <br/><br/>There was a lot of misplaced humor (lets give the depressed wife all the humorous scenes and lines?), no witty, meaningful or interesting dialogue, no palatable tension, no ""come together"" aha twist at the end, no likable characters... everything that makes a movie great, this movie lacked. I don't think there was a single quotable line other than ones similar to what you could find when googling inspirational quotes about finding yourself. <br/><br/>They decided to include ""mafia"" in the last line of the plot description and that was highly inaccurate. The ""mafia"" man they encounter (wouldn't call it opening them to the mafia world) lasts a whopping 2-5 minutes and is spent sitting around a table talking about money and failed entirely at creating any sort of tension (a 1-2 second flashback to the mob man shooting a single man in the street is supposed to make us afraid). A more accurate description of this movie would be: ""A con man, Irving Rosenfeld, along with his partner Sydney Prosser, is forced to choose between kidnapping his son and fleeing the country or working for a desperate FBI agent, Richie DiMaso, who pushes them into sitting around tables and convincing New Jersey politicians and businessmen to break the law. They decide to try their chances with the FBI and then after 90% of the movie is over finally realize that was a huge mistake."""

","Never before has a cinema visit made me want to physically hurt myself.<br/><br/>For two and a half bum-numbing hours I sat, jaw clenched, temples twitching as this loud, obnoxious farce of a film clattered along, all the while thinking 'how the hell did THIS get nominated for several Oscars?'.<br/><br/>The entire running time of ""American Hustle"" can pretty much be summarized as a collection of vignettes in which you have spoiled, nasty, unlikable characters shouting and bickering at each other hysterically over absolutely nothing. It is the epitome of a current trend in American films to fill time with yappy, antagonistic improv in a shallow attempt to create tension and humour without actually furthering the plot or the characters.<br/><br/>Some of the dramatic mood shifts feel so forced and poorly developed, for example, the bitchy bathroom exchange between Jennifer Lawrence and Amy Adams that ends in a totally contrived and bizarre lesbian kiss, clearly put in for shock value.<br/><br/>Equally shallow is the film's treatment of it's female characters, Adams in particular. Her every turn to camera is frozen in a glacial-eyed expression as though she's being photographed for the cover of Vogue. The camera zooms in and out of her gaping cleavage like a horny fly. In one scene, Bradley Cooper forces her into a toilet cubicle and gropes her ass, while she stands pert like a porn star, the camera leering up her skirt. It's cringe-worthy.<br/><br/>Hardest to bare was Bradley Cooper, easily the loudest and most manic of the lot. Every scene with him just made me want to wring his neck. Perhaps the only saving grace is Jennifer Lawrence, mainly there for comedic value, she goes full pelt and is fun to watch, but I wasn't convinced by her relationship with Bale's character or her vulnerability.<br/><br/>There is so little emotional weight to this film. No matter how hard the characters screamed, grimaced and cried, I didn't believe or care about any of it. I was emotionally numb. It felt like watching a bunch of teenagers playing dress up and pretending to be edgy and adult. Flashy costumes and atrocious wigs, hiding nothing of substance.<br/><br/>Easily one of the most over-rated Oscar nominated films since ""Crash""."

The story is not special and very slowly moving, a lot of unnecessary and long scenes. <br/><br/>The character Amy Adams played, running around without bra being the cliché of a witty and like to be classy sex bomb is as exaggerated as some of the other characters, but it's not consistent - and that's a problem throughout the whole movie.

So for this reviewer it is just a massive shame that the prior mentioned ingredients are ruined scene after scene by the cast's improvised dialogue.<br/><br/>Instead of sharply observed insightful gripping scenes, we have the cast repeating the same thing three times just to make the point. When they don't know what to say, hell, they just say the first thing that comes into their heads. <br/><br/>The worst part is that I don't know who to blame – the cast for arrogantly thinking they are script writers, the director for not taking a tougher stand or the producers for just allowing the thing to evolve in the way it did.<br/><br/>American Hustle will win Oscars, not because it deserves to, simply because it has that awful thing called the big momentum.

He meets Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams) a Jersey stripper who can produce a fetching English accent and the business takes off as well as their intimate relationship. When she gets busted by a hyper intense FBI agent Richie DiMaso ( Bradley Cooper) they agree to working a sting that starts out small but mushrooms big time when the DC pols develop a taste for some illicit green waved in front of them.

Adams, Cooper, Jeremy Renner as the mayor and Jennifer Lawrence as Irv's off the wall wife more than hold their own with the superb Bale but the projectory of the story begins to lose thrust halfway through as Russell struggles to amp up the suspense with smoke, mirrors and a hint of slapstick.<br/><br/>Hustle pads itself heavily with music video to give it an energy and many scenes crackle with it as agent DiMaso, Irving and Sydney play a sexual tension cat and mouse game with each other. But Russell as he did in his last overheated exercise Silver Linings Playbook fails to maintain a consistent mood, vacillating between tension and humor to tell his story making it uneven and ultimately unconvincing as it ties up loose ends in a mawkish way with Russell sacrificing verisimilitude in favor of making his loathsome characters warm and fuzzy for audience consumption.

The story itself is somewhat interesting but it's very slow and confusing. There are so many double-crosses it's hard to keep track of what's going on. Also one of the very nice characters (played by Jeremy Renner) is treated horribly. On the plus side there's a great soundtrack of 70s music and they got the styles and fashions of the era down to a T. The acting is for the most part good. Bale is admirably slimy and Cooper is having lots of fun in his role. Adams I couldn't quite get a grasp on. Her character is difficult to figure out but that may be the point. Jennifer Lawrence is easily the best actor here. As Irving's wife she's loud, aggressive, beautiful (in a way) and VERY funny. However, all in all, I was pretty bored and underwhelmed by what I saw. Why this is getting praised to the high heavens is beyond me."

","Let me see, a gangster movie with 2 hours of talking and no action, is that believable? Yes, there's more dialogue in this than the BBC News.

It's everything you want to believe and nothing as it unfolds. Save your time and leave this viewing for a long plane ride as American Hustle is one salty joke. It deserves to be destroyed and never shown again. I would rather experience a shortage of breath and be hit over the head until I started bleeding from the eyes.

It is a badly made comedy moview, for dumb audience. Don't waste your time. You will feel so empty after watching this moview. It will suck all your energy because it is just so boring.

","There are those who say AH is a cinematic masterpiece ; others contend its preposterous crap <br/><br/>I fall into the latter category. These are not people but garish caricatures. I thought I would never hear myself say Where's Leonardo DiCaprio when you need him which is what I said at the opening scene of the con being set. <br/><br/>Sting sang Why Should I cry for you? He could have said Why should I care? <br/><br/>And for these , I cared nothing. AH is treated as if this idea of scamming scammers is something unique. It isn't. These individuals care only for themselves, saving their own butts at the expense of their object of desire:Carmine Polito. <br/><br/>Much has been made of hair/makeup/clothes- Oscar here we come. For a more accurate portrayal of 70's attire, take a look at Ron Howard's excellent Rush. In Rush, the clothes complimented the story. Here in AH- they are the story. <br/><br/>Bale, who I generally like, is clearly acting here save for a scene where he expresses regret, trying to make it right for Carmine. Adams- anyone could have portrayed her role, Lawrence is way over the top and too young to convincingly play a matronly sort of woman. Her sashaying in the bar scene was laughable at best, cringe-worthy at worse. But she is clearly a camera favorite and Russell's muse, so much so she distorts the picture.<br/><br/>Cooper, another Russell favorite, is the worst offender of all. And what of the rookie in this mess:Jeremy Renner? <br/><br/>Renner has said everyday they swung for the fences and this approach of Russell's might be his preferred way of directing. But the film clearly comes across that way too. Renner has said it was a challenge for him to portray a character who wears his heart on his sleeve. And Mr. Renner, please do this more often, if you are given the chance for how wonderful you are! <br/><br/>In the hands of a Branagh, his performance might have been elevated to near Shakespearean tragic heights, recalling to mind, the line from Merchant of Venice- ""To do a great right,do a little wrong"". <br/><br/>Like Tom Hardy, Renner conveyed much with simple gestures. So much so I wanted to scream 'get out of the car', you are being taken for a ride!""<br/><br/>Of course if he does, the cynic in me says, there is no film! I don't think Russell really knew how to handle Renner's quietly affecting performance. And he is heartbreakingly terrific!<br/><br/>I am surprised no charges of misogyny/objectification of women has been levied against Russell as it has been against Scorsese in Wolf of Wall Street. I wonder why that is? The women in AH are busy flaunting their assets as if to make up for their lack of acting talent. <br/><br/>AH might be considered the flippant stepchild of Wolf. Wolf is concerned with one thing and one thing only:EXCESS. And because Leo and Marty have corroborated many times in the past, their bond/ trust is palpable here. Leo is/was comfortable in doing certain scenes here for Martin that he otherwise would not have done. To put it simply, white collar crime as depicted in Wolf is rendered OK in the sense this is how one man chose to lead his life and his cohorts who merrily went along with it. But Scorsese does show the downside; perhaps not as much as he should have. <br/><br/>With the single scene of one individual going to jail, , Russell altered two character's outcome. At least Belfort served time in federal prison as did his primary cohort."

","The definition of ""hot mess."" David O. Russell takes a bunch of ideas for scenes, throws them together and calls it a movie - but most of the scenes, while fun on their own, make no sense in context and don't work together at all. The movie is a chore to sit through; almost everything in the first hour along with Jennifer Lawrence's character could have been cut and nothing would be missed. The chaos and complete lack of structured narrative clearly has appealed to some but for me it was unengaging and annoying.<br/><br/>Bad editing isn't always a kiss of death, but unfortunately the screenplay is trash and the acting a mixed bag. None of the dialogue sounds organic, the plot is predictable, characters are manipulated beyond recognition to suit the story or mood (poor Amy Adams plays about 7 different women here). Bradley Cooper and Jeremy Renner do what they can and create the only mildly sympathetic characters in the ensemble, while Amy Adams struggles admirably to make sense of her ridiculous character; Christian Bale's Robert De Niro impression is dull and Jennifer Lawrence could not be any more wrong for the part. <br/><br/>The most frustrating thing about American Hustle is that there is a great story buried there somewhere - but Russell drives it into the ground. He has stated that he values character over plot and that much of the movie was improvised, and he clearly casts actors he enjoys working with rather than actors who suit the roles, and in some cases his approach could work out, but here it's a recipe for bizarre, trashy disaster.<br/><br/>Highlights: - Bradley Cooper's chest hair - Amy Adams screaming on a toilet - Maybe the best soundtrack of the year<br/><br/>Grade: - At least it makes Goodfellas look better by comparison"

","American HUSTLE is a big disappointment from David O. Russell, one of America's most overrated directors. This 1970s throwback is more interested in fashions and set design than actual storytelling, because the storyline is all over the place. It's about a group of con men and the FBI and the ways in which they get involved with mobsters and the like. It's sort of like an OCEAN'S ELEVEN, albeit with a '70s setting and no heists in sight.<br/><br/>The first thing noticeable about this film is the cast, which is pretty impressive. The person who really shines is chief actor Christian Bale, once again near enough unrecognisable thanks to some extreme weight gain. Others like Jeremy Renner and Bradley Cooper are less impressive, but Amy Adams shines as a femme fatale. Worst of the bunch is Jennifer Lawrence, totally miscast playing a character who should be in her 40s at the very least. Lawrence's ""look at me"" performance here is a constant embarrassment and she's way out of her depth in comparison to the others.<br/><br/>While I appreciated American HUSTLE's look, feel, and sound (those Brooklyn accents make you feel like you're watching an old Scorsese gangster flick), the film is way too long for its own good. Nothing much happens either, apart from loads of grating arguments. I heard that some of this was improvised, which makes sense, as improvised stuff always tends to get repetitive and samey after a while (check out the later series of the British show THIS IS ENGLAND for a good comparison). Maybe with a tighter script and some better casting choices, American HUSTLE could have been a good film. As it stands, it's just an overrated mess."
"pc95","6","6","11","19 January 2014"," Overlong and Overrated
","(spoilers)Directed by David O Russell, ""American Hustle"" does not warrant the apparent acclaim it's been afforded critically. It is a parade of look-at-me characters/actors set in the 70's some of whom seem terribly cast. Before going into that, the real problem was the movie dragged especially in overdone scenes with Bale and Adams in the beginning and Cooper and Adams later on. How many scenes do you need to ""convince"" us that these two are soul-mates or she's conning. Likewise how many stupid yelling matches do we need to endure with any 2 sets of characters. There is too much screaming, yelling, and name- calling. Then there is those who were miscast: Jennifer Lawrence is way too young to be a naggy wife as is Jeremy Renner as a Mayor of New Jersey town. Renner doesn't come close to coming off as a East Coaster. Anyway, what is good is some of the dialog and Chrisitian Bale's once again complete metamorphosis as a New York conman. I also liked the inside clever ice-fishing joke, as well as the representative music and costumes. A mild recommend though ridiculous as an Oscar selection. 6/10"

","Not sure what this film was supposed to be. Whatever it was, it failed in every respect - lots of talking and swearing, and very little action left me feeling bored and frustrated. There was nothing wrong with the acting - Bradley Cooper is making a career of playing idiots and he again did well here, playing an odious FBI imbecile particularly well. Christian Bale also did a good job as the unkempt, unclean and slimy Rosenfeld. The female leads also did a good job. The problem is that I was never sure whether this was a comedy or a gangster movie; it had elements of both without falling into either category and therefore failed to engage my attention for very long. As for the dialogue, it was mostly banal and meaningless. Shame to see such good actors wasted on this garbage."

","What really made this movie for me was Jennifer Lawrence. She stole every scene that she was in. Whether she's accidentally setting her kitchen on fire, angry dancing to ""Live and Let Die"" or walking around with a neck brace, she was absolutely hilarious. But she was also very charming and made me feel for her character. I even teared up a bit when she was at the restaurant with Pete and she started crying about how ""she doesn't like change"". I mean, she was wonderful. I would love to see her win another Oscar. Her accent was pretty spot on too. All of the other actors were pretty good too. Although, I thought Amy Adam's British accent was distracting. I don't know if it was meant to come across that way...but it wasn't good.<br/><br/>I also really loved the costumes. They all looked authentic 70s garb. I actually really dug a lot of Amy's ""booby"" costumes. The hairstyles were awful....but purposefully awful and they too worked. Even the atmosphere, and the colours they used for the filters had a 70s vibe to it.<br/><br/>However, I thought the rest of the film seemed like a mess. I didn't like how the story played out on screen. And I thought the voice-overs were annoying. Like, they would say stuff like ""I thought he was charming"". ""I met her 2 years ago"". And I would sit there like....Who are you addressing this to? The audience? Why is this necessary? It was distracting, annoying and not needed. Im sure you can properly convey this to an audience without actually having to actually say it."
"Troy_Campbell","6","15","36","13 December 2013"," Good, but well below expectations.
","When your cast list comprises of Christian Bale, Amy Adams, Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence and Jeremy Renner, and you have David O. Russell (Silver Linings Playbook) behind the camera, expectations are naturally going to be high. Apparently too high. Based loosely on the Abscam scandal, this period drama (set in the swinging seventies) with thriller trimmings is solid but nothing more, which, considering the talent involved, is undeniably disappointing. It's tonally uneven and the dramatic elements are subsequently diminished, whilst the sorta-scheming- and-conning plot is bizarrely underwhelming and lacking a worthy payoff. Nevertheless, Hustle scores big with some well-timed comedy, Linus Sandgren's beautiful cinematography and an absolutely cracking score; and the top shelf ensemble cast, with Amy Adams in particular, are reliably watchable (and boasting humorous disco-era makeovers to boot). There's enough here to recommend a DVD viewing, although forking out the big dollars to see this on the big screen is unnecessary."

","Watched this on a large screen last weekend. <br/><br/>Liked it, but not over-the-moon for it, like most critics have been. Might be due to missing a couple of plot-points, but hey, I think Russell/Bale/Cooper have made better. That being said, it's probably the best release in months (not counting '..Llewyn...', of course.<br/><br/>Starting off, right from the beginning, the movie became meta, not in a good way, where attention was being called to Bale's physical characteristics. It seemed more like a treatise on what the actor had undergone in prepping for this role, rather than a look at the character himself. No denying his effort, but subtlety is an art that was Not practiced by either the star or the director in these few sequences. Very self-indulgent, and took me right out of the movie. <br/><br/>I loved 'The Fighter' as well as 'Silver Linings playbook', even though there were moments of self-indulgence in the latter as well, they were not put in to the point of being overwhelming.<br/><br/>As it has been said many times while referencing this movie, Jennifer Lawrence steals every scene her character's in, and she could well give stiff competition to other Oscar noms in the BSA category. One of the things being missed by most critics/reviewers, is the fact that every scene with Louis CK's a hoot, and Cooper's interplay with him is very, very hilarious. Sadly, unacknowledged. <br/><br/>A cameo by another scene-stealer has the intended effect, and added to the overall charm of the movie. Renner does well in a very thankless role.<br/><br/>Conclusively, definitely a great watch, but not one of Russell's best, and definitely not deserving of all the Oscar love, IMHO.<br/><br/>A shout-out for the editing, for though the movie's a tad overlong in hindsight, it never outstays its welcome. Go watch it at a local cinema close by....."

","""That's the boat, Donnie."" <br/><br/>When FBI Agent Joe Pistone, posing as jewel-thief Donnie Brasco, and attempting to infiltrate the Mafia, wanted to impress Benjamin 'Lefty Guns' Ruggiero of the Bonanno Crime Family, he got the use of 'The Left Hand', a big boat that was being used in an FBI sting-operation called ABSCAM.<br/><br/>This film is not about Donny and Lefty, or the boat, or even about ABSCAM, rather it is very loosely based on the sting-operation.<br/><br/>Everything that I have heard about this film, the trailers that I saw, everything, made this reviewer want to see this film.<br/><br/>Film opens with a couple of studio credits. They look a little old and naff, and combined with the quality and the texture of the film, cause us to be immediately transported back to the seventies. There are no further opening credits, except one, which states ""Some of this actually happened."" Film is actually set right at the end of the seventies and the start of the eighties. In the seventies a device was invented for bald men. It was called 'The comb-over'. The opening shot of the movie is of Irving, a bald man, played by Christian Bale. He adjusts his hair before getting into his role. He is bald, fat, and middle aged. He is also working with Richie played by Bradley Cooper. Another man with an interesting hairstyle. Actress Amy Adams makes up the trio. She too will sport some spiffing hairstyles. Together they are trying to do a business deal, but things are not clear. They are in fact, running a con. Film now backtracks to explain how they got together.<br/><br/>This film is like 'Donnie Brasco' (1997). Like that film, this is as much about undercover work by the FBI as it is about the other subject matter. So we see, like FBI Agent Pistone did, the problems associated with running an undercover operation in that era. Decades later FBI Agent Joaquin Garcia, aka 'Big' Jack Falcone of the Gambino Crime Family, would similarly struggle. How Pistone and Garcia must wish they could've sorted out their problems in real-life as happened in this film.<br/><br/>The job of the con-artist is to exude confidence, to convince the person they are dealing with, that they are the genuine article, that what you see is what you get, whilst all along it is not. The same applies to undercover-work by FBI Agents. This film, like 'Donny Brasco', has arguments, betrayals, confrontations, and dangerous exposure threats. It is unclear who is conning who.<br/><br/>However, we the audience, know more than the actors/players. We know that the con is on. Know too that the FBI is involved. So we know more than the marks and can enjoy seeing the actors in their dual roles. They had dual roles in real-life too. Jeremy Renner has a very poignant role. It was in fact specially written for him due to casting problems. Bale, Cooper, and Renner, were all cast for more than one role. So not only were they acting two roles in one part, in real life they switched parts too. <br/><br/>Thus this, in 'American Hustle', was not deliberate, it just happened, but it must enhance the film. So too, that much of the film is improvised, this was deliberate, perhaps it was to capture the feeling of the con. Film then is like a con, it is unclear what will happen next, improvisation is always a possibility.<br/><br/>The film was written and directed by David O. Russell who also did the great 'Silver Linings Playbook' of 2012. Both films share that same mix of comedy, drama and romance. Writer/Director Russell also reunites some of the cast of 'SLP'. Jennifer Lawrence who was so good in that, here again gives a superb performance. She plays a young mother who is stupid, sassy, sexy and sultry. The role is comparable to that of Sharon Stone in 'Casino' (1995). We have too, Bradley Cooper of course, who even gives us another dance. Robert De Niro, also puts in an appearance with a great performance.<br/><br/>In real-life Christian Bale added over 40LBS to his weight for his role. When Robert De Niro met him he didn't even recognize him. However all actors, with parts large and small, were all great.<br/><br/>This film has been described as a 'fictionalization'. A google after viewing the film, showed me that the film is somewhat different from the source material, but not in a major way.<br/><br/>In real-life New Jersey has been described as the most corrupt state in the USA. In real-life too, the casinos brought Atlantic City back to life. An era captured well in 'Atlantic City, USA' (1980).<br/><br/>In this film the characters are less black and white, less good guys and bad guys. The colouring is much more that of shades of grey. The dividing line is not clear.<br/><br/>This is a great film. In the style that Martin Scorsese created, we have apt use of period music. Actors play characters who exhibit much warmth, and as they exude great love to each other, so do we fall in love with them. But be warned: just like Jennifer Lawrence's nail-varnish, this film too is bitter-sweet. We too will experience the highs and lows as do the characters. Having said that there are some nice twists. Some clever twists too. This is after all a con film. So do try to keep your eye on the ball.<br/><br/>The only mistakes in this film are, one badly placed moustache (I can thank Donny and Lefty for spotting that) and two badly delivered lines. Not enough to mark this film down for.<br/><br/>""Hey, did they get us? We're sitting here, Left. We beat those FBI guys!"" <br/><br/>The con is on. Enjoy! 10/10."

","""Some of this actually happened"" is the opening title, there are no credits, on the most pitch perfect movie since Argo and before that Magnolia.<br/><br/>It's a mob movie with grifters.<br/><br/>The ensemble cast is led gloriously, no miraculously, by Christian Bale (really? Christian Bale?) in perhaps the most astounding physical transformation since De Niro in Raging Bull.<br/><br/>And what an ensemble. Bradley Cooper is hilarious throughout, not least because of his Starsky-esque tight perm and outrageous swagger.<br/><br/>Amy Adams is simply electrifying – in so many movies she is brilliant but in this she is radiant. (Surely she will win at the Academy Awards at the fifth time of asking in the Spring).<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence is gearing up to win as many awards as Meryl Streep as she glides effortlessly from franchise movie to big American Drama via the odd art-house number. She is wonderful.<br/><br/>And then there is the unsung star; Jeremy Renner who plays an important leading subplot character role as the mayor of New Jersey.<br/><br/>Maybe it's not surprising that the ensemble works so well because this cast has been Oscar nominated no less than 17 times; Cooper (once) Adams (4 times) Bale (Once and won for O'Russell's The Fighter) Renner (twice) Lawrence (Twice with one win) and in a supporting role De Niro (seven times winning twice). By the time March comes that will be at least 20.<br/><br/>And then there's O'Russel, who is on fire. In my opinion he is now as good as PT Anderson with Oscar nods for this (surely), Silver Linings Playbook and The Fighter; his last three movies.<br/><br/>It's a film you never want to end with a plot that twists and turns like a mongoose in a sack with a cobra. So it's impossible to plot spoil because it's so complex. But the writing is nailed on in every scene so that you are carried along on a wave of gasps and belly laughs (it really is very funny indeed).<br/><br/>The camera-work (Linus Sandgren) is beautifully evocative of time and place (late 70′s New York).<br/><br/>One scene in particular sees Amy Adams just about have actual real life sex in an ecstatic Studio 54 washroom trap, to the thudding soundtrack of ""I Feel Love"". It had me open mouthed. Indeed she achieves this effect more than once.<br/><br/>In another, late in the film, Lawrence kisses Adams on the mouth so hard that she leaves all her lipstick behind. Spraying her territory. Marking Adams' cards. It's brilliant.<br/><br/>(The kiss of a spiderwoman.) ""You're nothing to me until you're everything."" says Adams' character, Sydney Prosser, to Cooper's FBI agent. And this is possibly the central thought in the film.<br/><br/>It's all about possession; of power, of women, of money.<br/><br/>And it's what blinds the foolish and drives them to make wrong, ill thought out decisions that can have, and do have, monumental implications.<br/><br/>The moral is; don't play with the big boys unless you've got your wits about you.<br/><br/>Christian Bale most certainly has his.<br/><br/>A resounding 10 out of 10."

","Lets start with the movie itself. David O. Russell who both wrote and directed advances his career nicely with this one. Arguably a tad overlong, arguably the beginning is slow, but by midpoint the audience is hooked on this offbeat ""caper"" film with some of the strongest performances seen in years. Especially enjoyed the scene about a hour in where Bale sits down and eyeballs diNiro -- since for most of the movie Bale has been doing his diNiro impression, and a pretty good one, at that. Liked seeing Anthony Zerbe in a walkon, this man has been acting since before your parents were born and rivals the late Anthony Quinn as one of the longest-working actors in Hollywood. But at the end of the day, when the lights are out, and you are are alone with your thoughts, the performance that really pops is Amy (""Dance with me baby"") Adams. Pushing 40, and no spring chicken, it seems odd to say this is a breakout role for her, but the fact is that she has never used her looks and talent to better purpose. She stands out in each scene she is in like some sort of cinematic ""Where's Walda"" test. And the use of the British accent just makes her character that much more interesting. Russell set out to make a classic and here he just may have succeeded. **ODD FACTOID** As reported in Businessweek (of all places) this was nominated for an Oscar as a ""comedy"" even though everyone, critics and film-maker included, is of the opinion it is actually a drama. BW reported that this was part of the new ""tricky marketing"" in Hollywood where (not making this up), by implying a film which is NOT a comedy really IS a comedy, you increase the potential box office by (theoretically) attracting movie patrons genuinely looking for a comedy***"

Bradley Cooper had a difficult role as an ambitious and out of control FBI agent, and did a very good job, Christian Bale was also great in interpreting a very fragile and yet complex character, Amy Adams was also surprisingly convincing in a erotically charged character, very unusual for her, and the promising Jennifer Lawrence seems once again really fit for psychologically frail characters.

","Never trust a movie that's having a better time than you are When New York con man Irving Rosenfeld meets his lady luck, an English accent faking Sydney Prosser, their business-honeymoon provides more excitement and pleasure for the characters than the first act of David O. Russell's GOOFELLAS clone American HUSTLE allows the audience to be part of: What's really needed is that special someone to shake things up <br/><br/>Let's first point out that, like the work of newspaper caricature artists, two leading men can be transformed into average, goofy looking slobs Christian Bale's Irving resembles a balding Sea Lion while Bradley Cooper's shifty FBI agent Richie DeMaso is a pointy gnu with an extremely bad perm And both dolts are extremely in love with Sydney Meanwhile, unlike the uglified males, Amy Adams looks better than ever.<br/><br/>After setting up and taking down Irving and Sydney's scams, ranging from fake art to business loans, the main plot involves Cooper's Richie making a deal: the couple have to turn in four lucrative con artists in order to regain freedom This labored sting involves a bogus sheik, an idealist politician and a dangerous mobster played by a surprise guest, who not so surprisingly wields the most intense scene that ends much too quickly.<br/><br/>The 1970's are brought to life in all the glorious polyester by SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK director Russell, zooming cameras in the Martin Scorsese fashion as classic rock provides an ongoing soundtrack to the tantrums and heartaches, which often distract from the pivotal cons being dealt in a whirlwind pace.<br/><br/>And while every flashy deck needs a wild card, here it's Jennifer Lawrence as the young and shallow, conniving and deliberately annoying Rosalyn, Irving's trophy wife who, like Sharon Stone's manipulative gold-digger from CASINO, is a bad luck charm thwarting the hard work earned by the real players. What's more tragic is she eventually pushes Adams who had genuine femme fatale potential into a somewhat benign backseat.<br/><br/>To give away the twists would be a crime, and to fill in the clues a sin, but ultimately HUSTLE unveils who we were subliminally rooting for and against It's too bad we didn't have more reason to love and hate these people along the way Although, for better or worse, they do take us for a ride."

","For a number of years we have had a great UK TV series on the BBC called ""The Hustle "" with good acting and great humorous story lines. I was expecting something similar with American Hustle but what I did get was OK acting and a very poor story line with little humour some of it unintentional. I was really looking forward to this film but sadly it was not to be. Was I expecting too much ? Probably. But I did love the disco dancing sequence although a hip disco in 1978 would not be playing a 1977 release with so many great new tracks being issued weekly! And the costumes really were exaggerated and made the characters look like buffoons at times. Watchable but wait till release on DVD or download ."
"RyanCShowers","Null","6","12","31 December 2013"," The Best Film of 2013
","It did not take an astronomical amount of time during my screening of American Hustle to realize I had found the best film of the 2013. American Hustle was not what I expected, but in the best way possible. Acting as almost a descendant of Goodfellas, it does not rip off the story or characters, but traces of Martin Scorsese's masterpiece can be found in the style and spirit of David O'Russell's now masterpiece. O'Russell keeps his controlled hand over the wild characters and fast-paced plot; for the crime movie it is, class seems high on the list of ""musts.""<br/><br/>The commenters of the screenplay have noted how much of a blast the screenplay is; a blast it is, but most are ignoring the intricacy of the screenplay by David O'Russell and Eric Singer. The groundwork is the twisty fraud story, which is snappy, entertaining, and full of surprises. The next layer is the character work of the five leading roles, the screenplay inflames all the characters to reveal their unique cores. The third layer details those characters each with their own object of symbolism including a comb over, a British accent, hair curlers, nail polish, and a science oven. Layer four is the screwball comedy dialogue exchanges between the characters, which drives comedic artistry out of the actors leaving the audience cheerfully laughing.<br/><br/>The most puzzling compliant about American Hustle many are holding against the film is a lack of deeper meaning. It confuses me because the deeper meaning is quite clear and abundantly there, Amy Adams and Christian Bale even have key moments of literally speaking it to the other characters. It's a story of identities, being unhappy with who you are and the different versions of ourselves we put on display as we encounter different people. We have numerous roles we must play in order to survive, whether it be for respect, love, self-worth, or community. We all do it.<br/><br/>David O'Russell's sight of his screenplay dares him to capture his film in a particular fashion. The camera acts as a silent third party in scenes of where, if the audience were a character in the movie, our eyes would be during the conversations such as focusing on hand gestures, zooming in to characters as they speak, and the length from the characters to the camera in his editing. Where our focus would be in person is where O'Russell places us in his vision where and when he wants us to see what.<br/><br/>The acting ensemble of American Hustle has been called the star of the show, collectively the five leading actors support each other through the two hours and fifteen minutes. Some have found it troubling to select one of the five as the most valuable player because all five do their homework and put the effort in. I anticipated the cast from the trailers and released clips, but I never found myself too terribly excited to see Christian Bale's work, yet he surprised me with how complete his characterization was of Irving Rosenfled. This is a trite way of describing an accomplished acting performance, but Bale warrants it here: I forgot I was watching Christian Bale, the actor, entirely.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper has made a career by unleashing the inner-asshole in himself; in American Hustle he's the ultimate shade of that character type with an added vibrancy and an immaturity of not feeling respected. Jennifer Lawrence oozes in her supporting role filling the juvenile Rosalyn with hilarity and loneliness. Someone who saw American Hustle with me commented on how unlikeable Lawrence's character is and in lesser hands it may have been more predominant, but Lawrence charms her way through her character's flaws and makes us empathize with her entirely. Jeremy Renner delivers great work as well, but with fewer money moments and less ""umph"" than his co-stars.<br/><br/>The general consensus may have trouble finding an MVP of the cast, but it was no problem for me. Though I admired everything Bale, Cooper, Lawrence, and Renner added to American Hustle, it's an understatement to say the film belongs to Amy Adams. She's proved herself to be a great talent, but Adams delivers her most accomplished work here. In the Hollywood Reporter's Actress Roundtable earlier this winter, Adams commented how miserable she was during the filming of American Hustle because she was so consumed by her character's identity, or lack-there-of. I've never seen a performance like Adams or a character like Sydney. Adams slips in and out of Sydney's faux British accent as she keeps her cards hidden from all the other characters. We never knows who her loyalties belong to. Tears swell in Adams eyes as she pathologically tells the story of her character, without divulging enough information to be completely vulnerable. It's a sensational performance.<br/><br/>""The world isn't black and white as you say, it's extremely grey,"" a line Christian Bale imparts to Bradley Cooper, another existential message that is driven by the screenplay. O'Russell exhibits his two main characters, con artists, and asks us to like them enough to follow them for rest of the story. By the end, we have not only accepted them, but love and root for them. <br/><br/>At the heart of American Hustle is a love story between Irving and Sydney, an aspect that I found to be most successful. Adams is at her most gorgeous ever, Bale is balding and fifty pounds over. Their love is not formed around physical attraction, something magical happens in the first twenty minutes and we see and feel the way they fall in love. This supports the film's stance on appearances meaning nothing. With maybe the exception of Blue is the Warmest Color, try to find two 2013 film characters more in love than Irving and Sydney."
"moviexclusive","Null","6","12","25 December 2013"," One of the best films of the year that's riotously entertaining and ceaselessly captivating thanks to an A-list cast at their best and a director at the very top of his game
","If there was yet any doubt in your mind from his previous two films 'The Fighter' and 'Silver Linings Playbook' that director David O' Russell is on a creative streak, then his latest 'American Hustle' should convince you unequivocally to put these qualms to rest. Taking an unconventional approach to the loose retelling of the Abscam scandal, a late 1970s FBI sting operation that led to bribery convictions for a U.S. senator and several members of the House, it sees Russell at his most invigorated yet, a wild and woolly ride through the dark and dizzy heart of American ambition brimming with so much unbridled verve that it is quite impossible not to get caught up in its rapture.<br/><br/>Co-written by Russell and Eric Warren Singer, it begins on a definitively offbeat note with a paunchy Christian Bale painstakingly putting together his hair with some glue, a forlorn toupee and a comb- over. Bale's transformation into the balding and bloated con man Irving Rosenfeld is a revelation in itself, one of his character reinventions that demonstrate his commitment as an actor and his astonishing ability to disappear into just about any role that he takes on. But more about Bale and the rest of the ensemble later on – what is apparent from this very opening scene is Russell's screwball exuberance to the material, which recalls both stylistically and spiritually the spirit of vintage Scorcese.<br/><br/>That sequence thrusts its viewer into the same frame with the rest of the key actors - Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams), Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper) and Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner) - whose roles in relation to Irving become clearer after Russell rewinds to recount the events leading up to that terse and tense exchange. Allowing his characters their own voices, Russell lets Irving and Sydney narrate their own individual livelihoods - the former as a con artist with a dry cleaning business on the side and the latter as a knockout stripper from New Mexico - before the pair bond at a Long Island pool party over a shared passion for Duke Ellington's ""Jeep's Blues"" as well as a mutual belief in reinventing their respective lives.<br/><br/>Making use of an alternate identity as Lady Edith Greenleigh, Sydney builds a fake loan scheme with Irving using the company guise of London Associates. Their grifting enterprise becomes so successful that they attract the attention of Richie, an ambitious FBI agent whose latest target is white collar criminals and whom arm-twists the pair into setting up a scam involving a fake sheikh (Michael Pena) to reel in some bigger fish. What follows is an increasingly elaborate - and dangerous - sting operation that calls into question their shifting personas and motivations, especially as the all-too eager Ritchie works his way up the food chain with New Jersey mayor Carmine as his prime focus and eventually unwitting pawn.<br/><br/>While the title ostensibly refers to Irving and Sydney's business, the brilliantly written script slowly peels back the layers of each and every one of its characters to reveal each as a 'hustler'. For Ritchie, that means refusing to see through the delusions of his FBI glory to recognise the good intentions of Carmine and the rest of his targets. It also is refusing to accept his hen-pecked life in a working-class home with a mother and fiancé, and finding distraction instead in his growing attraction for Sydney. And for Irving and Sydney, their hustle lies not only in their schemes but also in their personal lives, what with Irving being married to a much younger but also much more unhinged wife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence) whose young son is the apple of his eye. There are no perfect characters here, no saints or heroes or role models to look up to; rather, each in his or her own way inevitably resorts to some form of hustling in order to survive.<br/><br/>It is evident from how richly Russell sketches these characters that he loves each and every one of them, and his passion for the material is matched by the enthusiasm and creative energy that each one of his actors brings. Reflecting that perfect synergy between actor and director, Russell and his ace cast share a trust and confidence in each other that is demonstrated in the boldness with which they take to their roles. Not one of these actors is a stranger to Russell - Bale and Adams from 'The Fighter' and Cooper and Lawrence from 'Silver Linings Playbook' - and their combination sets off an explosive chemistry that counts as acting fireworks. <br/><br/>Indeed, 'American Hustle' might very well be Russell's best film that boasts a perfect balance of the director's spontaneity and control. He gives his gallery of strays, cheaters and deceivers plenty of room to roam far and wide, and yet nothing feels superfluous at any point. And in that corral, we see Bale's magnificently understated performance, one that grows in pathos and dignity as he is called upon to be the film's moral centre; we also see Adams' most versatile act yet, showing a depth in a darker and more dangerous role than she has ever played; we are also treated to Cooper at his funniest and liveliest, digging deep to unearth a maniacal side yet unseen; last but not least, a simply magnetic Lawrence who is mesmerising as ""the Picasso of passive- aggressive karate"". Exceptional performances from some of the finest actors of our generation, a director at the top of his game, and an intriguing subject that finds its relevance even today, this is one movie that belongs on your must-see list and every critic's best-of list of the year."
"bfsr81","5","4","7","3 September 2018"," Excellent cast and mediocre movie.
","I expected much more from this movie. Unfortunately it was not close to my expectations. The movie end was predictable and some of the scenes and details are not necessary at all. I didn't find anything fresh in this movie and for me some of the scenes are really annoying:
<ul><li>Jennifer Lawrence singing ""live and let die"" !!</li><li>Robert de niro talking in an Arabic that's not understood at all.</li><li>Why was Christan bale asked to gain weight or being bald? What did it add to the movie except some propaganda ?!!</li></ul> 
The acting was not bad, But I think the pace and the story were not good enough.<br/><br/>It is ok to watch it but do not expect to watch anything special."
"lindy_bop","1","4","7","26 June 2014"," Worst movie I ever tried to watch
","American Hustle was nominated for many awards so I thought this would be a good movie. In the opening it said it was based on things that could have happened. That got my hopes up that this would be a good period piece from the Disco Era. It went downhill from there. I hated the characters and found it boring. I kept hoping something would happen but the characters were so irritating I didn't care what happened to any of them. I don't think I could ever watch a movie with Amy Adams in it again, she was so irksome in this movie! Christian Bale's hair - that was stupid, not funny at all. I couldn't follow to decide: Was this supposed to be a comedy or a drama? Was there supposed to be a mystery or at least a crime in the hustle? I didn't see any suspense. After 2 hours I finally ejected the disc and watched the evening news."
"beeeen498","1","4","7","22 May 2014"," Terrible Movie
","In my life, I can say that I've watched a lot of movies. Horror, action, drama, animation and more, but never, and I mean NEVER, I was so disappointed or bored from a movie that I had to just stop watching it. The F word is being said way too often and Christian Bale mumbles most of his lines (or at least in the first 30 minutes that I suffered before I stopped watching). It's a shame, because the acting was decent, the clothing and sets were good and as I read the plot I wast very interested, but it's so poorly executed that you can skip this movie without any worries, you won't miss anything important. Let's just hope that the next Hollywood movie that stacked with great actors won't be that bad."
"SirBreeze","7","4","7","8 February 2014"," And the Oscar goes to...cleavage
","It would be unfair that the only reason for so many Oscar nominations for this movie are the cleavages and the mere names of the cast. This movie is very watchable, good fun and gives you a thought or two. But not much more than that.<br/><br/>It's the classic switcheroo – con artists get conned and then manage to up-con their rivals. Even though the movie is based on real events, there's not too much else to say about the plot. The cast however deserves a mention and Christian Bale in yet another of his body transformations is definitely the lead man. He does a good job and gives his character depth, even makes us feel for the guy. For a man so inclined to overacting, he's quite subdued.<br/><br/>But Bradley Cooper makes up for that: he's the overacting throughout the movie and succeeds in making the FBI agent the sleaziest character in a movie about con artists, politicians and mobsters. Quite an achievement, really.<br/><br/>Amy Adams' character motivation seems to have been: cleavage. I'm aware it's in line with the character, with the character's line of work where showing skin is meant to put off the guy on the other side of the table, but I can't shake the feeling it somehow took away from arguably the most interesting, the most layered character in the movie.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence is on the other hand the most annoying character and I guess that's an indicator she did a good job – but definitely not award material. Louis CK was brilliant, who would've thought he can actually act? De Niro plays a mobster, which means he was good.<br/><br/>Jeremy Renner deserves a mention. Very convincing performance of the loser in the bunch, a sincere character who navigates through this story about the shades of grey.<br/><br/>That's actually what the movie is about: it's another confirmation that the world is just shade upon shade upon shade of grey, and there's much more than fifty of them. David O. Russell conveys it in a light-hearted way, with nice period costumes and a great soundtrack, and, it gives you a thought or two, but not much more.<br/><br/>Is this Oscar material? No way. Is it good Hollywood fun and should you watch it? Absolutely. I'm being benevolent and giving it a 7 even though it more deserves a 6.5, but definitely not a 6, though."
"kamillafitos","7","4","7","8 February 2014"," A Good Movie to Watch Once
","To tell you the truth, I only went to watch this movie in the cinemas because Jennifer Lawrence is my favourite actress, but I had doubts, if this film would be good, because usually films which have to many good actors in it end up being not so good at all. But this film wasn't so bad at all. It started out a bit boring, but by then end I couldn't wait what the end will be. All in all it was a very interesting film with quite a few sexual content but not too many to be rated plus. I haven't seen any other Christian Bale films, but I think I will watch more from now on, because he did a good job in this film. I've seen like three-four films from Amy Adams, but so far I've only seen her play the good girl, so this was a surprise from her. I think Bradley Cooper's and Jennifer Lawrence's character was sort of like what they always play, but they didn't act badly. Jennifer actually made me laugh a few times, I think she sort of lit up the movie. I admit i didn't look through the cast too closely this time, because when Robert DeNiro appeared in the middle of the film I was quite surprised, but after all his character was quite typical too. To sum up, it's a good movie to watch once, especially if you like these actors. It isn't bad, but isn't the best film I've ever seen either."
"NamiCFC","8","4","7","27 January 2014"," Good movie but not a great
","I went into this movie with great expectations because, well just have a look at the cast and you expect nothing but greatness. At the end of it, I was more or less satisfied but I couldn't help but feel that this movie could have been much greater. However the cast were all terrific in their own roles, with Jennifer Lawrence being the standout performer in spite of probably having one of the lesser central roles in the plot. Both Christian Bale and Bradley Cooper were solid and Amy Adams was lovely as always. These great performance were mainly the reason I rated this movie above average because they were certainly a joy to watch. I liked the plot, twist within twist with a whole lot of mini-twists here and there and it did allow all characters to develop to a certain extent. However in my opinion, it was at times a little too complex for its own good. Don't get me wrong, I like a movie with a deep plot that doesn't give everything away to the viewer straight away. Even then, American did seem to lose to me for brief periods here and there, in spite of me trying to pay a great deal of attention to the movie. A great example of a similar type movie is Sting, which keeps twisting you around till the last minute without actually over complicating things. At the end of the day, I'd say American Hustle is a good movie and is definitely worth a watch but it could have easily been much bigger with a little tempo injected in some parts and a more direct approach in some other parts."
"Prismark10","6","4","7","6 January 2014"," Going for the big one
","American Hustle is one of the best acted films in a long time. Christian Bale, Amy Adams, Jennifer Lawrence, Jeremy Renner and Bradley Cooper are all excellent. Also Robert De Niro makes an uncredited cameo as a mobster in flashbacks that makes you think the scenes were lifted out from Goodfellas.<br/><br/>The film is a black comedy-drama set in the late 1970's period revolving around the the true life Abscam scandal, where FBI agents and con artists joined up to frame politicians for taking money 'to help grease palms.'<br/><br/>It focuses on Bale as an out of shape hustler with bad hair and Amy Adams his soul mate who passes off as an English Aristocrat. They both have been making big money in a scam where they dupe arrangement fees for loans that never materialise.<br/><br/>Cooper is the FBI agent with big ambitions and a big ego who wants to go after a bigger catch and more by accident has the mafia in his sights.<br/><br/>In the mix is Bale's wayward wife (Lawrence) and stepson. A Mayor of New Jersey (Renner) with a big heart and charisma who has been caught up in the sting operation which Bale feels very guilty about.<br/><br/>Directed by David O Russell who has worked with many of the cast before, this is an interesting take on con men and law men.<br/><br/>However the film feels flabby, it has plenty of narration which is essentially exposition. The film needed to be leaner, more playful and sharper, the humour is sporadic.<br/><br/>You quickly get a good idea that given some of the crooks are shown to be very nice that it is Cooper that might be the one who ends up being the mark. He is arrogant and can be boorish. (Cooper at one point beats up his superior officer who constantly tells him to be careful.)<br/><br/>The movie has sassiness from its female leads, quirkiness from Bale and Renner. With De Niro's steely gaze it should had been better than the final product."
"cubsckc","8","8","18","20 December 2013"," Good Watch
","Overall, good movie. Honorable mentions to Christian Bale and Jennifer Lawrence. They did a fantastic job with the props as well as acting (everybody). The story itself was pretty descent up to the resolution in my opinion. I had a problem with the overall ending and thought it was unrealistic, but thats my take. I think it still is a pretty good watch for the big screen and I would not be surprised if any of the actors win academy awards for their performance. The movie was enriched with a good plot. I thought that the way that corruption is played was very realistic in that sense. The movie also had shades of grey that depict how fighting against crime isn't as black and white as many of the gangster movies have tried to do. But this movie definitely makes you feel for all of the characters at some point."
"alex-d94","9","5","10","8 March 2014"," Be hustled. It's worth to
","The adjective ""American"" appended to a ward in a movie title usually implies something with instant design-classic status with a good dose of irony and modernity. So in this ""American Hustle"" David O.Russell has really done it. For starters the unreliable narration and urgent zooms, the 1970s milieu of flashily dressed scammers and mobsters, the carefully chosen songs underscoring key emotional moments; It's all just there! But unlike Scorcese, Russell infuses them with his unique brand of insanity. Russell is obviously fond of characters on the brink of imploding or exploding and with ""American Hustle"" he's assembled his own posse of stars from his last two films as his personal acting troupe:Christian Bale and Amy Adams from 2011's ""The fighter"" and Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence from ""Silver Linings Playbook"".Russell's latest is based on the Abscam sting operation of the late 70's in which a con artist helped the FBI catch members of Congress taking brides. ""Some of this actually happened"" a title card warn us at the film's start, and then Russell introduces us to Irving Rosenfeld a con artist and an either paunchy version of Bale. To play this swaggering Rosenfeld,the owner of a small chain of Long Island dry cleaners who makes his real money through fake art and fraudulent personal loans, Bale seemingly downed all the food he denied while shooting ""The Machinist"" and ""Rescue Dawn"". He meets his partner Adam's Sydney Posser, a young beautiful woman attracted to his monument of calm and confidence.While Sydney kicks Rosenfield's cons in high gear, the in love and crime partners are forced to work for an FBI agent Richie DiMaso who's confidence and arrogance lead them straight to world of mafia and gangsters which is as dangerous as enchanting. In this messy situation which also affects the good friend and idealist political of Irv's, it's the unpredictable (and dimmer to a few of us) wife of Irv's who could be the one to pull the thread that brings the whole world of Irv's falling apart.The film is probably a tad overlong, but it's a blast to hang out with these people, and Russell creates such an infectiously zany vibe around them that if even you notice the running time, you probably won't mind. For all its brashness and big personality, ""American Hustle"" is a character study at its core—an exploration of dissatisfaction and drive, and the lengths to which we're willing to go for that elusive thing known as a better life."
"jadepietro","10","5","10","1 January 2014"," Game On!
","This film is highly recommended.<br/><br/>The comb-over, that not-so-subtle way of camouflaging your own flaws so that others might see you in a different light. Perhaps, it's just a self-fulfilling prophecy, a means of vanity over delusion, a fight against the helplessness of aging. Literally, it's all a slight of hand, a desperate attempt at concealing the obvious truth and garnering personal acceptance at any cost. This startling opening image, that of a con man named Irving Rosenfeld (a portly Christian Bale) preening before a mirror, begins American Hustle, David O. Russell's dramedy about grifters and their schemes to get what they want.<br/><br/>Even before this clever opening shot, American Hustle begins with the following disclaimer: Some of this actually happened. This title card zeroes in on the perfect comic tone for the film and the Abscam sting operation of the late 1970's becomes Russell's inspiration. The film uses fictitious characters to show the ongoing corruption of governmental leaders during that era. And characters they are, fully realized and played for our utmost farcical enjoyment!<br/><br/>The film's characters are of the Guys and Dolls variety, a screwball assortment of Runyonesque endearing quirks and lowlife mobster stereotypes. Besides Irving, the mastermind of the scam, we also meet Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams) Irving's sexy and cunning moll and mistress, their target, Carmine Politio (Jeremy Renner), all swagger pompadour and good intentions as an ambitious New Jersey mayor, Rosalyn Rosenfeld (Jennifer Lawrence), Irving's trophy wife (if the trophy in question is Best Dimwit of 1978), a modern reworking of the Miss Adelaine type of gal, and FBI agent, Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper), a vain and obsessively slick operator out to get them all.<br/><br/>The ensemble is wonderful. Bale literally carries the weight of the film and creates a complex character driven by greed and his need for living the high life. Cooper energizes the film with a fervor of zealousness and brashness that sets all the antics in motion. Renner plays his character as a sincere dolt wanting his share of fame and glory with an exacting ineptitude. This male trio play off each other so very well. But it is their female counterparts that spin the film into the comic and strangely tragic stratosphere. With her many accents and characterizations, Adams' Sydney conveys a full range of emotions from her street smart petty criminal to the elegant and sophisticated Lady Edith. Lawrence's Rosalyn is a wonderful ditz, a floozy who is quick to react without realizing the consequences from her words or deeds. She steals every scene she's in. (The film's high point is when these two actresses have a memorable altercation in the ladies room about their role in Irving's life.) Strong support by Louis C.K., Michael Pena, Jack Huston, Alessandro Nivola, Shea Whigham, and Elisabeth Rohm round out this perfect cast.<br/><br/>Russell's script, co-written with Eric Singer, is a throwback to the quick banter of the Hollywood screwball comedies of the 40's. The dialog is quick-witted and sly, even if the situation causes more serious repercussions for all those involved. The direction is concise and detailed, from his larger-than-life characters down to the polyester period costumes and 70's pop music soundtrack. Russell's production team outdoes themselves with special mention going to costume designer Michael Wilkinson, the fine art direction of Jesse Rosenthal, and Linus Sandgren's fluid cinematography.<br/><br/>American Hustle is a delightful con game that keeps the movie-going audience guessing right up until the film reaches its foregone conclusion. Russell has added yet another fine film to his impressive resume that already includes: Three Kings, The Fighter, Silver Linings Playbook and I Heart Hucklebees (well, let's not include the latter). American Hustle may will be this prolific director's best work to date. It certainly is one of the best movies of 2013.

"ClaytonDavis","Null","8","19","15 December 2013"," 'Hustle' for the performances but little else...
","The stars seemed aligned for David O. Russell's highly anticipated American Hustle in which assembles some of Hollywood's most sought-after talent that includes Oscar-winners Christian Bale and Jennifer Lawrence along with Oscar-nominees Amy Adams, Bradley Cooper, and Jeremy Renner. He teams up with scribe Eric Singer, whose only feature writing credit is Tom Tykwer's The International, and based on the popularity of last year's Silver Linings Playbook, this was suppose to be Russell's masterpiece. Sad to report that the final product is an anti- metamorphosis of filmmaking that prohibits any consistency for the viewer to relish. What remains intact and palpable are the outstanding performances by the cast that Russell put together. All of them are dedicated to their roles, even when development and direction are lacking, and they truck through much of the narrative successfully.<br/><br/>One of the largest areas of opportunities is the script composed by Singer and Russell. Despite scene-chewing performances from our principal actors, an absence of insight and cohesiveness, along with an irregularity of interesting dialogue plagues this once promising Oscar hopeful. In the first twenty minutes of the film's opening, I said to myself, ""this is going to be my favorite film of the year."" When the film ventures off into back stories and character origins, it plays like a parody of Paul Thomas Anderson's Boogie Nights, lacking any emotional connection. The film isn't overtly dreadful or horrendous by any stretch, just mostly disappointing. All the pieces are there, they just didn't take the time to make sure they all fit. It's confusing in tone, though very funny at times, especially coming from Cooper and Lawrence, but by the end, Russell feels he's warranted an emotional reaction from the audience when he's done anything but.<br/><br/>Christian Bale is terrific, magnified in charisma while still keeping mostly all his ticks and mannerisms he's created for Irving in perspective. His work is also an impressive counterpoint to his other well-executed performance in Out of the Furnace. Bale proves once again that he's one of this generation's most gifted actors. Not only in the way he packs on the pounds, or rocks a comb-over better than any wannabe gangster I've encountered on the streets of Little Italy; he's the one performer that has a character that goes through an authentic evolution that's believable.<br/><br/>As the spunky and crude wife of Irving, Jennifer Lawrence gets the biggest laughs and commands the most attention from the viewer. Better than she was in last year's overly praised turn in Silver Linings Playbook, for which she won the Oscar for Best Actress, this is a role that suits her well, both for her range as an actress and what she excels in with her fiery demeanor. I'm still a bit unsure about how old Rosalyn was suppose to be (that may be a fault of these directors thinking she's old enough to play these older women). Lawrence owns her role and has enough naughty sex-appeal and delivery to land herself an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress. I'd argue if she hadn't JUST won last year, she would be a formidable threat to win. Probably a more appropriate representation for her acting arsenal.<br/><br/>I have fallen hard for the abilities of Bradley Cooper following his role as Pat in Russell's Playbook. Subsequently, the 38-year-old actor has sought dynamic and challenging roles that you can tell he finds exciting and prolific in its nature and candor. His turn in The Place Beyond the Pines earlier this year proved that notion and in American Hustle, Cooper is simply dazzling. Delivering the best performance of the cast, Cooper nails moment after moment, infusing his strict and intense line delivery while having impeccable comedic timing. One sequence in which he imitates the great Louie C.K., who plays one of Richie's frazzled superiors, engulfed the movie theater in non-stop laughter.<br/><br/>The actor I feel the most for is the talented and beautiful Amy Adams. If the script was more developed on a writing level, this role could have been the performance of the year. Adams is given an opportunity to enrich herself in a woman, full of layers, that prevent her from losing sight of her own identity. However, being short-changed as her character builds, leaves the audience unsatisfied with where she ends. On a pure performance level, Adams is top-notch, conveying one of her strongest turns yet. I wished more for her but ultimately was let down.<br/><br/>David O. Russell used to be able to excite, in the way that Quentin Tarantino would when ventured off into a new realm of his imagination. His 2010 film The Fighter was his most ambitious outing and I've waited, patiently mind you, to see when he top that endeavor. I'll always award his efforts as a writer. I Heart Huckabees, Three Kings, and Silver Linings Playbook succeed mostly on the merits of his storytelling ability. American Hustle levels out a lot of the time, enabling the viewer to connect and engage the world convincingly. There are other times though, where honestly, I almost fell asleep. Even when Russell demonstrates uneven filmmaking, I've remained bound to the story. This is the first time I found myself bored, especially in scenes involving Jeremy Renner, who I adore.<br/><br/>Read more @ AwardsCircuit.com"

This movie has everything. <br/><br/>Plot: I've read some of these reviews and they all say ""no plot"". That is untrue, I do not understand the argument. The story stars off in the future with a business transaction happening. Then it explains everything, how Irving and Sydney started their conning, get caught, and then forced to start catching and arresting con-artists. The characters get tangled up with the mafia and go on an entertaining roller-coaster the whole film.<br/><br/>Cast: What a stunning cast. Stunning. Christian Bale gives is best performance since The Fighter and plays such a great character. Amy Adams is great as his partner. Cooper is also good as the detective, Richie Dimaso. Jennifer Lawrence gives her best performance which should have won her the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress, which Lupita N'yongo won for. Jeremy Renner as the mayor is great, too. The cast is amazing and even the small roles are acted nicely.<br/><br/>This is David O. Russell's best movie. The writing is great and the directing is amazing.

This isn't a awful movie, but it's a snooze fest of a movie with actors and actresses playing childish and immature characters. Although the characters are suppose to be professionals. Now I have seen these types of movies before such as in Coen brothers films, Woody Allen films and etc. But in this, it just isn't done well and just doesn't have any of those clever or witty moments. Some critics seem to go on about how good the dialogues are, I personally can't remember a single one. I give this movie a 4.5/10 mainly because the ending is at least tied in well.<br/><br/>4.5/10"

"cycledelics","2","3","5","14 April 2014"," Snooze alarm! Grossly overdone.
","Sorry, I found this movie to be an overproduced yet under-edited mess. It presents a frantically-fast, mumbling, babbling gibberish dialogue with a painfully predictable, tortoise-speed plot. It's a real ordeal to watch without fast-forwarding the remote. In addition, the annoying, relentless sleazing of Amy Adams -- who is far from being a beauty or sex siren by Hollywood standards -- is puzzling after awhile. And did anyone really care about the neurotic relationship subplots that were so prominent, yet played little part in the outcome? Finally, the relentless infusing period pop music was so relentless and interfered with hearing the dialogue, placing a exclamation point to seal its grossly overdone rap. Why -- to what, keep reminding viewers of the time period as if we suffer from dementia or to wake us up as it dragged on?"
"LeonardKniffel","2","3","5","23 March 2014"," Boring and pointless
","I did not expect to be as bored and impatient as I was while watching this movie, but it lacks just about everything that makes a movie interesting to me. Full of insipid dialog and meandering movement, the movie just drags. Bad people doing bad things is really dull unless the director can give us a reason to watch. Amy Adams can act, for sure, but making her parade around in silly dresses displaying her boobs all the time seemed so pointless. Maybe the performances of the actors was supposed to make up for the lack of a compelling script? They didn't. I found myself asking repeatedly, ""Who's zoomin' who?"" and trying hard to follow the deceptions but ultimately asking myself, ""Who cares?"" It is also baffling to try to understand why the director chose to set the film in the time period he did. Often, this decision seems to leave the tone-setting to whatever old tunes happen to be chosen, making them more interesting than the conversations they are supposed to inform."
"gazivoda_people","10","3","5","15 February 2014"," Great piece of art - the promo ruined it
","Before I start writing about how much I love this movie, let me criticize on thing: The movie was advertised as an entertaining movie for everybody. Unfortunately, this is not the case. The movie cares more about the needs of the actors themselves, than the viewers. There is no typical story arc. I was shocked as I saw all the advertisement, because I could not believe that David O. Russell made a movie that meets everyone's needs. And it does not.<br/><br/>Now let me make clear why I ADORE this movie:<br/><br/>1.) THE ACTORS! I can't understand anyone who says that Jennifer Lawrence sucks in this movie and that her performance is totally overrated. In her 20 minutes screen time she shows a bunch of emotions, and what is really important: She built a character. She made her character become real, and this is what I call great acting. In addition, she really dominates the screen, as soon as she appears. All in all, I think she made an astonishing performance and I prefer it over Lupita Nyong'o's. (Just in order to refer a little bit to the Oscars) Then, Bradley Cooper was really amazing! Again, he really built a character. A loser, who thinks that he's the big boss. He drives his performance in so many directions. He is funny and somehow heartwarming. In the other second he becomes this reckless and crazy wannabe. Amy Adams and Bale did a similarly great job and complete this perfect cast. The actors truly are the heart of this movie.<br/><br/>2.) The screenplay. I think it seems so authentic, funny and dramatic. Maybe not that good as in Silver Linings Playbook, but absolutely great!<br/><br/>3.) The atmosphere. I left the cinema with a big smile on my face. You get this naughty feeling while watching it, and it simply makes you feel good; as we are used to, when watching David O. Russell movies.<br/><br/>All in all, I can say that this an unique and remarkable movie, that makes me feel good and that lives from its actors. If you are looking for entertainment with a structured plot, I would recommend ""Wolf of Wall Street"". Otherwise dive into the world of 4 losers, who all think they're big deals!"
"Robert_duder","6","3","5","12 February 2014"," Average at best, but what I expected for certain
","I was very, very sceptical about American Hustle. It seems to me that every year there is one of these films that critics love, there is all kinds of buzz about and it nails a whole bunch of Oscar nominations. I knew from the trailers exactly what I would think of this. I expected something very ""Argo"" like which was okay but the furthest thing from what I thought was a ""Best Picture"" contender. Well I was entirely right in my initial expectations...sort of. At the half way mark of American Hustle I was actually quite impressed. It was a little bit artsy and bizarre and the cast of characters are way out there and in your face but it was entertaining me for sure. It was just weird enough that it still had me watching intently. Then it continued...and continued...and continued and had to keep pushing itself further and further until the pacing was nearly excruciating and any redeemable performances were ruined by pushing the characters too far. What is left by the end is a very different sort of crime thriller about a group of characters that are diverse and strange and ridiculous (in a mostly good way.) This film was made to appeal to critics and the Academy and it accomplished that so who am I to bash it.<br/><br/>The cast is definitely an ensemble cast and impresses as much as it does takes it too far. Do I agree with the main cast getting Oscar nominations? No not really. I don't see anything particularly moving or unique about any of the performances. They are certainly over the top, perhaps satirical (I hope so for their sake) and often ridiculous but they work for the context of the movie. Christian Bale absolutely transforms himself into a fast talking con-man with a terrible comb-over and huge pot belly. He is probably the best of the cast and gives the least silly performance though he does have some outrageous moments too. Amy Adams is sort of landing on my more annoying than appreciated list. She shows up so much lately and I just don't find her ""that"" good. She was actually decent in this and her and Bale have good chemistry. I don't feel as though she particularly takes off in the role but she definitely does a good job. Bradley Cooper is absolutely over the top, ridiculous and incredibly whiny as the FBI man determined to catch his big break. I don't mean to say he isn't good in the role because I think the character was meant to be ridiculous and whiny. Still he got really irritating by the end of the film and I was simply tired of his character and that's not a good sign for a movie. Jennifer Lawrence, as she always is, was a shining beacon in this film. She has a small role comparably to everyone else but its a terrific, sarcastic, biting role that was simply fun. She really is stunning when she's on screen. Jeremy Renner was also pretty good in a smaller supporting role. I'm not a huge fan of his either but he was sparingly used in this and yet his character was vital to the big picture and he didn't get in the way of the story. Michael Peña and Louis C.K. deserve mention as well in very small almost cameo level roles. Speaking of cameos, watch for a barely recognizable and uncredited Robert DeNiro immediately upping the ante in a small cameo role that was fun.<br/><br/>The movie wasn't a bad movie. It was an okay movie. Perhaps if it wasn't getting SO much critical acclaim and Oscar nominations I would go easier on it but because so many love it I have to pick it a part even more. David O. Russell is sort of hit and miss for me. He's a very talented writer and director and I have enjoyed some of his stuff but then every once in awhile I find him just too forcefully artsy for me. Its like he goes out of his way to appeal to critics and I can't respect that. I feel like movies are for the general audiences and for entertainment and if you're specifically trying to appeal to critics then shame on you. American Hustle feels like one of those movies. How exactly does Amy Adams sitting on a toilet and randomly screaming into the air make sense? Or the gratuitous and pointless lust filled scenes with Cooper and Adams? It doesn't play into the story that very successfully sets itself up for a great crime thriller in the first half and then is reduced to a silly, satire by the second part. Amongst a TON of very worthy competitors, American Hustle should be way down the list of potential winners in my book. Its worth seeing but honestly I won't even remember I watched it by tomorrow. It was all around average at best. 6/10"
"HarryBeavers","Null","3","5","8 February 2014"," What An Overrated Load This Is
","I couldn't help but cringe through much of the film. That's how embarrassed I was that many people seem to think this is some sort of great film, lmao! I really find it hard to believe. Bradley Cooper was flat out terrible, and the plot itself mostly seemed like an unimportant backdrop. If this is top notch character driven film, then I'm a flying donkey from Venus. Not sure who liked this film, but most of the people leaving the theater when I went, didn't seem to think it was worth anywhere near the hype this very average film has been given. Why don't you delusional hypesters go stick your head in a bag of reality, mixed with doggie doo?"
"Kicino","8","3","5","3 February 2014"," Great character development, interesting plots and witty lines based on true events
","I love movies based on true events. American Hustle is more than that as it is also filled with character development revolving around interesting plots and witty lines. What's more, it leads us to question our basic assumptions in addition to bringing us black humor. I highly recommend this thought provoking comedy.<br/><br/>The main characters are not lovable but they are all fun to watch and brilliantly portrayed by the excellent cast. The plot is basically some schemes in the 70s and the FBI arrested two cons and used them to attract more cons in politics.<br/><br/>Christian Bale put on 40 pounds to play Irving Rosenfeld, an experienced but unattractive con since his childhood. Irving meets smart and sexy Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams) at a party and decides to team up as partners, in business and in private.<br/><br/>But Irving actually has a passive-aggressive wife Rosalyn Rosenfeld (Jennifer Lawrence) with a son whom he cannot leave. Rosalyn, though self-proclaimed socially handicapped, effortlessly becomes the center of attention in any social gatherings. When suspicious Rosalyn overhears Irving's phone conversation with Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper), she invents many stories in her head which ultimately affected everyone's fate.<br/><br/>Because Richie is a neurotic and impatient FBI agent who tries to leverage on Irving and Sydney's con skills, even though it means ridiculing his supervisor. Dragging into the scene is New Jersey Mayor Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner) whom is set up to lure more congressmen into a trick involving the mafia although he, a happily married politician, has been working very hard for his community.<br/><br/>Dotted along are some hit songs from the 70s which make the whole experience so nostalgic. Full of surprises in cast, lines and plots, American Hustle is very entertaining to watch and urges you to question your normal logic, making you more critical in interpreting the news and whatever that is happening around. Totally pleasant to watch."
"burger1124","7","3","5","31 January 2014"," Not Perfect, But a Lot of Fun
","If you took the wittiest and most entertaining parts of Ben Affleck's Argo and amped them up to Monty Python levels of farce, you'd get the basic feel of David O. Russell's American Hustle. With all the controversy surrounding Hustle's Golden Globe nomination for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy, I walked in expecting an out-and-out drama. But a comedy it is, and a darn funny one, at that. It's practically a throwback to Preston Sturges, in that the plot doesn't really matter; it overlaps, contradicts itself, and loops back around in a glorious mess. <br/><br/>Christian Bale is absolutely dynamite as overweight con man Irving Rosenfeld, who is introduced to us in a lengthy scene wherein he combs his hair. Well, combs is an understatement for the elaborate comb-over and toupee patchwork that sits atop his head. It's a brilliant introduction to a small-time con, a sleazy character in a movie brimming with them.<br/><br/>While Rosenfeld and his assistant/mistress Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams in her best role to date) may be sleazy, they certainly aren't stupid. They are successful in their line of work, which happens to involve duping desperate people into giving them $5,000 to secure a nonexistent $50,000 loan. When the lovebirds are picked up by hotshot FBI Agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper, playing dumb quite well), they become embroiled in a series of stings in exchange for their own immunity. DiMaso is a man who wants to wield power he doesn't possess. He is only intimidating because his lack of foresight makes him volatile. He is three steps behind everyone else, and he realizes it.<br/><br/>The first thing you will notice about American Hustle, except for maybe how well-done the period details are, is the caliber of the acting. Bale and Adams rise above the rest, but the performances are strong all around. Jennifer Lawrence, as Rosenfeld's kooky younger wife, shows up here and there to throw a wrench into every plan. She holds her own, though I am still not sold on her playing older than she really is: Lawrence is 23, and she shows it. She is gifted at improvising, but against world-class acting from the likes of Bale and Cooper, her portrayal seems more like a pretty mask worn by Katniss Everdeen than a lived-in character courtesy of an Oscar-winner. <br/><br/>Jeremy Renner is superb as the target of DiMaso's operation, New Jersey mayor Carmine Polito. In Renner's hands, we see no ulterior motives lurking beneath the surface: Polito is a genuine guy who really wants to see his city take a turn for the better amidst the crime and violence of the 1970s. He is aware that he must deal with unsavory characters to get things done, but isn't interested in skimming off the top. In DiMaso's eyes, though, it's enough to be called corrupt.<br/><br/>This is certainly Russell's most entertaining film in years, although his penchant to let the actors improvise gets a bit out of hand. There are many instances where it becomes clear that the actors are off- script, and such transparent improve tends to pull the viewer out of the film. Still, American Hustle is hugely enjoyable, a very funny and often very tense story that crosses elements from GoodFellas and The Informant in the best imaginable ways."

Great job with wardrobe, hair, make-up etc. I also thought the performances were very good, especially Bale and Amy Adams. The problem with this movie was the story. It just didn't move. It seemed that from the beginning, they were sure to point out that this was not supposed to be a true telling of the Abscam scandal. It starts with a line saying, ""Some of this actually happened."" A clever way of telling us that ""we embellished the story a lot"". Great, they can get creative. The problem is, you didn't feel like you were getting a history lesson, but you also didn't get an entertaining story. It was too slow, too long."

Great actors...perhaps given too much room to improvise...loads of meandering scenes. Perhaps with a tighter script and focused direction it may have capitalized on it's promise.It's as though the director thought if he put a bunch of talented actors in front of the screen, put in some popular songs and plenty of cleavage, he would produce something entertaining. I found myself fidgeting and shuffling about in my seat, trying not to fall asleep. Not to sound prudish ,but, what's with the cleavage? I know it's the 70s..but, seriously...overkill!. Close ups and make-up (or lack of) made beautiful women look hideous. Definitely the most overrated movie I have seen in a while.

"TimMeade","9","10","27","12 December 2013"," American Hustle is a grand success at nearly every level
","The 'based on a true story' we so often see at the beginning of a film has been a recurring Bête Noire of mine for some considerable time. I have argued before that the licence it gives to film-makers is open to the widest interpretation. It is a specious use of language. It allows writer and director to re-frame events, dissemble, misrepresent people, and, if challenged on points of veracity, hide behind the fact that it was never claimed to be a truthful recall.<br/><br/>The Butler was one of the biggest culprits in 2013. This film was based on THE true story rather than A true story - whatever the difference of the definite article might imply. The only problem was that most of the major events portrayed in the life of Cecil Gaines never happened – his mother's rape; his father's murder; his son in the Black Panthers; his son killed on active service in Vietnam. All poppycock.<br/><br/>So David O. Russell's wonderful American Hustle had me on-side from the outset with its tongue in cheek advice at the film's beginning that 'Some of this actually happened'.<br/><br/>Set in the 1970s, Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale) is a con man skilled at depriving the needy from cash they can ill afford to lose. Not wishing to restrict his activities to the lower socio-economic demograph, he sells forged art works to the well-heeled as a lucrative sideline. Joining him in these activities is the seductive erstwhile stripper, Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams), who poses as a royalty-connected member of the British aristocracy to give the operation some class. Their ill-gotten trade is broken by federal agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper) who then turns the couple in order to ensnare corrupt politicians on the take whom he wishes to expose and incarcerate in furtherance of his career. DiMaso's inordinate ambition is hampered only by his lack of tactical nous as he has to rely ever more on the wily Rosenfeld.<br/><br/>American Hustle is a grand success at nearly every level.<br/><br/>The ensemble cast appears to be without a weakness: Christian Bale, with a heavy paunch and comical comb-over, always suggests that he is far more in control then he is letting on; Amy Adams, about whom I was scathing as the demure Lois Lane in Man of Steel, is pitch perfect as the cleavage-showing Siren oozing sex appeal – her ability to separate salivating men from their dollars was all too believable; Bradley Cooper with another comical hairstyle, this time a tight-knit perm, clearly enjoyed his role as the obsessive and flawed FBI man; Jeremy Renner as the well-meaning Mayor, Carmine Polito, (collateral damage in Cooper's crusade) came across as an oily and cheesy lounge singer as a reminder of an era before professional spin doctors homogenised the political class; Jennifer Lawrence as Bale's trailer trash and manipulative wife, aware of the lien she holds over her estranged husband, gave a fantastic performance of tragic comedy. An uncredited cameo from Robert De Niro exuding septuagenarian menace was the cake icing.<br/><br/>Direction from David O. Russell was consistently fast-paced with no lulls in its 138 minutes and without ever being confusing. The cinematography and editing were first rate.<br/><br/>It would be nit-picking to mention that the excellent 70s soundtrack was occasionally just a little overblown.<br/><br/>But what raises American Hustle well over the bar is its screenplay from David O. Russell and Eric Warren Singer. Humorous throughout, the film has several laugh out loud moments while also delivering both dramatic impact and thought provoking concepts. As Christian Bale becomes ever more ambivalent about what he is being forced to do, he very deftly leads the audience to share his growing but tacit realisation that sometimes an end can very much justify the means. That the film is bound to have a final twist is never in doubt. If, when it comes, it is not totally innovative or unsurprising, quite frankly – who cares? <br/><br/>The producers of American Hustle can start hiring the limos for Oscar night."
"bob-the-movie-man","9","4","8","7 January 2014"," A superior film - glossy, beautifully acted and with a great script
","As director David O Russell how to you follow the critical and financial success of Silver Linings Playbook? The answer is with American Hustle, and boy - what a double bill that is! American Hustle is set in the late 70's - big hair, loud clothes and a disco beat. Bradley Cooper plays Richie DiMaso, a maverick FBI agent stressing-out his more mainstream boss but impressing his ambitious director with his wildly optimistic plans. He recruits (read 'frames') small time con artists Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale) and his girlfriend Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams) to run an entrapment scam to catch local mayor and family man Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner) who has been righteously greasing a few too many wheels in his ambitious bid to re-build Atlantic City as a Vegas of the east. A simple FBI playbook (you could even say it was silver lined?) but one that comes under ever-increasing stress due to too key factors: firstly, DiMaso's wild ambitions that starts to encircle not just low-level shysters but increasingly higher levels of federal and mafia targets; and secondly Rosenfeld's unstable and unreliable wife Rosalyn, played by Jennifer Lawrence.<br/><br/>Where does this film succeed? Well, first and foremost the original screenplay by Eric Singer and David O Russell just drips quality with every line like a beef joint oozing juices. The opening title card says ""Some of this actually happened"" but the truth, as much as it was true, has been skilfully extended and embellished by the writers. This must surely be a shoe-in for a screenplay Oscar nomination, and will be in my predictions for the award.<br/><br/>Secondly, the performances are just top notch. Christian Bale has never looked less like Bruce Wayne. Piling on the pounds and having the dodgiest combover since my Dad, his opening scene is just brilliant. Then Amy Adams (Man of Steel, Enchanted) wades in with such sass and style that you are mesmerised as you watch Adams and Bale bounce off each other. Nowhere is the acting better than when Bale encounters the most senior mafia head: played as a cameo (brilliantly) by someone you'd fully expect to play that role (no - not Joe Pesci). Bale's terror at realising the depth of water he is in is brilliantly portrayed and your mouth turns as dry as his no doubt is.<br/><br/>In a supporting role, Jennifer Lawrence makes her first appearance and you think ""yeah, she'll probably get a best supporting actress Oscar nod by default"" - she is 'flavour of the year' after all. But that is before her performance really kicks in in the second half of the film - - and suddenly you realise you are in the midst of something really special here. Seeing her clean her kitchen in yellow Marigolds belting out ""Live and Let Die"" after stitching up her cheating husband is a sight to behold. Surely this WILL be another Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination, and never more deserved.<br/><br/>Jeremy Renner also impresses in a more understated role, but with a never less than impressive performance at the film's denouement.<br/><br/>I haven't mentioned pretty-boy Bradley Cooper yet. Although he has some great scenes (for instance, when cruelly mocking his morose boss during a victory celebration), overall I was never as completely convinced by his performance in the film as his in his role in Silver Linings Playbook. Perhaps he was trying a bit too hard.<br/><br/>Finally the music is great: Danny Elfman does the soundtrack, but the smash hits of the 70's, including Elton John, Wings and the Bee Gees carry the story along with verve and vigour.<br/><br/>Where does the film falter? Well - hardly at all in my view. Perhaps Irving and Sydney's altruistic tendencies at the end of the film - given their sociopathic and immoral roots at the film's start - seem a story step too far. But overall this is a glossy and deeply involving story that is my best film so far in 2014. I appreciate that on January 6th, that's not saying much! But I fear I might need to wade through a good few dark auditoria this year before I find a film that surpasses this one. Go see it!"

","I was lucky enough to be able to see American Hustle, twice in theatres and each viewing made me like and appreciate the film even more. Because there is often so much going on in this film, I feel that most people would probably do better with a second viewing as I did, as I understood things better, picked up on more things and also appreciated the sense of humour the film has as well as ultimately enjoying it a lot more than on my first viewing. I still liked the film the first time I saw it, but after a second viewing I can safely say that it was one of my favourite films of 2013. In the wrong hands this film could have been your average Hollywood type grifter and con man film, but talent like David O. Russell and his amazing cast make it ever so much more than that. The original screenplay by O. Russell and Eric Singer is brilliant. I loved the way it combined the crime elements of the story as well as the drama and some of the most delectably offbeat humour, some of the best I have seen in awhile and I smiled and laughed out loud many times during the film. It's one of the more original and unique films of this year and that is one of the reasons I liked it so much. Here is a film where you have some very strong components that all seem to work to perfection. You have great acting from the main cast right down to the supporting characters. They are all great in their roles here and with a lot of these characters they have been given a couple of more dimensions than your usual Hollywood characters, so there is more to them than you may think and after the film is over and you have thought about it for awhile, you really start to appreciate everything this cast and crew did with these characters because they are so interesting, offbeat and sometimes charming at the same time. Once you piece the entire film together after you have seen it, it really makes you appreciate everything that went into it with the great writing, cast and directing. I love when you have a film such as this where the writing is so sharp and you have an excellent team of actors knocking their performances out of the ball park and delivering top notch material to already top notch writing. It is often a joy to watch. I enjoyed the 1970's setting of the film with the interior and exterior shots of buildings, the flashy clothes the characters wear and the selection of pop and rock songs that were popular at that time, which play in the film's background. All of it helped enhance the mood and made you believe that either it was the 70's, or you were watching a film from that time. I also really liked the stylish nature of the film's cinematography and direction. There were a number of camera shots and editing that I really enjoyed and found both interesting in a visual kind of way, but it also gave the film style and it's own unique way of getting this story across. I personally feel that director David O. Russell, is on a hot streak. I really enjoyed I Heart Huckabees, when I saw it back in 2004 and I loved The Fighter and readers of my reviews will know that Silver Linings Playbook, was one of my top 3 films of last year. This is a guy who can tell an excellent story and gets the best possible acting out of his actors. Jennifer Lawrence won an Oscar last year for Silver Linings Playbook, and I have no doubt that she will be nominated for her performance this year in American Hustle. All the performances in this are awards worthy, it has just been an impressive year and Lawrence, is so far the only for sure lock as far as awards nominations go, but the whole cast is absolutely fantastic here. At one point I read that David O. Russell, was considering doing a biopic of cult director Russ Meyer, but I have not seen, or heard any more about that project. Seeing what he could do here with his humour and take on the 1970's, I would personally love to see that film get made, being a personal fan of Russ Meyer and now of David O. Russell as well. I am sure however that whatever his next film is, that it will be a hit because he seems to be on a hot streak with no signs of slowing down. As it stands, American Hustle is one of the most original and fun films of 2013 and I recommend if you have a chance to see it more than once as I did, because you'll appreciate it even more and I think that is the way the film was meant to be seen."

","Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale) is an intelligent and effective con artist that teams up with a very attractive former stripper, Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams) in New York city. They soon find themselves in hot water after being set up by Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper) a slightly crazy and overly ambitious FBI agent. In an attempt to keep their freedom they help DiMaso bring down corrupt politicians as well as the mobsters that seem to control them. <br/><br/>The movie relocates to New Jersey where the scam gets deeper and involves an Arabian sheik impostor, chest hair, lots of bling and some high maintenance 70s hairdos. The characters are extremely interesting and the viewing pleasure is provided by them rather than the scams themselves. Sex, affairs and a lot of flirting combined with Irving's gorgeous yet utterly disreputable wife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence) , provide us with as much character depth as one could hope for. <br/><br/>I was left with a sense of uncanny admiration similar to that of Oceans Eleven or Catch Me If You Can.<br/><br/>Once again David O. Russell knocks it out the park with another high end movie.<br/><br/>Highly recommended 8/10<br/><br/>MattRigby"

","Irving (Christian Bale) is a small-time 1970s hustler, cheating people out of ""fixer"" fees for arranging loans which never materialise. He meets Sydney (Amy Adams) whose sights are higher, but they fall foul of ambitious FBI agent Richie who, having caught them dead to rights, blackmails them into going after bigger prey. Before long they find themselves in deep waters, way out of their depth.<br/><br/>Based on true events, this is a crime drama - relatively light in tone, albeit with a genuine sense of jeopardy in places. Though complex, it is easy enough to follow, and boasts some terrific performances. Amy Adams, whose every ensemble advertises the absence of a bra, is quite excellent (and far, far sexier than she usually is) although, for me, Jennifer Lawrence's performance has the edge. As Irving's wife, she bears his infidelity unhappily, and believes herself to be brainier than she actually is. It is not a big part, nor an essential one, but it is funny, and it carries a solid emotional truth at its heart. Then there is Robert De Niro in a small and uncredited cameo as a mafia enforcer, who gives what is probably his best performance for 15 years: the reptilian evil he exudes is almost tangible.<br/><br/>There are criticisms: it is, perhaps, overlong, and the most sympathetic character, Mayor Polito (Jeremy Renner) is the one who suffers a punishment which he doesn't really deserve, while the other characters, all morally compromised (at best) don't get a comeuppance of equivalent unfairness.<br/><br/>But this remains an entertaining and intriguing ensemble piece, with enough bad language to sink a ship, an intriguing ongoing drama, and Amy Adam's ever-present cleavage."
"Horst_In_Translation","4","5","11","15 September 2014"," Another style-over-substance work from David O. Russell
","After being heavily underwhelmed with his ""Silver Linings Playbook"" (especially due to the cringeworthy ending with the dancing scene and judges rating their dance), I thought maybe this could be the movie that lets me get on the David O. Russell bandwagon, especially after seeing that ""American Hustle"" is gonna be one of the big players of the 2013/2014 awards season. Well, it was not. Actually, it left me even more unimpressed than his previous work. He has gotten consistently worse since ""The Fighter"", which was decent, but not a masterpiece either. I am not familiar with his very early works ""I Heart Huckabees"" etc., so I will not judge these. The films he has recently been getting awards attention for, though, have not been brilliant at all.<br/><br/>For ""American Hustle"", he basically reunited the key players from ""The Fighter"" and ""Silver Linings Playbook"" (except Melissa Leo) plus Jeremy Renner. The film managed to score no less than four acting nominations and had a heavy contestant for the win in Jennifer Lawrence. Thankfully, she did not. I am yet to see a film of her that convinces me that she is an above-average talented actress. The film starts chaotic right away with the intro being taken randomly from the middle of the film and nobody knew what was actually going on. It completely relied on seeing familiar faces in stylish costumes and makeup. Zero substance. The possibly worst scene of the whole film was the ""Live and let die""-sequence. I never leave a movie while it is still running, but if I did, I possibly would have here. The BAFTAs should really be ashamed for giving David O Russell two writing awards. Thanks to Spike Jonze and Lupita Nyongo for keeping him and Lawrence from winning Oscars this year.<br/><br/>The costumes, settings etc. are all pompous and unfortunately managed to distract many viewers from the many flaws in the storytelling. The characters are neither authentic nor likable (the latter is not a criticism) and almost all of them are so over the top that you'd expect them in a cartoon or something. One flaw for example with the sheik storyline is that if they organized a fake sheik from high authorities, they would never be so amateurish to pick somebody who cannot even speak the language which is supposed to be his mother tongue. However, we need to ignore that because otherwise the makers could not have given Robert De Niro (who was the only decent one in ""Silver Linings Playbook"" by the way and deserving of his nomination) a very small badass role as a gangster here.<br/><br/>Lawrence plays pretty much the same character as in her Oscar-winning performance and the behavior of Adams' character is completely random and rarely makes sense. First she tells Coooper's character her real identity and then she cooperates with Bale again. Why would she tell who she is if she plans on switching sides again anyway. Makes no sense at all. There are many good mobster movies post-2000, but don't get tricked by Hollywood honoring this one so much: It is not one of them. The story is confusing, doesn't make much sense on quite a few occasions. There is not much wit to the screenplay and the final bluff without the lawyer can't save it either, even if they tried building it up as some huge aha moment.<br/><br/>There is one quote which was also used in the trailer saying roughly that some forge paintings and others just steal money from phone booths and the former just have bigger balls. This pretty much says everything about David O Russell's talent when it comes to dialog writing. I can't recommend watching this over-2-hour-long film at all. However, I am pretty curious how people will perceive it in 20 years from now. If they will still consider it one of the best films of the year or give the edge to one of the many actually great films that did not get so much awards attention (such as the Coen's ""Inside Llewyn Davis""). Anyway, I hope David O. Russell can improve on his next projects. Considerably."

","A con man, Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale), along with his seductive British partner, Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams), is forced to work for a wild FBI agent, Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper). DiMaso pushes them into a world of Jersey power brokers and mafia.<br/><br/>To best review this film, we need to talk about what the film is and what the film is not. Generally, it is a fictional retelling of the FBI's Operation Abscam, where they used a fake sheik to bribe politicians. However, the emphasis is on fictional, because a great many things have been changed -- most notably, Amy Adams' character is completely invented, along with the love triangle aspect. There is also little evidence of Mafia involvement in the actual operation.<br/><br/>So, the storytelling is quite good with a more than adequate script, but it is not by any means a realistic presentation of the facts. If such a movie exists, I would love to see it, but this is not that film.<br/><br/>What this film is: a strong showcase for some incredible actors. Adams is at the top of her game here, and easily earns herself the Oscar nomination if not the win (though it is a competitive category this year). Bale, who is always good, also gives a respectable performance, though maybe not his best. Jennifer Lawrence continues to expand her talents and it is no wonder she has quickly become a regular on the red carpet. Even Louis C.K., not generally known for his acting, is top notch here.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper, who I slowly warming to, is the weak link. He plays his part well, but not ""Oscar well"", and I am more than a little surprised by his nomination. In my estimation, Adams could win if Bullock does not run away with the statuette, Bale has a shot, Lawrence may squeak by, but Cooper is unlikely. The Globes awarded Adams and Lawrence, which seems about right. If there was an award for ""ensemble cast"", they would be a shoo-in, but individually it is a tough call this year.<br/><br/>I have a hard time accepting this as a best director nomination for David O. Russell. He may be a great director, and some credit must be given for being the man in charge, but again, this is an actor's film. There is no inventive camera work or lighting or much in the way of technical achievement. With such an impressive cast, I suspect Russell's role was relatively easy. I do not see a best director win for Russell, especially with Alfonso Cuarón as his competition.<br/><br/>The film editing category is too difficult to call with my limited knowledge of the process. As for best costume design and best production design, I can see why there were nominations but I suspect a win is unlikely. Maybe for costumes (though it is up against some films that want it badly) but not for production.<br/><br/>On to the biggest nomination of all: best picture. Although I have not yet seen all the Oscar nominees, I feel comfortable in saying this not only deserved the nomination but could possibly win. Being up against ""Gravity"" and ""12 Years a Slave"", I suspect a win is unlikely, but it is probably the best film of 2013 I have seen so far. This is a dramatic improvement over ""Silver Linings Playbook"".<br/><br/>Moreover, I think a best picture award is fitting. Despite the plethora of nominations the film received, it will not win most of the acting categories and probably not the directing category. But the whole is more than the sum of its parts, and its final form transcends the individual performances and crew achievements.<br/><br/>For a great 1970s throwback with action, romance, double dealing, and some of the finest acting of the year, you cannot do better than ""American Hustle""."

There is also a super cool cameo (I wont give it away) Jennifer Lawrence is awesome again, Bradley Cooper is at his funniest and most sincere since Silver Linings, Renner is great and very genuine, Amy Adams plays one of her best roles and is sexier than ever.

"matthewssilverhammer","8","5","11","30 December 2013"," A Stylish Screwball Crime Comedy
","""American Hustle"" is all about deception. Every character is hiding something from every other character, manipulating their relationships to get what they want. On top of this, there seems to be trickery of the film itself on the audience. Is this a crime/heist film? Yesbut only just. Above the hustle and bustle of the plot is a wonderful array of bumbling characters and neurotic screwball-esque dialogue that is sorely missing in our modern day Cineplex's. In the end, we get a crime-comedy-drama that is full of laughsintense, unsettling laughs. Nostalgia for the 1970s is extremely thick here, not just in the costuming and set pieces, but in the filmmaking itself. Yes, the style and music are perfect in putting us within the era, but even the camera work, editing, and jazzy directing scream of ""Mean Streets"" era-Scorsese. Russell struggles at times with some of the potential convolutedness of the lies, but this is minor. Lucky for us, Russell can pair this madcap style with some great touches of reality, grounding us back in the mundane as we are facing the insane. However, Russell is barely interested in the plot or even the real life Abscam scandal. He is interested in quick and brilliantly repetitive dialogue. He is interested in tone and style. He is interested in giving his actors surprising and authentic characters, and then letting them playand play they do. Everyone brings their A-game, especially Cooper, Bale and Lawrence who are truly outstanding, hilarious, and convincing. This is must-see awards season viewingbut it will also just be an entertaining and engaging night at the movies."
"jdkraus","10","5","11","30 December 2013"," Best of 2013
","According to the trivia section of the IMDb Page for ""American Hustle,"" it states that director David O. Russell said to Christian Bale, ""I hate plots. I am all about characters, that's it."" Whether this is a true fact or not is debatable. In viewing this movie, however, this trivia statement seems thoroughly factual to Mr. Russell's intent with his new feature. There are five characters present and each of them have one common trait...they lie. <br/><br/>With the backdrop of the 1970s, two con artists, Irving Rosenfeld (Bale) and Sydney Posser (Amy Adams) work with an FBI agent (Bradley Cooper) to take down a corrupted politician (Jeremy Renner). The sting could all fall apart from Irving's unpredictable wife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence). The plot is simple enough. Any half-decent writer could come up with this idea. But what sells its excellence is the characters. These individuals are not necessary persons you would want to meet or perhaps even feel sympathy for. Yet, they are so sophisticated and intriguing to watch on the big screen as they lie, seduce, and back-stab one another. In a way, it is the ultimate soap opera feature. <br/><br/>The ensemble cast is nothing short from what I expect from a David O. Russell film. He molds them to deliver the best of their ability and then some. Bale once again physically and mentally transforms himself as Irving Rosenfeld. Sleazy, crooked, yet compassionate and nice--all that is needed in humanizing a con man, and Bale does so with finesse. Amy Adams as his partner is equally brilliant. She portrays her character with seductive ingenuity, and cunning wittiness--a real manipulator and con artist. She is truly an underrated actress who desperately needs accolade recognition.<br/><br/>In comparison, Cooper and Lawrence play their roles with more fun than seriousness. Cooper is determined and over the top as the ambitious FBI agent Richie DiMaso. He practically lights up the screen with his wild energy and off-handed sense of humor. Jennifer Lawrence is a real screen stealer in her small part. It is more than apparent that she watched ""The Real Housewives of New Jersey"" via her thick Jersey accent and snobby attitude. Yet she pulls in elements of a woman who is a force of nature like in the old 1930s screwball comedies. I see a bit of Katherine Hepburn from ""Bringing Up Baby"" in her depiction Rosalyn. She could very well earn a second consecutive Oscar and I will not complain. Jeremy Renner is unfortunately dwarfed by his acting counterparts. He still makes a good character as the politician who is on a path of building greatness to his city.<br/><br/>The bigger budget to this film has improved the visual style of David O Russell's new film. Hand-held camera work is replaced with smooth steadi-cam and dolly shots, creating a believable period piece of the 1970s. The sets, props, costumes, hairstyles, even choice of music redevelops this lost era of fun and disco. Some of the techniques of editing and voice-over narrative are a bit of a knockoff from a Scorsese film. For instance, a freeze frame is used on a character as another character explains who the significance of this person to the audience. This really isn't terrible, but it feels too much like ""Goodfellas"" when this movie is supposed to be a David O. Russell creation. <br/><br/>Aside from this minor critique, ""American Hustle"" is a great character-driven film with little action and phenomenal dialog. I will go so far as to call this the best movie I have seen this year. <br/><br/>My rating: 10/10"

","In New York in 1978, two scam artists are forced by an FBI agent to assist in a sting operation that catches politicians accepting bribes. This film is based on a true story.<br/><br/>The directing and pace are vibrant and enjoyable enough. ""American Hustle"" also boasts four highly acclaimed performances by Christian Bale, Amy Adams, Bradley Cooper,and Jennifer Lawrence. The praise for the actors is all well deserved.<br/><br/>While this is an okay movie, it's not as great as the overall praise it has been given. Each scene is well conducted and they do fit into an overall story. Some scenes are quite good. Yet somehow, there is still a feeling of incoherence. It seems to be missing an broader theme or concern for any of the characters even if they happen to be sleazy on the surface.<br/><br/>It's certainly not a bad film. But considering the numerous awards and nominations it was won, ""American Hustle"" comes off as rather disappointing."

My synopsis would be that it was trying too hard and that the ending was predictable.<br/><br/>There are some huge names in it, but somehow, although everyone's performance was good - Bradley Cooper was a bit over-the-top, though - they just didn't seem to gel together.<br/><br/>The opening scene was sort-of funny, but went on too long. There were several episodes where things should have been funny, but just weren't. One instance was the FBI man in hair curlers - it just wasn't that amusing and it really should have been. I imagine other things were thought to be done in a ""knowing"" way, but it was just a bit cliched.<br/><br/>It felt like they were out to make this decade's Boogie Nights, but fell short.<br/><br/>I didn't even watch it in one go - I watched the second half two days later so it wasn't exactly gripping!"

","David O. Russell knows how to make a good film with great actors, even if his antics behind the scene can be described as cruel, especially to Lily Tomlin (look it up). He has a quick style, almost like Scorsese, where he rapidly follows the characters through their journey. It's worked plenty of times before with films such as The Fighter and Silver Linings Playbook, and it works here again in American Hustle. With an assembled all-star cast and a great script with some truth to it, Russell's film will surely further his status as one of modern Hollywood's most successful directors.<br/><br/>The film follows five main characters during the late 70s and early 80s. The first is Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale). He's a born con man who has spent years building up his dry cleaning empire along with an art forgery business on the side. Next to him is Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams), a scrappy and resourceful woman who gets romantically involved with Irving. They both start running a loan scam business together, which after a while attracts the attention of FBI agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper). Knowing he has two expert criminals by the leash, Richie forces Irving and Sydney to participate in an FBI operation to crack down on political bribery and gambling. <br/><br/>The two other characters to show up are Irving's actual wife, Rosalyn Rosenfeld (Jennifer Lawrence), who's always on the rocks drinking and smoking while she lays the day away in her house with her and Irving's child. The last is Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner), mayor of Atlantic City and the prime target in the FBI sting.<br/><br/>The overall plot and pacing of the film are very character focused. Every event is either from a main character or from a side character that affects a main character. This is both a pro and con that the film carries throughout. <br/><br/>The pro comes from the actors making the best of their characters. Every actor has great chemistry and skill to carry the action and emotional wright. The whole film would have probably fallen apart if lesser actors were cast instead, but luckily that never happened. <br/><br/>The con that comes from the character-driven story is that all the characters have a wide range, but very little depth. We only really get surface details and never any real background or striking motivations. The characters are really only memorable because of the actors playing them, which is probably while watching the film I referred every character to the actor. I always saw Christian Bale and Amy Adams, never Irving and Sydney.<br/><br/>David O. Russell is an actor's director and he shows it here. He expertly lets his cast do what they want while also staying within the confines of the script, which can be a bit overlong at times. <br/><br/>The camera acts as a spectator to the action as it reacts and follows whatever the actors do. The frame is only filled with the actors because nothing else is more important. It's a strategy that works perfectly in this case since it keeps the story focused and free-flowing.<br/><br/>The biggest reason you did or probably will see this film is for the performances, and that is definitely what you get. <br/><br/>Christian Bale goes through another one of his trademarked body transformations to play the overweight con man with an elaborate comb-over. Bale is hardly recognizable from his Dark Knight trilogy days and makes every scene his own. <br/><br/>Amy Adams plays almost like a seductress that is out to overpower every man with her looks and brains. She brings the ferocity to make her character both dangerous and intriguing. <br/><br/>Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence both play sort of eccentric characters that keep interfering with our main pair. They both have great energy and an ability to steal scenes at any given moment. <br/><br/>Finally, Jeremy Renner jumps in and out of the film at times as Carmine Polito. He has charisma, power, but also a heart and genuine love for his city. He's a troubled character that you really don't know if you should be rooting for or against. <br/><br/>American Hustle definitely boasts some of the best performances for each of the actors involved. While it never really develops its characters enough, the film is still a fun ride because of the good story and great people. To sum it all up quickly, the actors are not part of this film, they are the film."
"SquigglyCrunch","8","2","3","12 November 2016"," Confusing Story and Great Performances
","American Hustle follows two con men who are caught by an FBI agent who decides to use them to catch corrupt politicians.<br/><br/>The movie features an all-star cast, and most every one of them is worth mentioning. Bradley Cooper is fine, probably the worst performance of the bunch. Not to say he's bad, but he doesn't stand out. Same with Amy Adams, I can't tell if it's her acting style or what, but she was just fine in this movie. She brought more to the table than Cooper, but not much more. Jeremy Renner is good, but in my opinion the two best are Jennifer Lawrence and Christian Bale. Lawrence is fun to watch on-screen, as is her character. She had a level of depth to her especially that I just really enjoyed watching. Christian Bale, on the other hand, is magnificent. He's the most convincing and intriguing character of them all, and he pulls it off beautifully. <br/><br/>The movie looks beautiful as well. The colors, the clothing, the settings, everything looks great. I don't know how accurate it is, but I don't really care. It looked great. <br/><br/>One of my only gripes, however, is the story. It's not that it's bad, but it's one of those movies that you have to pay extra attention to to understand. I didn't actually understand what the characters were trying to accomplish until they'd accomplished it, at which point it made sense but it also took a while. Would I have caught on if I'd paid more attention? Probably. Which is why I'll definitely be seeing this one again. Chances are I went in with the wrong expectations. <br/><br/>Overall American Hustle is a good movie. The characters are interesting and well-played, the actors range from good to amazing, and the movie as a whole looks great. If your going to watch it, go into it knowing you'll have to pay a lot of attention. In the end I'd recommend this movie."

",".....I could not believe how many Academy Award nominations it received. But the Academy has been sinking for a long time along with most of Hollywood elite. Little is left of the glory days when good films were built on solid stories, good acting and superb directing. American Hustle had not of that. What it did have in almost every scene was nearly exposed breasts.Any movie that has a character in dresses and blouses that plunge as far as her navel and more in her every scene is a movie that is begging for eyeballs because there is no other reason to watch the movie. Amy Adams is pretty enough but she was as lame in this as in Leap Year. Christian Bale who has been top notch in most of his roles was stuck with paying a pathetic character in need of a bottle of booze and an retirement in a 1972 mobile home park.

I mean at just over two hours I expected quite a lot to happen (it's longer than Die Hard, and that's long enough for Bruce Willis to single handedly bring down a entire German terrorist organisation and save his wife), but was disappointed to find that the plot didn't really go anywhere and that, to be honest, I was unable to really care. <br/><br/>When I was first told the plot line for American Hustle, coupled with the discovery of the actors and actresses (whom I have nothing but respect for) that star in this film, needless to say I was excited, such was only increased by the amount to Oscar nominations and awards it won. Unfortunately, I felt the film was unable to live up to the hype around it: I found the plot overly convoluted and that I didn't like the characters enough to care about their fate. <br/><br/>Although, I see this as a good time to mention that there are a few amusing minutes featuring Jennifer Lawrence, and the costume was impressive and gave the film a stylized feel (although, my mother would like to make clear that some styles were never meant to be repeated). However, I don't feel this is enough to redeem over two hours of this film. <br/><br/>Altogether, I think the concept of a stylized 70s film about the Mafia has blinded people to the fact it's not that great a film. I'm sorry but there are other films out there more worthy to watch..."

His role would have been better served by Philip Seymour Hoffman (RIP).<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper did the best job, IMO.

","This is slow-moving and full of cliché's. It's a very stereotypical ""Hollywood"" film in that it won awards and had press like the first moon landing. Cast was good, but each one of them has acted better in previous work. I did like Louis CK in this movie. Read one of the ""trivia facts"" stating that wardrobe made several duplicate dresses for Lawrence to wear because she liked to eat Doritos and stained her wardrobe. This is the type of crap that makes normal people hate Hollywood. How about instead of wasting time and money on duplicate dresses, you tell the cast members to stop eating on the set, stop damaging company property and stick to the work at hand. You know, like the real world."
"ddbverano","4","2","3","22 July 2014"," All style. No substance
","It looks like this movie tried to copy Goodfellas a little bit. In Goodfellas I felt empathy for a lot of the characters. In this one I felt zero. <br/><br/>The soundtrack was good. I don't blame the acting. I have scene much better films depicting the 70's. (Boogie Nights, Dazed and Confused, Almost Famous, hell even the Anchorman) American Hustle looked more like a costume party than having a real feeling for the 70's. <br/><br/>At times it seemed so silly that it felt like watching a SNL bit. In short, I did not care or have any interest in any of the characters in this overrated film."
"j-lamminger","1","2","3","20 July 2014"," Awkward
","The whole movie a dabbling trickle, of of course nice retro 70's pics, though painstaking. The ""showdown"" of the way too long, dusty social sketch is plain awkward. The stoner, Christian Bale even more wooden with a slight touch of Fear And Loathing - dramaesc and nervous. The curly guy, really sexy and good looking, one of the few fun moments, with the curlers on and living in a flat with his mother. Jenniffer Lawrence well, nice girl and unlikely as a mother. For Amy Adams the make it big wasn't happening sorry, pale but eyes, too much of a good thing? I believe the cast and crew had fun while working on this, is it a literary film? Could be fun as 15 minutes short stories-series, as a complete movie this is a complete bust and another Hollywood fail to be checked. Have to say again very very pesky, hopefully the studio is already bankrupt."
"athena24","5","2","3","6 July 2014"," Average
","Very, very average movie. And considering the cast, it's actually bad. I don't know why there is a comedy tag on the movie. There were about 2 comic occasions in a 138 minutes long movie. There is also a clear stance on showing the FBI as the 'bad guys' while trying to make Carmine Polito as Maria Teresa. Another irritating thing was the notion that the whole FBI operation was conducted by a single guy. And not a very bright one.<br/><br/>I liked the plot. Though it took about an hour to ignite the engines, it progressed interestingly afterwords. Even the unnecessary relationship matters, that delayed the progress as the movie went on, didn't damage the plot extensively.<br/><br/>Other bright spots are the performances of Christian Bale, Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner. Jennifer Lawrence did a great job, but her character got much more screen time that it should. <br/><br/>Bradley Cooper, on the other hand, ruined what others built. Every scene he was in, brought some antagonism from my side. Instead of having a serious, smart and restrained type of agent we got a stupid and a cocky one. This wasn't the right type of character, and Bradley Cooper wasn't the right actor.<br/><br/>In all, FBI looked like a bunch of clowns. Bypassing the chain of command, beating your supervisor.<br/><br/>There is another drawback in focusing on the unnecessary meandering relationship between the main characters. However, on the most part, the actors played their roles well and it wasn't the accent.<br/><br/>In conclusion I would say that the director, David O. Russel, has some gift of storytelling but fails to make it entertaining. And the latter happens mainly because of the implicit stupidity in the movie. For myself, I have a very low tolerance for implicit stupidity. As I see it, the director assumes the audience is not smart enough, and that is a major fault. For some movies it is alright to be stupid. American Hustle on the other hand, is plot and character driven drama, so it does not have any excuse of being such."

","This movie moved incredibly slow. How it is a nominee for anything is beyond my grasp. With a line up of respectable actors, I expected much more from this movie. It failed in keeping my interest, as well as failing on the story line. Very disappointing. There were a few funny moments, as well as some unflattering wardrobe issues. In some shots, there were flat chests nearly exposed. It appeared the cast had a good time with it though. I am very glad I did not see this film in the theater. Should have been a free rental.

","This is like someone -- Oh, surprise; It's David Russell(sp.?) -- tried to put ""Boogie Nights"" and ""Casino"" together into one movie, and then that movie was focus-grouped at boring people.<br/><br/>What I hate about Mr. Russell is that everything in his films focuses on the up-front-and-center. Everyone's got a stupid toupee, or they're over-acting, or, like ... C'mon, dude. Why do you even spend money to build a set? You could shoot this in a black box theater and then people would REALLY think you were an artist!<br/><br/>Anyway, I would compare this movie to ""Death to Smoochy"" in terms of how much of both a train-wreck and a necessity it is to watch. But it was pretty hyped up, so if you hang around with people who grill you on what movies you saw in 2013, and will throw you out of their friend circle if you didn't see ""American Hustle"" in the theater within a week of its release, well, if you have friends like that it probably doesn't matter whether the movie's any good or not so you can stop reading now and go watch it. Quick! They're onto you!<br/><br/>If you liked any or all of David Russell's previous films, you might like this one, but I can't really speak to that because I'm not a fan. I don't like any of the movies of his I've seen. They're amusing, I guess. Also, I sort of harbor a grudge against him for what I heard was a shitty treatment of bipolar disorder or whatever in ""Silver Linings Playbook"", but I've never seen it nor read the book. That's totally just because I'm an angry crazy person who has to put up with people thinking they know all about my crazy because they saw ""Silver Linings Playbook"". <br/><br/>That's where my hatred of this movie I haven't seen comes from. Maybe I'll go watch it now."

There are loads better Films to see if you look out for them. I really thought this would have been right up my Street but was wrong.

Sydney has improved Rosenfeld's scams, posing as English aristocrat ""Lady Edith Greensly"".

"sohansurag","6","2","3","19 April 2014"," Brilliant Performances, Over-rated Flick!
","I'd seen American Hustle soon after its release and till this time I'd been pondering what to make of it. I just couldn't figure out why it was acclaimed so much.<br/><br/>David O Russell has become a go-to guy for Oscars it seems. No matter what movie he makes, its bound to win at least one Academy Award or at least get a couple of nominations. He's being doing it in a row and American Hustle has undoubtedly ended up on everybody's favorite list, some even preferring it more than Martin Scorsese's debauchery epic The Wolf of Wall Street or Steve McQueen's period drama on slavery, 12 Years a Slave. Myself having seen American Hustle, though, would stand on the other side of the fence.<br/><br/>Silver Linings Playbook was one of those fine movies which captured my short attention span from start till end. Owe it all to the fabulous performances from Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper coupled with David O Russell's offbeat injection of comedy. While I could be called a Jennifer Lawrence superfan, I was not a big fan of Bradley Cooper, thanks to Alias, I could never shake off the image of Will Tippin from my mind but what can I say Silver Linings Playbook did make a fan outta me, well at least of his performance more rather than him. The Fighter was another film that had everything going for it, solid performances from Christian Bale and Mark Wahlberg, Amy Adams, David's direction and a brilliant script. David O Russell, far from his I Heart Huckabees days was indeed churning out finely made movies.<br/><br/>American Hustle held a lot of promises having pulled the inexplicably talented stars from both Silver Linings Playbook and The Fighter. A slew of arguably the best actors from Hollywood but were they put to best use? I'll stick with 'Nah'. The actors however were at their best, having fun with their respective roles. American Hustle has a lot of style as well, the actors and the settings were all set ablaze with genuine looking costumes and props. I mean the direction was good, actors were plenty and performed well but all that doesn't make a great movie? I was irked by two issues: 1: The Pacing. Compared to The Wolf of Wall Street's 3 Hours which felt like a breeze, American Hustle's mere 138 felt laboring. It did have its fast moments but at times it felt excruciatingly slow. And problem number 2: The obvious predictability. I don't know if it was intended that way but the predictability this movie carried made me question O Russell. Considering this was a con movie, everybody would agree the final revelation wasn't the least epic Hey, I was brewn so, expecting something revelatory is totally normal and would have just made American Hustle GREAT. a la Oceans Eleven!<br/><br/>Christian Bale's amazing sincerity towards his role had been evident from frame one. We've seen him get emaciated in The Machinist then get beefed up for his Batman roles then again get thin in The Fighter. Here we've got a flabby potbellied balding Bale in the role of Irving Rosenfeld. Bale has once again shows us that he can take on any kinda role, superhero or not. Bradley Cooper yet again displays off his acting prowess and shows that he's come a long way from his Alias days. Amy Adams proves that she can sizzle both as a commercial or art-house actress, be it Lois Lane or the insanely glamorous Sydney Prosser. Her side bosom gets a special mention as well. Jennifer Lawrence as the raunchy Rosalyn Rosenfeld was so adorable despite her slightly grey tone in the movie. Its impossible not to like her even when she plays a horny, yammering, naggy wifeand does it near perfectly. To see C K Louis was a pleasant surprise and scenes with him and Bradley Cooper did pack a lot of laughs. Jeremy Renner ends up in a solid role, this guy had been looked upon post his Hawkeye role but I am glad that he did an excellent job as Mayor Carmine Polito.<br/><br/>American Hustle's soundtrack, though was thoroughly enjoyable, be it along with the visuals or not. The score composed by Danny Elfman really stood out and kept a admirably fast pace for an otherwise slow procession of things. The selection of songs featured on the OST was also noteworthy.<br/><br/>Agreed, American Hustle had great performances, a decent storyline and excellent direction and in all sense its a perfectly watchable flick but does it deserve an Academy Award just for affixing 'America' to its title? Not quite. I have nothing against the Academy's incline towards American movies or directors but there is a roster of much better movies nominated this year which genuinely deserves it."

","I started watching this movie, and of course, like everyone else, had really high expectations. But, honestly, other than Jennifer Lawrence's character and Christain Bale's belly, was not wow'd or impressed in any way. Even the ending... I was expecting a pretty spectacular ending. Sure, it was a good ending, but nothing even close to great in any way, in my opinion.<br/><br/>I made myself watch it for a second time, because it felt wrong that I was disappointed in this movie and yet it was supposed to sweep the Oscars.

","For me this started off slow, got really good and fizzled in the end. I really have to bash the end because it really ruined the movie for me. How could Bale and Adam's character walk away scott free or rather scratch free after pulling off a con that got so many people in trouble? How could they walk away after trying to con De Niro's character who is supposedly the most nefarious mob enforcer in the country? So what he didn't get taken down, he would have still wanted retribution for the attempt. I mean come on seriously? The film was based on actual events so I think in the 70's the con people would probably end up in a dumpster somewhere. Also if an FBI agent misplaced 2 million dollars of his agency's money because he got conned, he would have no doubt been fired. How can the audience be expected to take a movie seriously when the director himself does not?"
"auroraborealis7","4","2","3","28 March 2014"," More fun for the actors than the viewers who pay for it
","Don't assume that critical acclaim means that this a great movie. This is a movie that perhaps actors or drama students would love; makeup people; set dressers etc. because it is completely aesthetic. The dialogue kills the movie - very interesting actors and pacing, but - and its a huge obstacle - the dialogue doesn't move the plot forward. This is self-indulgent movie making. Your job as a film maker is to tell a story, properly. I just don't know how this one got off the ground... perhaps it was a vehicle to display the actors, who are interesting, good-looking and talented. Too bad the bones of the film are broken. This one could have been fixed: new script, keep it TIGHT, take off a layer of the ""icing"" by which I mean the overly-dramatized 70s era props and styling (like the hair - who cares, its a hairstyle, get over it and don't depend on it so much), and in the end, do your job and keep me interested. This movie feels like a drama school project and not a real piece. There is no reality in it whatsoever... from the opening scene ""Some of this actually happened..."" don't bother putting that statement in if all you have is fiction."

","Average Film, and totally overrated. While the cast performs... well, the only one that really makes a performance is Mr. Robert de Niro, although in his cliché mob guy. The rest is fine, entertaining, but nothing more. Amy Adams' wardrobe is superb, though. The story is plain, and there is no fun watching it. This is not a must see, and I am starting to understand why Oscars were neglected to the film. You will leave the theater and or watching your TV with a meh... attitude. Not bad either, but characters are very shallow, the script is not entertaining not energetic, lots of directing mistakes, etc. Even the seventies are not exciting enough to be seen here."

But besides its surface value, besides the music and costumes, what was there? It would be a serious, serious stretch for me to put much meaning to this movie. What, ""Don't con the guy that cons you, um, conning isn't great, be careful of redheads, um don't wear hair pieces guys."" ""Watch out which nail polish you use, cuz um, be careful."" The film is just like Christian Bale's hair piece; its for show. They're making a lot of money, and most people think that a movie cannot get much better than this. But any human being can realize the difference in emotion you feel after seeing a film like 12 Years a Slave and American Hustle. At the end of American Hustle, you're content, maybe you chuckled a bit, but nothing more. At the end of 12 Years a Slave, its like someone shot you in the chest, you're just thrown a back.

","David O. Russell, returns with his ensemble cast from his previous 2 films, The Fighter & Silver Linings Playbook. So we have Christian Bale & Amy Adams returning from 2010, whilst Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence and Robert De Niro (yes don't miss his cameo) from last year's Oscar winner. <br/><br/>Bradley Cooper reprises his role as executive producer, after the successful Limitless. <br/><br/>Set in 1978, New York, this ABSCAM inspired story, moves with local small time dry cleaner-cum-glass vendor-cum- con artist, Irving Rosenfield (Bale) and his new found associate-cum-lover Sydney Prosser (Adams). After being busted by FBI Agent, Richie DiMaso (Cooper), the duo are forced into hunting white collar criminals as a pay off. There begins the hunt, starting with Mayor, Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner) as bait to nab the politicians on the take. <br/><br/>Like Russell's previous 2 films, the film, inspite of having a strong story, is run completely by 2 things...a strong screenplay and even stronger all round performances! Coupled with excellent camera-work by Linus Sandgren and music by Danny Elfman, you can feel the characters' emotions on screen, be it the nervousness of wannabe DiMaso or the vulnerability of the supercon Irving!<br/><br/>As a matter of fact, you can feel the terror by just looking at De Niro's eyes, in the party table scene, nearly expecting him to chop off a head or two. <br/><br/>Co- Written by Eric Warren Singer and Russell, the film has unleashes, yes you read right, unleashes its primary 4 characters at one go, hitting us like a wasabi shot! Just by the time you have absorbed the 4, you get hit by the unpredictable, volatile, voluptuous Rosalyn (Lawrence). <br/><br/>Russell takes the cast of Soderbergh, the narrative style of Scorsese, the dryness of the Coen Brothers, shakes it all up, adds his sour humour and presents a cocktail which will hit you like a shot!<br/><br/>Bale, in yet another physically transformed role, makes no bones to flaunt his paunch and his elaborate combover. As a matter of fact, he shifts between the role of the completely in control person in the room to the least in control, especially while confronting Rosalyn, with such ease. <br/><br/>Adams as the sexy sultress, is the game changer in the film. Her constantly shifting loyalties and heartburns, make her the least trustworthy character in the film. not once will you feel pity for her, but yes, you will always be wary whilst she is on screen. <br/><br/>Cooper as the loudmouth, fast talking, wannabe is simply top notch. Whilst his scene with his mother, sums up his character's ambition, it are the scenes with his boss, Stoddard Thorsen (Louis C.K., in a fantastic performance) that add the actual humour in the film. The Ice fishing story is sure to get your goat. <br/><br/>Alessandro Nivola as Thorsen's boss, the guy we all remember as Pollux Troy from Face / Off is a pleasure to see. <br/><br/>Jeremey Renner, the new entrant to the Russell team, portrays the family man Polito with super finesse. You feel for him throughout his entrapment and wish that there was some where you could redeem him, cos he is the only guy in the entire plot who has his heart in the right place and for the right cause too. The treatment that Renner gets doled out with, is a realistic portrayal of life by Russell, that not necessarily that the good guy will win in the end.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence, after the mega successful Catching Fire, delivers yet another knock out of a performance. Although the least in terms of screen space and the last of the main entrants to come on screen, she lights up the screen with fire, literally, whenever she comes. Her childish yet vampish of a wife attitude makes you want to smack and hug her at the same time!<br/><br/>Russell has developed a track record of winning the acting accolades for both his last ventures, Bale and Melissa Leo for The Fighter and Lawrence for SLP. <br/><br/>Definitely a movie worth your time at the theatres, for repeated viewing and a worthy contender at the Oscars!<br/><br/>Does it have The Y Factor : YES<br/><br/>Rating : 4/5"
"vanijay-work","6","2","3","20 February 2014"," All in Hustle
","American Hustle is the second movie since 1981 being nominated in the four acting categories of Oscar. The nominations are for Christian Bale, Bradley Cooper, Amy Adams, Jennifer Lawrence. This super start cast might pique interest in anyone even if they remotely belong to the world of movies. And no wonder, this stardom tricked me into it. <br/><br/>This supposedly comedy drama offers very little comedy and one might wonder why this movie is tagged to the word 'Comedy' in all the reviews. Those handful funny moments comes via Jennifer Lawrence as Rosalyn Rosenfeld, an unstable wife of Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale). She is the only saving grace of the movie. However, even her erratic character is exploited a bit when she kisses her rival Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams) in a rest room. That's awfully disgusting.<br/><br/>Now I wonder why Amy Adams has been nominated for awards? Because of receiving that weird kiss? What has she done in the movie except wearing waist low tops and kissing the co-stars, even a female co-star at that? She is supposed to be a seductive con artist who could pull any one to the ploy with her ingenuity. Is there any visual that explains this? She does tricks the wild FBI agent Richie Dimaso (Bradley Cooper), however she prefers more skin show with him rather than any sort of intelligence. <br/><br/>Richie is a wild, rather another erratic (just like Rosalyn) character in the movie, who was simply let loose in the screenplay. He says he is so ambitious about capturing the corrupted politicians. But he only says so, no action to prove that he is ambitious. He forms a deal with two most intelligent cons Irving and Sydney that they both would be freed in exchange to their help to trap at least four corrupts. But he even fails to check Sydney's background. <br/><br/>And finally Christian Bale, who is not the typical charismatic con, but rather a little plump, middle age man who is blessed with a heart of gold. He loves his son a lot. He refuses to give up on his wife. The problem is all these are shown via dialogues instead of any real reasons to believe him that he has a noble heart.<br/><br/>At the end, you don't care about any of these characters. All of them might have flared better if they stand alone. However, in a movie they all look lost, and so are we."

I love a complicated film, and certainly this was. I love good acting and certainly I couldn't fault the performances --though at time I failed to understand what certain actors were actually saying. But I kept waiting to be engaged in the film, to love something or some character--to just love the complicated plot twists and constant thinking of just who was conning whom. In the end I just did not care. In the end what I decided is that the film just had no soul. There was no character who deserved my applause, just no character on whose side I wanted to be on, just no connection at all. Both my companion and I just looked at each other when the film was over and expressed our puzzlement. We just did't get why others thought this to be a great film. It is not."
"nadiahourihan","6","2","3","2 February 2014"," A film on drugs. But sub par drugs... Potentially just sugar?
","American Hustle is a film on drugs. But sub par drugs <br/><br/>Potentially just sugar?<br/><br/>Its hyperactivity sweats fun. So much FUN, that I sunk into a jealousy suffused funk. The on screen action jarred with my viewing experience. O'Russell is a connoisseur of artificial emotional explosions. We're served an I-can't-count-how-many-course meal of undiluted synthesis; A thematic on screen orgy. And yes it was that uncomfortable (Disclaimer- I do NOT speak from experience). The incessant barrage of bluntly delivered ""Oh hey this is fake"" was exasperating. The pinnacle of this irony contoured falsity was reached in a kiss under the coats scene. Plastic coat wrappings swirled around lovers in a delirium drenched dreamlike sequence. It was pretty. But the mid scene punctuation of ""I felt I could be myself"" was too cheeky. A sneaky tear may have been shed at the deathbed of subtlety. And this was just ten minutes in Point of irritation number two: The acting. Primarily, Bale was miscast. Even the almighty accrual of a gut failed to veil his uncomfortable knowledge of this. He portrayed his character without any discernible emotional attachment. It was insipid. However, 'un amigo mío' argued that this brought a childlike quality to the performance<br/><br/>NO. A child could not claim such a curiously botoxed style of acting. Similarly, Cooper well he was just Cooper, and the hair didn't make me laugh. Yet O'Russell's smothering presence was most acutely felt with the actresses. Amy Adams is talented (Go watch Junebug ye naysayers!); this talent was felt. And then O'Russell decides to detract from the delectable ambiguity of her character, tossing in a cheap British accent, Cunnilingus gags (I know) and banning the use of any dress which didn't exhibit TITS. And trust me that mandated capitalisation. Later, he doubles back and decides to abandon any provocative murkiness at all and reduce her role to template. Jennifer Lawrence's seething frailty was also asphyxiated by O'Russell's infatuation with everything hyperbolic. But hey, at least she looked like she had FUN. But not as much fun as anyone in Goodfellas, to which this farcical Xerox treads too close. Although hold up every one, am I being too mean? Perhaps. I suppose I should list some more balanced points; the score was phenomenal. The attention devoted to Ellington's Jeep's Blues is very much merited; it's an addictive brassy little number. And the music is only surpassed by the zealous recreation of the fashion, furniture and feathered locks. No doubt producers are currently embroiled in legal battles denying that the volume of hairspray used on set will hasten global warming (GO TEAM GREENPEACE!). American Hustle is flawed and I begrudge it for trying so overtly hard BUT, if only to gauge the depth of my bemusement that this is the bookies Oscars darling, you must book a cinema ticket."
"sydney-swans-1","5","2","3","1 February 2014"," Style Over Substance
","So Jennifer Lawrence's character blows up a microwave and comically cleans the house whilst singing 'Live and Let Die'. So Christian Bale's character has an intricate comb-over that takes several minutes to perfect, only to have it messed up not five minutes later. So Bradley Cooper's character wears curlers to create the illusion that he's a curly-haired Italian bad-ass.<br/><br/>These are all moments people keep referring to when they talk about David O. Russel's American Hustle. It's as if they are rooting for something that will back up the brilliant acting on display. Yes they are funny, but they feel deliberate. They don't really serve any contribution to the narrative, they're just sequences Russel has included to distract you from the lack of things happening in this film. I've seen a lot of reviews on this film, and one common complaint is that the film has a sloppy plot, but critics are always quick to defend it because something else is more important in the film, whether that be brilliant acting or the vibrance of the film.<br/><br/>The film is indeed vibrant: the costumes are wickedly fun and dazzling, and each scene is bright and inviting. There are funny scenes. There are countless moments of honesty and realism from all the members of the cast, particularly Bale, who stars as a con-man who is forced to work with an FBI agent to sting corrupt politicians.<br/><br/>This is the problem, though. There's too many elements that are intentional and deliberate, and you feel that. Russel has never been one to be subtle, but here he is in full-swing. Fancy hair and costumes? A classic 70's soundtrack? Bright disco lights? A scene about a science oven that blows up? A scene where a fully grown man wears curlers? A whole two-minute sequence dedicated to someones comb-over? These are all things that help build the characters, and the characters are fascinating, but they have nowhere to go in this film. They wonder aimlessly through each un-necessarily-long scene trying to pull the plot to it's conclusion. They are just ploys by Russel to draw the viewer in and make them feel obligated to follow their stories, when in reality, they don't really have much of a story, and if they do, it hasn't been represented in the right manner at all by Russel and his team.<br/><br/>Perhaps the scene that speaks most about how this film is a con-job to make you think you're watching a really entertaining film comes about three-quarters of the way through the film: we are introduced to a gangster played by none other than Robert De Niro. I know Russel and De Niro have worked together before, but his inclusion in the film was purely tactical. Here's why: we're introduced to him as a fearsome, brutal gangster as he shoots a man in cold blood and precedes to spit on him. This gives us the impression that the action is about to begin, only to be disappointed by a seemingly endless scene where De Niro and a group of his colleagues, and Bale and Coopers characters all sit around a table and, through even more dialogue, try to add some more layers to a film with not much to it. It's a boring scene, and a waste of a truly great legend like De Niro. Opening that sequence with De Niro being a bad-ass killer instantly attracts our attention because we all love De Niro in bad-ass mode, but it isn't long before you realize you've ben blinded by a 10-second scene and discover nothing is going to happen.<br/><br/>That is the story of this film: Style Over Subtstance."

","American hustle did not live up to the expectation that was originally put to me. The film starts off very slowly and for the first 45 minutes you are fed a long story before the real action of the main hustle begins. The film could of really caught the attention of the audience but it just didn't do that. <br/><br/>Despite the bad start the American Hustle really did get exciting once he big hustle began. It was clever how everyone was hustling each other under what was suppose to be one main hustle. The film is brilliantly cast and each character feels necessary.

Even though the film is well made, superbly directed, excellently acted and fairly well written, it still ends up being a boring film which only gets better for the last 30 to 40 minutes.<br/><br/>Premises set upon the ABSCAM, it is a fictionalized account of how a FBI agent used small con artists to get the big fishes.<br/><br/>Firstly, this isn't my Genre, I don't particularly like these kind of films. They might be good and well rated, but I still find them boring at points. So I wasn't expecting much. As David O Russell say, he only like characters and hates plots, it is fairly evident in this venture of his. The film is totally character driven with some excellent performances, whereas the plot seems a little messed up and haphazard especially in the first half. The comic moments were rare and only came with Jennifer.<br/><br/>Along with excellent directing and acting, the film has eye catchy costumes and hairstyling, particularly Amy's dresses and Lawrence's hair. I was surprised when it wasn't nominated for Makeup and Hairstyling. I think the film is the most deserving nominee for Costumes.<br/><br/>Direction: Strong. David manages to hold a messy plot together.<br/><br/>Writing: Slightly weak for David's standards. Though it is good towards the end.<br/><br/>Acting: Almost everyone was outstanding, and I'd be utterly disappointed if Lupita takes away Lawrence's Statue.<br/><br/>Music: A good mash-up of old classics.<br/><br/>Overall a one time watch flick, well made, yet a bit boring. 6.7/10."
"slgarber85","7","2","3","26 January 2014"," Great Acting, OK Plot.
","This movie has gotten a lot of buzz, and I decided to watch it after it won the Golden Globe for best comedy. For me, the movie itself was just OK, but the acting, costumes, and music were all amazing. Christian Bale is at his best as the lead in this film, and Jennifer Lawrence has some of the best scenes in the movie. All in all I am a little confused about how I feel about this movie. It starts well, I was initially engaged and interested to see what happened. The middle dragged a little bit, and it was hard to keep my mind from wandering. Thankfully there is a great cameo by Robert DeNiro in the middle that grabs your attention and gets you back on track for awhile. By the end of the movie though I was happy that I had sat through the whole thing, I really enjoyed how everything ending up playing out, and found myself smiling at the end of it all. So while I wouldn't call this movie a must see, it certainly is not a waste of time either. If you have a night to kill, give this movie a shot and at least enjoy the great performances, if not so much the slightly slow plot."
"cynmonares","5","2","3","24 January 2014"," this movie is SLOW. Not as good as it looks.
","the Positives: Excellent cast, good acting. Beautiful 70s costumes. Believable. Excellent soundtrack.<br/><br/>the Negatives: the story is SLOW. Something about the writing, it seems nothing much happens for most of the film. the movie is TOO LONG. I kept waiting for something to blow me away, but nothing. I left the movie feeling underwhelmed.<br/><br/>If I had watched this at home, I would have fallen asleep for sure, and would have not been motivated to go back and finish the movie.<br/><br/>Also, I do NOT think anyone on this film should win any kind of award (specifically Amy Adams or Jennifer Lawrence). Not that they weren't good, because they were great, BUT I think other actors in other movies deserve to win (ex. the lead actress in ""12 Years a Slave""). The actors in this movie seemed like they were just *playing*, having fun (exception: Christian Bale, who is scary, the way he transforms)."
"tomgillespie2002","7","2","3","21 January 2014"," A big dose of strangely endearing entertainment
","American Hustle is all about large characters, outlandish fashion and awful hair. It may tease you into thinking it's some kind of smart con- artist movie with it's (very loosely) based-on-real-events premise (""some of this actually happened"", the opening credits inform us) and snappy trailer. But for all visual pizazz, this is in fact a very small movie, focusing on a small set of unique and frequently bizarre characters that just happen to cross paths amidst the ABSCAM operation in the late 70's and early 80's. Imagine if the characters from I Heart Huckabees (2004) were in fact the people who took part in the operation covered in Argo (2012), and you'll have something akin to American Hustle.<br/><br/>Paunchy con-artist and loan-shark Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale) hooks up with the beautiful Sydney (Amy Adams), an intelligent and ambitious American girl who improves Irving's scams by pretending to be an English aristocrat. When they are busted by creepy FBI agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper), they are promised leniency if they assist the Bureau in making four additional arrests. The plan is to entrap popular Mayor Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner), who is looking to inject funds into gambling in Atlantic City, by having a friend pose as an Arab sheik looking for potential investments in America. As Irving, Richie and Sydney delve further into the sting, things start to spiral wildly out of control, as Irving's loud-mouth wife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence) can't seem to keep her mouth shut, and Richie develops feelings for Sydney.<br/><br/>As said before, the plot plays second-fiddle to director David O. Russell's obvious fascination with this ensemble of weirdo's. Surprisingly, it's the slimy swindler at the centre of it all, Irving, that comes out of it the most recognisably human. In the opening scene, we see a shockingly bloated Bale, slapping his awful toupee across his head to cover up an embarrassing hairline. Is this the American Dream at work, a petty criminal posing as a sophisticated, honest guy? Well, no, American Hustle doesn't need to try and touch those metaphorical heights, but this is the type of person we're to spend the next two-plus hours with. An apparently successful sort of guy, covered in gold and eyes covered by tinted sunglasses, but hiding something fragile or dangerous that may soon reveal itself.<br/><br/>The performances are spectacular, as one would expect. Bale manages to make you actually root for his slimeball character, and Jennifer Lawrence shows that she seems able to tackle any role or character with aplomb. Cooper does a job similar to his previous work with Russell, Silver Linings Playbook (2012), but even betters that. He seems to have the uncanny ability to make you instantly know there's just something wrong with his character, and when we see him at dinner with the fiancée he clearly doesn't love or respect, his hair bunched up in tiny little rollers, there's something simply tragic about him. And Amy Adams, let loose here to reveal an unseen feistiness, wins the award for Side-Boob of the Year.<br/><br/>The whole thing is a rather strange experience, never really falling into a recognisable genre or taking a conventional approach to storytelling. It could only really come from the mind of David O. Russell, the only director that seems able to combine a mixture of mainstream commercial success, nominations and awards a-plenty, and independent sensibilities, never really moving away from his own vision. It's not a total success of course - Irving's admiration from the 'moral' Mayor Polito, who just wants to rejuvenate Atlantic City, seems a bit of a sympathy quick-fix, and no-one can out-Scorsese Martin Scorsese. Well, maybe Paul Thomas Anderson can. But American Hustle is a big dose of strangely endearing entertainment, that even when it outstays it's welcome towards the end still made me want to spend more time with the characters.<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"
"rsabnis1","7","2","3","20 January 2014"," Ingenious, refined and crisply scripted
","A movie's fate is driven somehow by a powerful factor of the star cast; a kind of actors that people would love to see interacting on screen. David O Russell uses this over utilized cinematic weapon of an ensemble cast for his con-film 'American Hustle'. Along with Eric Warren Singer, The Silver Linings playbook director also managed to have a lion's share in formulating the screenplay. Impeccably refined, masterful performances and reflection of sheer ingenuity is what American Hustle offers to the audience. The film gets us through some clichés and prodigal deviations but overall it bestows a worthwhile experience for the cinema lovers.<br/><br/>The pot-bellied Irvin Rosenfeld sets up a fake company to grant loans to the needy people thereby having an expertise in money laundering. His success reaches a capstone when Sydney Prosser walks into his life. Posing as the British lace curtain 'Edith Greensley', Sydney assists Irvin and both gradually become the 1978 con experts who succeed in controlling various scams but finally end up getting caught blatantly by The FBI. FBI agent Richie Di Maso (Bradley Cooper) arrests the duo on the charges of earning money by fraudulent schemes. He offers them immunity but in exchange wants them to aid The FBI to conduct a massive bust which will put the Mayor Carmine Polito and other politicians including the congressman behind bars.<br/><br/>Di Maso falsifies the identity of an Arab Sheikh who apparently is his Mexican friend. He, guided by Irving and Sydney together indulges in convincing the Mayor Polito about Sheikh's active interest in conducting business with him. Carmine Polito is the one to be struggling to assemble funds to resuscitate the Atlantic City. The trio uses Mayor's very keen desire to invest into Atlantic City as the driving force to bring him and other corrupt politicians to ground. Jenifer Lawrence plays Irvin's wife Rosalyn who is rather a piquant personality rather succumbing to being impulsive & manipulative throughout. Robert De Niro who plays a Mafia kingpin Victor Tellgio makes an impressive cameo. The most striking factor of the film is that deeper the film takes you inside the plan; more layers of this operation begin to unravel making it completely embellishing.<br/><br/>American Hustle has a crisp screenplay as the characters spring to live and engages you throughout the duration. David o Russell's direction poses as a strong reminder to Martin Scorsese's 'Goodfellas' and 'Casino' following its narrative which enhances the experience throughout thereby giving Russell's ambitious nature a strong highlight. The script is sleight but lucid. The movie however successfully manages to break the monotony of action sequences and burlesque comedies in cinema and provides a rich perpetual experience.<br/><br/>However, I sincerely feel 'American Hustle' strongly exemplifies how a con-film should be presented on the celluloid."
"avik-kumar-si","5","2","3","19 January 2014"," Not one for the ages, but good entertainment nonetheless
","American Hustle is the top dog at the Oscars this year with 10 nominations, including the big ones for Best Motion Picture, Best Director and Best Performance in Leading and Supporting Roles for both actors and actresses.<br/><br/>It is this stunning advertisement that served as insurance as I went to catch the film on the big screen this Sunday (January 19). And it has to be said that American Hustle is very good entertainment. A tale of greed, con jobs and ambition – it has the perfect ingredients for weaving into a tight narrative. And this is what David O. Russell does so coolly.<br/><br/>The comedy is the best part of this film, with situations, mannerisms and characterizations all leading to moments of fun and laughter.<br/><br/>The casting by Lindsay Graham and Mary Vernieu deserves high marks. The film is littered with stars, but each in the right place. Christian Bale, in the most important role as Irving Rosenfield, is fabulous. His dedication to the art is visible in the opening sequence itself. The Batman sports a paunch in American Hustle, and not a small one too. But preparing physically is one thing, and getting into the skin of the character is another. Bale is just superb as a con-man caught in a difficult situation, both at home and at work. He portrays his condition with aplomb, drawing both sympathy and laugh at his comically pitiable state of affairs. Amy Adams as Sydney Prosser, Rosenfield's suave partner, delivers another flawless performance. But a special mention must be made of her co-star, the young and talented Ms. Lawrence. At 24, she already has a burgeoning list of performances under her belt. Katniss Everdeen and all that is all very good, but this one is a top-notch performance from her. While she makes it look quite easy, getting right the neurotic wife of a high-flier, cheating criminal husband here is just a proof of her wonderful skills and abilities. The scene where she confronts her rival, the beyond-her-league Sydney Prosser, is already being written about and even compared to the Michael-and-Fredo scene of The Godfather II – and for some reason. Even in the face of the pace of the film (mostly driven by the need, I feel, to keep up the comedic action), Bale and Lawrence, especially, provide moments of fine acting.<br/><br/>In a film of this genre, the plot is a make-or-break factor, and the plot of American Hustle certainly has enough meat to keep the viewers' interest alive for its long running time of 138 minutes."
"thesar-2","7","2","3","18 January 2014"," Niro De Niro
","Grifters, they're not, but they bring a pretty good American Hustle to the screen.<br/><br/>There's a good surprise to expect towards the end, but the one that surprised me most was when Robert De Niro shows up. Yeah, it's a gangster-kinda film, so, naturally, he would. But, what threw me was that Christian Bale basically portrayed a young Robert De Niro this entire film. So much so, in fact, I could never see Bale. Just De Niro.<br/><br/>So, it was odd seeing them both on screen at the same time.<br/><br/>Beyond that, you do have some damn good performances from the female leads. Amy Adams, whom I always see as a Muppets lead, did great here, but she was outshined by the always fantastic Jennifer Lawrence.<br/><br/>Those two, Amy and Jennifer, actually did so well, that you nearly forget about the male leads (and their terrible wigs) in this feature.<br/><br/>I digress. This movie, about lowlifes who get caught and have to turn tricks now for the feds is decent enough. Not great, but watchable through to the end. Sadly, it's really nothing I haven't seen before and yet, the humor, music and performances did make it watchable and interesting. I wouldn't necessarily vote it into the Best Picture noms from 2013, but you could do a lot worse.<br/><br/>* * * Final thoughts: Jeremy Renner's always been a favorite of mine, as is Jennifer Lawrence as of late. Sadly, neither portrayed their best performances here, but still did what they could. Though it would be nice for the nominated Lawrence to pull in another Actress Oscar win, my eyes are centered in on Julia Roberts in August: Osage County."
"knoxfan2008","5","2","3","15 January 2014"," Good, but ultimately a bit disappointing
","David O.Russell's last 3 films have all had something in common. They are clichéd and formulaic, yet the individual aspects are much greater than the whole. 'The Fighter' was fun and grounded by a great Bale performance, 'Silver Linings Playbook' hid under the guise of being ambitious and original whilst giving us a horrendously out-of- character and contrived last act. American Hustle is somewhere in between these two.<br/><br/>It is consistent, yet runs far too long. After an hour it runs out of steam and just becomes repetitive and derivative of other crime dramas we have seen a million times before. Yet like O.Russell's other recent efforts, the acting is top-notch. <br/><br/>The performances, especially by Lawrence, Adams and Renner are all great, yet the director does not seem to have confidence in the story or the dialogue, and instead uses star power to cover up this fact. For example, Jennifer Lawrence is much too young for this role, and even though she gave a great performance, she just looks out of place. The same goes for Renner, again, good performance, yet the Mayor should have been portrayed by a man closer to late 50's or 60's, do they expect us to believe that Jeremy Renner would have 5 grown up children when he barely looks a day over 35?. O.Russell's indulgence is most obvious in his casting of Robert DeNiro in a tiny, unimportant part as if to say ""Hey look, Travis Bickle is in my film for a bit"". This casting choice is just distracting and totally takes the audience out of the film. If you need a big actor to show a character's importance, then your not making an in-depth character. <br/><br/>However there are some good details in the film. Costuming and the set- designs are nice (Even though they over-indulge in Amy Adams' V-necks). The music is great (But it being the 70's, it would be hard to screw it up) and some of the humour works well (though a lot falls flat and tries too hard).<br/><br/>Over-all, I liked the film, but was disappointed as a whole. It is in no-way a bad film and it will definitely hold your attention. However,it was not original, and despite being set in a world of excess, did not have interesting cinematography like peers 'Boogie Nights' or 'Goodfellas'. O.Russell needs to be more ambitious and creative next time, because at the moment he seems content at just making better-than-average, non-challenging and formulaic films, yet not truly being brave enough to make something new, risky or innovative."

","How to waste good performances with a bad script and an uninspired directing.<br/><br/>The cast is good in this one. Really good.

I was kid in the 70s, but I don't remember women not to wear their bra all the time. <br/><br/>Oh and the cinematography... who had the brilliant idea to film it with an ""instagram"" filter? The hairdos, the costumes weren't enough to portray the era? we needed the ""old photography from the 70's"" filter? So annoying.<br/><br/>In conclusion, no spark,no rhythm, no tension, no highlights just the cast and the efforts of the editor to give us the ""Good Fellas of Hustling"", but good editing alone can't help bad directing and storytelling.<br/><br/>Another hyped movie that will collect nominations and probably awards for being just above average.

"SDAim","5","2","3","10 January 2014"," I really enjoyed the soundtrack . . .
","From all the hype and buzz surrounding this film, I was expecting to be blown away. I was not. To me, it was just okay, and the best part was the music, the hairdos, and of course, the clothes. The storyline was a little confusing, and, as someone else commented, it was hard to find a single, likable character to root for. I thought, at first, Bradley Cooper was going to be that guy, until he went completely wacko and turned out to be the worst of the bunch.<br/><br/>Also, I really like all of these actors and thought their performances were great (Christian Bale slipping into an unintended Al Pacino impression a couple of times, notwithstanding), but it was a bit like watching ""Silver Linings Playbook"" all over again. I don't know why it bothered me when David O. Russell recycled his cast and it played like a re-run, but someone like Woody Allen or Christopher Guest can do it and the film feels fresh and funny. I think, at the end of the day, perhaps Mr. Russell isn't my favorite director in the world. <br/><br/>At any rate, if you go not expecting too much, the experience is worth it, especially since the story is somewhat based on actual events. However, if you are trying to choose between this and a lot of the other fantastic films out this awards season, perhaps save this one for a NetFlix rental."

","A movie that tries to stress the seriousness of the moment and the consequences of failure, falls short of instant classic as its most dramatic scene takes place around a folding table. The stellar cast holds the piece together although the lack of depth within the script makes its stars work for it. <br/><br/>The flow of the film is displaced by slow motion dance sequences that are one extra dose away from complete trip fest. The end of the film evokes the questions: were there real consequences for any person and what was the point of this portrayal?

The stakes never felt dire enough for the characters to do what they had to in the end, but somehow maintaining the growth in their persona's that they were not ready to achieve. Denial leads to destruction, Unwillingness to change leads to loss, and Arrogance leads to destruction are the premises I found that were trying to be portrayed through this movie and its characters. Some of these were elaborated on and characters did fulfill their rolls of certain changes in their lives, but when trying to cover so much a lot was left through the cracks."

","When you see the trailers and posters the first thing you notice about American Hustle is how many nominations it has including best picture at the Golden Globes! So it's quite hard to go in with low expectations. <br/><br/>The film starts with a slow almost boring pace and the only thing that holds your attention is the superb acting performances particularly from Christian Bale and ​Bradley Cooper. Yes it is funny and rather slick but it seems the set up of the story is just rather dull and for some lazy reason the scriptwriter chooses the characters to narrate for nearly half an hour. I found myself wondering if I was watching a nature programme rather than a film. <br/><br/>However, the writer then let's the characters come to life and the film finally gets going, the pace picks up and the acting becomes even better. As Bale's character Irving and Amy Adam's character Sydney go deeper and deeper into the world of 'conning' you begin to join them in this unpredictable, dangerous world. Cooper who plays Richie DiMaso is a cop blackmailing them into framing some very dangerous people!<br/><br/>Overall it's a good film but definitely not worthy of the best picture nomination. The acting however is. Bale is superb but to be honest Cooper totally steals the show, and we shouldn't forget Amy Adams and Jennifer Lawrence who are both exceptional. <br/><br/>A fun and enthralling film but maybe needs a re-cut on the first 30 minutes!"

I question all this great reviews under mine, are they real? Are the written by people connected somehow to the production? Is IMDb legit or just a tool for commercial purposes? Do this same people rating great Anchorman 2? This movie was for an actor like Bruce Willis, Vince Vaughn, or a B list or less actor, not Christian Bale. It's the first cheap movie that he makes that I know off. The movie was boring at first, and then you get a little bit interested. It's not a bad movie, the problem is that the whole build up of greatness with an awesome cast and great theme is just to upscale for the final product. Christian Bale is Awesome, Bradley Cooper have his moments, the Blond Girl Over Acts like a Dumb Super Bimbo (Maybe she is not acting) and the FBI Supervisor Guy I was sure that in some part of the movie he was going to turn into a Vampire."

It's never entirely clear if Bale's character or Adams' character have a specific goal in the story. They just sort of... do what they do. And I can't remember ever seeing Bale's eyes even once, which is odd and creates a significant barrier into his character for the audience. <br/><br/>The camera work was painfully awkward and distracting and one could sense the editor's struggle to find optimal edit points in the strangely choreographed camera moves.<br/><br/>The oddly written script was poorly paced and had a disjointed quality to it that I can't put my finger on. <br/><br/>It was nice to see Elisabeth Röhm finally in a big studio film. <br/><br/>I think DOR should have let this script percolate a while longer before execution of the film. It just seems poorly developed and the half-baked narrative isn't quite as amazing as Three Kings, Boogie Nights, or Silver Linings Playbook.<br/><br/>I give it a 1/10 here only to offset the number of 10/10 votes but to me, it's a 6/10."

And for the most part, it is a good show; a bit too ungainly in its narrative sprawl--encompassing not just the complex nature of the operation, but also the messy lives that the characters navigate on a daily basis (repeated scenes of jealousy get redundant after a while)--but smart dialogue and the gaudy/glitzy production maintain interest all the way. Top-notch ensemble cast delivers, especially Cooper and Adams, though the real star of the film is the men's hairstyles, some of the (intentionally) worst one would find in a major motion picture.

"Magow-Intermean","9","1","1","7 April 2019"," American Hustle Review
","1978. Seasoned confidence tricksters Irving Rosenfeld (Bale) and Sydney Prosser (Adams) cut a deal with FBI agent Richie DiMaso (Cooper) to dob in other offenders in return for clemency. However, Irving's loose-cannon wife Rosalyn (Lawrence) threatens to derail the plan.
This opens with a caption that claims its story is ""mostly true"", which has in the annals of crime cinema historically covered a spectrum of veracity and mendacity ranging from In Cold Blood to Fargo, but tries to position American Hustle as more significant than the average twisty con-inside-a-con crime movie.
Like Pain & Gain, it's as much a portrait of the excesses of its era as it is criminal reportage, with an unusual emphasis on 1970s hairstyles as symptoms of the Carter years. The opening shows Christian Bale, demonstrating his Machinist super-power of altering his body at will by sporting an impressive paunch, applying the toupee, glue, spray and hair-sculpting moves necessary to create his disco comb-over. Later, the film gives equal time to the tiny and huge curlers Bradley Cooper and Amy Adams' characters require for their respective 'dos.
Writer-director David O. Russell reunites with the stars of his last two movies - Bale and Adams from The Fighter and Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence from Silver Linings Playbook - and again gives them roles all-but-guaranteed to land multiple awards nods. Russell seems to be the go-to guy for talents whose profiles have been raised by blockbuster superhero movies but want to show they can still act without spandex and CGI, with Jeremy Renner joining the gang as the world's most likable and honourable crooked politician. There's even room for an unbilled surprise guest appearance by a screen legend who has been relaxing of late but can still turn on the steely menace when prompted, cast as a Mob boss who springs a disorientating surprise at a crucial stage in the con by talking directly to the fake sheikh in actual Arabic.
However, American Hustle is a showcase rather than a truly great movie. The intricate, attenuated plot threatens to address corruption in America but any point keeps getting lost in its own trickery. Unrepentant con men, crooked politicians and (even) murderous Mafia bosses are more honest and admirable here than the FBI sting operatives out to take them down. The message might be to leave institutionalised crime well enough alone - Rosenfeld seems to express the script's message when he says that ""after Vietnam and Watergate"", the country doesn't need another disillusioning political scandal. Besides, the film keeps showing us that con men are fun - they have enviable dress sense, live large in a way the movies are hardwired to admire more than plodding decency, and aren't notably more deceitful and money-grubbing than the forces of law and order, just better at pulling the rug out from under the marks and waltzing away with a smile.
On a scene-by-scene basis, it's undoubtedly a dazzling film, albeit with many lifts from the Martin Scorsese and Paul Thomas Anderson playbooks. Casino and Boogie Nights are explicitly evoked, and one flashback might literally be a GoodFellas outtake. The camera prowls through '70s luxury hotels and suburban homes, wincing at the thick carpets and the eye-abusing curtains, pausing to relish the kitschy tableware or clunky furniture. It makes persuasive use of a double album's worth of 1970s chart hits, with major dramatic moments sold by selections from Elton John's back catalogue.
Meanwhile, Lawrence cements her current can-do-no-wrong status in an extraordinary scene, just after her character has set a fiendish revenge scheme in motion, as she sings along to Live And Let Die while aggressively cleaning her house in yellow kitchen gloves and gloating over the deadly pickle she's just landed her faithless husband in. Cooper is stuck with the least rewarding role, but keeps finding brilliant little bits of business to hold the attention: watch him do spot impersonations of his overly cautious (but smart) boss during a premature victory celebration. Bale, in velvet jacket, and Adams, in dresses so low-cut that double-sided Sellotape must be involved to preserve decency, play conners who are always on - Adams' Sydney poses as British aristocracy with a Diana Rigg accent for most of the film - but gradually show their real personalities and become appalled by what they've got into, though the film becomes less convincing when its brittly amoral double-dealers start showing a rudimentary conscience."

","""American Hustle""'s inherent theme of reinvention is one I appreciate, but my enjoyment was derived (surprisingly) from outside the central Bale-Adams-Cooper trio. Though I did like the fast one they pulled at the end, I didn't really care about these characters. Jennifer Lawrence, though she seemed too young for the role, was riveting in her hot mess of a performance. Michael Peña and Louis C.K. were also highlights. <br/><br/>But it was the technical side that I liked the most: the soundtrack, the production design, the wardrobe (splendid array of plunging necklines), the old Columbia logo before the opening credits - the general '70s vibe and atmosphere that was damn well created.

","The performances in ""American Hustle"" were fine. It was competently directed and didn't beat us over the head by constantly screaming ""it's the 70s!"" But it didn't really serve the movie to stretch what should have been 30 minutes into 90. We don't need to worry about learning about the characters because their voice-overs give us that info.<br/><br/>After the first 1:30, it does pick up a bit, but other than not knowing the exact details of how things are going to unfold, we're TOLD that things have been set into motion. There are no surprises in how these play out, and at the end you're just thinking, ""meh.""<br/><br/>Take care."

","As I've gotten older, I've learned to appreciate more than just action and comedy movies. 5-10 years ago, I probably don't see this movie. Needless to say, I'm extremely happy I did.<br/><br/>It's a drama movie, but the chemistry between the actors is superb. And the way they interact and respond is quite funny. I laughed for probably half the movie. If most of this was improvised like I've read, than these actors deserve even more credit.<br/><br/>Christian Bale's transformation makes him look like a completely different person. The very first scene is showing him doing his comb over and it takes a couple minutes and you just have to laugh.<br/><br/>Amy Adams is gorgeous, period. She's a brilliant actress and this might be her most risqué role yet. She was perfectly cast and has a British accent for most of the movie. She's essentially playing 2 characters and I enjoyed every minute she was on screen.<br/><br/>The others including Bradley Cooper, Jeremy Renner, Jennifer Lawrence, and a cameo by Robert De Niro, are all perfectly cast as well. I loved Jennifer Lawrence and thought she had the best lines in the movie. Every time she was in a scene I enjoyed the movie even better.<br/><br/>I hope this gets the best picture award it deserves."

","what you have is one of the best performances of the recent times by the ""entire"" cast (not just couple of them). Christian Bale is the master of makeover and is so much into character and at times hard to believe that the same guy played the famous caped crusader. Amy Adams was fabulous in ""The Master"" and is completely convincing as a conniving ruthless seductress. Jennifer Lawrence is adorable, playing that crazy, eccentric and loud mouthed wife - she might be the best female actor to have happened in last few years and next decade or so belongs to her. Bradley Cooper is great with his funny hair playing that over-zealous fed who wants to shake the whole system. I might be stretching it, but Renner has that aura of Joe Pesci. I absolutely loved everyone in the movie. <br/><br/>For me the story/plot was not the most original of all. If you have seen many of these, you know how it is going to end and who is gonna win. Sometimes, the predictable trying too hard with the cover of unpredictability (and all those twists and turns) can be off-putting. But, script is extremely tight and gripping. The chemistry between all the characters is almost natural. The dialogues are well thought and are timely hilarious. The camera and lighting, the costumes, hair-dos all take you to that 70-80s era. In all, a great job!"

","this review might contain spoilers, you have been warned!!! (no big ones that would ruin your life though) :)<br/><br/>so i decided to watch this movie last night with a friend and i had previously read some reviews before the movie started about how good this film is, so i though i might watch it and find out myself. American hustle is about 2 con artists Irving Rosenfeld (Christian bale) Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams) being caught red handed and are forced to work for a wild FBI agent, Richie DiMaso (Bradley cooper).<br/><br/>The film is alright and is not alright in are lot of areas, the acting is absolutely superb with Christian bales perfect role of Irving Rosenfeld and Bradley coopers Richie DiMaso. unfortunately Amy Adams didn't play as well as i thought she would in this film and Jennifer Lawrence was so out of place in this film, although with that said she did play her part quit well throughout the film as the wife to Christian bale. And Jeremy renner did a great job as the mayor.<br/><br/>the film lacks progression (it didn't make it clear, at all) the film starts out perfectly, but about half way/ three quarters the way through you'll find yourself very confused with whats going on and lost within the plot of the story. its not until the end that it kind of makes sense with a twist that is good but is confusing because you were already lost within the story itself which kind of ruins the ending a bit to be honest. although upon a second viewing of the film I'm sure my opinion would have changed. <br/><br/>American hustle defiantly did not live up to my expectations and i think that the film is overrated at this time with a rating of 85/100 on meta critic. i will also be very disappointed in the academy if this film wins any awards other than acting and screenplay.<br/><br/>so with the brilliant acting and alright story the film deserves a ✭✭✭1/2"
"gotchaby","6","4","9","28 December 2013"," competent but derivative
","This gets a pass, but only because I didn't feel like walking out after 20 minutes, like I normally do when I make the mistake of going to see a movie. Some are comparing American Hustle to Goodfellas - this comparison is plain redundant. The problem is that it has none of the panache and (controlled) manic energy of the Scorcese classic, therefore its attempt at pastiche is a failure, and it ends up just being painfully derivative. However, this does not prevent the director from indulging in a woefully egotistical self-reference regarding a forgery of a Rembrandt painting. The line goes something like ""Who is the master, the painter of the original, or the forger?"", ie ""Who is the master here, Scorsese....or ME?"" (!!!). The use of music is too deliberate, and falls easily into the 'soundtrack in search of a movie' category. We're also a bit tired of over the top depictions of 1970's fashion, hairstyles, etc. Overall,a rather klunky piece of self-indulgence."
"cdjh-81125","10","3","6","3 July 2016"," At This Point It's Not Overrated It's Underrated
","David O Russell's American Hustle is an extremely controversial film and I don't understand that controversy because I think this is an amazing crime thriller that reminds me of classic Scorsese movies. This movie on the wrong hands could have been very boring but it's not this movie is one that entertains me from start to finish and that's because of Russell's direction he maintains a fast pace and consistent tone that keeps me loving this film every time I watch it. The performances in this movie are all fantastic for one Bradley Cooper absolutely steals the show here he's amazing in this movie because he makes his character so unpredictable and unhinged but you can't help but be excited for when he gets back on screen. Amy Adams should have got the Oscar for this movie because she is such an unpredictable character your never completely sure where she's standing but you still route for her. Christian Bale gives another one of his legendary Body transformations in this movie and he gives one of his finest performances here because you can't just help but like him despite all the bad things he's done and continues to do. I love the fact that this movie was set in the 70s it just makes the film look more glamorous and Russell captures the period perfectly I didn't live in the 1970s but after watching this movie I feel like I have. The narration in American Hustle works which is good because if done wrong it can become very frustrating and overloading but helps you understand that characters mindsets and motivations. But without a doubt my biggest issue with this movie though is Jennifer's Lawrence's character don't get me wrong I love Jennifer Lawrence she gets way to much hate and she's fantastic in this movie but her character has far to much screen time than is necessary and it gets on the viewers nerves quickly. Overall I adore American Hustle it's a fantastic film with terrific performances, great direction and an entertaining, fast paced plot. A-93%"

","No apologies! Yep, I bought the DVD set that includes the digital copy. Admittedly, the first time I saw ""American Hustle"", I was taken back, annoyed, confused, and uncomfortable---during the first 15-20 minutes. Then I settled a bit. As I became familiar with the roles played by Amy Adams and Jennifer Lawrence, it became interesting and entertaining for me. Following this first viewing, I also saw other nominated films of 2013, which led me to wonder had I seen any yet worthy of Academy Award, and if so, which ONE! So I returned to see American Hustle again. That's when I fell for this movie and it became my choice for top movie. Movies that I would never want to see a 2nd time can not qualify, by my standards, for movie of the year. There were actually several that I would see again. ""Captain Phillips"" and ""12 Years a Slave"" are not among them. Kind of reminds me of my rage when ""ET"" did not get movie of the year!! ""Gandhi"" did. I ask, ""what's your score on multiple viewings of these?"" OK, my ""review"" is basically defending my ultimate enjoyment of ""American Hustle"". What was confusing was, of the four actors, who was ""Best"", and who was ""Supporting"". They were each incredible. But the gals were stunning in there roles. And ""the mayor, Jeremy Renner"", was outstanding. I'm just glad the DVD set came with the iTunes digital, so I can truly watch it anywhere, anytime....

There is wonderful humor in the film all designed to make us laugh at ourselves as a broken culture struggling through the '70's.

Jeremy Renner is Carmine Polito, the passionate, volatile, New Jersey political operator caught between the con-artists and Feds. <br/><br/>Irving's unpredictable wife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence) could be the one to pull the thread that brings the entire world crashing down.<br/><br/>Overly long movie that likes to do that retro 70s look and thinks it's kewl. Bale in his imitation of a Tony Soprano accent owns 2 dry cleaners, a glass repair and deals in art but somehow he acts and dresses like he makes $3 a week.<br/><br/>About 15 minutes into this you'll get antsy.

Jennifer Lawrence was ATROCIOUS, too broad, like a parody. Neither the Amy Adams character nor the Christian Bale character were remotely sympathetic. I guess we were supposed to get caught up in their love story (?) or feel sorry that Bale has a heart condition (who cares?) The movie uses too much voice-over in the first half hour, which is always the sign of lazy storytelling. Even when the voice-over disappears the storytelling doesn't pick up.

The soundtrack was great.<br/><br/>Bale, Cooper, Adams, Lawrence and Renner ... and De Niro ... were exemplary of actors incredibly deep into character; they were all barely recognisable and each performance was gripping, believable and impressive. Jennifer Lawrence, girl du jour, was luminous as the unstable and rather irresponsible wife of Christian Bale's overweight, balding hustler; he was quite gross in many respects. Cooper was the over zealous FBI Agent who you sort of wanted to win out but the whole film was back to front in that good guys were perhaps the crooks, or were they? It was a little of a grey area. He was sexy, funny and obnoxious in equal measure. The script was great, the plot was great ... as a con-artist movie this is up there with the greats BUT it was largely unsatisfying emotionally. It was a really good film but not really all that enjoyable. Sure, it was entertaining and laugh out loud funny in places but it wasn't a comedy, was definitely drama, and watched more like a documentary than a film. It was good but one came away feeling a bit underwhelmed. None of the characters were particularly likable and whilst the story was gripping, you weren't invested in the characters, just curiosity about the story. It was, I can only describe it as, an empty and unsatisfying experience and the ending... I don't know, it didn't please.

","What do you get when you put together accomplished actors like Christian Bale, Amy Adams, Jennifer Lawrence, Jeremy Renner and Robert De Niro? Answer – Not much.<br/><br/>OK, another one. What do you get when you throw together Directors like Martin Scorsese, Quentin Tarantino, Guy Ritchie and Wes Anderson? Answer Forgettablefellas oops I mean ""American Hustle"", broadly speaking a poor imitation of ""Goodfellas"".<br/><br/>Based on the mostly true details (there is a disclaimer to that exact effect, right at the beginning of the movie) of the well known ABSCAM case of late 70's, Director David O. Russell picks up actors from his previous movies (The Fighter, Silver Linings Playbook) and also brings in Robert De Niro for a quick cameo appearance but fails to recreate any of the past magic. It is evident that Russell is heavily influenced by fast talking, profanity spewing, dysfunctional and flawed con men/women characters of Scorsese, Ritchie and Tarantino. The movie does have the scope of being ambitious, fun, entertaining, smart, darkly comic, sophisticated adult fare however it fails to live up to the hype and expectations because at the core of the movie is a weak and crumbly script. The narrative is uniformly murky and poorly paced, even incoherent at times.<br/><br/>So what does Russell do? To keep the audience engaged he indulges in amateurish and pointless distractions (Jennifer Lawrence doing a cringe worthy imitation of Wing's rendition of ""Live and Let Die"" and many such examples.) I would love to see J Law appear in a musical in near future. Talking about the music score, there are many little gems here – Elton John's Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, Santana's Evil Ways, Led Zeppelin's What is and what should never be, Killer Papa was a rolling stone and others.<br/><br/>But soon the viewer realizes that the movie is deliberately trying to distract you (garish costume, smelly nail polish, boob show necklines, fake accents, over the top hair-do's, side stories et al) as it has very little to offer you by way of substance. But to give credit where it is due, Russell keeps the movie visually engaging what with overall production design, coiffure hairstyles, garish costumes and some funky 70's music.<br/><br/>However, what truly stands out in the movie is its two lead female characters – Amy Adams and Jennifer Lawrence. Both are absolutely glorious, conniving, terrifying, manipulative, sexy and spectacular all the way. Adams has an edge over Lawrence. While regrettably, Lawrence does not get enough screen time, Adams' is a more nuanced character with a lot more screen time. Adams takes her character and does magic with it infusing it with flesh, charm, vulnerability and her own personal touch. ""American Hustle"" is owned by Amy Adams. This is probably her best performance ever. Amy Adams is definitely the front runner for Academy Award for Best Actress (at the time of writing this review she had already picked up a Golden Globe). <br/><br/>While ""American Hustle"" disappoints sorely from a story, script and direction point of view it still managed to hold my attention on the basis of its entertaining characters and its visually appealing look and feel."
"Michael Kenmore","6","3","6","6 January 2014"," Fragmented and bizarre story on the American farce, replete with overacting
","After seeing a few David O. Russell films (in spite of his personal problems, especially the infamous bipolar-type outburst on the set on ""I Heart Huckabees,"" the movie I never saw because the word of mouth was bad referring to the complaint of pretentiousness), especially the stellar and moving The Silver Linings Playbook, I went to see ""American Hustle,"" piqued by the reading of the stranger than fiction story on political corruption.<br/><br/>The movie is middling at best, harmed by some disjointed editing and structure, which explains the near-incoherence of the story. Non-linear is intentional, but it's difficult to follow the movie with complete comprehensibility the first time, befuddled by frequent ensemble overacting and rapid-fire dialogue (often profane) that only serve to annoy.<br/><br/>The film probably contains the most overacted ensemble in the history of the movies. Everyone overacts to the painfully embarrassing effect.<br/><br/>Despite suffering the flaws, the movie is half-riveting and half- tedious. I can't decide which, but it is simultaneous. I noticed a few walkouts of the young adult moviegoers to return 15 minutes later, in the middle of the movie, completely missing the story, probably to their confusion arising from the short attention span.<br/><br/>""American Hustle"" demands attention throughout to comprehend the plot with the dizzling turns and twists that even confound me as to the plausibility. It asks the audience to suspend disbelief momentarily, which is stretching the truth, typical of Russell's penchant for comical exaggeration that throws the allegation of the true story in question which is true and which is completely made up.<br/><br/>The movie, being inane and implausible with the elaborate scam conspiracy followed by the police entrapment, reminds me of the cheesily produced television show with Jonathan Flake, ""Beyond Belief: Fact or Fiction,"" which I recollect I saw at the turn of the century. That is now the staple of the Sunday morning cable programming with the marathon programming, which brought back memories. <br/><br/>Watching the movie conclude, on a spectacular note despite the bizarre structure of the movie in terms of pacing and dialogue, with the insanely clever plot twist reminds of this television program. <br/><br/>Pursuant to Russell's style in allowing freestyle improvisation, the movie is consequently strange and frequently off-color, that makes it a little boring to watch, trying to pay attention to the story without getting lost in the process.<br/><br/>As aforesaid, everyone overacts, even the uncredited role of Robert De Niro, for what reason I wouldn't know. The director lets them act as they like, without the measure of control by both artists.<br/><br/>It shows to the degree of shtick. Even Jennifer Lawrence overacts in this movie, in contrast to her tempered and nuanced acting roles, including her Oscar-winning role in the other Russell movie.<br/><br/>I was fascinated by the constant action of the movie as directed, being freestyle but also formless that lend to the palpable tedium and confusion as the result of recklessness at the vain attempt to achieve the artistic value.<br/><br/>There's not much to be said about Christian Bale being deliberately overweight, imitating Robert De Niro's Oscar-winning role in Raging Bull. Bale is a fine actor, but in this movie, he's forgettable, as is the guiltily overacted Bradley Cooper. (There is the scene towards the ending with Cooper that is so overacted it was weirdly off-putting.)<br/><br/>The noteworthy stars of the movie are the quietly commanding character of a FBI field office director played by the (foul and frequently antagonistic) comic C.K. Louis and the ""is-she-British-or-is-she-not"" scam artist played by Amy Adams, who emoted superbly in vulnerable characterization without being phony deserving of an Oscar (like Jennifer Lawrence in another emotionally taut role), a departure in 180 degree turn from the innocuous Disney movie ""Enchanted"".<br/><br/>Not a bad movie, but not a great movie either, blamed on the director's inability to maintain control, letting the actors go wild like mustangs, with the strange and non-linear structure, resulting in the incoherence and near incomprehensibility of the point of the movie. <br/><br/>Overrated, but serves as a good study how not to screw up the production with freestyling, which may explain the lack of necessary disciplined filmmaking in artistic and technical collaboration. I know how editing works, being directly involved in work, but the structure is a mess.

","I very much looked forward to this movie, especially after having watched ""Dallas Buyers Club"" and ""Argo"", which seem to have started a trend. ""American Hustle"" starts really strong, with Amy Adams and Christian Bale making great choices, but then into one third or the movie, I lost interest in the plot. Overall, the sets and costumes are great and most of the Actors work well together. The pacing feels alright. I generally like the look and the feel of the ""Hustle"", including the title font. Compared to the hustling ""The Manhattan Dating Project"", this movie adds a bit more entertainment, since it does not only covers hustling and getting digits, but has a heist as well. In comparison, both movies cover the Zeitgeist pretty well."
"salehamasud","8","3","6","4 January 2014"," a pressure cooker of drama and action
","About 2/3 of the way through I needed to take a breather from the pressure that built up in the scene of confrontation between two characters Jennifer and Amys' characters. I felt like leaving the screen room-but I didn't want to miss anything. The directer paces this film so well and builds the drama that you don't notice the length of the film. The suspense throughout events unfold perfectly that you seamlessly break through the pain barrier of tedium when you sit through a film so long and hit a euphoric stage. I love it when a lengthy film manages that for an audience- everyone in the packed audience was gripped.<br/><br/>Each character is measured out perfectly in this film. Even brad cooper and Jennifer Lawrence's' excesses adds dimension to their character. Amy Adams and the unusually humble character of Bale are quite complex because they go the through dilemmas during the film and see that they sort of react to the situation the best way they know how; these characters are both wrong and right in a very accessible and human way.<br/><br/>I was expecting the director to put these characters above the above audience and on a pedestal showing them as experienced masterminds of hustle(kind of like in now you see me or oceans 11). But there's no real convoluted heist, deception or misdirection just a clever Amy Adams making it up as she goes along.She does some really good acting despite having to wear eye wateringly booby dresses throughout the whole film.That is what is refreshing about the film,the characters appear to just make it up really well, to survive the situation they find themselves with all the ""big sharks"" circling them. Calling it American hustle in the sense that hustle films currently regarded is a little bit of a misnomer. But I wont grumble.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is a pleasant surprise and reminds you how good these songs were; I think they complement the events in the film.<br/><br/>Clearly the director didn't want to have to choose between gripping, suspenseful, fast paced events and a character driven film so he did both and I applaud the decision.<br/><br/>You have to see this film! 8/10"

","Time magazine's Richard Corliss wrote, ""American Hustle is an urban eruption of flat-out fun — the sharpest, most exhilarating comedy in years. Anyone who says otherwise must be conning you."" Peter Debruge of Variety was critical of the film and questioned the nearly unanimous praise, calling it ""a sloppy sprawl of a movie"" and criticizing the plot, complaining that the improvisational performances overwhelm instead of adding to a coherent plot.<br/><br/>As for my opinion, there was 10x more drama than comedy in this movie. The acting, character interaction, and dialog were above average, and it held my interest from start to finish. It was hard to determine which character was the lead and which were supporting as they were all so very good. It had sort of an amateurish feel to the cinematography at times, like it had been filmed by a hand-held video camera and that I was being made privy to some clandestinely taken FBI film footage...very engrossing. As I left the theatre, I was thinking ""I need to go and read the book."" But there isn't a book, so seeing it twice, and then again, is my only option which I certainly intend to do once it's released to DVD."

","David O Russell has once again created a film with fascinating characters who emanate from the darker places within ourselves. They love the ones they shouldn't, they can't control themselves and they think they are cleverer than they really are. All of which leads them down dangerous paths but unlike a lot of characters in film & television today, they do actually learn from their experiences.<br/><br/>The name of the film is an interesting choice also because the whole show is a hustle, each character is trying a con and the society they exist in is a facade. Irving & Sydney are small time fraudsters cheerfully ripping off people who believe $5000 will get them $50000 before they're caught by Richie who uses them to trap corrupt politicians to make a name for himself. Irving's wife Rosalyn uses her son as bait to keep their relationship together and controls her husband with passive aggressive manipulation whenever he comes home.<br/><br/>The only decent characters in the story are Carmine (the target of Richie's sting operation) a politician who is actually doing his very best for the people of his district and Richie's superior Stoddard who's cautious approach and drawn out ice fishing story results in him being ignored, beaten and made fun of by Richie.<br/><br/>The irony in the story (and I do enjoy ironic humour) is Carmine is attempting to get funding from an Arabian sheik to build a casino and create employment for the people of New Jersey so for this to happen other politicians apparently have to be bribed. In reality, the alternative to the sheik building the casino would have been a tax on the people of New Jersey to create a centre for gambling addiction, prostitution and drug trafficking....like I said earlier, the society they live in is a facade.<br/><br/>Thus we have Irving & Sydney doing what they do best, an unwitting Carmine doing what he believes to be best all acting for an overly ambitious Richie who becomes more and more corrupted by his power. Every single actor disappears into their character thanks obviously to the director but also due to the wonderful costumes and hairstyles of the day. Truly the seventies was a dark period for fashion from the hair to the glasses, the paisley shirts, the plunging necklines and the fur coats it is an assault on the optic nerve but this camouflage melts away when the actors are allowed to act. There's some golden comedy thanks mainly to Rosalyn, simmering antagonism between Irving, Sydney and Richie and one of the most tense scenes in years when Victor Tellegio, a Miami mobster meets them to discuss their venture, I was on the edge of my seat.<br/><br/>Everyone did a great job on this one. The costumes as mentioned earlier, the soundtrack is a time machine and the narrative is tight. The characters have depth, emotions and motivations and I really engaged with them from beginning to end. These are real human beings caught in the headlight of an oncoming train and they're doing all they can to get off the tracks."

","Watching American Hustle one of the things that truly got to me was how back in the day when J. Edgar Hoover ran the FBI nobody like Bradley Cooper's character could ever have gotten employed in that agency. Let alone have the FBI use someone like Christian Bale as a pawn in a sting. Hoover was such a stickler for straight arrow types that Cooper could never have gotten in the door. Of course Hoover also never went after organized crime, but I can't help thinking that his quirks about dress and deportment weren't completely bad after seeing American Hustle.<br/><br/>American Hustle is the story of the Abscam scandal and with a lot of poetic license it's an account of how it was almost an accident that several members of Congress were ensnared with bribery charges. <br/><br/>Our protagonist is Christian Bale who plays a low level conman, but one who is good. He's got as a sidekick Amy Adams who affects an English accent as part of their modus operandi. He and Adams are both trapped by FBI agent Bradley Cooper who in his own way is as much con artist as they are. Instead of arresting them, he admires the way they work and turns them into his own operatives.<br/><br/>It's impossible to proceed with further plot description. The investigation just gets away from any control and instead of mobsters they're taking down members of Congress who are bribed to get citizenship for phony Arab sheik. In the end Bale has to use some of the techniques employed in The Sting to get out from under.<br/><br/>American Hustle is about a world that is intoxicating and dangerous. Bale and Cooper are evenly matched pair of allied antagonists. Amy Adams sure gets her innings in. There's also Jennifer Lawrence whom you will not forget as Bale's wife who with her own selfish dizziness may get them all killed. All four were nominated for acting Oscars and not one of them won. In fact 10 nominations went to American Hustle and it did not take home a winner.<br/><br/>All four of these players sublimate their own personalities into their characters to a degree rarely seen. Christian Bale in most of his films does that to a degree I've not seen since Paul Muni. But that all four did here is a tribute to director David O. Russell.<br/><br/>Like the Scorsese classics Goodfellas and Casino, American Hustle changes all the names so a lot of license can be used. And of course with Robert DeNiro playing a small, but unforgettable role as mob boss, the identification is complete.<br/><br/>American Hustle is a film not to be missed."
"jzappa","5","4","10","4 January 2014"," Talk About Being Conned, Everybody! Come on!
","The opening scene of Irving Rosenfeld, arguably Christian Bale's furthest left-field role so far, refining his comb-over and crowning it with a spray of aerosol heralds the start of something great. Alas, it was all drivel thereafter.<br/><br/>David O. Russell's raid on grifters and graft in the late 1970s is full of smug put-ons. Though he has selected a cast entirely comprised of hype-magnet zeitgeist stars to draw the crowds, it only exacerbates the self-seriousness of the script, which is pandemic with high camp and laughable pageantry. These people talk way too much. About nothing. Just for Russell's pride in his own riffing. <br/><br/>Beginning with the title card, ""Some of this actually happened,"" the film unceasingly reminds us---often through various characters in carelessly derivative voice-over---that life is a con game, and we all lie. We lie to others, we lie to ourselves. And that it's the American way. And American Hustle isn't clever about making this point. It makes it, makes it again, and in case you didn't get it the first few times, a character says it out loud. Then another one does. And before you know it, you find that it's the self-congratulatory Russell and his overrated cast, not to mention the hordes of critics raving about it, that are conning themselves.<br/><br/>Like Russell's other films, there is quite a bit of humor, but in this case, not all of it is intended. One scene has Jennifer Lawrence going on and on about her nail polish over an important dinner with Irving and Jeremy Renner playing an Italian-American mayor. What initially is marginally charming descends rapidly into a maddening sequence, much too long and breathtakingly vain. And symbolic of the movie in its entirety.<br/><br/>The dialogue is so labored, so artificial and pretentious that everyone involved must've felt too highly of themselves to probe as deeply or use thinking as critical as they all have in past work. Certain scenes seem either pedantically constrained, just have no purpose, or both. Take for instance a particularly eyeroll-inducing ladies room showdown between Adams and Lawrence, while numerous lines are groaners. ""After Vietnam and Watergate, we're just starting to trust politicians again."" Seriously? ""I just want to be loved!!!"" What is this, Clifford Odets? ""My dream was to be anyone but myself."" Thanks for telling me, you self-mythologizing drama queen.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, when you didn't think the GoodFellas and Casino procurements were transparent enough, there's De Niro in a fleeting cameo as a vicious mobster which has no more effect than that of a gimmick of a declining legend riffing on his career staple.<br/><br/>Even the essentially perfect casting of comic genius Louis C.K., in just the kind of bit role I could really get used to seeing him play, can't relieve the film of its hollow ego trip. Once you've unraveled the movie's trendy gloss-over, you've got an overblown wannabe of an undertaking, stuffed with nothing more than the bluster of hand-me-down inspiration, gaudy artifice and lugubrious schtick."
"Red_Identity","Null","5","14","22 December 2013"," Exhilarating, spectacular fun!
","I want to start off with this... I love this movie. Why? It's true what so many are saying, it's just incredibly entertaining and just so, so much fun! That's really what it comes down to. The only other O Russell films I've seen are The Fighter and Silver Linings Playbook. The former I thought was decent if totally formulaic, and the latter I thought was fantastic although still somewhat formulaic. Russell shows a different kind of energy here that I hadn't seen from him in those two films, and he shows that he has a more distinct vision than I would have imagined. The plot here really is messy and sometimes hard to follow, but what keeps it endlessly intriguing is the cast and many single individual scenes that manage to work completely on their own. This shouldn't be how a film functions, and it's a surprise the film is as great as it is because it really is all over the place sometimes. But it all works.<br/><br/>There are many great performances here, but the single best is Bradley Cooper. Who would have thought two years ago that the Hangover jerk- looking guy could actually act, but wait, that he could actually have an incredibly likable screen presence and steal a film from so many of his co-stars! That's what he does. He releases a kind of energy here that he didn't reach in Playbook and steals away most of his scenes. The other comparable to Cooper is Lawrence, who's also having a blast with all of this. It's like someone let these two come up with their own things and weren't given rules to go by. There's a spontaneity to them and the whole film really, and it pays off tremendously. They both benefit from having some of the funniest material. Bale is great, as expected, but for me, Amy Adams resonated more. In the past, she'd always been hit-or- miss for me, but after last year's wonderful work in The Master and now this, she's becoming someone I'm actually liking a lot. Jeremy Renner has much less screen time than the other four, but he nails the role in his limited screen time. In short, these five make up the strongest ensemble of 2013, unlikely to be challenged by any other cast. <br/><br/>That's pretty much what the film's success comes down to. Its cast (and I didn't even mention all of the other great supporting turns) makes this a roaring great time. It may not have the emotion or gravitas that films like 12 Years A Slave or Gravity have, but it might just be better as a more accessible movie-going experience."

","If you liked Martin Scorcese's work, especially ""Casino,"" then you ought to love this one because the writer/director, David Russell, is to Scorcese as Brian De Palma is to Alfred Hitchcock. Not only is the plot redolent of ""Casino"" or ""Goodfellas"", but the techniques belong to the same family -- loud intrusions of 70s pop tunes, rapid dolly shots into someone's tense face during a crisis, the romantic troubles of the con man hero with his jealous wife and his smooth girl friend. There are narrative comments here and there by two of the actors.<br/><br/>Christian Bale is surprisingly good as the small-time New York Jew who promises to get desperate people a loan of fifty thousand dollars for an irrevocable fee of five thousand, then just keeps the five. Good accent, Chris. But he fades from view about a third of the way into the movie and has only minor functions until the last few minutes.<br/><br/>Amy Adams, as the very savvy phony English aristocrat who is swept up in Bale's schemes, is very, well, sexy although her innocent features seem to glow with the freshness of a Kansas sunflower. The director was courageous enough to give her a few scenes with her hair up in those ugly plastic curlers, while she wears no discernible make up. And, though pallid and washed out, she STILL looks pinchable.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence, who has been in the news a lot lately, looks a little like the younger Leelee Sobieski, something in the slant of her eyes. Her character, the bitchy and conniving wife, was a surprise. I thought that someone whose celebrity depended partly on the hacking of some nude photos wouldn't have much juice, but she can act. She's not as radiant on the screen as Amy Adams but she's not supposed to be, what with her hair piled up into a pompadour, something resembling a fire plug on top of her head and her overall witchiness.<br/><br/>The plot has the confidence team of Christian Bale and Amy Adams being caught by the FBI in one of their transactions. The agent in charge is Bradley Cooper (who also curls his hair into little knots) and he sort of cons them into pulling their stunts on other illegals and on politicians so that he, Cooper, can make a big name for himself. Cooper does his best to keep his hands off Adams, but he manages to come out of the affair the most vile of the bunch. A touch of Sidney Lumet. (See Lumet's ""Prince of the City"" for a comparison.) But then, whatever interest the story and the performances had is drained by the imitative techniques, which go far beyond Martin Scorcese into some kind of decadent hell. The actors must have been told to improvise some bits of business because some of the exchanges sound exactly like improvised bits of business from other films.<br/><br/>Adams and Lawrence have a vicious exchange in the ladies' room. ""You're all gross inside."" ""I'M all gross inside? YOU'RE all gross inside."" ""Maybe we're both gross inside."" I didn't make that up. Nor am I making this up: ""Waddaya mean?"" ""Waddaya MEAN, what do I mean?"" The film is too long by, say, half an hour. And some of the actors must have been given free rein in their improvisations because the scenes become unbelievably raw, ridiculously excessive, shouting and screaming, smashing furniture in a fit of pique.<br/><br/>I hope Russell makes more movies because a successful film, not commercially but emotionally, is just a matter of successive approximation."

Soon the trio are working together with a scheme to prove political corruption through a senior New Jersey politician, Cermine Polito (Jeremy Renner) who wants redevelop Atlantic City. But the operation is complicated by a mutual dislike between Irving and Ritchie, Irving's developing friendship with Cermine, Irving's wrecking ball of a wife, Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence) and a love triangle between the trio.<br/><br/>American Hustle is a excellently acted film as you would except from the cast of this talent. Bale goes through another physical transformation, giving himself a massive beer belly and Lawrence went to full gusto as a dizty, yet very manipulative woman who has Irving wrapped around her little finger. Adams also gave a surprisingly strong English accent for her character's false identity.<br/><br/>David O. Russell is a director who has had great recent track record and actors want to work with him. Russell does inject energy and wit throughout the film. There is a Scorsese style to the film as we see multiple story lines, the use of multiple voiceovers and different viewpoints and even the brief flashbacks. Russell was able to bring us back to the 70s with the period details and he does want to replicate the look of a Scorsese film. American Hustle also has a great soundtrack.<br/><br/>Throughout the film the questions of who is really in control of the situation and the constant manipulation and power plans between the characters as Ritchie and Irving trying to gain control of the situation and show they are the one who knows how to handle the operation whilst the women in between the men also look for their own self-determination and in Sydney's case her own survival.<br/><br/>Renner does play a small supporting role in the film but gets to play an interesting character, a politician who wants to do the best for constituents and his state, sees redevelopment of Atlantic City as a way to give people jobs. But he comes up to a system where he cannot get support from the Federal government so has to turn to act illegally to do what he thinks it is best. It would have been interesting to have seen the film from his point of view, exploring political morality and reality. This investigation also raises the question about whether the operation was entrapment, making someone an easy target so they can get an arrest and result instead of someone who is actually bad.<br/><br/>American Hustle is a very well made and acted film that does provide a crime film fix. But it is a good film, not a masterpiece that some critics are claiming it to be."

The only problem is that the agent decides to go after some even higher rollers. If you take THE STING and mix it with GOODFELLAS you're going to end up with this film and under the loving care of Russell and the terrific performances you're really left with a true gem of a film. There are so many wonderful elements to this film but I think the greatest thing has to be the screenplay, which constantly leaves you guessing as to where the next twist is going to come from yet it never out smarts itself and it certainly never gets too confusing for those watching. Russell has proved himself as someone who can take a worn out genre and make it seem fresh and original. He did this recently with boxing (THE FIGHTER) and oddball romance (SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK) and he's done it again here. You really do get the feel that you're watching a film taking place in the 70s as the atmosphere is just perfect, the cinematography flawless and the music selections are just brilliantly used. Of course it also helps that you've got such a stellar cast and everyone of them doing excellent work. This includes Bale who is just simply amazing at the way he can transform himself into any role no matter how big or small. There's not a single frame of this film where you don't believe he's this character. Then you've got Adams and Cooper doing some of the strongest work of their career and the same can be said for Renner. Then there's Jennifer Lawrence in a small but very important role as the rather dimwitted wife. How many times have we seen the dumb wife role? Countless times but Russell and Lawrence bring a fresh and original take here. There's also a surprise cameo that I won't ruin for those not wanting to know it but man is it powerful. American HUSTLE is without question one of the best films of the year and it's also a perfect example of being able to mix laughs with slick twists and some tense drama."

The story here - which is based on real events, at least somewhat - isn't the greatest, but the film is an absolute tour de force, bolstered by some truly brilliant performances and an assured hand behind the camera. There isn't a better cast this year. In addition to the four I've listed, comedian Louis C.K. is just brilliant in the deadpan role of Cooper's disapproving boss.

When it was about to bear fruit, Richie fouls the sting by deviating from Irving's plan, and Carmine leaves the meeting.<br/><br/>Irving and Sydney save the day. Irving gets Carmine to trust him; this was a major effort. Sydney helps the FBI come up with just enough good faith money to convince Carmine and his people that they have a serious investor (a sheik) to re-energise the rebuilding of Atlantic City. Irving's friendship with Carmine continues to deepen, and Carmine insists that Rosalyn get to know him and Dolly socially. Rosalyn takes to this social whirl very quickly.<br/><br/>Richie loses his composure when things work despite his foul-ups. He keeps pushing the FBI to make larger attempts to get bigger stings.

","Reminiscent of light-hearted caper films such as The Sting, American Hustle captures the look and feel of Hollywood films of the seventies and can boast of some of the finest acting performances of the year. The film starts off with two scam artists in cahoots with each other but, before we are through, we have met a Mafia kingpin, a fake Arab sheik, a popular but corruptible Mayor, several on-the-take Congressmen, a dangerously honest wife, and some personally unbalanced FBI types. It is played mostly for laughs, however, and nothing to get upset about, that is, unless you think that depicting predators without empathy, who do not care much about the law and about who they hurt, ought not to be so much fun.<br/><br/>Directed by David O. Russell and co-written by Russell and Earl Warren Singer, the story is loosely based on the Abscam case of the late seventies where an FBI sting operation, partially directed by con artist Melvin Weinberg, used fake Arab sheiks to convict a New Jersey senator, six congressmen, and the mayor of Camden for taking bribes. Coming not far after the political fallout from Watergate, the dubious credibility of the Warren Commission, and the illegal and unpopular Vietnam War, the scandal further contributed to the decline of the American people's trust in their government.<br/><br/>Beginning with a tongue-in-cheek inter-title that tells us that ""Some of this actually happened,"" American Hustle is filled with a relentless energy that does not flag throughout the film's 138-minute length. We first meet middle-aged pot-bellied Irving Rosenfeld portrayed by a bulked-up Christian Bale. Irving has a dry cleaning business which is a front for his lucrative art-forgery scam and his illegal loan shark ""business"" where he promises to get desperate people the loans they need, then bilking them out of their money without providing any service. Things look up temporarily for Irving when he falls in love with Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams), a stripper who has reinvented herself as slick con artist Lady Edith Greensly, an upper crust British executive.<br/><br/>When one of their clients turns out to be FBI agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper), however, they are threatened with jail time unless they agree to use their scamming abilities to work for the bureau. Richie is an ambitious schemer who has set his sights on the higher ups in the political and crime world and is busy working on a plan. The idea he comes up with centers on rebuilding the Atlantic City waterfront to make it a haven for casinos and organized crime. To this end, DiMaso sets a trap to bring down the popular but corruptible Mayor of Camden, Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner), along with a few Congressmen and some upper echelon crime bosses.<br/><br/>Richie doesn't count, however, on the loose lips of Irving's wife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence) who does not look too kindly on her husband's partnership/affair with Sydney and who uses Irving's adopted son to hold onto their marriage. Rosalyn's sing-along rendition of Live and Let Die achieves a mixture of humor and sadness that is one of the film's high points. Things go further downhill when the fake Arab Sheik Abdullah, in reality a Mexican Fed named Paco Hernandez (Michael Pena), is caught in his Sheik act by Mafia kingpin Victor Tellegio (Robert de Niro) who, to the surprise of everyone, speaks the Arab language.<br/><br/>As the film goes on, the characters become more over-the-top and the plot becomes more and more convoluted. By the time it ends, everyone's veracity is so compromised that it is hard to tell the difference between the swindler and the victim. The performances are such stand-outs, however, and the fun so contagious that it hardly matters anyway. American Hustle may not be the most profound statement ever made about the corruption that lies just below the surface of the American dream, but it is definitely one of the most entertaining."

"juoliver-70482","9","2","4","18 May 2017"," An historic event altered into a good screwball thriller.
","Real facts stories always have attracted filmmakers. Historic tales offer some feeling of truth to the cinema stories. Always will be controversy among moviegoers about fidelity and treason to the historical truth. Whenever a historical person o era is portraits somebody will question the fidelity to the facts. Warren Beatty was probably aware of this and populated REDS with interviews to a gallery of real people, as they were at the real time of the movie-making. They were present, somehow, during the life of John Reed. They commented about those times with their own thoughts. Watergate turned to be a wonderful thriller about the work of two journalists and not about Nixon. Both journalists were credited with William Goldman as responsible by the script. Serious, committed filmmakers have realized good movies out of historic events and moviegoers have shown to be attracted by them. Actual facts give a structural base to the script, a generating point from where it could come up an interesting, brilliant movie. Now the important thing in this genre is to deeply develop such factual themes and relate them to the movie story, which by now will probably become tinted with the filmmaker's ideas. American hustle has been successful in processing the material of a once newsworthy event from late 70,s early 80, which now is not totally installed in the country's collective memory. The real Abscam was in itself an official cover operation and its planning notes could have been the synopsis of a B-spy movie. American hustle used the blueprint of the scam as the movie line and from it created a cast of characters and sub-plots very complex, rare and chaotic converted into a web frame from where develops a story that is credible thanks to the intelligent construction of scenes with characters moving and talking organically and in unison with the screwball spirit of the story. Apparently there was a real Irving (Bale character) and a real mayor Polito (Renner character) who were functional to the factual story both with personal traits and history to nurture these great actors' work but the final product was the task of profoundly creative study of characters and its integration to the story. Jennifer Lawrence and Amy Adams are extremely accurate in their roles. Bradley Cooper had a great composition of a FBI agent unlike to most typical portraits of Intel agents. He is success- hungry, probably to vindicate his own history as a person and have not scruples and little dignity in achieving the goals he is setting for him and the operation. At one point early in the movie we have forgotten the actual history and we are immersed into a movie rich in textured characters and attracting script with an organic discourse of tension and fear, going much faster and complicated than the characters and spectators have asked for. The film's look expresses with precision an era and an event that it is not to far removed in time. David O. Russell was able to organize a chaotic storytelling by keeping a consistent atmosphere directing a cast of odd characters in a space that is dangerously edgy. As moviegoers we sense the climate and fell the uncertainty of the unknown next step. American hustle is a film that proposed an unusual historic thriller and it was accomplished."

","There is a tendency in America to assert one's individuality by refusing to listen to ""the so called experts"". Whether it be from an academic or a film critic, no one wants to be told what to think or how to feel. The problem with this anti-intellectualist attitude is that it causes those who hold it to often overreact to many things that the ""experts"" almost unanimously agree on. In extreme examples, one is forced to deny hard scientific evidence, as in the case of evolution or global warming. In milder examples, it means giving a one star rating to a film that quite clearly deserves more. I believe that is why you find so much hatred toward this film in the user ratings and reviews on this site.<br/><br/>Like many, I had high expectations when I first saw this film. After hearing all of the critical praise, much of which did seem a bit over-the-top, I felt somewhat let down. A few years have passed, so I decided to give it another chance, this time from a more objective position, and with much lower expectations. I was truly mesmerized. It was as if I had seen a completely different film. Everything from the Scorsese-esque directing by David O. Russell to the actors completely disappearing into their characters was as close to perfection as one can ask from a film. Watch it without an agenda and you will enjoy it as it was meant to be enjoyed, because in the end it was made to entertain, and it certainly did that for me."

","Low-life con artists, glitzy trophy wives, smooth wiseguys, hyped up cops and career politicians all collide in this homage to a time past. In keeping with the adrenaline-fuelled nature of the lives on display, the whole production seems to be on uppers, moving breathlessly from one emotionally-fraught scene to another. Make-up, prosthetics, and acting at the top of your voice are all taken to extremes. Christian Bale, Bradley Cooper, Amy Adams and Jennifer Lawrence all ooze period sleaze and amorality. Bradely Cooper tries too hard, and playing him opposite Louis C.K. tilts things too much towards pastiche. Tonally, the film seems to ride too high and fast. We are barely given time to reflect on any of the absurd, horrid actions seen on screen. Like The Wolf of Wall Street, the film seems to indulge in its characters and period too much, when a more objective scalpel might be called for. The whole aesthetic also mimics Goodfellas far too closely. This feels like a film I saw before, only done better, and with more consideration. Entertaining in parts, there is something slightly unpalatable about American Hustle."

","Despite being on a good streak after The Fighter and Silver Linings Playbook, David O. Russell returns with this American Hustle that is, unfortunately, deadly boring. The movie never manages to shift gears, evolving at a false rhythm from start to finish : every time the plot seems to be gaining interest, it all goes downwards so much so that it is impossible to get carried away by this story, by the way too little dynamic, too talkative, and whose scenes often drag on with no real justification.<br/><br/>Apart from a few sparkles here and there, the mise-en-scène isn't very glorious either and its relative flatness only emphasizes the heaviness and limpness of the movie.<br/><br/>As for the cast, it's not particularly blamable but it seems O. Russell tried a bit too hard to pile up names to arouse curiosity when in the end, some actors, Renner or De Niro for example, don't have significant roles.<br/><br/>Anyway, even though a few scenes manage to captivate or crack a smile, American Hustle is a disappointment especially in relation to what we were expecting from a director/writer who, apparently, already had proved his worth."
"Carlosmave","10","2","4","7 May 2014"," An intelligent and funny movie with a great cast!
","""American Hustle"" is a comedy/drama film that tells the story of Irving Rosenfeld, a con artist, and his partner Sydney Prosser, who are forced to aid FBI agent Richie DiMaso in setting up a sting operation on corrupt politicians in exchange for their release.<br/><br/>The movie is partially based on the FBI ABSCAM operation of the late 1970's and early 1980's. The characters featured in the movie are fictionalized versions of their real-life counterparts.<br/><br/>The movie is directed by David O. Russell and stars Christian Bale, Amy Adams, Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence and Jeremy Renner. The original script by O. Russell and Eric Warren Singer combines elements of drama and comedy to present the story of Irving Rosenfeld, since his early little crimes as a child to his adult life as a con artist, which led to his forced involvement in the sting operation.<br/><br/>David O. Russell wrote the principal characters having in mind the actors that would portray them, that's why each character fits each actor perfectly. The main cast does an excellent job, Christian Bale as Irving Rosenfeld, the intelligent and resourceful con artist; Amy Adams as Sydney Prosser, Rosenfeld's seductive and equally intelligent partner; Bradley Cooper as Richie DiMaso, the ambitious FBI agent; Jennifer Lawrence, always amazing, as Rosalyn Rosenfeld, Irving's unpredictable wife and Jeremy Renner as Carmine Polito, the naïve mayor from Camden, New Jersey. The film presents a character-driven story that is greatly benefited by the excellent direction of David O. Russell, who encouraged the cast to improvise throughout the shooting of the movie, which is what made the final result so unique.<br/><br/>All this elements make ""American Hustle"" a great film, a movie that manages to be both intelligent and funny."

My teenage daughter texted the whole time. We had seen the clever trailers during the summer, most focusing on Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper. In retrospect, the trailers were conning us to think it was another Silver Linings Playbook. The trailers certainly did not convey this dreck of a film. The pacing was agonizingly slow and should be studied in film schools as how to NOT do pacing. There was no protagonist and that should be studied in film school as how to NOT emote any sympathy for any character. The acting by Amy Adams was intriguing but we did not wear braless, low cleavage outfits ALL THE TIME in seventies so the wardrobe people got it all wrong. It's insane that Amy Adams won the Golden Globes best actress award over Dame Judi Dench in Philomena or Emma Thompson in Saving Mr. Banks. Also insane is the over-the-top scene-shredding acting by Jennifer Lawrence actually won Best Supporting Actress. More inexplicable is this flick winning the Golden Globes Best Picture over Saving Mr. Banks, Philomena, Catching Fire, Dallas Buyer's Club, Blue Jasmine, Twelve Years A Slave, and Captain Phillips. The Foreign Press Association got it all wrong and if they give awards to a movie of this caliber then they are tools of Big Hollywood who's purpose is to give awards to up and coming actors so movies can make a mint on the next mediocre flick they churn out with the same up and coming actors.

"Likes_Ninjas90","7","5","16","13 December 2013"," Spearheaded by enormously charismatic actors and a script's verbal wit that overrides its untidiness
","Director David O. Russell's new film American Hustle (originally titled American Bullshit) is hilarious chaos. It captures some of the same manic energy as Silver Linings Playbook, mostly through its stunning performances, but it is also scattered in its narrative and storytelling. Some people have compared the film to the style of Scorsese's crime work, like Goodfellas. I don't think it has the precision of that film but what it excels at is a very engaging character study of a criminal network of people, determined to be far more than what they are. Though it is set in the 1970s, the characterisations of its con artist characters and its dialogue quips about the state of the economy forge meaningful parallels to the post- GFC climate of America today. Beneath its sometimes messy and undisciplined narrative is a crime-comedy about the ugly side of the American Dream: greed, status and self-importance. <br/><br/>Christian Bale features as Irving Rosenfeld, a conman who runs a laundromat but is also ripping people off with a money lending business and art forgery. He lives away from his young, crazy wife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence) and their son and instead he finds himself in a relationship with his mistress Sydney (Amy Adams). Sydney used to be an exotic dancer but wants to be something more and uses a false English accent to scam people. When they're busted by the police they're put to work by a hyperactive FBI agent Richie (Bradley Cooper) who wants to work a big operation and bring down a corrupt politician in Mayor Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner), who is intent on rebuilding Atlantic City. Yet the operation grows increasingly dangerous and elaborate, leading to the involvement of a fake Sheik (played by Michael Pena), who is actually Mexican and speaks minimal Arabic, and a dangerous gangster (Robert De Niro in a fun cameo role). <br/><br/>One of the attractions of the overloaded but witty script by the director himself and co-writer Eric Singer is that it is never short on insight into the motives of the characters and unifying these ideas into a theme of personal ambition. As a boy, Irving would smash windows so that he would generate business for his father's windows business, showing the legacy of unethical financial viability in his life. Also significant to his character is a long opening sequence where in the present he is fat and balding and he spends a great amount of time adjusting his hair piece and combing it so that he has the appearance of a much tidier man. It is metaphorical for not just the deceptiveness of his business practices but the way other character's posture too. The dialogue characterises them as not only ambitious but conscious of the power of perception and the way people believe what they want to believe in reaching their dreams. <br/><br/>Both the characters of Amy Adams and Bradley Cooper also strive to improve their lives too. Adams is shown briefly as a stripper, which instils a blind, single-mindedness that her scam work will provide a higher status and true happiness. She powerfully tells Irving: ""You're nothing to me until you're everything"". Cooper's character Richie is a loopy control freak. He is engaged and still lives at home with his mother, determining his motives for wanting to stage an elaborate heist so that he can be famous and earn a promotion. The one character who seems comfortable with themselves is Jennifer Lawrence's Rosalyn, but this is another form of blindness because she is manic, irresponsible and rash, which welcomes some delicious scenes where her unpredictable behaviour threatens to derail some of the missions. Yet there is also a poignant moment where she begs someone not to hurt Irving as he is still the father of her son. <br/><br/>The film only needed some trimming in how it presents a lot of this information. Parts of the narrative are flabby and convoluted and the exposition rushed. The film is also too long, with several montages padding out the running time to over two hours, while a surprise end twist emerges from nowhere. David O. Russell relies dominantly on voice over in the early portions of the film to flesh out the motives and character attractions so important contextual details and exposition points, like the flashbacks to their pasts, are hastily drawn. <br/><br/>Fortunately, when David O. Russell focuses the camera on the faces of the actors he draws career best performances from them. Both Bale and Bradley Cooper have hysterical verbal sparring contests and maximise their screen time with delicious comic energy that is so infectious and fun to watch and listen to. Their dialogue is frequently hilariously and demonstrates sharp comic timing. Under his dark aviator sunglasses, Bale also injects subtle, internalised moments of remorse when he realises he will be destroying Carmine's family. Amy Adams and Jennifer Lawrence both bring forcefulness to their roles, generating a tornado of hysteria and comedy to some scenes that is on occasions electrifying and tense. Lawrence's presence and ability to hold a scene almost singularly is hair raising and scarily confident. <br/><br/>Although the film doesn't have the same amount of satisfaction and sheer joy of the director's last film, it doesn't rest on its star power alone either. Each of the characters and their relationship to one another is integral to the film's thematic goal: the dissection of the American dream, where people will willingly trample one another to get ahead of the curve in troubled economic downtime and the effect this has on families. The film is at its best when these goals and desires clash head-on, spearheaded by enormously charismatic actors and a script's verbal wit that overrides its untidiness."

","There is a lot to be learned from watching American Hustle: <br/><br/>1. An unusual premise is a start, but without well developed characters and a fathomable plot, you are studying a map to nowhere. 2. popular and talented actresses can only do so much in unsympathetic roles, no matter how hard they try and how much skin they show. (Jennifer Lawrence gets to add some color, but can't change the basically tedious arc of the story line and action deadening dialogue) 3.. Good directors occasionally misfire, even one with the talent for Silver Linings Playbook. 4. At some point, at some level, we want to be One of Them, the characters we see on the screen...to live outside of our lives for two plus hours and get some kind of transformation or change as a result. But with American Hustle, . I didn't want to be someone routinely taking other people's money in fraudulent loan schemes, or selling fake art ( the Christian Bale and Amy Adams characters), nor did I want to put a notch on my FBI agent gun by taking down a well meaning politician for attempting an unorthodox way of raising money to rebuild a slumping Atlantic City (the Bradley Cooper character ). No one was likable or relatable, although I woke up for a tense five minutes in which Robert DeNiro morphed into a senior mob apparatchik who throws the schemers for a loop by speaking Arabic to a faux sheik set up by the FBI. Still, this little delight not worth the time wasted. I don't want to be one of them and I don't particularly want to watch them, either. Save your $$, if you want to stay impervious to scams including those perpetrated by the Hollywood publicity machines."

","Some say that for a film to be truly successful it must have a main character you can sympathize with. I am not sure if this film does all yet I found it interesting and thought provoking. Maybe it is because I was there, North Jersey in the 70s, I was unable to look away.<br/><br/>Amy Adams as Sydney Prosser, just doing what she had to do to get by, Christian Bale as Irvin Rosenfeld playing the odds just trying to make a buck, and he ends up the films moral compass, Bradley Cooper as Richie DiMaso, the misunderstood FBI guy who just wants he get ahead and nobody likes, not even the FBI, Jennifer Lawrence as Rosalyn Rosenfeld, the Jersey accent is worth the ticket price alone and Jeremy Renner (and his hair) as Mayor Carmine Polito, family man extraordinaire who justifies his crime by saying ""it was the right thing to do"".<br/><br/>Some films have action, some scenery and some like this film focus on characters, quirky funny characters who when you look closely are not that different than people you knew back then, you just don't remember so much polyester and you are sure there was not so much low cut cleavage. <br/><br/>A fine film well worth seeing."
"dromasca","9","4","13","27 December 2013"," smartest film of the year?
","I really needed this film two days after watching and being so disappointed with Gravity. I am pretty sure that American Hustle will make ways less money than 'Gravity' and will get less Academy Awards if any. It is however a much better film in my opinion, smart and sensitive, funny and entertaining, and in its way represents much better today's (or yesterday's) America.<br/><br/>The story happens in the late 70s – early 80s in Manhattan and part in New Jersey, these two settings which may provide the background for more than half of the movies about America today, and is based in part on the real story of an FBI investigation that discovered wide-spread corruption in the local and national politics. In order to infiltrate in the local environment the Bureau investigator (Bradely Cooper) devices a scheme in which he blackmails a couple composed of a con man (Christian Bale) and his partner and lover (Amy Adams) are sent to lure a local politician and then other by offering them bribes. Same as in director David O. Russell previous film Silver Linings Playbook, (also set between NJ and NYC) none of the characters is really normal, they all have their non-negligible dose foolishness, malice and stupidity.<br/><br/>There are two reasons for which American Hustle works well. The first is that the structure of the script is well designed, and the characters are very credible with all their goods and flaws. The second is that Russell's style of directing his actors enhanced the feeling of authenticity. Russell picked a team of very talented actors whom he knew well from previous films and let them create and improvise each their own roles. The result is bright. Christian Bale is hard to recognize physically, he is a smart and pathetic, loving and cynical con man. The actor of so many feel-good movies Bradley Cooper is mean and dark. For the first time I have seen here Jennifer Lawrence in a role (Bale's wife) that justifies the praises he received from many critics. Last and best – Amy Adams is unbelievably beautiful and vulnerable – she looks like a 2013 version of the best of what Jane Fonda could be. The cake has a glazing, and it's called Robert De Niro (uncredited for some reasons) – he does the older and tired version of the role he played so many times, and I hope that his devastated looks were just make-up.<br/><br/>Smartest, maybe best American film that I have seen in a while."
"blanche-2","10","3","9","18 January 2014"," do the Hustle
","Christian Bale, Amy Adams, Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence, and Jeremy Renner do the ""American Hustle"" in this 2013 film, directed by David O. Russell, who co-wrote the screenplay with Eric Singer.<br/><br/>It is 1978. Con artist and imprisoned Irving Rosenthal (Bale) and his partner Sydney (Adams) have to work with an FBI agent, Richie DiMaso (Cooper) to bring down white collar criminals in order to be free of all charges. Eventually. Richie and Irving are led to the rebuilding of Atlantic City into an east-coast Las Vegas, a project that will be rich with payoffs to politicians and investment scams. Irving, Sydney (known as Ethel in her British accent) and Richie get to work, meeting with the mayor of the city, Carmine Polito (Renner) who sincerely wants to put people back to work and bring in revenue for the city and state. Unfortunately, he seems to believe the end justifies the means and is willing to break the law to achieve his dream of a gambling mecca.<br/><br/>The situation goes from edgy to downright scary when the mob (led by Robert de Niro) comes to town to talk with the fake sheik (actually from Mexico) about making a $10 million investment.<br/><br/>This is an absolutely hilarious film with wonderful performances and bizarre situations. Part of the beginning is Christian Bale working on his hair, teasing, pasting on pieces, and then spraying. We're actually brought into the middle of a situation, and the film works back. We see Sydney's and Irving's stories, we see them meet and fall in love, and developing their various cons, fake loan sharking (charging $5000 to loan $50,000 but the mark never sees the $50,000) and a fake art scam.<br/><br/>We learn that Irving is married to Rosalyn (Lawrence) and he has adopted Rosalyn's son from her first marriage. For this reason, he is reluctant to leave her. The problem is, out in public, she has a tendency to drink too much and say too much.<br/><br/>Part of the charm of this film is the '70s atmosphere -- gold-dipped wall patterns, carpeting, heavy furniture, black and white photos of babies, the discos, Nehru jackets, bouffants, streaked hair, girdles, stereos, and the music: Bee Gees, Blood, Sweat & Tears, Billy Joel, Steely Dan, America, and Irving and Sydney's favorite throwback, Duke Ellington. I'll admit that I don't really remember the style dress Amy Adams wore throughout the film, cut down to her navel with part of each boob showing.<br/><br/>The film has lively, wild performances by Christian Bale, with a gut sticking out and horrid hair -- when a leading man, especially a handsome one, does that, it gets a lot of attention. But Bale follows through with a great performance. Adams is sexy and funny. Lawrence is hilarious. Some might say that she and Elizabeth Rohm, who plays the mayor's wife, are caricatures, but frankly, they were like a lot of women I've known. Jeremy Renner as the mayor is wonderful - sincere, naive, and a little low class. And Bradley Cooper as a man living with his mother and engaged to a girl from the neighborhood is fantastic as a no-boundaries FBI agent.<br/><br/>Just marvelous, particularly for my generation. I had a blast."

","David O. Russell, the supremely talented filmmaker of films such as 'The Fighter' & the instant classic 'Silver Linings Playbook', brings us the much awaited crime-comedy 'American Hustle'. Now, does it work?<br/><br/>The Answer is neither a yes or a no. To begin with, the film is blessed with Great Performances by its amazing cast. Its also blessed with O.Russell's Stylish Direction. But what it lacks, most importantly, is a Solid Script. The Writing Material is clichéd, though often funny, its never out-of-the-box or awe-inspiring. Though the film begins brilliantly, the momentum keeps going down, especially, in the last hour. One Expected Much More! <br/><br/>'American Hustle' Synopsis: A con man, Irving Rosenfeld, along with his seductive British partner, Sydney Prosser, is forced to work for a wild FBI agent, Richie DiMaso. DiMaso pushes them into a world of Jersey power-brokers and mafia.<br/><br/>'American Hustle' begins so well, that I thought I was in for a joyride! Unfortunately, the Writing surrenders to clichés & the pace drops. Though the characters & their darker-side kept me engrossed at parts, the story as a whole, isn't captivating enough. Eric Warren Singer & O. Russell's Screenplay underwhelms, though there is some genuine merit in it. O.Russell's Direction is Stylish. He handles this crazy-con affair with much style. Cinematography is fine. Editing isn't sharp. Art & Costume Design are excellent.<br/><br/>Now Coming To The Performances! 'American Hustle' works primarily due to its cast, who deliver so wonderfully. Jennifer Lawrence is astonishing as the nagging wife. She delivers a performance that deserves her an Oscar Nomination for supporting actress. Despite limited screen-time, The Academy-Award-Winner is the show-stopper here! Bradley Cooper enacts the overenthusiastic FBI agent, superbly. Christian Bale as a con-man with a bad hairdo, is simply terrific. Amy Adams as Bale's seductive British partner, bares it all, quite literally! She's first-rate, yet again! Among other performances, Jeremy Renner is not in form this time around, while Robert De Niro is spellbinding in a surprise cameo.<br/><br/>On the whole, 'American Hustle' works in parts, but Fine Acting is undoubtedly its biggest attraction!"

"Red-Barracuda","8","2","5","25 September 2017"," Energetic crime-drama with top level acting
","An FBI agent recruits a pair of con artists in a scheme designed to ensnare some corrupt politicians and gangsters.<br/><br/>This 1970's set, New Jersey based crime-drama is a definite success from director David O. Russell. His direction here is unmistakably influenced by Martin Scorsese in full flow and this is of course a very good thing. There is a real energy and inertia to a film with, on the face of it, not an awful lot of action. It succeeds on account of Russell's strong direction combined with a set of superior performances from a great ensemble cast. In fact, it's probably the acting more than anything which powers this one over the line. Christian Bale once again shows his high calibre and totally loses himself in his character, once again going the extra mile physically by putting on a lot of weight to the point of obesity to play a potbellied, balding con-man. It's a great charismatic performance and yet another bit of top level work from Bale. Bradley Cooper is also impressive as the slightly out-of-control FBI agent who also happens to sport a perm. Amy Adams is wonderful as a con woman who feigns a delicious English accent in her role-within-a-role as an upper class British aristocrat who uses her charms to ensnare unwary victims. She also sports an outrageous wardrobe of sexy 70's clobber, which doesn't do any harm. Then there is Jennifer Lawrence in a scene stealing performance as Bale's loose cannon wife who has a knack for manipulating the con man. Those four all put in sterling work and are a joy to watch, and that is to say nothing of Jeremy Renner as the Mayor, a character who would be a one-dimensional villain in most other films but here is probably more sympathetic than the 'heroes'! While we also have an unbilled turn from Robert De Niro as a nasty crime boss – it's probably the kind of thing he could do in his sleep but he is still impressively threatening nevertheless. Additionally, the 70's period detail in which the drama plays out against is another major plus point with great décor, hairstyles and costumes on display throughout.<br/><br/>The story is told partially in flashback which always adds a nice extra dynamic and here is no different. While I would certainly say that the screenplay is very good, I would also be inclined to suggest that the story just falls short of greatness. The plot trajectory has a few twists and turns but doesn't necessarily amount to as much as it promises. Still, this is a relatively minor complaint as the story is still more than decent. The tone is often on humour with some of the comedy being very funny. But it's a good mix of the comic with the dramatic, with the story having enough overall seriousness for the drama to still resonate when necessary. Overall, this is a very entertaining and well delivered movie with its superb acting performances defining it most."

","It's truly a rare occasion to have such prominent cast in one movie, each capable of a leading role on their own, the amalgamation of these talents, coupled with extraordinary directing, make American Hustle a deceptively dark yet charming comedy. In a commentary on how far people are willing to use others for own selfish purpose, these illustrious characters seduce, lie and cheat in an orgy of deceit. It's ludicrous, self-deprecating while still able to be funnily relatable and thoroughly enjoyable.<br/><br/>American Hustle is a story of two con artists, Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale) and Sydney Prosse (Amy Adams), who make a living by setting up small fraud businesses. Unfortunately for them, they are caught red-handed by an FBI agent Richard DiMaso (Bradley Cooper). Now faced with heavy charges, both have no choice but to aid the agent in capturing more high profile targets. The operation soon becomes out of control as they try to manipulate increasing amount of victims and also outmaneuver each other, while dangerous and powerful men caught whiff of the sting operation.<br/><br/>Every time a scene plays out, the actors passionately perform at excellent caliber. Christian Bale transforms himself into almost a completely different person. He looks plumper, wears hair piece and struts with somewhat slouched posture, it's realistically impressive. He shows complacent cautious behavior to mask his sly ambitious side. I admittedly didn't recognize him at some points as he almost merges in the character. Bradley Cooper plays the suave agent, who is Irving's counterpart, brimming with confident and unbridled ambition. The way he portrays his character is explosively brazen, almost obsessively erratic in his endeavor.<br/><br/>Amy Adams as the role of sensual mistress, trademarked by how unwilling she is on wearing bra, has another persona as Edith, the supposed British lady. She shifts between the roles so convincingly, weaving layers of lies with great British accent; she may very well elude the audience. Jennifer Lawrence plays Irving's overly defensive, disturbed and near batshit insane wife. She seems so broken with habitual reliance on dubious men, both using and being used by them. There is one scene where Adams and Lawrence loath each other with such malicious intensity, it's almost creepy to witness.<br/><br/>I like the addition of Louis C.K. as the reluctant cop and DiMaso's supervisor; he brings organic humor to the table, mostly on his own character's expense. Jeremey Renner rocks a flamboyant haircut as the seemingly philanthropic mayor Carmine Polito. Sometimes Renner looks genuinely motivated to do good for his city, also rather too innocent to mingle with the rest of suspicious characters. Robert DeNiro, however, portrays an old mob boss, calculatingly dangerous in short time he's on-screen.<br/><br/>Every minute of the movie practically boasts high level of talent, they are simply captivating, even as they desperately claw their ways by forging fictional version of themselves. Director David O. Russell succeeds in presenting these talents in near over-the-top scenes, which are fairly ridiculous but will make audience can't help but feeling there's a glitter of glamor on them. The movie is clever of its use of twist, although characters' personal struggles are still the essence.<br/><br/>There lie few movies that can rival American Hustle in the quantity and quality of its actors. It weaves a fantastic gripping tale of fraudulence with colorful characters, dancing with the tune of greed."

American Hustle is a movie with wonderful actors that all can carry a movie by themselves with no problems whatsoever. That's the problem though. There are so many amazing actors and actresses, but so little story. The plot to American Hustle was way below par and quite boring. David O. Russell is one of the best directors of this generation. Sliver Linings Playbook was one of the best movies of last year. But this was nowhere near the caliber of that story.<br/><br/>We get introduced to Irving (Bale), an art hustler and con artist (kind of) and Sidney (Adams) his partner in crime. There is no real chemistry between these to as they develop a romantic relationship throughout the movie, but it really falls apart before it even starts. There's no build up to anything in this movie. You're just sat down in a seat and told to watch, but there's not much there. The story is so weak that you're just left watching the actors play there part. But that's what saves the movie. The acting is so good in this movie, because it should be. You expect that. All of the stars in American hustle are stars, and they shine. If they didn't have the stars that were cast in this movie, it would be getting a lot different reviews. <br/><br/>If you go and see this movie, be prepared for a very weak story, but perfect acting by everyone in their parts.

","Filthy, immense personalities with a shared lack of moral compass own the driver's seat in this lingering peek at a late-'70s government sting operation and the flawed individuals caught up in its net. While the titular hustle is, obviously, the driving force behind this film's plot, the lion's share of its effort is spent inspecting the players themselves, rendering each from a variety of different angles and lights. In fact, the first two acts concentrate almost exclusively on the cast, to the detriment of the heist itself - which isn't necessarily a bad thing, just a different approach than I'd expected. Of course, that ratio is flipped on its head in time for the climax, when our slick set of con (wo)men abruptly realize they're in way over their heads and the audience lets out a collective gasp; ""Oh, crap."" Predictably, the A-list actors hit all of their notes with sly ease, with the best - Christian Bale and Jennifer Lawrence - completely disappearing into their roles. Poor Bale has transformed his body in this way so many times over the years - an enormous gut, meticulously bad combover and slumped posture epitomize this particular role - that it's hard to imagine he won't pay a steep price later in life. A few scenes are slower than they need to be, and the focus could stand to be a touch sharper, but without both indulgences this wouldn't be the film it is."

","In ""Casino"" Scorsese made a strong film in film technique and narrative. ""American Hustle"" is essentially another version of that film in its form and how it plays out. The result, though, is a film without any originality, or new ideas, in any way at all.<br/><br/>This takes a standard double cross storyline and uses all the obvious devices to tell the story using reliable and traditional forms such as voice-over to tell the narrative and back story, not to embellish, but just tell the story. It then adds music from the era in a cookie cutter form to gild montage sequences.<br/><br/>On top of that add 1978 costumes, hairstyles and hairpieces and those huge cars and the recipe is complete.

"katherinecmcmanus-881-430673","9","3","10","27 December 2013"," 'American Hustle' - one of the the best films to hit cinemas in years!
","""Some of this actually happened.""<br/><br/>From this first inter-title, David O. Russell's new crime comedy-drama American Hustle (2013) promised two and a half hours of the twisted, the practically anarchic, but most especially, the absolutely absurd - and in the best way possible. Despite its late arrival to the Oscar scene (along with Scorsese's Wolf of Wall Street) and its being overshadowed by Steve McQueen's long-awaited 12 Years a Slave, American Hustle proves worthy of every nomination and accolade to date and lives up to its enormous hype. It is one of the best films to hit cinemas in years.<br/><br/>American Hustle - based on the true story of the FBI ABSCAM operation - follows conman Irving Rosenfield (Christian Bale) and con-woman Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams) after they are forced to work for wild FBI agent, Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper). As they con their way through the story ""to survive,"" the audience joins them, dragged into a world of power schemes that is as lethal as it is intoxicating.<br/><br/>If the subject matter doesn't scream Scorsese's Goodfellas (1990) (or even Mean Streets (1973), if you squint), the style most definitely does. American Hustle's narrative trajectory is almost reminiscent of Casino (1995) in its first person narrative, given from the perspectives of both Bale's Irving Rosenfeld and Adams' Sydney Prosser. Yet, it's no Scorsese in regards to cinematography - and definitely no Guillermo del Toro. From a first viewing, the camera placement and movement remains incredibly simplistic and unremarkable. The cinematography, therefore, simply acts as an enabler for the film's greatest aspects - namely the performances by the A-list cast, and its fantastic script and plot.<br/><br/>The screenplay is simply sensational, creating a remarkable dynamic between both comedy and drama that is so rarely accomplished with films of this nature. Dramatic moments - including a screaming match between Irving and and his unstable wife, Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence) - are immediately followed by hilarious quips and creative dialog that left me gasping for air. Everything about the script is interconnected fluidly and cleverly and moments expressed in the film's infancy reappear later on with greater prominence and importance, all working together to create a story that comes full circle and completely encapsulates its overall themes of reinvention and survival. The story is fantastic, the writing superb - and the plot completely driven by its characters.<br/><br/>Christian Bale, renowned for his dedication when it comes to a character's physicality, immediately astounds with a comb-over and beer belly in his interpretation of lead, Irving Rosenfeld. However, it's his rendition of Irving that truly startles. Bale cleverly crafts a man who, despite his conning nature, is honorable at heart and is uncomfortable with potentially destroying a good man with good intentions (Jeremy Renner's Carmine Polito). Bale could have gone over the top with Irving - he is, after all, a conman from the Bronx - but, instead, he opted for a more realistic, grounded character. It was a fantastic choice, and one that definitely adds to the story's growing tension and drama. This may perhaps be one of Bale's best films. Opposite Bale is Amy Adams, in arguably one of her best showings to date, as well. Her performance as cleverly deceptive Sydney Prosser (or Lady Edith Greensly, if you're on the wrong side of the desk) is punctuated by moments of severe sincerity and emotional turmoil. Adams' prowess as an actress is in top form, and she proves absolutely deserving of her nomination for Best Leading Actress at this year's Golden Globe awards.<br/><br/>In almost a throwback to another Russell film, Silver Linings Playbook, Bradley Cooper plays uncontrollable FBI agent Richie DiMaso (slightly familiar to Paul Solitano in regards to his wild desperation), who is determined to prove himself as a worthy player to not only his department, but his mother and especially himself. Though not Cooper's best performance to date, American Hustle definitely shows off his stuff and solidifies his position as a powerful, talented actor in Hollywood.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence once again proves herself to be one of the most daring and talented young actresses in the business as Rosalyn Rosenfeld, Irving's unstable and uncontrollable wife. In a world of reinvention and masks, Rosenfeld is the only character who tries not to change (""I hate change. I think I'd die before I ever changed"") and it shows through her erratic and sometimes violent behavior - perfectly executed by Lawrence. Simply put, after watching American Hustle, I threw my hands up in the air and exclaimed to a startled audience of moviegoers, ""Just give her the Oscar now!""<br/><br/>Jeremy Renner, though the only actor in American Hustle to not rack up a nomination at the Golden Globes for his performance as good-guy Carmine Polito - gave a solid performance. I could not see any other actor giving Carmine the sincerity and good-guy-politician, go-getter attitude he deserved. Keep an eye out for Renner in the future; that Hurt Locker nomination was just the beginning of what will be an award-stacked career, and American Hustle is a perfect stepping stone towards that future.<br/><br/>If the acting - and pristine characterization - isn't any indication of what an incredible film American Hustle is, just take a look at the Golden Globe nods its received - Best Picture (Comedy or Musical), Best Director, Best Screenplay, Best Lead Actor (Christian Bale), Best Lead Actress (Amy Adams), Best Supporting Actor (Bradley Cooper) and Best Supporting Actress (Jennifer Lawrence). And American Hustle proves incredibly deserving of every scrap of recognition that it's been getting.<br/><br/>If you haven't heard about - or seen - American Hustle, please get yourself out from underneath whatever rock you've been under for the last six or seven months and stomp on over to your local cinema immediately. Also, tune into the Golden Globe Awards on Jan. 12, 2014, where it's sure to give 12 Years a Slave a run for its money!"

When she gets pinched by an eager FBI agent (Bradley Cooper as Richie) they are asked to assist the FBI with four arrests and then they would be let go. Irving reluctantly agrees and Edith helps against her better judgement. The plot leads us to Irving being involved in a bust of organized crime figures (Robert De Niro), something that would lead to his demise and that of everyone he loves. He is in over his head. During the film you know everyone is scheming, but who is going to come out on top?<br/><br/>This is another classic con artist tale. It is a crime/thriller/drama/comedy. The acting was superb which made the script look substandard. Amy Irving is perhaps the sexist we have seen her to date. I never miss a film with Jennifer Lawrence who proclaims ""Thank God for me.""

","Going in to see ""American Hustle"", I really had no idea what to expect. To be honest, it didn't look like the type of movie I would usually be interested in, but that dynamite cast mixed with overwhelmingly positive reviews got me in a theater seat. I enjoyed the film and thought it was an exciting mix of cast interactions, period (1970s) references, and some really great music. I just don't understand why it is being nominated for so many prestigious awards.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""American Hustle"" tells the story of Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale) and Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams), two individuals who, after a chance meeting, set out on a life of ""hustling"" (mainly by charging fees on loans that will never develop). When they are eventually busted by F.B.I. agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper), they are given a deal to work together with the government to take down some ""big boys"" of crime.<br/><br/>The reason this film works so well is because director David O. Russell is such a master of character interactions. He just has that innate ability to pick a perfect cast and then make literally every interaction between them mean something (whether dramatic, comedic, or any other range of emotion). Plus, the 1970s atmosphere is fun to be flung into, complete with vintage clothing, music, and set pieces. There are some negatives to this film, but its main positive is that it has the ability to completely sweep away the viewer and engulf them in every aspect of the movie.<br/><br/>The reason I can't give ""American Hustle"" five stars or consider it a ""classic"" movie? The story is a bit weak. I left the theater (despite being dazzled by the things I described above) thinking ""what was the take-home message of this film?"" I felt as if the plot meandered a bit and wasn't as rock solid as perhaps it could/should have been. Maybe this is somewhat of a Russell ""trademark"", though, as I gave a similar four-star ranking to last year's ""Silver Linings Playbook"" for similar reasons.<br/><br/>Thus, my overall verdict for ""American Hustle"" was that it was a rip-roaring good time at the theater...but nothing worthy of major awards (perhaps with the exception of Amy Adams, whom I thought gave the best performance of the show). I still think that ""The Fighter"" is the best movie directed by Mr. O Russell. Other than that, though, this is a picture that can (and probably should be) watched twice in order to catch all of its complexities."

","Overworked, over styled, over acted and overdone. Very little to keep interested in this overlong period piece with few highlights, no pace, drama, humor or much else. What was particularly grating was the forced accents of Bale and Lawrence. The scenes with Bale and Adams work pretty well, especially the introduction and subsequent love story. The rest of the cast and story falls pretty flat, with Coopers character well over the top, not believable and seems to want to make a whole storyline about his permed hair. Louis CK is totally misplaced as the manager who gets zero respect. I couldn't see the point to his character at all. None of the characters come across as likable or realistic."

Finally Christian Bale, who at this point I pray, pray, pray will continue to work with Russell to develop a relationship of continuing to bring us these over top, multi-layered characters like which we've seen here and earlier in THE FIGHTER.

"Nothinggrandproductions","8","2","6","4 January 2014"," A whole lot of fun despite it's lack of sophistication
","Not a whole lot about American Hustle will be seen as something done differently and creatively pushing the medium of movies as we know but damn is it entertaining. With it's absolutely tasteful and enjoyable 1970s setting and the charming performances by the entire cast, it's hard to not find something to like about this film. On top of that, it has wonderful camera work with some stylistic choices from David O. Russell's previous film, Silver Linings Playbook carrying onto this one, most notably is the usage of fast paced movements of the camera either backwards or forwards that I love each and every time it is used. <br/><br/>The story itself tells the tale of two con people, Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale) and Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams). The movie opens in a very interesting way with a title card saying, ""Some of this actually happened."" For one thing, it made me laugh. For another thing, it sets the tone for what is obviously a black comedy and that to me is a great way of both telling the truth (it only takes partial aspects of a real story) and getting the movie off on the right footing. The main plot of this film takes off after we establish the two main characters, most notably through Christian Bale's narration which at times really works in a very Scorsese sense but at other timesfeels a bit force. Although, some very notable pieces of dialogue come from it and probably the most thought-provoking parts of the moviewhich there isn't a whole lot of, not that every movie needs it.<br/><br/>After the beginning of the film, Irving and Sydney eventually get caught by Richie Di Maso (Bradley Cooper) but they can be dropped of charges if they help him catch four guys, congressmen and a politician played by Jeremy Renner. This leads to some comedic events. Some serious ones. But, overall entertaining ones. Most viewers of this movie will be able to love the 1970s atmosphere with it's music and clothing as I did. Two other notable characters are Irving's wife played by Jennifer Lawrence who provides some fun, comic relief at times but is still a key component of the story with Irving and Sydney carrying an affair. But, probably the true piece of comic relief and a pleasant surprise is Stoddard Thorsen played by the always wonderful Louis C.K. who needs to be in lots and lots of movies after this. He is just so damn hilarious and plays off Bradley Cooper's character the best with a story about ice fishing that is constantly mentioned. Overall, this is a good, entertaining piece of cinema. Is it sophisticated? No, not really. To me, it is a combination of David O. Russell and Martin Scorsese and that comes off as a good thing. The cast is stellar. The comedy works. The narration sometimes works. And it's overall, a really good time, with some occasional thought provoking aspects."

","A great cast, decent setting, excellent story material and a somewhat promising narrative should combine to make a good movie, no?<br/><br/>In parts, the above rings true, however it is all too obvious that after a while, the movie becomes too much of a spotlight for each actor to have their 'moment' rather than carrying on with what starts as an interesting story. <br/><br/>The film turned out to be too much of a comedy for me. The trailers portrayed it slightly differently than that and I went in expecting quite a hard-hitting film based on the thin line between the risk/reward nature of the criminality the story is based upon. Instead, it is soft at best and descends into one-liner territory after the first half. <br/><br/>There is far too much focus on side-boob and not enough on narrative and what starts as an intriguing insight into a fictional story within a larger, truer scandal, unfortunately descends into pretentious nonsense much more interested in allowing the cast to have their head-up-their- own-arse moments rather than fleshing out a story that begins all too well.<br/><br/>Cameo performances from huge actors are only really successful if they either aren't in it long enough to make you want to see more of them (Hugh Jackman in X-Men: First Class for example) but drawing out a potential side plot with a huge actor to then have it fizzle away into nothing is poor. The film was all-but ruined for me the moment I realised the actor in question was not sticking around after his introduction was too involved for me to think his side plot wouldn't be explored.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence shines in a movie that she was clearly miscast in, but I can't think of any reason to give this a second watch. <br/><br/>Disappointing."

","Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale)is a con artist who, together with his partner-in-crime sexy Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams), was conscripted by over-eager FBI agent Richie diMaso (Bradley Cooper) to hatch a complicated con to trap crooked politicians, including New Jersey mayor Carmel Polito (Jeremy Renner). In the meantime, Irving has to keep his incendiary wife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence) on a leash or else his plot will be blown wide open.<br/><br/>Everything about this movie is overblown and over the top, so downright entertaining. I enjoyed watching this film about con artists out- conning each other. There was so much fun watching the out-of-this- world hairstyles and over-acting of each of the main cast (all Oscar pedigreed), so unlike anything we have seen them in. <br/><br/>Christian Bale had gotten so much out of his Batman shape for this role as the Jewish conman with the elaborate comb-over hairdo. Amy Adams was no Princess Giselle in her constantly cleavage-revealing dresses. It was quite a hoot seeing Bradley Cooper in hair curlers, going more bananas than his role in The Hangover. Too bad there was too little of Jeremy Renner in his teased-up bouffant hairstyle.<br/><br/>The best performer here is Jennifer Lawrence in a supporting role that is not directly within the main plot, yet she does so well to steal the thunder from her other co-stars by being so audacious and wild. This girl is really so versatile. It is no wonder that she is already being touted by critics to be the ""next Meryl Streep""! <br/><br/>This is another quirky masterpiece from the director of ""The Silver Linings Playbook"", David O. Russel. If you like great camp, this is the film to catch."
"aharmas","6","2","6","1 January 2014"," It looks right, but its just about average
","First of all, Mr. Russell can come up with some dazzling dialogue, and he can stretch an idea quite a bit. For a moment I was wondering if Peter Jackson was around. Russell gives us a caper where double-crossing and outsmarting other people is the main idea. This has always been a sure way to entertain people. Look at ""Clue"", ""A Fish Called Wanda"", ""Deathtrap"", and a few other classic examples, which were hilarious, engaging, and stood up because they had novel approach. In the case of ""Hustle"", the performers, with a couple of exceptions, are doing excellent work. The feel of the 70's is there. You can almost smell the polyester and the hairspray, and this film should carry a warning for the scary and extravagant hairdo's most of the leading actors are saddled with.<br/><br/>It would be difficult to summarize the plot, except that the key word is one couple tries to pull scam after scam, only to encounter an ambitious and overzealous FBI agent who gets involved and seduced by the others' ideas, overwhelmed by his own goals, and gets stuck in the middle of some very passionate love affairs. If this isn't enough, why not mix in the mafia, some office conflicts, some Italian tempers, a touch of Middle East stereotyping, and in what has to be the worst lack of imagination bring in two actors who are so overexposed, they only help detract from this convoluted mess.<br/><br/>Yes, there are some memorable moments, and this is because sometimes the film falls into the episodic trap. Here is the unstable and lonely wife, who doesn't understand the intensity of her personality. Lawrence is wonderful inhabiting the character and showing her talents will keep on growing. Here she's vulnerable and a little scary because of her impulsive nature. Cooper surprises with his physical comedy and outrageous reactions, and an couple of funny scenes with Louis C.K., once again a series of sketches that could fit in a 70's comedy show, but are kind of bumps in the narrative here. The biggest pleasure in the movie is Christian Bale, who transforms himself again, but unlike so many performers who believe a physical makeover is enough to be recognized as ""remarkable performance"", gives us a complex and touching turn, as he is able to express a range of emotions that go from pride to complete devastation. He says more with his eyes than our uncredited performer has done through his entire career, not even the ""hairdo"" help because he went back to the same mannerisms and facial expressions.<br/><br/>In the end, I was hoping for another ""Notebook"", but it didn't happen. The promise was there, but the ambition, like one of the main characters' killed whatever potential it had. I guess we've been ""hustled""."

I can go on but i think i should stop now. It has this Scorsese/early PTA feel to it, you can pot quite a few homages to Goodfellas and Casino in this one. Some may even say that this one succeeded at being more Scorsese than Scorseses The Wolf of Wall Street, movie surrounded by a lot of controversy but is in my opinion better than kind of overrated American Hustle. Like a lot of movies it is influenced by, it is also very character driven and less plot driven, but that doesn't mean that it doesn't have good plot with really good resolution. To some it may seem like it's unfocused at times, but to me it didn't matter because each and every character is a delight to watch on screen. All the actors had great chemistry with each other, especially Christian Bale and Amy Adams. And, don't let them fool you, this movie IS NOT A COMEDY! It's a great crime drama with some funny moments in it. Check this one out."
"saltyfilmcritic","8","2","6","1 January 2014"," Great flick
","This is really a solid picture.<br/><br/>All the performances were brilliant, but especially those of Bale and Renner. I have never seen either of them in roles such as these, and to me they were the most believable, at times crazy organic, characters that stole the show. Bale in the very least should get an Oscar nomination. Renner is so damn good, it was refreshing to see him step away from the action flicks. Even the minor players did a fantastic job, including Louis CK adding a surprisingly amazing acting performance. We know he's funny, but who knew he could act! Listen, the story is great. I had all my questions answered and nothing was left on the table. Yes, the story is a little lazy in some points, slow in others, but those few moments didn't distract from the environment that you were drawn into. Great script and direction.<br/><br/>I guess my only gripe holding me at an 8 out of 10 stars was the performances of Cooper and Lawrence. Don't get me wrong, they were both really great, but their performances felt at times a bit copycat. Cooper didn't bring anything new to the role, I felt like I had seen him play this role a dozen times (look at his body of work before you disagree). There were even a few moments where I felt like he was trying too hard. Lawrence was the same for me. I understand she has an Oscar for Silver Linings Playbook, and that was well deserved, but this time she bit off more she can chew. Her character was inconsistent with her accent, and along with her Silver Linings costar Cooper, her performance at times felt forced and unbelievable. There is one particular scene where Lawrence and Bale are fighting in their kitchen that will make you cringe. She goes way over the top, making it cheesy. Thankfully, Bale kept the scene together, which is why I am sure it didn't end up on the 'cutting room floor'.<br/><br/>Amy Adams was solid and I found her to be as equally mesmerizing as she was visually stunning. The film is called American Hustle because you never are entirely sure who is hustling who, and to me Adams was the most convincing. You never knew whose side she was on.<br/><br/>Great art direction, wardrobe, and decent acting. The story was fun and interesting, and I am sure it will rake in some well-deserved awards."

It was like watching 5 wonderful actors/actresses go blow by blow to the 12th round. Amy Adams was unbelievable - she nailed the role spot on. I loved her role in ""Trouble with the Curve"" but wow she was amazing. Bradley Cooper was on top of his game and so natural. There were a couple of scenes were he made me crack with laughter after an intense exchange with his boss - totally unexpected in a very heavy movie with drama and twists. <br/><br/>But the one that surprised me the most was Jennifer Lawrence - For me her role was amazing. She justified winning the Oscars last year and in this movie, I would say she topped Amy Adams even she had lesser scenes compared to bale, Cooper, and Adams.<br/><br/>Christian Bale played his role well, but I have never been a big fan of his but he also played the ConArtist role to perfection. <br/><br/>All in All, I loved this movie although some might find it slow at some points but the character buildup and the unexpected twist at the end made me hooked<br/><br/>9/10"

","First of all, I really want to know how Christian Bale is getting thin, muscular and fat in no time.. is it only me, or everyone is wondering how does he do that?<br/><br/>American Hustle is directed by David O. Russell, written by Eric Warren Singer and David O. Russell, and starring Christian Bale, Amy Adams, Bradley Cooper, Jeremy Renner and Jennifer Lawrence.<br/><br/>American Hustle tells the story of brilliant con man Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale), who along with his equally cunning and seductive British partner Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams) is forced to work for a wild FBI agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper). DiMaso pushes them into a world of Jersey powerbrokers and mafia that's as dangerous as it is enchanting. Jeremy Renner is Carmine Polito, the passionate, volatile, New Jersey political operator caught between the con-artists and Feds. Irving's unpredictable wife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence) could be the one to pull the thread that brings the entire world crashing down.<br/><br/>With no doubt American Hustle is one of the best movies of 2013, and it's also one of the best Crime/Drama movie ever! I loved it so much that don't even know where should I start from! Everything with this movie is so amazing, very close to be perfect... It's well-acted, strong story, surprising, rewatchability, funny, great script but the direction isn't so perfect, and here's the only flaw and what made this movie not perfect is the direction! It's not bad at all, sometimes it was energized and exciting, but in some moments it felt like a mob-cam caption, and I didn't like that, but still David O. Russell did such a great job writing with Eric Warren Singer, and with the direction though!<br/><br/>This movie is full of great casting, like Christian Bale, Amy Adams and Bradley Cooper, beside Jeremy Renner and Jennifer Lawrence. Everyone I mentioned or the rest of the crew was so convincing and talented, especially these 5! They are so memorable, with lots of lines which're going to stick in you memory for very long time, not only because it's a very good script, also because it has a very convincing cast!<br/><br/>The story is very catchy and entertaining, with a very surprising finale, beside the hooking two acts, American Hustle did them all right, beside how powerful the story is! The story is so realistic, nothing overreacted or not real, nothing. A 2h 18min movie with no boredom or even looking at the clock to know what time is it. Some movies have a very good story with a terrible script, and American Hustle isn't one of them, it has the strong story mixed with well-written script combined with humor, presented to us by some very amazing cast!<br/><br/>American Hustle could've been better if David O. Russell didn't make these mob-cam caption scene, but it's still amazing and I'm gonna give it an A!<br/><br/>Alright guys, thank you as always for reading my review, and supporting my stuff. Lots of reviews are coming up, so if you liked this one, you can read my old ones and wait up for the upcoming ones as well. Thanks again!"

","Let's start with my only two beefs: Either have a joisey accent or don't, as in, throughout the film, not intermittently. Jennifer Lawrence is merely OK and there's alot of better actresses out there and she would have been less annoying if she could have been more consistent, including yeah, the accent. To her credit, she does 'eccentric' really well.<br/><br/>For gosh sake - Louis CK? He isn't that funny in the film which reflects the fact he hasn't been funny in a long time. <br/><br/>The film does a great job combining drama, understated humor and a good amount of twists and turns. Frankly I was never sure during the middle of the film who was hustling who, which was highly enjoyable. Storyline works out well, and if you think it's over the top, the story is loosely based on the Abscam effort run by the FBI in the late 70s.<br/><br/>Christian Bale is great in this as was Brad Cooper and Jeremy Renner."

"paul2001sw-1","7","1","2","17 April 2017"," Entertaining, but so predictable
","'American Hustle' tells the story of a pair of con-men induced to help the FBI trap some bigger fish, a shaggy dog story told mostly straight and with some genuinely funny moments. It also features explanatory voice-overs, a heavy (1970s) period soundtrack and a final twist I found underwhelming, to say the least, first of all because if you've seen any conman movies before, the double-cross is only to be expected, but secondly because the film is so obviously playing for entertainment, and makes little attempt to lure the viewer into the trap. And indeed it is entertaining, albeit in a rather predictable way - but it falls well short of the standard of Mamet's 'House of Games', or even 'The Sting'."

","By the way this movie was hyped, from its stellar cast of Bradley Cooper to Jennifer Lawrence and Robert DeNiro, to its numerous Academy Award nominations, I was expecting an entertainingly exceptional motion picture! Quite frankly, to say it was just average is an understatement.<br/><br/>This 2013 black-comedy from David O. Russell is the story of two con-artists, Christian Bale and Amy Adams, who are forced by FBI agent Bradley Cooper to set up a sting to snare corrupt politicians ~ including the mayor of Camden, New Jersey, Jeremy Renner.<br/><br/>The movie isn't at all captivating nor the plot nuanced with ANY twists or turns. I'd say the only good thing I found with this movie were the great songs interspersed throughout it. How one critic called the film ""the sharpest most exhilarating movie in years"", and another ""riotously funny"", just proves to me how IMDb reviewers are much more credible in their assessments of movies than those who do this for a paycheck.<br/><br/>Gave 5* out of 10, mainly for the music...and empathy that Cooper had to endure those daily hair rollers!"

","While I give props to the team tasked with matching the style of the 70's era (wich was very well done) I think American hustle is one of the must hyped and disappointing films I ever seen.<br/><br/>First, the story begins strong (the cast was very impressive) telling us about everything cons and all of that. But son, nothing else happens: no emotion, no twists, non likable characters; only a deep sense of tension and andkwardness. Specially the character portrayed by Jennifer Lawrence was such annoying woman that made me enjoy even less the film (and I have nothing against her, she's gorgeous and talented) If you want to avoid wasting a considerable amount of time, don't watch this film. Its dull, boring and never gets off the ground."

","Simply put, couldn't bear it. The movie was just awful. But still worthy of 5 stars. I had seen Silver Linings Playbook and The Fighter, both of which I actually liked, but this movie compared to them, is complete garbage. Maybe I was expecting too much. This movie in itself expects you to get bored, that's why they tried to surprise you (a bit) at the end by showing that Christian Bale and Amy Adams in fact conned Bradley Cooper by using their common friend, who had been shown before. ""His screen time was way too short"", you think? All right, I'll leave that aside then. On the other hand, the following points prove that this movie blows. Whether you admit it or not, I thought that there was too much of Christian Bale, who surprisingly overacted at every second of the movie. Every single one. Now, the reason I gave the movie a 4 star rating is because I actually liked the first half, (or less than the first half) and would've given it a 10 if it continued at that pace. I say, there are a lot better movies, even by the same makers, which deserve a watch, but just not this one."

I walked out of the theater angry, bored, and disappointed with this mess of a movie. I honestly can't think of one well done thing in it. The plot is shambolic and underdone, with the unlikable and boring characters just stumbling from one scene to the next. The dialogue lacks any real humor despite it's comedy branding. The film is all shot in dark, drab locations and the editing is awkward. The performances aren't bad but they're not anybodies greatest work. The only good thing about this film is Louis C.K's part.

Including the repeated drawn-out, starting from a far-away point, closeups, and camera follows, which happened every other scene segue, and the dated rock n' roll fed into the soundtrack. Also, THE ACTING WAS HORRIBLE IN THIS MOVIE! Everyone just half-ass mumbled their way through the unintelligible script with bad accents and every cliché imaginable! I get it... America steps back and takes a look at itself in all its evil glory. TOPIC DONE TO DEATH! I only gave it 2 stars instead of one because an effort was made in wardrobe and cast. Although... if I were one of the actors in this movie I'd hide my head in shame somewhere. No effort was made to turn the actors into actual people living a story! I hated all of them and had no sympathy even for Bale who could have saved this one. All I saw was Jennifer Lawrence, Christian Bale, and the rest dressed up in retro and mumbling for the duration. What the hell happened to this movie and why did it fail so awfully? Maybe the director was too intimidated by the A-listers and didn't have the guts to direct them and just left them to mutter and mumble through the whole thing all by their lonesomes. Awful!"
"smatysia","6","1","2","24 August 2014"," some unrecognizable stars
","I have let my movie-viewing slide a bit in the last few years, so I was not familiar with some of the actors in this film. Amy Adams, for instance. She does a great deal with this role, which is a woman who is unlovely and unlikeable. And Jeremy Renner, who is apparently a star in a lot of those comic book movies. I would have never recognized Christian Bale, or Elisabeth Rohm. Jennifer Lawrence had to dig deep for her inner white trash sleaze, and she was remarkable. I remember the scandal quite well, where the FBI bribed and arrested a number of prominent New Jersey Democrat office-holders. it was all kind of fun, as I recall."
"luckywarrior4","6","1","2","25 April 2014"," Great Performances, meh movie
","I get the hype. Really, I do. But this movie is nothing special. I'm not going to be one of those people that say ""I don't get the hype"" or ""don't believe the hype"" or stuff like that. The main praise for this movie seems to be for the performances, fashion, and scenery. And for the most part, it is warranted. Jennifer Lawrence and Jeremy Renner really stood out to me in supporting roles, and Christian Bale and Amy Adams did pretty good as the main stars. Bradley Cooper was a weak link to me, however. The fashion and scenery are top-notch and authentic. The main problem with this movie, though, were not the technical aspects. The main problems were the plot and characters. I often got confused by the convoluted narrative as well as the character's motives. Part of this was due to the lack of chemistry between Bale and Lawrence, who did very good on their own but when they were together it was hard to believe that they were in love at all. Compare this to Bale and Adams' chemistry, or Adams and Cooper's, and it's clear that Jennifer should stick to being Bradley's love interest. The story was unrealistic and too confusing. By the end of the movie, I was wondering what the main purpose David O'Russell was trying to get across. I don't think an FBI member would willingly risk his job to help convicted cons, or not get into trouble at all for beating up his boss (and then proceeded to laugh about it later, in an unfunny scene that actually made me respect the cons more). Why did Rosalyn kiss Sidney? I get that she was crazy and all but this just seemed random to me (and yes, I know that Amy Adams suggested it, why I have no idea). In conclusion, this was was an OK movie with some Oscar-worthy performances but little in terms of plot and character development."

Jennifer Lawrence owned this movie. Her performance was stellar. I think that she very narrowly missed getting the Oscar for that performance.<br/><br/>The story would have been better if they would have kept it to the bare bones. There was too much back and forth, here and there; the movie had no clear direction.<br/><br/>The speed of the film was just too slow and it allowed for the viewer to be distracted too often. If you cannot lock-in that audience attention, then your film is just not going to do well."
"michaelRokeefe","7","1","2","29 March 2014"," High energy comedic drama.
","I think I was expecting too much. First of all; there is director David O. Russell and then the biggest draw for me...Jennifer Lawrence. This movie is a fictionalization of the much-to-do scandal of an FBI operation called ABSCAM. It was stunning and very news worthy in the early 1970s. Brilliant con-man Irving Rosenfield(Christian Bale), running several fraudulent businesses and over confident in his ability to deceive people, falls in love with a stripper named Sydney(Amy Adams). Although married to a very flirtatious wife Rosalyn(Lawrence), who lounges at home with her small son; Irving teams with Sydney to scam money from needy businessmen. During such activity they are busted by an over achieving FBI agent, Richie DiMaso(Bradley Cooper), who in turn influences Irving to avoid jail time by carrying out sting operations with his beautiful partner. The FBI is wanting to catch white collar criminals and one of their biggest targets is Carmine Polito(Jeremy Rener), the very popular and flamboyant mayor of Camden, New Jersey. Irving and Sydney use Polito to lure corrupt politicians to accept bribes in a high dollar hotel room. But there is a fly in the ointment; attention deprived Rosalyn's chatter may put the whole operation in jeopardy.<br/><br/>This very watchable film is quirky and funny and filled with high, but scattered energy. Realistic period scenes, sets and music. Greed, adultery, jealousy and a bit of violence with very little sympathy. Bale and Lawrence transformed themselves into characters excellently. Adams is sultry without even trying. Also in the cast: C.K. Louis, Elisabeth Rohm, Michael Pena, Jack Huston, Anthony Zerbe and Robert De Niro."

There are many absurd moments; take for example Bradley Coopers relationship with his boss.

Another comparison is taking place between the selfish and ambitious fed (Bradley Cooper) and the selfish and ambitious con (Christian Bale) which makes each of us say ""Oh.. some people really change in a good way while others go to hell because they don't change"".

"estella2","6","1","2","9 January 2014"," 'Hustle' tells 70s/80s Abscam story
","Director David Russell and writer Eric Singer come together to tell the true story of the Abscam sting operation that was set up by the FBI in the late 70s/early 80s. It led to the conviction of a lot of politicians in New Jersey.<br/><br/>Never heard of it? Neither had I before seeing this movie, but anyone living back then probably has heard of it since it was apparently national news headlines at the time. Born after 1980? Then yeah.....you probably will need to Wikipedia it.<br/><br/>Christian Bale plays Irving Rosenfeld, a N.J. con-artist who meets a retired stripper from New Mexico, Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams) and together they form a partnership scam and a romantic relationship. Sydney Prosser pretends to be a British Lady Edith Greensly and together they run a fake loan office and sell forged paintings. While Irving is romantically involved with Sydney, he is actually married to a sharp tongued feisty woman named Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence). They live together with her son from a previous marriage, Danny , who Irving has adopted. We soon realize that the only reason Irving ever married Rosalyn was because he felt sorry for her having to raise a child alone. Irving doesn't want to go run off with Sydney because he is too attached to his son Danny and would feel terrible leaving him alone with his mother, who he feels is completely irresponsible as a parent. The other reason Irving stays: look the word 'manipulation' up in the dictionary and you should find a picture of Rosalyn underneath! As time goes on, Irving and Sydney get caught by Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper) an FBI agent from Long Island. Richie gives them two choices: 1.jail time or 2. help the FBI in their sting operation uncovering corruption in the NJ politics; they agree to help the FBI. Surprisingly, agent DiMaso never discovered Sydney's true identity (apparently she had expert connections with getting records falsified), so she has to continue pretending she's British and talking with a terrible phony English accent throughout the majority of the film. Jeremy Renner plays the Camden N.J. Mayor Carmine Polito who is being targeted in the sting operation. Michael Pena plays Paco who is pretending to be an Arab Sheik Abdullah. Robert De Niro plays Victor Tellegio, a mafia boss. Louis C.K. plays Stoddard Thorsen, DiMaso's boss at the FBI. <br/><br/>Personally I felt some of the scenes with the heavy empty dialogue should have been edited down in the film ( I would say a good 30 minutes in total could have been cut). I'm talking about the kind of dialogue that you usually find in the very first unedited draft of a script, or at the first stage performance for an Improvisation Level A class. For example:<br/><br/>Bob: You know what I'm talking about? <br/><br/>Eddie: No, what are you talking about?<br/><br/>Bob: I think you know what I'm talking about. <br/><br/>Eddie: Really? Because I really don't think I do.<br/><br/>Bob: Oh c'mon. You know what I'm talking about! <br/><br/>Eddie: Bob, I don't know what you're talking about!<br/><br/>Bob:How many times do I have to tell you what I'm talking about?<br/><br/>Eddie:Maybe ten times. <br/><br/>Bob: Eddie! c'mon please...you know what I'm talking about, okay?<br/><br/>My mother also saw the film and she seemed to like it more than I did. She said she wouldn't have edited anything out and she didn't seem to feel it was too long. I, on the other hand, felt myself dozing off during the parts that didn't have Rosalyn. It could have been partly due to the fact that she instantly recognized the story from the 70s, while I didn't. <br/><br/>I thought all the actors did a great job, but I think Jennifer Lawrence's character is the one that kept me awake, although she was only in like 15-20 minutes in total of the film. <br/><br/>I thought that the Production Designer Judy Becker did an excellent job creating a New Jersey from the 1970s, together with great costume choices made by the Costume Designer Michael Wilkinson. I also liked the original score composed by Danny Elfman and the choice of songs for the soundtrack. I thought that Katherine Gordon, department head hair stylist and others working in her department did a nice job on the hair. They got the home perms for men, the comb-over, the long hair, the wild perm for Amy Adams that became more popular around the early 80s, and Jennifer Lawrence's swept bouffant (in the late 70s the Edwardian/Gibson girl style started to become very popular), and curled updos. and I thought that Evelyne Noraz, makeup department head and other working in the makeup department did a nice job with authentic 1970s makeup (they choice a very a natural look for makeup, lots of earth tones, very light---you can see this with Amy Adams -you can see all her freckles, any sun damaged skin, and every wrinkle through the light powder foundation which is very appropriate for the time. Her legs weren't airbrushed and they show her bruises on her legs (probably from her time as a stripper?). To get an idea of what i'm talking about with natural makeup, just watch the movie 'Five Easy Pieces' with Jack Nicholson from the early 70s. Also enjoyed the whole nail polish story, the rotten/sweet smell.<br/><br/>And it's true that all the best nail polishes have something nasty in them!<br/><br/>side note: I found it ironic that when I got home from the theater and turned on the TV, the news was about N.J.

Something witty is also what Russell is trying to do and it's not his first time. If you consider Three Kings and I (heart) Huckabees and what he has delivered the past few years you can't help but notice a director getting better by the minute (movie).<br/><br/>It's not easy to juggle a movie about con artists, especially when it feels like it's build entirely on something that really happened (which apparently isn't the case, which makes this even more intriguing). But whatever the case and however you feel about some of the actors, this is brilliant. For one I do love Jennifer Lawrence, but the character she is playing could not be more despicable and appalling in my eyes. So while I'm still very fond of Lawrence herself, she (and Russell) actually made the impossible possible! I kind of hated her.<br/><br/>There is a reason why there was Oscar buzz and nominations and what not. I know I myself get sometimes tired of buzz like that.

Director Russell has consistently proved himself a deft co-ordinator of ensemble pieces (back from the time of THREE KINGS {1999} and I HEART HUCKABEES {2004}), but especially with his impressive last trio of ""Oscar bait"" efforts – namely THE FIGHTER (2010), SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK (2012) and, of course, the title under review.<br/><br/>With respect to American HUSTLE, this latter element emerges as both its strength and drawback: it obviously creates some well-defined characters for the talented actors to sink their teeth into but, at the same time, it necessitates that they often take a back seat in order to allow the others to shine or for the complex plot to unravel; this suggests that, in spite of having four nominations in the acting categories (Best Actor Christian Bale, Actress Amy Adams, Supporting Actor Bradley Cooper and Supporting Actress Jennifer Lawrence – it is worth noting, and that in itself is no mean feat, that Bale and Lawrence had already won under Russell's guidance, while Adams and Cooper also received previous nods!), their chance of taking to the Dolby Theatre stage tonight is pretty slimapart, perhaps, from Lawrence, thanks to her wacky antics as the proverbial ditzy blonde! All things considered, however, the performances here do come across as a tad overstated; likewise, while the late 1970s atmosphere is impressively evoked throughout (helped in no small measure by a killer soundtrack that includes Steely Dan, Todd Rundgren, Elton John and David Bowie), the film's visuals seemed inordinately drab to my eyes (unless there was simply something wrong with the print I watched!).<br/><br/>The plot, then, is a mix of THE STING (1973) and GOODFELLAS (1990 – yeah, another tip of the hat to Scorsese!): though the con (among those being 'taken' are Jeremy Renner and veteran Anthony Zerbe) took some time to draw me in, it became quite compelling once the Mob was roped in, with the suspense quotient rising in view of their inevitable retribution if the F.B.I. operation's cover were blown. At 138 minutes, the film can seem lengthy and repetitive, but the surface style succeeds in keeping it all together – and, as I said, the characterizations are solid (and, individually, entertaining) enough to anchor the fanciful (albeit true) events in reality."

Photography Director managed to give us nice scenes, even in a movie that the scenery took place in 5-6 rooms. Film director has done an excellent job on a very good scenario. Finally the movie had insignificant details, like Louis C.K. story, that kept me in vigilance, apart from the general scenario. It's a very nice work that I recommend you watch but remember it's a drama, not a comedy!"

","Don't go into this movie thinking it's about Abscam at all, or closer to what I thought, a playful caper (Ocean's Eleven--both). It's a comedy, and a laser focused one at that, landing on just five cogs in a mammoth machine. It's fresh, hilarious at times, but look-not-laugh funny most of it. It's also on the slow side. For a movie about a con-men and a sting, it's relatively geologic in it's timing. Music is perfect (no exaggeration. Perfect=The exact fit, more than flawless). Bale gives a heartful performance like always, Cooper shows his comic chops but Adams is the best, showing her range. Lawrence's part is overstated in the trailer, but nonetheless and excellent catalyst for trouble, with hilarious timing to boot. Renner's role is understated, not that funny, but it's because he's the straight man. Check the hair. Much too hyped, and hyped in the wrong direction."

","If you plan on seeing this film, do not expect to see one that is heavy on the plot. The plot for this film is used almost exclusively as a setting for the characters to interact. <br/><br/>With that being said, all of the characters become part of an intricate plot that is bigger than themselves, and David O. Russel does an incredible job of humanizing each of the players in this game. I found myself not looking forward to some ""big bang"" ending or intricate underlying twist like that of an Oceans flick, but awaiting the next interaction between conflicting characters and just how pathetic, comedic, humanizing, or intimate they can reveal themselves to be. It's a movie about strongly connected characters and how they will blindly step all over each other in order to achieve their goals. The entire cast is incredible at their roles and it's wonderful seeing such beautiful people playing such flawed, vulnerable, and believable characters. <br/><br/>If you go to this movie expecting an action-packed plot with a Hollywood ending, you will leave disappointed. If you go into the movie with an interest in the characters and their evolution throughout the film, you'll be delighted at every turn."
"seaview1","9","2","8","1 March 2014"," American HUSTLE -the Art of Seduction and Survival
","Suggested by actual events of the Abscam sting in the 1970s, the FBI plans to setup and arrest corrupt politicians. How they get the officials and the professional con artists that help the sting operation are the basis of a nostalgic film. As directed and co-written by David O. Russell (Silver Linings Playbook, The Fighter), American Hustle is an acting clinic highlighting a convoluted tale of men and women who are looking for a big score.<br/><br/>In 1978, ambitious FBI agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper), forces con man Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale) and his mistress, Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams), to help arrange a con on white collar crime, specifically targeting corrupt politicians. Richie wants to make a name for himself, and he is immediately attracted to Sydney and has designs on her beyond the con. Starting with a local, beloved mayor, Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner), high level political figures are drawn in, and there is the possible organized crime connection. Further, Irving's wife, Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence), threatens to derail the sting. As Richie's grand plan comes together, things get more complicated and risky, and Irving and Sydney must rely on their skills to survive.<br/><br/>These are very well etched characters. Each has something to gain, and each has an angle to exploit, whether it's Richie's dreams of a big bust or Rosalyn's threats to expose the operation. Kindred souls and survivors, Irving and Sydney have mastered the art of deception and manipulation. You feel a degree of sympathy for Irving despite his criminal past and his marital discord. Not only does he love his women, but he tries to save a friend from jail. Irving turns out to be someone to root for. In fact the world is not black and white especially when an FBI agent breaks the rules and gets involved with one of the principals. Carmine is the noble, elected official who truly believes in doing good for his community. Just who are the good guys and bad guys? Just who is conning who? Memorable scenes include a catty confrontation in a women's restroom, the face off between Richie and his beleaguered boss (played to great effect by Louis C. K.), and an incredibly tense meeting with a head mobster (Robert DeNiro in a lethal cameo).<br/><br/>Acting is superior throughout as expected in a Russell ensemble with the principals at the top of their game. Bale transforms his physical appearance as an overweight, balding schlep (a far cry from The Dark Knight's Batman). A sultry Adams (Doubt, Her) has a great time playing a kindred con artist with a British accent. Cooper (Limitless, The Hangover) has a ball as the gung ho agent with a 1970s perm who will step over his boss to get his time in the sun. Lawrence (The Hunger Games, Winter's Bone) excels as the wife who exhibits a bold brashness in public which delights her onlookers but risks blowing the sting.<br/><br/>There is liberal use of 1970's pop songs which blend with the costumes and hair styles seamlessly. The camera work is fluid and is reminiscent of early Martin Scorsese films. There is a very carefree attitude in the film's look and feel which is consistent with this loose, uninhibited decade.<br/><br/>A slice of the seventies with freewheeling hustlers and loose morals, at its core, American Hustle is a love story centering on Irving, an imperfect con artist and the women in his life. The film is essentially a con within a con and keeps you guessing until the end. Although the film's narrative is not as tight as it could have been, Russell has sacrificed a tiny bit of substance for style. Do admire this film for the many scenes that pit flawed characters against each other. Acting does not get much better than this."
"Amari-Sali","8","2","8","31 December 2013"," A con is played featuring politicians, mobsters, the FBI and two people with a complicated relationship.
","After Silver Linings Playbook, it is hard to not be curious about David O. Russell's new production featuring the stars of his last movie. Mind you, Jennifer Lawrence is in a smaller role, and Robert De Niro has been reduced to being in one sole scene, but with Christian Bale picking up the slack and Amy Adams replacing Lawrence as female lead, you are given quite the combination which may not be as comical or crazy as fellow con-man focused movie The Wolf of Wall Street, but while Wolf relied on debauchery, style, and outright sensationalism, Hustle has sustenance and takes it times, scatters jokes throughout and is more about the story than having you watch one crazy thing happen after the next.<br/><br/>Characters & Story<br/><br/>The main character of the film is Irving (played by Christian Bale), this creepy looking con man, who mostly specializes in fraudulent loans and art. Alongside side him is business partner/ mistress, Sydney (played by Amy Adams) who seemingly is all he ever needed in a wife. She is smart, cunning, and flexible; but unfortunately for Irving his wife is Rosalyn (played by Jennifer Lawrence) a woman who seemingly has arrested development. But, though Irving would love to divorce her, between her threatening to take away her son, which he adopted, and dangling threats of snitching, he is trapped.<br/><br/>Leading to the main focus of the story which is when FBI agent Richard, though commonly called Richie (played by Bradley Cooper), catches Sydney and Irving trying to con him. Leading to a series of cons which get more and more complex to the point that you aren't sure who is on whose side. You see, Sydney pretend to be this English woman named Edith in order to con just about everyone but Irving who helped craft the character, and then with Richie using them both so that he can make a name for himself, this leads these three to going from something small like taking down Camden mayor Carmine Polito (played by Jeremy Renner), to Richie trying to take down the mob leader Victor Tellegio (played by Robert De Niro). This is despite his boss Stoddard (played by Louis C.K.) trying to reign him in whenever possible, but with Richie having a very similar mentality to Rosalyn and trying to make a name for himself, he ends up digging his grave more and more to the point where between Richie's ambitions and Rosalyn's big mouth, everything seemingly falls apart.<br/><br/>Praise<br/><br/>What sets American Hustle apart from its closest competitor is that all the weight of the movie doesn't rest on one or two people's shoulders. Also, as noted in the beginning, there isn't a reliance on sex, drugs and excess in order to fuel your interest. Hustle focuses on, albeit through caricatures, telling a true story, with some embellishments and serving it up nicely. Perhaps though what really deserves praise are the portrayals, for though they aren't award worthy, they can still be considered competition.<br/><br/>The reason I say this is because, the cast embodies these characters to a point where, despite being caricatures, you can actually see them as real people. Take Amy Adams' Sydney. Perhaps in the film's best performance, you get a sense of empathy for this character to the point as the film goes on, you begin to believe that perhaps, as much as the men in the film are, maybe you are being conned too? But, don't take Sydney to just be some floozy, for though both Irving and Richie are cheating on a significant other with Sydney, even outside the relationship drama you are given quite a bit. We are provided with enough details that, especially with Sydney, you can almost create a character analysis in your head and really understand them to the point of even guessing their character's story trajectory and understanding why they did what they did in the movie.<br/><br/>Leading to the last thing worth noting: the comedic moments. To me, all the leads are guaranteed to make you laugh due to their character's personality. Lawrence as Rosalyn, for example, seems like she is just the most annoying bits of Lawrence's public persona amped up and then made funny. Then you have the interaction and lives between Irving and Richie of which the majority of the laughs are given either due to Bale's ridiculous toupee; Richie's ego, especially when you combine Stoddard; and other memorable scenes, which keep you engaged.<br/><br/>Criticism<br/><br/>Really, when it comes to critique, perhaps my main issue is that the con as a whole does feel dragged out as the movie goes on to the point where when it gets more complex, it seems like the writers were trying to reinvigorate the movie. But, again, considering this is a true story, perhaps it is unfair to fault the writers with a con which, in itself, was a bubble waiting to burst. Outside of that, one issue I had is with Robert De Niro's character. In the film he plays this menacing mobster and due to the complexity of the con, I must admit I was left unsure if he was part of it, or if he was a real mobster who almost got screwed over, but didn't, and decided to just stay out of the FBI's way.<br/><br/>Overall: See in Theaters<br/><br/>Though I like American Hustle, it doesn't compare to Silver Linings Playbook nor is as entertaining as Wolf of Wall Street. However, I do feel the method of presenting a story featuring caricatures of the actual people the story is based on, rather than try to present something true to life worked well, but while the story is good, the overall movie doesn't feel like something you should rush to see and I'm sort of on the edge of saying to wait for the DVD release."

","This film is not a simple one to wade through. That is because it is partially based upon the truth but names have to be changed in order to protect the guilty, some of who are still with us; Because of the intrigue of the events of ABSCAM in the 1970's, there is a lot of care taken in the script of this. The writers have to be careful with the characters to not get too close to the real thing.<br/><br/>This details one of the most successful stings of the US government in History. It involves a phony sheik and the building of a scam trying to prove successfully that out Senators, House members, and others are less than honest. The bribe set up involves organized crime and the building of the casinos in Atlantic City. The thing that is amazing is that guts it took to write this one/ It uses much talking to get the plot over to the viewer. It is necessary to do this as just showing what happened without going into the people pulling off this complex scam would not tell the story properly.<br/><br/>For those who remember the actual events and the SNL sketch about it years ago, this is a hilarious romp. For those who are not initiated, it might get a bit tedious. <br/><br/>There is a great piece of humor from this period of history in this. Something that has changed besides the telephones is the way retail merchandise is distributed. When Microwave ovens and other things first came out back in this era, small middle men would actually make a living distributing hot items from the back of their car. This movie has a sequence that recalls the old Microwave oven from a trunk routine and then tops it by having someone who gets one that way put metal in it and explodes the oven. This is not only funny but is a sight gag as noteworthy now as in any movie in history."

It stars The Legs of Amy Adams with Cameo appearances by Christian Bale, Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence and Amy Adams. I'm not one to complain, but I""m still trying to figure out who The Legs paid off for such a prominent role. <br/><br/>Now let's get down to the brass tax. A very entertaining dramatic ride with outstanding performances and many laughs. David O. Russell has a gift to get the best out of his actors. Jennifer Lawrence is considered to be the 'showstopper' according to most pundits, but for my money, the performance by Bale was tops. You feel like you can see the cogs churning through Bale's eyes as he tries to manage the situations. Bale's layers of stress are a burden upon the viewer. The other performances seemed to operate on one plane when compared to Bale. <br/><br/>Now there are items that some of us will never be able to fully comprehend. Like for example, is the FBI really that dumb? The story moves fast and at times it feels like it could blow down with a gust of wind. The score is fantastic with its use of popular songs from the 70's. The musical interludes really add character to the film.

","I tell you I don't even know where to begin in trying to explain this movie. We can start by saying it was extremely unusual and pretty much incomparable to any other film I have seen lately or ever. I couldn't figure out if I liked the movie and then when I figured out that I did like it and really started to enjoy it, I knew why. The actors did a phenomenal job. And normally that goes hand in hand with a really good story. But in this case it was.well unusual. The main story is goodthe stories within the main story arewell just not feel good situations. But even with that somewhat negative observation they were entertaining in their own right. Funky I know. Without giving anything away it revolves around a con man (Christian Bale) and his partner (Amy Adams) and a fed agent (Bradley cooper) in an unlikely partnership to catch other criminals. The stories within the story are various. And you feel multiple emotions throughout the movie. Some of the situations are a bit sleazy, and I don't mean sexually. I mean just plain doing the wrong things. But just when you get kind of turned off the scene turns into laughter. Again, because of the fantastic job of the actors and their portrayal of the characters. You feel excited one moment then intense the nextupsetthen laugh out laughingthen intense again. At the beginning of the movie you are like ""What is the hype all about this movie?"" but I tell you as the movie goes on you get more and more enthralled with the characters their side storiesthe absurdity of some of the situationsand again the intensity. Literally you don't know what to make of it when you get out of the moviebut one thing for sure you are glad that you saw it because after everything you really enjoyed it. I can't say it enough that the all of the actors, every one, did a fantastic job of portraying their characters and you go from laughing with themto laughing at them to having no respect for themto sympathizing with themand back to laughing with them and going through that circle of emotions several times throughout the movie. Christian Bale played a part that you have never seen him like this. Amy Adams was so sexy and smart and very intense at timesyou will love her. And again each and every actor bought their game to this movie. I will say one thing, if you go to this movie commit to seeing the whole thing because you may be tempted in the beginning to say ""What the heck?"", because I did. But even as I am writing this review I am thinking I will see it again when it is available to rent because I will enjoy the first quarter of the movie more the second time after I have learned to really love the characters. I give this movie the most unusual ""B+""."

","Wow, filmmaker David O. Russell has come a long way to becoming one of the most popular filmmakers today. Recently having impressed audiences with The Fighter and Silver Linings Playbook, Russell has struck gold a third time in a row with his latest flick, American Hustle.<br/><br/>Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale) is a man from the Bronx who sports a comb over hairstyle. He works in running cons with his lover Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams). They have been doing successful in conning people to giving them money thanks to Sydney's fake British persona Edith Greensley. Even though they are succeeding, they're lives are complicated by Irving's wife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence) who he refuses to divorce out of fear of not being allowed to see his son. It isn't until FBI agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper) tricks them by being a customer and then arresting Sydney. Feeling attracted to Sydney, Richie will release them on the condition that they help him arrest four other con artists.<br/><br/>In order to set this up, Irving has one of his friends pose as an Arab Sheik looking to invest in American business. An associate suggests doing business with Camden, NJ mayor Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner), who is looking to legalize gambling. David O. Russell's film is one of mystery, craziness, and you don't really know who is conning who until it is all revealed at the end.<br/><br/>David O. Russell continue to show his excellence in directing. Russell does just right at pointing the camera at what is important to the story and how what is happening pays off. Another way Russell shows his skill as a story teller is keeping us interested in these characters, who are not really likable.<br/><br/>Eric Warren Singer and Russell co-wrote the script, which gives the film a nice Goodfellas vibe. With the majority of their screenplay focused on Irving and Sydney, it gives us a nice insight into what is in it for each of these characters and how they are all developed.<br/><br/>Christian Bale does an excellent job leading this ensemble as the con man who wants business. Bale dedicates himself to this performance by having gained weight and giving Irving an interesting looking comb over hairstyle. With this role, Bale shows us a guy who does his best to keep his cool despite what he's going through. Amy Adams is knocks her role out of the park as Bale's co-lead and Irving's lover Sydney Prosser. Adams does some impressive work not just as a con artist tricking people with her British accent, but also keeping us on our toes in making us unsure if she is loyal to Irving or Richie. Bradley Cooper is the best in show here as FBI agent Richie DiMaso. As Richie, Cooper showed us how much he has grown as an actor. I liked the choices Cooper made in showing us how much charge Richie is taking and keeping things in order, while trying to please his unhappy boss. Jennifer Lawrence is a riot as she pulls off the role of a 1970's New York housewife. Lawrence engulfs herself into looking the part to a tee, with the hairstyle and dresses she wears. Lawrence does so by using the mannerisms used then and how she gets nosy into her husband's business. Jeremy Renner does some nice work as the mayor who wants to do what he can to bring business to Camden and be able to get the economy going. I even enjoyed the cameo by Robert De Niro as Victor Tellegio, a mob boss who is also looking to do business in Atlantic City.<br/><br/>I also quite enjoyed some of the technical aspects to it. The production design of the film done by Judy Becker was so well done, I felt like I was right there in 1970's New York. The costumes designed by Michael Wilkinson felt authentic to the time period depicted in the film. The soundtrack also had a lot of great tunes that also contributed to the Goodfellas vibe I was getting."

","Just got out of the theater for this one. <br/><br/>American Hustle is a brilliant blend of great acting, a perfect script, and copious amounts of dark humor to keep everyone thoroughly entertained during the film's two hour and twenty minute run time.<br/><br/>Bale absolutely nails it as a sleazy con man that we can somehow relate to and shake our heads at the whole time, and Adams has once again grown as a competent actress to match him. This duo could not have been more perfect for this story. Bradly Cooper also extends his acting range and slowly let's the audience in on the pathetic nature of his character. Cooper had several scenes that had the whole crowd rolling with laughter. <br/><br/>...and the there's Jennifer Lawrence. Wow. Will she ever stop topping her self in these dramatic roles? I was worried about a younger actor standing up to the other heavy weights on screen, but she steals the show in every scene she has. The ""Live and Let Die"" scene is bound to wind up a classic.<br/><br/>To speak of Hustle's convoluted (but ultimately tried and true) plot would be cheating (hustling) the audience out of the fun residing in this masterpiece. While certain scenes definitely required more developed empathy for the characters to achieve the desired effect, Hustle invests the time to keep us on edge at least, and is a film that gets better with each and every scene.<br/><br/>Go see it with attentive eyes and you shall not be disappointed.<br/><br/>9/10"

","I have to admit that I was allured by the film's critical acclaim, and having seen and immensely enjoyed 'Silver Linings Playbook', I thought I was in for another David O. Russell hit. The film has its moments, the plot is fairly simple, con artists get busted by the FBI, and they have to dig themselves out of a hole, by helping the FBI catch a bunch of crooked politicians. The story progresses with moments of jealousy and all sorts of dysfunctional relationships. The film's structure and style is a complete rip off from Martin Scorsese: the voice over, music, freeze frames, slow motion, flash cuts, are all trademark Scorsese storytelling techniques, which are over used. The ensemble was enjoyable as a whole, but individually I felt like I was watching caricatures of people and not actual people, in the exception of Jeremy Renner. Overall, I really did enjoy the film, I see it more as a comedy, I felt none of the characters were ever in real danger, or any of the ""drama"" plausible. Anyone who goes out to watch this movie will probably enjoy it, but it won't blow your mind or leave an impression. You'll forget you saw it once you get out of your seat."

","Well I can just say that David O. Russel and I don't see eye to eye on stylistic film making. I didn't quite feel like I was in the 70's besides the outrageous outfits and totally distracting hair. Even with hair and wardrobe, Christian Bale still nailed it. As he did in The Fighter. That movie grabbed me, it inspired me, and reeled me in.. I can't say the same for Silver Linings Playbook or this one. I might give David O. Russel another try in the future.. Only if he uses Christian Bale again but that's about it. In the end, this movie was a big let down for me. With all the raving reviews around it, i expected more. It's a movie with incredible actors who i felt tried to conquer each other on set. And only Christian Bale won."

","I saw ""American Hustle"", starring Christian Bale-Batman in the Dark Knight movies, Newsies; Jennifer Lawrence-Katniss in the Hunger Games movies, Silver Linings Playbook; Bradley Cooper-Silver Linings Playbook, the Hangover Movies; Amy Adams-Lois Lane in Man of Steel, Enchanted and Jeremy Renner-Hawkeye in The Avengers-2012, 28 Weeks Later.<br/><br/>This movie is based on a real situation that happened in the late 1970's. The movie starts with Christian fixing his hair. He is overweight-I heard that he gained 40 to 50 pounds for the role-and he is balding, with longer hair on the sides of his head, which is what he is combing over to cover the bald spot-he is even using glue to keep it in place. Believe me, it is not a flattering scene but it does let you know a little about his character. He is a con artist. Amy is his partner and she uses a fake British accent to fool their 'marks'. Bradley plays an FBI agent that busts them and then decides to use them to get bigger fish. Jennifer plays Christian's loopy wife; she tricked Christian into marrying her and adopting her son, but she never leaves the house. She doesn't seem too bright, either but Christian stays because he loves the boy. Jeremy plays the mayor of New Jersey, the bigger fish of the FBI's take-down operation. There is a lot of good 1970's music, but FYI, Led Zeppelin's 'Good Times Bad Times' is not in the movie-it is used in some of the trailers. There is also a good cameo for a mob boss that shows up. It's rated ""R"" for language, violence and sexual content-no actual nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 18 minutes. I would probably buy this on DVD."
"MyloMan30","7","2","8","19 December 2013"," Enjoyable film but not a classic
","I went into this movie not really knowing what to expect. For me the trailers didn't really seem to reveal much which can be a good and bad thing depending on the type of person you are.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the movie and thought overall it was very well done. The movie starts out a little slow as it sets up the back story but that is to be expected. There is a flashback scene that talks about how Christian Bale's character came into the conman business and I found that somewhat uninteresting but it's a short scene so that can be forgiven. The story really picked up once they got the ball rolling with Carmine and wanting to bust higher profile people.<br/><br/>Christian Bale's performance was very well done throughout the entire film. I totally bought his character and I have no complaints with his role at all.<br/><br/>Amy Adams delivered another strong performance as well. Her accent was solid and I think she did a very good job in expressing her emotions as she tried to set up the entire con.<br/><br/>I may be the only person who wasn't completely buying Bradley Cooper's character. I thought his performance was fine but didn't necessarily think that his character would do some of the stuff that he did. That put him in awkward positions having to act and express emotion that seems beyond his character.<br/><br/>I thought Jeremy Renner did a really good job and complimented the entire cast very well. He really shined in this role and if he wasn't surrounded by such a strong cast, might have gotten more recognition for his role.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence's character really grows on you after awhile. At first she isn't in the film much but they gradually increase her screen time so that you get to see more of Rosalyn and how she lives her life. If you're a fan of Lawrence, you will absolutely love the final bedroom scene between her and Bale.<br/><br/>The movie overall was solid and the performances are great and while I think it will be nominated for some best picture awards, I don't think it should win. I think the ladies in the film will be up for some awards but I don't see Bale or Cooper receiving any awards for the film.<br/><br/>I think they missed the mark on this being any type of nostalgic, classic, have to watch multiple times movie. Then again, a movie only becomes that way after a long period of time. It's definitely worth a watch in the theaters and again at home if you're a fan of the actors but if someone told me that they didn't see this film I wouldn't think that they had missed out on some masterpiece like Shawshank Redemption, Goodfellas, etc."
"therunner42","8","2","9","30 December 2013"," An Interesting way to Spend the Afternoon
","American Hustle will be a big contender at most award ceremonies this year and it's easy to see why. It is a unique and captivating story with some standout acting performances. Set in the 1970s and focusing on two con artists, this film certainly won't be like anything else you see this season. Christian Bale and Amy Adams excel in their lead roles but the real surprise is Jeremy Renner, who despite not being nominated for a Golden Globe, delivers the best performance as Mayor Carmine Polito. The costumes and sets are very well done and quite fascinating at times. I did get tired of the low cut thing for Amy Adams though and thought the costuming was very one dimensional in this sense no matter how fab she looked in it. It is a long film and gets a little slow at times so bring some food in with you. Overall it's not a bad way to spend the afternoon.."
"blanbrn","6","2","9","24 December 2013"," Good look at the real life world of scandal, bribes, corruption, and greed with ever lasting power struggle.
","""American Hustle"" is one of those movies that when you watch you feel entertained and fresh still you feel a little sour and down to earth after you see what the world of greed and power struggle can do to people as each person and every organization is full of corruption and must figure out their own way and methods to survive. Based on the real life scandals of the 1970's mid to late of the 10 year period in New Jersey a con man named Irving Rosenfeld(Christian Bale)meets up with a sexy social kitten Sydney Prosser(in Amy Adams's best and most sexy role)and together they form a team that lures scandal and con games to make money for them as each and every way each scam is tied to different organizations and cruel underworlds. Even when FBI agent Richie Dimaso(Bradley Cooper)enters the investigation he joins the team with a plan to oddly enough set up a crooked and corrupt politician and that's a New Jersey city mayor named Carmine Polito(Jeremy Renner)and you guessed with politics it's dirty laundry that involves power brokers and the mafia. All along Rosalyn Rosenfeld(Jennifer Lawrence)the wife of crime king Irving just drinks up her pain and sorrow of sin in distilled spirits. Overall ""American Hustle"" rings true to life as every person is for him or her it's a way of life with greed, corruption and scandal as director David O. Russell again proves with a cast that has great chemistry that life is tough dark and never pretty as sometimes you have to do it ugly just to get by and live."
"smallwondr1818","7","2","9","21 December 2013"," Bale and Adams Give the Movie Heart
","First, the IMDb synopsis describes Amy Adams as the ""British"" partner. She does not play a Brit. She poses as British.<br/><br/>The movie, contrary to many reviews, is not frothy, or light or even a comedy. It is a drama that has comedic elements. It is a good show, not a great movie. Also, all the Jennifer Lawrence accolades are surprising when, in fact the most impressive performances belong to Christine Bale and Amy Adams. The press have a love affair with Lawrence which may be understandable considering she gives a great uncanned interview and she is talented. Watching her is always entertaining, but not surprising. I have only seen her in Silver Linings and in American Hustle. Basically it's the same character and both close to who she appears to be (without the neuroses and hysteria). She is charismatic and real always. But not surprising. <br/><br/>Amy Adams on the other hand is amazing. She seems to create iconic characters that bear no resemblance to each other and yet they are entertaining, real and riveting. Yet she hasn't gotten the great press or the big accolades.<br/><br/>Contrary to reviews saying that Lawrence blows everyone away, NOT SO. It is Bale who blew me away. This Welsh man completely embodies a Bronx con man with such humanity you can't help but love him. And, this is the first role I've seen him where I found him wildly attractive, despite his comb over and pot belly. His character could have been a repulsive unsympathetic pig, but instead, he is the one with whom we identify and the heart of the picture. His accent is perfect and he doesn't fall into the trap of lots of actors portraying New Yorkers--going over the top. He is restrained in that area. His mannerisms are right on and his heart is on his sleeve which may, partially, be credited to the script, but he embodies that character brilliantly. When he is on the screen, he is the one I am watching.<br/><br/>Bradely Cooper, an excellent actor, did not fair as well. Again, he may have had a tougher job bringing out the humanity of the character, but that is the job of the actor. And he could have done it better. I did not care about his character, and I should have. <br/><br/>Lawrence has the easiest role. A real character, funny in a crazy neurotic way. She has the flashy, comic-relief role that always gets noticed. And she plays it well. But again, it wasn't sympathetic and it should have been. But she is charismatic and entertaining to watch.<br/><br/>I had a similar reaction toward American Hustle (AH) as I did to Silver Linings Playbook (SLP)--okay, watchable, but what's all the hype about? AH is a far better film. SLP was a smaller, quirkier film with a script that seemed contrived. But AH suffers from some of the same problems, but with a much better script, and great twists to keep the audience intrigued. However, it didn't quite fly. It didn't breathe and take flight. <br/><br/>In a way AH is bogged down by the very thing that makes movies great: characters. Unfortunately, some of the character idiosyncracies were forced. For instance, the come over worked perfectly for the Bale character. In his youth Irving protects his father by ""creating"" business for him in a less than honest way; as an adult he protects himself in a desperate, self-justifying way: feeling a continuing vulnerability, Irving does what it takes to overcome (over comb) it and fit in--his comb over is a metaphor for his vulnerability and for his misdirected determination to ""overcome"" even if it requires dishonesty. Unfortunately, the director uses the same ""hair"" obsession to much less success for the Cooper character. In that case it just seems contrived. It provides a cheap laugh, but otherwise it's a self-conscious disconnected device.<br/><br/>All in all, it was an interesting piece of fictionalized history, even illuminating and certainly ironic (the good/bad guys get caught but the real bad guys go untouched) with some good characters/performances and great performances by Bale and Adams."
"mhlong","8","2","9","20 December 2013"," An Enjoyable Evening of Entertainment that requires one to think
","I just saw this movie tonight and I found it very enjoyable. I knew it was about people playing con games, and from the one or two previews I saw, I suspected it was sort of an updated version of The Sting, which was a movie that required the viewer if he/she really wanted to enjoy it, to actually think about it. I spent most the movie trying to figure out who was hustling who and how far would each go. I knew specifically that Bradley Cooper, Amy Adams, and Jennifer Lawrence were in it, but I didn't think about Christian Bale until about 15 minutes into the movie, that's how well into his role he was. He reminded me of a few other actors who with the right makeup and wardrobe sort of look like that, Paul Rudd for one. I found Jennifer Lawrence's character to be highly enjoyable. I was also very appreciative to see both Jack Jones and Anthony Zerbe having small roles in this movie as the major part of their careers took place in this era. It added a sense of understanding by the director/producers to the movie, to reach out to an audience who lived through it. A couple of drawbacks, Amy Adams hair was not 70/80's in the least except for one scene. The movie was probably about 20 minutes too long and some of the flashbacks (partial spoiler) such as the one where Bradley Cooper actually beat up his boss, could have easily been deleted. It added nothing to the movie except time. I will probably see it several times when it comes to cable. My wife and our friends also enjoyed it."

The standout performance was Michael Pena who is usually great in everything and Amy Adams who is probably the best American actress working today. Jennifer Lawrence looked like she was spending more energy in angling for the soap opera limelight than actually focusing on her character and Bale looked as bored as I felt watching this drivel. All of the characters were irredeemable. I didn't want them to succeed, I wanted to see them fail. It was just so contrived and half-baked. There are far better films worth your time."

","Critics think this film is brilliant. However, it has many faults. It's too long, confusing and complicated. It's supposed to be a comedy - but isn't funny at all.<br/><br/>The only character who's in the slightest bit interesting is the histrionic who's played by Jennifer Lawrence."
"ElMaruecan82","6","1","3","21 December 2016"," Slick, smart, quirk, irreverent, decadent... it tries desperately to be!
","I don't know if I have a bigger problem with O' Russell's films or the ecstatic reception they meet. His last film I saw was ""The Fighter"", and while I didn't dislike it, I couldn't get all the praise, it was a passable movie with solid acting but too many loose ends to make the whole experience satisfying. Yet this director made the extraordinary achievement to have two movies in a row nominated in all four major categories, which has never been done since ""Reds"", in 1981. I'll check ""Silver Linings Playbook"" soon, but from what I discovered in ""American Hustle"", what stands for great acting is the capability to act weird and over the top while in super disco disguises, well, then give a honorary Oscar to the wardrobe and that'll be enough.<br/><br/>But the film is supposed to be a comedy!<br/><br/>And I'm sorry but it is NOT obvious that the film is a comedy, as a matter of fact, the tone of the story goes all over the map and you can't really figure out whether it tries to be a lighthearted con-tale or some multi-layered character study. If it's a comedy in the sense that we shouldn't take it seriously, well, that doesn't say much about the film. But it could have been both funny and serious, this is not the hardest stunt a film can achieve, especially with a good script, but David O'Russell goes in too many directions for the film's own good. In the end, too many scenes, too many improvisations, too many jump cuts and cheap turns and twists, made the experience of watching the film extremely disorienting. <br/><br/>Speaking for myself, just when I started to get emotionally hooked to Amy Adams' Sydney (and her chemistry with Christian Bale's Rosenfeld), there had to be the character played by Jennifer Lawrence popping up and getting increasingly 'important' in the plot. And this sassy bitch, obviously meant as a comic relief, would even get on Freud's nerves. As if it wasn't messy enough, you've got someone who's obviously not part of the solution, and keeps on nagging and shouting.. well, if that's supposed to be funny, just give me drama. And don't get me started on the ""Live and Let Die"" part. <br/><br/>I know the music is an inevitable element when you make a period piece, and on that level, O'Russel has a pretty good taste in music, but music feels like noises superposed to other noises, not just a background. Now, it is obvious that this is a wannabe Goodfellas and Casino, but it turns a rather banal scheme into something of labyrinthine complexity, just to milk the acting of the four stars and justify the awards nominations. I'm pretty sure that each of these characters were interesting on their own, but in terms of effects, they all cancel each other, we can't individually root for them, since they all spend their time acting like jerks, trying to outsmart each other and win the 'quirkiest character' contest. If you make a film about swindlers, a minimum of likability is vital, otherwise, to the degree that you'll start to understand what's going on, you won't really care for the outcome. <br/><br/>It's not about having likable characters as morally right but providing enough perspective on their lives so you ca genuinely care for them. And this is why ""Goodfellas"", or ""The Sting"", are still acclaimed masterpieces, first, these films are easier to follow without being ""less complex"" than American Hustle. But more than that, you have a clear view on Henry Hill's backstory and you see why Hooker wants to get Lonnegan. In ""American Hustle"",, we have to assume that Irvin and Sidney had no other options in their lives, and that Rosalyn was actually smarter than her husband, the film asks us to take many things for granted, which could have been possible if the editing wasn't so deliberately chaotic. It's a pity because some parts were nothing short of cinematic brilliance. I, for one thing, loved the friendship subplot between Carmine (Renner) and Bale, culminating with that funny 'oven' scene. And it's very revealing that the only one who didn't get any award buzz was Renner, the one who played a straight and realistic character. <br/><br/>It's like acting was elevated to some carnival level. All the others were just dressed as if they were invited to a 70's themed party and spent their time shouting and overacting, Amy Adams being the constant subject to an obvious fetishist cameraman while baby-faced Lawrence was forcing herself to convince us she was some mature thirty-something woman. And I know many directors have their darlings, but it was too distracting to see the same actors again playing again for the same director no matter how chameleonic or versatile they are, it is distracting. Renner was the good thing about the film, so was Bale to a certain extent, and the last twenty minutes were good but not as emotionally rewarding as they should have been if the rest of the film matched that quality. Maybe there's something to blame on the directing, editing, or storytelling, or maybe I'm an idiot who doesn't get the brilliance of O'Russell. <br/><br/>But there was a similar film directed the same year, a co-nominee named ""The Wolf of Wall Street"", it was a wannabe ""Goodfellas"" too, but as Hitchcock would say, self-plagiarizing is style. And there's another thing that gives the edge to ""Wolf"", it focused on one main character, and two supporting ones, and Leo was the pillar, the film could get over the top, it never lost its focus. O'Russell wanted to pull a Scorsese style-wise, but it's like he was intoxicated by the exuberance of his characters and the flashiness of the 70's setting. That he convinced the world this was a masterpiece is perhaps more fascinating than the titular hustle."
"g-hbe","8","1","3","7 March 2016"," Quite an experience.
","I'd heard lots about this film but never seen it until it popped up on TV the other night. The plot (such as it was) sounded intriguing, so we cracked a bottle of wine and settled down to watch. It quickly sucked us in, but we had great difficulty following the dialogue due to some of the actors gabbling and mumbling their lines. My wife nodded off, but I decided to stay with it for the sheer spectacle and drama as the set-pieces and the music came together to make an almost hypnotic experience. Incredible, and at the end of the picture I was so wound up by the experience that I woke up my wife to tell her she'd missed a real treat. I'd give it 10, but the difficulties with the incomprehensible dialogue mark it down. It may be an English/American thing."
"Gideon24","7","1","3","12 December 2015"," David O. Russell explores Scorsese territory
","David O. Russell followed up his brilliant Silver Linings Playbook with a somewhat effective excursion into Scorsese territory called American Hustle, an explosive and elaborately mounted period piece that takes a bitingly accurate look at the hedonistic 1970's and the art of the con, seen primarily through the actions of three characters that is allegedly fact-based. We are told at the beginning of the film that ""Some of this actually happened,"" whatever that means.<br/><br/>The main players here are Irving Rosenfeld, the owner of a string of dry cleaners who begins a very profitable confidence scheme with Sydney Prosser, a sexy and smart hustler who not only knows how to watch the bottom line, but how to manipulate it in her favor. Irving and Sidney's increasingly cushy existence is stalled by one Richie Di Masso, a smart-ass FBI agent who offers Irving and Sidney immunity in exchange for their help in aiding him to nail some much bigger fish, as well as lining his own pockets.<br/><br/>Other key players on this complex but fascinating canvas include Irving's wife, Roselyn, a not as dumb as she appears housewife and mother, who refuses to be seen and not heard and is not above using Irving's son as leverage against him; Carmine Polito, the mayor of Camden, New Jersey, Stoddard Thorsen, Richie's boss, and a phony Arab sheik.<br/><br/>Russell has undertaken one of his largest stories that is on the surface a look at the greed and hedonism of the 1970's but does whittle its way down to an intense look at mob and political corruption, keeping the involvement of actual mobsters and politicians to a minimum and the complicated triangle formed by the trio of central characters, anchored by a dizzying monitoring of Sydney'as loyalties, which is the apex of the triangle primarily because Sydney really is the smartest character in the movie. Unfortunately, the film does lose a few points in the originality department, as images of Scorsese work like Goodfellas and Casino leap to mind, minus a lot of the in your face violence we get from Scorsese.<br/><br/>The performances are, for the most part, first rate. Christian Bale, cinema's second greatest chameleon behind Jared Leto, undergoes a remarkable physical transformation to bring the slick yet pathetic Rosenfeld to life, though he really just seems to be sort of channeling Robert De Niro. Amy Adams turns in the performance of her career as Sydney, a rich performance that effectively nails the character's intelligence and vulnerability. Bradley Cooper scores with his slick FBI agent too, though I think he was better in Silver Linings Playbook. Jennifer Lawrence offers another explosive performance as Roselyn that rivals her Tiffany in Silver Linings and Jeremy Renner is an eye opener as Mayor Carmine.<br/><br/>As with most of his work, Russell's direction trumps his writing, which, as always tries to encompass a little too much, but most of the film's running time is legitimized. Russell, Bale, Adams, Cooper, and Lawrence were all nominated for Oscars and I think Adams should have won, an actress I once thought of as a one-trick pony who has proved to be anything but. The film also boasts a kick-ass song score of some of the greatest music from the late 70's early 80's. Russell makes a mighty big leap into Scorsese territory here and though not completely successful, has mounted a watchable film that sustains interest for most of its running time."
"jimmichaels","8","1","3","16 November 2015"," Alright
","In this movie Russell let the actors improvise. Christian Bale, who plays Irving Rosenfield, said that he was worried that they will lose the plot at the script, but Russell told him that he is not so interested in that as much as the expressiveness and development of the characters. Unfortunately, Bales anxieties came true, and throughout the film there's a bunch of unnecessary sentences and sequences that do not have too much to do with the main course of action, so that the viewer inevitably at times loses attention. The film itself does not carry any special message, or forces us to any thinking. It's a bunch of over-expressed characters in one place with witch the observer cannot identify himself with. The great things are the costume and set designs that are carefully presented and authentically reflect the atmosphere of the time they talk about."
"JohnnyWeissmuller","8","1","3","25 October 2015"," American Hustle
","In David O. Russell's American Hustle, Christian Bale plays a conman who works - and is in a relationship - with Amy Adams, although he's also married to Jennifer Lawrence's character. When they're caught by Bradley Cooper's FBI agent, a deal is made for their freedom if they'll cooperate and put a sting on the local mayor, played by Jeremy Renner. Set in 1978, American Hustle is brimming with style, confident performances and astute direction mixed with a terrific soundtrack that features Duke Ellington, Wings, Frank Sinatra, Elton John and Ella Fitzgerald, amongst others. It's well written and perceptively clever, although it's more akin to being a showcase for the broad performances of its stars than a clear narrative. A narrative that may have more to say about post-Watergate political corruption and underworld influence had it remained more focused on singular story-telling aspects. Instead, Russell doesn't allow the intricacies of the plot to easily settle, keeping the performances taught and the audience engaged in those performances in spite of any subtext that may be culled. And the performances are excellent on every level, although Bale does look quite similar to Tom Cruise's Les Grossman -- and there are broad comic strokes abound here. Especially in a character we first see gluing down a piece of turf-cum-hair onto his head before working on the most elaborate comb-over you'll ever see. But that's key to the narrative and a world in which the characters exist solely on what they outwardly project -- Amy Adams is particularly good here, with dual accents and a a sexual allure that has who she wants doing what she wants. Although Jennifer Lawrence's performance reaches moments of tour-de-force bringing her own sexuality met with a coy duplicity and a touch of naivety amidst the scheming. Cooper and Renner have more straightforward parts, but bring a strong and vibrant presence to key roles. Whilst the feeling for the period, complete with garish and revealing outfits, works a treat and adds its own facet of curiosity amidst flared trousers, gaudy jewellery and plunging necklines. The ultimate payoff may not have the sting one would hope for, but this is vibrant and knowing film-making that asks for repeated viewings and faulters only in making an apology for the kind of characters we enjoy spending time with."
"landrewv","10","1","3","22 February 2015"," One of the best films made in 2015
","American Hustle, loosely based on the late 1970s Abscam political scandal with a social story added to puff it up, is one of the greatest films of this era and easily the best film Hollywood has produced since No Country for Old Men. To recite the reasons why this film attains such Olympian levels would take a dissertation; I'll try to do it in a few paragraphs.<br/><br/>-- Acting of the principal roles. To say American Hustle if full of stars is like saying 9/11 was a national disaster. The acting of the principal and supporting roles is universally insightful and credible, beginning with Christian Bale who turns in the best work of his career, full of subtlety and nuance yet laced with over-the-top emotions. He is equaled by the star-turn of Jennifer Lawrence, America's hottest actress who is undoubtedly this era's version of Barbara Stanwyck or Susan Hayward. Watch Hayward's Academy Award-winning performance in 1958's I Want To Live and convince yourself this isn't Lawrence playing that role. Her acting is at over often over the peak emotionally and lacks subtlety, but that will come with age and experience. At age 24, she is already among the greatest female stars and is destined for further greatness in the years to come. Amy Adams, one of the best supporting actresses in Hollywood, also is the best here she's ever been, expanding her resume with a sexual performance far from the buttoned down roles of Doubt, Julie & Julia and elsewhere. Bradley Cooper, who helped fund the film, is far more effective than in his last film with many of these actors, Silver Linings Playbook, as are the supporting actors from Jeremy Renner as Carmine Polito down to Robert DeNiro appearing unbilled. Few films with such star power achieve anywhere near the orgiastic heights of American Hustle.<br/><br/>-- Universally wonderful and credible acting is always a result of direction, so equal marks to director Mark Russell.<br/><br/>-- Next on my list is the camera-work that captures every actor in extreme close-up at one time or another, revealing their humanity and transcending what could have been cardboard cut-outs instead of flesh and blood people. Watch Jennifer Lawrence's make-up when Pete Musane (Jack Huston) wipes away her tears after her confrontation with husband Bale when she reveals to the mob what's really going on. Or stay tuned for Bale's carefully nuanced sideways glances throughout, always caught in close up. Remarkable camera-work throughout is among the most distinguishing landmark's of this awesome movie.<br/><br/>-- A script, partially based in reality, that moves at laser speed, rarely giving you a chance to catch your breath, while also telling a compelling story about greed, incompetence, lust, family life, loyalty and the sidebar we love to see on the screen these days, the Mafia. Never does this script let us down, whether it's telling the story of Abscam, the real-life political scandal of the 1970s, or the made up story about a scammer-art dealer-laundry owner and his complicated relationships with a family, girlfriend, loan marks, the FBI and all the other slime that comes into contact with his life. The script gets an A-plus and is nearly as good as the Coen's Western metaphor, No Country for Old Men.<br/><br/>-- Danny Elfman's musical score, featuring lots of real-life 1970s hits and even an occasional hit from the 1960s -- White Rabbit is from 1967 -- endorses the period and its excesses to a capital T.<br/><br/>-- Production values and editing makes a film with lots of drama and negative content into a joy to watch from the opening to closing scenes. Instead of being repelled at the shenanigans of these hucksters and their ties to organized (and disorganized) crime, we revel in joy from scene to scene watching these characters in our voyeuristic pattern of living a second life as a bystander to the history being portrayed on the screen.<br/><br/>-- Art direction, costume design, look and feel. Compare this movie, which accurately depicts the late disco era, to the failure in art design, costuming, hair and makeup of The Last Days Of Disco, a 1990s fantasy about 1979, to see how this aspect of filmmaking can make the difference between a movie of greatness and one of mediocrity.<br/><br/>-- Editing and continuity. The story begins in one place, transfer to another place and time, then returns to the original spot and moves forward in roughly chronological order from that point. At all time the editing is superb; there is never a lost scene or one that seems out of place or order.<br/><br/>I watch 30 movies a month and rarely do I see one where all the elements come together so well to create such a wonderful atmosphere of entertainment. American Hustle is sure to be watched as long as people watch movies and can take its place in the pantheon of social misfit-crime dramas that began with The Godfather and have carried into modern times through the likes of Goodfellas, Casino, Kill the Irishman and No Country for Old Men.<br/><br/>Having seen this film just about every week since August, I would now say it is -- along with The Pianist and No Country For Old Men -- one of the three best films I have seen in the 21st century. Of the three, this is the most remarkable filmmaking."
"thomas-w15","10","1","3","24 January 2015"," Very good once it gets it's feet on the ground
","American Hustle 7.5/10- I will start this off by saying that I am a huge fan of David O'Russell, Bradley Cooper, Christian Bale, Amy Adams, and Jennifer Lawrence. It is an understatement to say that I hold David O'Russell's directing and his screen writing at the highest regard. American Hustle cons its way into making a near-masterpiece of film making. <br/><br/>When I saw the previews for American Hustle, I read that American Hustle is loosely based on the 1978 ABSCAM scandal. I would explain what that is, but I do not want to ruin the movie for you. What I will say is, American Hustle gives a completely new view point on the FBI and how they do things. As said in the movie, the world is not black and white, it is gray. Now, none of the depiction of the ABSCAM scandal would be believable it was not for the great costume design. Bradley Cooper's curly hair looked hilariously superb, but Christian Bales comb over looked fantastic. The costume design department obviously knew what they were doing when they made these risky moves that more than paid off. <br/><br/>It is impossible for me to describe how great the screenplay was. The movie has a lot of ground to cover in a short two hours and five minutes. American Hustle moves at an electrifying pace that informs everyone on the background of all the people involved. The movie is a shoe-in to be at the very least nominated for an Oscar in the screen writing department. Now, a great movie is nothing without great acting. The acting ensemble that American Hustle gathered from all of his previous movies and a few new members was perfect. A lot of credit goes to both David O'Russell and the casting department.<br/><br/>When it comes to the acting, I do think everyone in the audience would agree that it was top-notch. Amy Adams, who plays Sydney Prosser, continues to deliver these amazing performances where she is sure to get a best actress in leading role nomination. Amy Adams plays the con-artist partner duo alongside Christian Bale. Christian Bale, who plays Irving Rosenfeld, amazes the audiences by his ability to commit to a role. Not many actors in Hollywood would be willing to give up a six-pack and gain forty pounds and have a comb-over for one movie role. This is what makes Christian Bale stand out. He can play any kind of character. He obviously did his homework for the role because he demonstrated his knowledge of the con game as the character that Bale plays is revered as one of the best con-artists of the 20th century. The Christian Bale-Amy Adams duo worked out well together and they showed good chemistry together. The characters they play, Irving Rosenfeld and Sydney Prosser go into the con-game together and are eventually forced to work with the hot-headed wild FBI agent Richie DiMaso. Bradley Cooper, who plays Richie DiMaso, gave a career best performance. He does not play very many characters that are arrogant and selfish, but no one in the audience would even guess that. Bradley Cooper also must have done his homework as he is being taught the con game by Irving Rosenfeld in American Hustle. Jennifer Lawrence will no doubt be nominated for best supporting Actress and I think she has a good shot at winning. Jennifer Lawrence plays Irving Rosenfeld's wife Rosalyn Rosenfeld. She has played this type of character before unlike the rest of the cast as she plays the loose cannon that can blow up the whole con whenever she becomes upset. Just like in Silver Linings Playbook, Lawrence plays someone who clearly has mental problems and her performance is so believable that some people guess if she actually has any mental issues. That is of course NOT true, she is just a normal nice cool young adult who deserves to be biggest in demand actress in Hollywood. But, that is neither here nor there.<br/><br/>Last year, Silver Linings Playbook was the first movie to be nominated for an Oscar in all four acting categories. I think American Hustle has a legitimate chance at doing what Silver Linings Playbook did. It is just one of those movies that makes you love every single character despite all of their flaws and you kind of end up rooting for all of them<br/><br/>All in all, American Hustle deserves all of the great reviews it has gotten. You do not even need to like any of the actors to love American and I would recommend this movie to anyone thats wants to see one of the best films of the year. <br/><br/>For more of my reviews, go to my website at reviewsbywest.com"

","I was expecting it to be better. I thought this was fair, but there have been better movies made about the fbi, mob, and swindlers. And this movie clocks in at over 2 hours, so if you devote the time to see it, pay attention; otherwise, some of it won't make sense.<br/><br/>You have Irving and Sydney scamming people out of money. The fbi come in and agent Richie gives them a deal. Help the fbi bust some dirty players, and they will get off scot free. So they get mixed up in politicians, bribing senators, and the mob. They are wearing wires to try to get money exchanging hands. Then you have Irving's wife thrown in for sex appeal since she just wears low cut tops. So I guess the big twist is, will Irving give up the mob and possibly risk retribution. Will the plan work with the fbi so he gets out of prison? The acting was OK, nothing great and the plot seemed stale. It's been done before.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: It's long, drawn out, I recommend it only if you are big fan of one of the actors in it."
"Joxerlives","6","1","3","24 May 2014"," Entertaining but like its' characters empty on the inside.
","'American Hustle' is a very curious film, it just doesn't seem to be able to make up its' mind what it wants to be, comedy, drama, heist film? I think the real problem with it is that the 2 central con artists are actually pretty unlikeable, we never end up warming to them in the way the makers obviously want us to do. It's a cliché of many movies that the people who get ripped off are always greedy and unlikeable and therefore we don't feel bad when they fall for it. In 'American Hustle' their scam is to find people who are so desperate for a loan that they're prepared to advance them $5000 as a non-refundable fee (a lot of money back in the late 70s) in the hope they can arrange a much larger loan in order to save their businesses and they never even try to do what they've been paid for? Not exactly Robin Hood? The FBI meanwhile are portrayed as largely a series of conflicting fiefdoms and career opportunists who need this pair of grifters because they lack the kind of street savvy needed to blend in for these types of cases. <br/><br/>On the good side it's probably worth watching this film just to see the amazing transformation of Christian Bale, making this famously handsome actor just unrecognisable. As a Buffy fan it's interesting to see alumni Jeremy Renner, Elizabeth Rhom and Amy Adams all in the same film. The recreation of the 70s is suitably spot on. But in the end it's all rather unsatisfying, we have a series of crooked politicians go to jail but frankly Renner's character is the most likable person in the film and the Mafia get away scot free. It's all nice to look at but ultimately vapid."
"Jac23443","10","1","3","20 May 2014"," A Film that Brings Back Class To The Big Screen!
","Finally!! A classy picture for those tired of watching up-to-date modern garbage. This movie is for those wanting a classic feel of a movie that actually contains human emotion. I enjoyed this film so much, I've already seen it seven times, and counting because I plan to watch it again very soon. This movie made me feel as if I were thrown back into the old days.<br/><br/>The Cons: Okay so the only thing that bothered me about the film were some of the bribery scenes, they seemed very forced, very awkward to watch, just a little thing in the beginning of the film when he moves the case towards Carmine (Jeremy Renner), other than that there was really nothing wrong with it at all.<br/><br/>The pros:<br/><br/>The script is beyond engaging and entertaining making the characters all the more intriguing to watch, the colors are very beautiful, the cinematic value even better. The person who made this movie truly respects what movies used to be and meant, it really does tell a story. No matter how lost you feel in this movie when you first watch, there will always be something you missed when you watch it again. It is witty, and again, I say this again because it is the truth, it is a classy film, it doesn't make you feel like you just watched recycled material from the oldies, it is a movie all its own, creative and original.<br/><br/>The characters, Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence starring in another movie is FILM GOLD! You cannot go wrong with a film starring either of these, especially Jennifer Lawrence, who is an important presence in films at the moment. Christian Bale plays a con artist who tricks the desperate into falling towards pointless loans with an outrageous advance price of $5000. ""I give 5, you give 50, right?"" He gets caught up in a scheme plotted by another desperate FBI agent (the film revolves around the desperate, because they are easy to be tricked, (you give them all the power, they become yours to mold) hence the ending, where the con artists con the very man who hired them to take down big names in politics. The stories in between and the drama are just to add to the atmosphere of the seventies, which is incredibly written and beautifully executed. This film is very poetic, (the story of survival is one that never dies) and if you are an avid lover of film, you will not pass this movie up, because I guarantee there will be something you loved about it."
"alishahmohd","9","1","3","11 May 2014"," Fantastic performances & settings carry an above average narrative
","American Hustle is a movie based in the 1970s and is about a real life operation called ABSCAM which took place during the same time period. And just like most films based on real life events this movie does not do everything in accordance to what happened in real life. For instance in the real event Bradley Cooper's character did not play such a role in the operation they were many other feds involved. <br/><br/>Now what this film does is that it tries to be a black comedy while also trying to be a serious movie, for me it actually works, it will make you laugh at several scenes and the serious scenes will make you understand the seriousness off the situation and grasp your attention. The movie started out excellently, with a pretty funny scene between Bale and Cooper arguing and then playing a great song from it's fantastic soundtrack, while rolling the opening credits. The beginning was done so well, that it had me hooked to the rest of film, I probably wouldn't have been interested in the slow back-story scenes that followed, if it wasn't for this great start. After this the film does some comedy scenes, some serious scenes and many songs as a routine while carrying the plot at a very very slow pace. What is a huge negative is that the film moves at an extremely slow pace and this story, which is not that interesting could have been told in a much shorter time. While I was happy with the conclusion, the overall plot/narrative was not that great, its setting, atmosphere and most importantly the performances are what carried this film. <br/><br/>Christian Bale, man I don't know what to say, he is extremely dedicated to any film he is in and any role he plays, he gained over 40 pounds and got a huge tummy for this movie, and this is the same guy who lost over 60 pounds for the Machinist and also lost weight for the fighter. And he is always completely into his characters. His performances in the sequels of Batman films were good but from what i have seen he has done so much better, his fans should do themselves a favor and watch his non Batman films to see how great of an actor he really is. I must say I liked his performance the best out of the cast.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence was fantastic, I haven't seen her Hunger games film but she is extremely charismatic and keeps you interested and keeps you listening and pay attention every time she is on the screen. Amy Adams does a serviceable job, she looks good in this film and her dresses are hot, her acting and dialogs are OK, apart from some scenes where she actually is really good. Her English accent was kind of bad though but maybe that was on purpose. I never considered Bradley a good actor but he kind of impressed with his performance, some people call him a weak link, I think he did a good job, yes he acts all goofy and silly and he acts all naive sometimes, but he is playing a naive power hungry fed anyway. Plus he gives this film a good comic relief believe it or not, his facial expression at the end of the film was just hilarious. Jeremy Renner also did a good job. De Niro's was awesome in his short cameo wish he had a more expanded role. The minor characters did well.<br/><br/>The film does a great job of recapturing the environment of the settings with it's awesome screenplay and setting, clothes, environments, everything is done so well. Apart from the performances I just love, love this film's soundtrack every song fits the scenes and they are all nice to listen, the soundtrack is one of the highlights of this movie, I absolutely loved the songs ""The Dirty Work"", ""Horse With No Name"" and ""Long Black Road"". <br/><br/>Overall I enjoyed the American Hustle, it is a great film in my honest opinion. Does it deserve all the Oscars and praise it has gotten, debatable, but this was an enjoyable film and had the narrative been stronger, shorter and moved at a faster pace, it would have only made this film better than it already is. <br/><br/>Overall Rating: 8.5/10"
"zhaohan_dong","8","1","3","7 May 2014"," American Hustle better than 12 Years A Slave
","I've watched these two films recently. What I believe is that American Hustle is better than 12 Years A Slave in many aspects.<br/><br/>First, American Hustle's soundtrack is really amusing, making the whole atmosphere of the plot properly.<br/><br/>Second, I have to mention about some really serious things like cinematography and the arrangement of shots.<br/><br/>Both films contain some Cut Away shots. I love CA, sometimes to give people time to think about the subject, and to make the film more interesting. But 12 Years A Slave's CA shots really made me mad. I still cannot know why they made such things. While in American Hustle, those CA shots are very good.<br/><br/>For cinematography, American Hustle's is very motivated, is a kind of inspiration. You can watch the film getting the most information from the visual impact. While for 12 Years A Slave, not so good for only WS, MS, CU, WS, MS, CU, sort of that. Boring when you always get the same view in different part of the story.<br/><br/>Really think American Hustle is a good film. Not the best, but the better."

After all of the hype from the Oscars and the reviews, this movie really does live up to its expectations and the clever writing do bring a little comedy to the movie. At the end of the day, this is definitely a movie not to miss. Great!<br/><br/>Round-Up: Bradley Cooper seems like he can't do no wrong at the moment. Coming from Silver Linings Playbook, which he also starred in with Jennifer Lawrence & Robert DeNiro, he has made some great choices in his career. Christian Bale had shown that he really does have a wide range with his acting skills. Coming from the Batman franchise, this is definitely a complete different type of movie which he play quite well. Amy Adams brought some light to the movie and she has also shown that she is a terrific actress with with a wide range. Jennifer Lawrence was a big surprise to me because she is mostly known for her role in the Hunger Games franchise, but she was brilliant in the film. <br/><br/>Budget: $40million Worldwide Gross: $252million (WOW!)<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into there intense dramas about a couple who have to take down corrupted politicians. 8/10"

","I had high hopes for this film having seen the line-up, and I wasn't disappointed. Christian Bale, Bradley Cooper, Amy Adams, Jennifer Lawrence and Jeremy Renner pull together to create a story that is fast paced, smooth and witty. Each character is so strong and brings something totally different to the film, and the quality of acting was some of the best I've seen.<br/><br/>The entire film has a beautiful relaxed 70's atmosphere which complements the pacy dialogue, and hits the ground running with a flashback opening scene. Atmosphere provides a real escapism here: the sets, costumes, music and dialogue are glamorously old-fashioned and authentic. Straight away the audience is drawn into the world of con artist Irving Rosenfeld (Bale) and his relationship with partner in crime Sydney Prosser (Adams) and the mysterious FBI agent Richard DiMasio (Cooper). The film unfolds slowly and smoothly moves between various hustles and more explosive character interactions. It really is the incredible dimensions that each character has within the story that makes it so enjoyable: the contrasts between Adams and Lawrence, and Bale and Cooper's roles provides some wonderful moments of comedy, emotion and drama. There's also a great minor role for Robert De Niro to watch out for. <br/><br/>Slick and glamorous, American Hustle boasts an excellent cast and top- class acting. This pacy and dramatic film is sure to keep you captivated throughout the many plot twists through its engaging characters and beautiful styling."
"Buddy-51","9","1","3","17 April 2014"," A full-throttled tribute to the American con man
","For all that we revere the farmer, the soldier, the statesman, the law enforcer, the clergyman and the hero, we Americans have always reserved a special place in our hearts for the outlaw, the gangster, the card shark, the con man, the hustler. It's a trait that goes to the very core of our identity as a people, a crucial element in our national mythology. From our most humble beginnings, hustling has stood as a time-honored tradition, a value ""as American as apple pie."" Indeed, whole genres of literature and popular entertainment have sprung up around this idea. And for all the lip service we pay to what we righteously call the Protestant work ethic, we can't help but subversively admire those who are able to achieve the American Dream through less noble and less arduous means. Indeed, our history is populated with scoundrels and scalawags we've somehow managed to turn into folk heroes, and, while today our grifters operate on Wall Street or in corporate boardrooms rather than on the western frontier, the characteristics are the same: they're all just slick-talking manipulators operating outside the system and making a fortune while doing so. And, oh, how we love it! Unless it's being done to us, of course; then, we're not so crazy about it, which is why when it involves political corruption, the fleecing of us the taxpayer, we may no longer be quite so forthcoming in our admiration.<br/><br/>""American Hustle"" is David O. Russell's smart and savvy tribute to the con artist in all of us. He and his co-writer, Eric Warren Singer, have chosen to set their work in the 1970s, an age of polyester suits, ultra-wide lapels, porkchop sideburns and bad comb-overs. It was also host to one of the biggest financial scandals of the modern era, Abscam, an FBI sting operation that resulted in the convictions of a mayor (played by Jeremy Renner), a United States Senator, six United States congressmen and an assortment of state officials from New Jersey and Pennsylvania on bribery and corruption charges. ""American Hustle"" starts off by declaring that ""SOME of this actually happened,"" and, indeed, the movie's often absurdly comic, larger-than-life quality makes us question the veracity of a good deal of what we're seeing. But no matter because the movie is clearly more a study in character and theme than it is a factual recounting of the events of history (which explains why all the names have been changed to protect the guilty).<br/><br/>And what a cast of characters Russell has gathered for our amusement and delectation! A paunchy, balding Christian Bale plays Irving Rosenfeld, a natural-born shyster who's found a way to earn money (to the tune of $5,000 a crack) through offering loans to people desperate for cash, money these down-on-their-luck individuals will never see. Irving is married to Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence), a scatterbrained chatterbox who is so high maintenance that Irving is forced to live on his own even though he supports her and her son, whom he's adopted as his own. Irving's problem is that for all his willingness to rip off people, he may be just a tad too softhearted to be very lucrative at his profession. Enter Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams), an attractive woman with some secrets of her own who becomes Irving's business partner and lover. They're not in the business very long before undercover FBI agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper) blows the lid off their operation, offering them immunity from prosecution if they'll help take down some bigger fish. Richie is, in many ways, the focal point of the screenplay, a preening, overreaching lawman whose main concern is netting as many big fish in his net as he can in order to make a name for himself. It's not long before tensions are developing among the three principal players, and much of the movie's fun derives from watching these two outsized figures, who find their value in being able to manipulate others to their own advantage, engaging in what amounts to a giant pi**ing contest over strategies, ethics and even Sydney herself.<br/><br/>As with any good tale of con artists and grifters, ""American Hustle"" beguiles us with the spectacle of hustlers hustling the hustlers, since, as we're told, hustlers are ultimately just people ""doing what they need to do to survive."" It gets to the point that not only do the characters not know who's telling the truth and who's playing whom, the audience can't tell either. And even though Richie thinks he's shrewd enough to play in the big leagues, he soon learns the bitter lesson that, when it comes to hustling, amateurs should never mess around with professionals.<br/><br/>Russell employs a dizzying whirlwind technique - consisting of fast-paced storytelling, energetic camera-work and editing, snappy dialogue, crisp narration - that puts one in mind of ""Goodfellas."" Even when the action is set in an enclosed room, which is often the case, the movie never stops moving. It's alive and we're alive to it. Moreover, the spot-on period details, especially the uber-tacky 70s fashions, only serve to heighten the absurd humor of the tale we're watching.<br/><br/>""American Hustle"" boasts one of the finest acing ensembles we've come across in quite some time, which, in addition to the main cast, includes Louie CK, Michael Pena and Robert De Niro, among others.<br/><br/>There's a manic energy in both the performances and the filmmaking in ""American Hustle"" that perfectly reflects the soul of a nation founded on youthful vigor and anti-establishment rule-breaking. And indeed it's that uniquely American spirit of anarchic iconoclasm that Russell captures to such memorable effect in ""American Hustle."""
"donwc1996","10","1","3","14 April 2014"," Riveting and Compelling
","This film is not for everyone. It demands that you pay complete attention to what is going on because so much is happening so fast that you practically sit there with your head spinning trying to keep up with it all. It is probably the most complex script I have ever been subjected to and it is just that complexity that is both riveting and compelling. The cast is uniformly superb - a true ensemble film - but Amy Adams steals every scene she is in because she is so beautiful - truly gorgeous - but beyond her knock-out looks there is a true magic to her that Disney certainly used in their film with her. There are a couple of scenes with her and Bradley Cooper that have to rate as the sexiest ever put on film and they will definitely get your heart pumping in a way it probably has never done before. Christopher Bale, on the other hand, proves beyond the shadow of a doubt that he is just about the best actor around he is so convincing in his part and in fact he manages once again to look so different you don't realize who it is at first. All of the elements of this film are excellent - the music - the settings - everything is first rate and top notch. But it is demanding and if you're looking for something light and frothy this is not the film for you."

","I recently spray painted my chaplin statue gold to look like an Oscar. If this film is an Oscar winner then we mere normal painted punters are being airbrushed out. I'm not angry, I don't feel duped, let down; I only slightly care this was one of the worse films I've ever tried to get through in two sittings because there is one thing right about the Oscar category - its in as comedy bla bla. Well the real reviewers are so right about that. Whilst us film goers are totally bemused any critic is giving this film an Oscar nod or a gold plated ten out of ten review, they are right it is hilarious. Not obviously in the vein of comedic value like shaun of the dead or dumb and dumber - no its laugh out loud because its obvious, the script is so funny you can laugh along guessing the next tired idea, the music is plonked on top and how you can laugh out loud guessing the next 70's classic. In fact, I almost enjoyed this movie except its a film not a crummy 70's sitcom. A huge number of people involved spent time and money making something meant to be arty, cool and groundbreaking using great actors and music to thrill us. Result - a boring film so clichéd to amuse yourself pick out the film references as you watch along. In fact, this film has merit - it could be used in film school to study how not to copy, how to ruin a script, bore the audience, repeat oneself and how not to edit you could make an entire lesson out of it. So in fairness what was right? Well all the actors trotted along merrily overacting never reacting or interacting, however no one was the star, which could be novel except there is no character between them you can empathise with at all. I assume the audience is expected to empathise with bale but he mumbles along and looks forever stuck in a nightmarish bad fancy dress 70's party he cant wake up from. In fact, perhaps the worse fault of the movie is how aware the viewer is throughout entirely that these are actors they are dressed up and acting. Personally, I like improvisation here it is simply so poor the story gets swallowed up forgotten and ultimately all you are left with is aesthetically pleasing shots - its all fore play no climax to the bitter end which any grifter movie watcher can see coming a mile off. The wolf of wall street - heavily criticised - is the easiest valid comparison it rattles alongs has a similar story based in the real world and has a fairly simple structure but, unlike American hustle or American bullshit as it was originally called, its is really funny, is full of rounded characters you care for, flawless in terms of scenes, script, editing, acting. In fact, you are instantly absorbed and immersed in their world completely. American hustle spends the first twenty minutes and we learn about 70's fashion and not one minute on learning sharing or believing these are grifters then the next hour and a half wasting the audiences time half heartedly playing us cool music and copying camera dolly shots following characters around you don't care about till it peters out. someone somewhere find me someone who didn't guess they were going to fleece the FBI about half way through? If this film gets an Oscar sack all critics and have a long bath or start writing scripts. I read a fair few of the normal punters reviews and we speak as one; this film is as sprayed gold as a statue and as much fun to watch - superficial weak characterless boring."

"michael_the_nermal","7","1","3","6 February 2014"," An Amusing Comedy, But Not a Classic
","PLOT SPOILERS AHEAD. <br/><br/>In brief, this movie is a comedic homage to ""Goodfellas."" Everything stylistic about this movie calls back to ""Goodfellas,"" from the dialogue, the camera work, the characters' personalities, the use of pop music as a motif, and, most annoyingly (to me), the third-person limited out-of-body narration by the characters. This director obviously admires Scorsese, thinking him one of the great pioneers of cinema, and it seems that he wanted to make this movie as a valentine to him. I thought ""American Hustle"" was much more entertaining than ""Goodfellas."" For one, the tone is lighthearted, witty and fun; ""dark"" is not an adjective I would use to describe this movie. Second, some of the characters in this film have redeeming qualities--something sorely lacking in the cold and amoral ""Goodfellas."" I do question some of the producer's casting decisions, particularly that of Jennifer Lawrence as the protagonist's wife. This movie tries to touch upon themes of political corruption and its causes; the ""villain"" of this piece is not as rotten as he seems. The film seems to be saying that the ends justify the means, and that behind some Boss Tweeds there are noble Robin Hoods (that's not to say that Boss Tweed did no good for the people of New York; scholarly articles on New York history will reveal this). This movie does not have a pat morality, and I appreciate that point of view. I think viewers will, too, and will definitely appreciate that the comedic tone lightens these serious themes, preventing this from being a somber, depressing movie.<br/><br/>Now on to the negatives. Firstly: the plot. This movie is based on a political scandal that happened over thirty years ago, and is all but forgotten today. I know filmmakers--notably Louis Malle--have tried to make a film about the ABSCAM Scandal since the participants were sent to jail; but I think the ship has long since sailed on giving this subject a film treatment. Something more timely would have seemed appropriate this far ahead. ABSCAM is too obscure an event off of which to base a movie in 2014. Bigger scandals from around the same time, like the Iran-Contra Scandal or the Savings and Loans debacle, seem better for film topics; the general public might make an emotional connection, in the current economic mess, to the perfidious and larcenous behavior of those in the late-'80s Savings and Loan scandal; but I digress (which I love doing!). This film's second major flaw is the casting. I think Jennifer Lawrence is a fine actress. She did well here. The problem isn't with her acting; it's with her age. Her part calls for a middle-aged woman with crow's feet and a smoker's cough. This part called for an an actress of about forty-five who can generate pathos and revulsion at the same time. At 23, Lawrence still looks too young for the part. She is too baby-faced to play the part of a world-weary Long Island housewife. It seems odd to watch Lawrence pull off a performance of a yenta trapped in a shiksa's body. I found it distracting. An older actress ought to have been placed in this role. I thought Christian Bale was okay in his role, though he seemed interchangeable with other actors, like Matt Damon or Markie Mark. Ditto for Amy Adams. I don't expect Oscar wins for any of the actors here.<br/><br/>In all, I think ""American Hustle"" is an amusing and compelling movie. It works well as an homage to ""Goodfellas,"" superseding the work of the director from whom it was inspired. Still, the plot and the casting of Jennifer Lawrence leave one puzzled. I recommend this film, but don't expect a timeless masterpiece, as all the hype would have you expect."
"davideo-2","9","1","3","6 February 2014"," Nearly drowns in style to start with, but does develop into something more solid
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning<br/><br/>Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale) is a small time crook who grew up taking a few hard knocks, who finds a kindred spirit and partner in Sydney (Amy Adams) and together they mastermind powerful and elaborate swindles in high stakes situations. But they push their luck too far and undercover agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper) busts them. To save their skin, they must help him spring a trap on seemingly wholesome Mayor Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner) who DiMaso is convinced is dirty. But as Irving and the mayor come to form a more intimate friendship, loyalties and boundaries get pushed that little bit further.<br/><br/>The 'American' dream always begs to be scrutinized by film makers, who start the titles of their films with the word 'American', implying their desire to scratch beneath the surface and show up the, potentially quite ugly, side to certain aspects of the culture and lifestyle. Here, director David O'Russell takes us back in time to the '70s, colourfully and stylistically bringing the fashion, music and setting back to life to have a stab at the love of the almighty dollar and the drive for material wealth. Yet it's a film that almost doesn't want to be taken quite so seriously, aiming to tell a straight forward, quirky heist tale, if only such strong writing, good acting and all round higher ambitions weren't getting in it's way.<br/><br/>You come to make this assessment as to start with, the film almost seems to get carried away in style, drowning in all the modern flashy, slo-mo tricks any modern day cinema goer would be familiar with, matched by a brilliant '70s soundtrack. But the writing's nowhere near as lazy, and a bit of patience would make way for an intelligent and gripping story, a slow burning narrative that develops in to something fabulous. And if the story is multi-layered and pleasantly surprising, the performances are even better. In the lead role, Bale is a revelation as a dishonest lowlife with an unquenchable spark of humanity burning beneath the surface, but the supporting cast are among the most inspiring, notably Renner as the public spirited politician people just aren't willing to accept breaks the mold in decency, and Jennifer Lawrence as Bale's neurotic ex wife who throws a big spanner in the works as the plot gets under way.<br/><br/>This is the sort of thing that can't be pulled off wrong, and O' Russell and his writers have ensured a tale that is solid, enthralling and revelatory. ****"

Which brings me to my next point - don't expect to see an upbeat caper movie, like Oceans 11 or The Italian Job. This movie is a gritty and sleazy story about cons, excellently told.<br/><br/>The dialogue is witty and fast-paced. Every conversation is a battlefield, and each character is constantly trying to win the upper hand. The women in particular (Jennifer Lawrence and Amy Adams) deviated considerably from their previous roles, and to great effect.<br/><br/>I don't think this genre of movie gains too much from the big screen, but I highly recommend purchasing it on DVD when it is released."

","American Hustle it's a treasure. From the beginning, you feel identified with any of the characters. The good order of the history, the excellent actors performances, a good environment, makes you feel back in the time, like you live back in the 70's.<br/><br/>All actors performances was perfectly acting. Amy Adams feels so engagement with her character, at the point that you feel's that she's Sydney in real live. Cooper was cool, but not one of my favorites. But Bale, god!

At the beginning you maybe feels that he's absent, but in the development hes take's his site.<br/><br/>If you want to compare this movie, I guess you need to think a little in Catch Me If You Can (2002).

","I was waiting for this film and finally got to see it last weekend.<br/><br/>Simply put, its a cocktail that hit me well and I was on a high when I left the theatre. <br/><br/>A nice story with a brilliant screenplay and some terrific dialogues. Add to this, Russell's direction and fine performances from its cast. Frankly, all the 5 actors are my favorites.<br/><br/>Bale shows why he a terrific performer. Unrecognizable with a paunch and wig, he's brilliant as Irving. A wrong man but you feel pity for him because of the circumstances he is in by the end credits.<br/><br/>Adams is sexy and uses her eyes beautifully to express herself while Lawrence is brilliant as Bale's nutcase wife. Lawrence has some of the best dialogues in the film and she uses her body language to the tee. She is 22 yrs old but plays the mother's part with perfection.Check out the scene where Adams and Lawrence meet in the washroom...Mindblowing. <br/><br/>Cooper is excellent as the success crazy and jerk FBI officer. He shows his desperation well while Renner plays his part well as a man who innocently gets caught in this muddle. <br/><br/>Loved the film and a must watch !!"
"bobbysing","7","1","3","31 January 2014"," Its good but not as per the expectations raised by the wide appreciation.
","Based on one of my favourite subjects on conmen & heists, probably I was expecting a lot from this widely appreciated film, nominated in many major categories of 2014 Academy Awards or maybe I am the only one having a different opinion about the film as it seems. Anyway in honest words, I found American HUSTLE to be just a good film with a lot of noticeable merits but not a great path breaking or exceptional movie to be applauded that loudly.<br/><br/>Mentioning it worthy points first, the film has been shot well and written beautifully, especially focusing on the witty dialogues which in fact become the major highlight of the film throughout. Actually it's a thriller which focuses more on its characters, their mannerisms, their spoken words or their way of living life on their own terms and less on any major events or happenings as such. So if you are looking for any great con sequence in particular (as it is always there in such films) then you are not going to find the same in an exact from, but there surely are many enjoyable, worth watching, and commendable performances working as its major triumph card arguably.<br/><br/>The largely convincing acts are led by Christian Bale, who has amazingly got into that shape to play the given character brilliantly and then there is Amy Adams sensually playing his con partner with all her sexy, glamorous looks and elegant dresses having long, open cleavages. Jennifer Lawrence is terrific as Christian's nagging wife and Bradley Cooper is great as the confused FBI agent along with the veteran Robert De Niro, who weaves magic in his only one scene in the second hour. Reportedly based on the real life Abscam scandal of late 1970s, it's about a secret FBI operation to investigate illegal transactions of money involving many politicians, wherein the FBI agent takes help from few con-artists. Director David O Russell uses that familiar kind of backdrop to make an engaging film which is surely great as far as performances and their mutual conversations are concerned. But it frankly cannot be rated as a thoroughly entertaining or a fast paced, thrilling con drama to be precise.<br/><br/>At around 140 minutes, the film turns out to be a bit lengthy and gains its real momentum like an exciting, crime drama in only the last 30-40 minutes of its script. So before that one can only enjoy the film if he focuses more on the characters and their amusing interactions without expecting any great engaging sequence involving the con team. In other words, I found it to be a film where perhaps the ensemble cast and the director was having a more enjoyable time than the viewers. And that should easily give you a hint about the experience I had watching it in the theater. However in case you are the one more interested in enjoying the performances alone then you can sure opt for this over-appreciated movie for just once."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","1","3","26 January 2014"," Perhaps the most well-acted con movie of all time
","If you're an actor with any degree of prominence, you've probably asked your agent to get you into the next David O. Russell picture. Including ""American Hustle,"" the dude has helped his actors to 11 Oscar nominations in his last three films, with a nod in every major acting category each of the last two years. That's unheard of. Needless to say, ""American Hustle"" is a tremendously acted film, perhaps the most well-acted con movie ever.<br/><br/>""Hustle"" is the kind of film you'd expect from Martin Scorsese, not Russell, who has shown a distinct preference for family drama in his previous films, ""The Fighter"" and ""Silver Linings Playbook."" This is a story about deception, corruption, the American dream and love muddling up all of it.<br/><br/>Set in the '70s, ""Hustle"" imagines the story behind the FBI's famous Abscam sting, in which the feds, with help from a convicted con-man, exposed several corrupt politicians by disguising an agent as a fake Arab sheik who offered them money for help with illegal activities. The con-man was Melvin Weinberg, the basis of the film's main character, Irving Rosenfeld.<br/><br/>Christian Bale drastically transforms his appearance (yet again) to play Irving, this time putting on significant weight and giving himself a sophisticated comb-over. Watching him, you'll be in shock that this is the man who played Batman for three films. Irving is a businessman who owns a chain of dry cleaners as well as a con artist with a sharp mind and a big heart. So big, in fact, that after we learn how he fell in love with Sydney (Amy Adams), we discover he's a family man with a wife, Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence) and a son.<br/><br/>The script uses voiceovers for each of the main characters to provide some insight into who they are. Sydney, for example, has longed to be anyone but herself, so instead of ditching Irving when she finds out his main line of work, she takes on the persona of a British lady with banking connection in London. Together, they con desperate lowlifes who think they'll land $50,000 on a $5,000 investment.<br/><br/>Everything changes when FBI agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper) catches them in the act. Knowing he has them by the throat, DiMaso leverages their haplessness into helping him set up sting operations. If they comply, he'll drop everything he has against them and let them walk. They start by setting New Jersey mayor Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner) as their mark. As they develop and carry out Abscam, however, DiMaso's brazen behavior gets them all way over their heads.<br/><br/>Every role in Russell and Eric Warren Singer's (""The International"") screenplay gets ample material to work with, which is part of what makes ""Hustle"" such an incredible ensemble film. Even Lawrence, who plays the wild card character who has little to do with the actual plot, gets a few meaty scene-stealing moments. It might be her best performance yet in terms of proving just how diverse an actress she can be.<br/><br/>Adams also does some of the best work of her career. An Academy darling with four nominations in six years, Sydney is her most worthy performance of any of them. The role effectively showcases her one-two punch of toughness and beauty in a way previous roles haven't. Sydney is independent-minded but hopelessly in love, dangerously seductive but morally conscious. Given her outfits, you'd make assumptions about here character, but you'd be wrong.<br/><br/>Cooper's character is hot-headed comic relief as the FBI agent driven by dreams of catching the big fish. Richie controls the pace of the film and Cooper uses that to his advantage. He's another character with a distinct moral ""direction,"" as sometimes he's a confident go-getter, sometimes he's a baby and sometimes he's everywhere in between. Renner's Mayor Polito is also complex; most con marks in a film are despicable scumbags, but he might be the most likable character in the film.<br/><br/>Much of the dialogue was improvised, so that tells you how much of a character-driven film this really is — actors truly becoming their roles and bringing out instinctual emotion on screen. A version of this film could've been easily done in a way that focused entirely on the intricacies of the scam, setting up situational humor or melodrama as a result of strictly plot points. ""American Hustle"" takes on a life of its own with these actors/characters really playing off one another. Production pieces such as costumes and a killer '70s soundtrack set the stylistic tone more so than the direction or the screenplay.<br/><br/>As much as the talent sets ""American Hustle"" apart from similar genre entries, it's a con film at heart, in which the satisfaction comes from a big twist and seeing who comes out on top when the smoke clears. Although this movie does push the message of people believing what they want to believe, Russell's previous films had more thematic and emotional weight to them. ""American Hustle"" is more entertaining, but less fulfilling — a fun con movie with phenomenal, praiseworthy acting.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

","I'm sure many people were compelled to watch American Hustle because of the Oscar buzz alone. Along with the glowing reviews, I became one of these people. I expected a clever, witty and brilliantly made film but this fell far short of my expectations. The one stunning thing about this film is the acting performances. The female leads stuck out particularly with Jennifer Lawrence providing the only real laughs of this supposed comedy. Christian Bale is also very good but it baffles me why all the awards nominations have been showered on Bradley Cooper when his performance is unspectacular and was far out-shined by that of Jeremy Renner. The production and direction is good but this cannot make up for the shocking lack of plot and incomplete characters. By about half an hour in I was looking at my watch as this film does nothing to hold your attention further than the impressive wardrobes and visuals. If I was to sum up this film I would say that it is well made but dull. It is typically what the Academy rewards but if this goes on to win Best Picture it would be more than a shame."

The joy beyond drama inside the characters is the Appealing that gets the movie together. The funny thing of being sad was never better played. A kiss between two women never said more about life and the play of emotions before. This movie is an ode to female wisdom. Forget about gangsters, the Mob, Atlantic City, corrupt politicians, these are just side stories. The only topic of the movie is our own hopes and fears we have to deal with, whether our game is big or small. It just doesn't matter."

","Its not like me to usually agree with the films that are up for the most Oscar nominations. But I've got to admit to being impressed with ""American hustle"" before I even knew it had been so widely praised by everyone else.<br/><br/>Yes, I went into the cinema (making myself go because I hadn't been for a while) knowing only that Christian Bale was probably going to be great in a film I knew very little about. Except that it was set in the 70's.<br/><br/>Little did I know the whole film was going to be a whopping success. ""American Hustle"" has a decent story, is unexpectedly funny, and is jam packed full of great performances. Which got me really into this, as even actors I previously thought were over-rated, or nothing more than good looking stars were great here.<br/><br/>I'd go as far as saying ""American Hustle"" has single handily changed my opinion of at least 2 actors I previously had little interest in. Amy Adams in particular is amazing in this. While Bradley Cooper was also good, as a character who surprisingly adds a lot of laughs to the film. But perhaps unsurprisingly the stand out stars are Bale and Jennifer Lawrence. Lawrence in-particular steals every scene, while Bale, as usual, puts everything he's got into his main part.<br/><br/>Just go into ""American hustle"" with an open mind, like I did. Don't let the hype that is now behind the movie build it up to some sort of impossible standard. It is simply a funny, classy, well made flick, that I couldn't take my eyes of off for over 2 hours."
"KennethBillings","10","1","3","19 January 2014"," Superb performances by Bale and Adams
","American Hustle Review By Kenneth Billings Valley Thunder Production<br/><br/>From the moment I saw the trailer for American Hustle, it leaped to the top of my ""must see"" list. Boasting the most impressive ensemble cast of any film this year, this story of a clever anti-hero and his literal partner in crime promised the potential to be a contender for either the top prize either the Oscars or the Razzies, leaving no room for middle ground. As the honors continue to stack up for ""Hustle"" during awards season, it is obvious that the talents of David O. Russell, Christian Bale, Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence, Amy Adams, and Jeremy Renner more than delivered. Though billed as a ""comedy"", ""Hustle"" does not fit so neatly in this genre and should only cautiously be considered alongside 2013's other laughter-seeking fare. While ""Hustle"" has some definite ""laugh out loud"" moments and you will without question find yourself smiling as you leave the theater, Russell's story is much deeper than the typical jokes, gags, and one-liners relied upon by films in this category. In ""Hustle"" you will find yourself rooting for the criminal cheating on his wife while empathizing with him for his choice, longing for the good-guys comeuppance, heartbroken and hopeful for the co-conspirator/mistress, and being equally appalled, sympathetic and happy for the selfish, self-indulgent wife. Lastly, you will find yourself pondering (and ultimately discovering the answer to) the great life question posed by Russell – ""What the hell is the relevance and importance of a damn bottle of fingernail polish?"" As equally impressive as Russell's carefully crafted story, and possibly more so, are the performances delivered each and every member of the cast. When a film boasts an ensemble such as this, it is often a victim of its own provenance falling woefully short of its potential. In ""Hustle"" however, the obvious chemistry between the actors, coupled with the masterful individual performances and Russell's storytelling set a new high-water-mark. Though much of the press surrounding individual performances in ""Hustle"" has centered on Amy Adams and Jennifer Lawrence, I find myself scratching my head at the fact that Christian Bales performance is being so overshadowed and that he is only considered an outside contender for the Best Actor Oscar. Perhaps it is because I am partial to character actors, but to me it is the artists who truly transform themselves into the character they create who are the elite artists and master craftsmen of the screen – performers like Daniel Day Lewis, Jauqin Phoenix, and Johnny Depp. These are performers who go beyond playing a role to becoming the person they portray. Christian Bale has become one such performer. Bale impressed me immensely with his portrayal of Dicky Eglund in ""The Fighter"" but in ""Hustle"" he solidified my respect and admiration for his craftsmanship. In portraying Irving Rosenfeld, Bale, in my opinion, reached a level few actors attain. In his performance, Bale became ""lost"" in his character in a way that had nothing to do with costuming, comb-overs, or prosthetics. Staring at the screen, I saw not an actor portraying a character, but an individual coming to life on screen so believably he could have stepped onto a street in 1979 New York City and no one would have raised a brow. From his dialect, cadence, mannerisms, and gestures to his accent and appearance, Bale disappears into Irving Rosenfeld leaving us with a performance hard to match by anyone. Like Bale, Amy Adams continues to deliver performances that seemingly overshadow each one before Adams turn as Sydney is no exception. In portraying the con-artist/co-conspirator/mistress of Rosenfeld, the most naturally beautiful woman in Hollywood turns in another knockout performance giving us a mere glimpse at the emotional range she brings. I have long admired Adams talent as an actress. I believe that her star will only continue to rise and ultimately she will be considered one of the greats. However, when it was announced earlier this year that she would be taking up the role of hell-raising, hard-partying rock pioneer Janis Joplin I found myself scratching my head. Adams is a beautiful, refined woman in every sense.Janis Joplin – not so much. How the hell was that ever going to work? True, Charlize Theron's transformed from blonde vixen to the rough around the edges and everywhere in between serial killer Eileen Wornoss, but like Bale she disappeared thoroughly into the character. How on earth, would the astoundingly beautiful Adams be able to pull off a transformation into the more than ""plain Jane"" Joplin? Watching ""Hustle"" however, I soon had my answer. As I watched Adams portrayal of ""Sydney"" at her most emotional and vulnerable stage – crying, with puffy red eyes, un-coiffed hair, etc – I got it. Though much has been made of Lawrence's performances of late, I'll confess – I have never been a big fan. Not that she isn't a talented actress, I just haven't seen examples of her ability to the extent to find her living up to the hype. In ""Hustle"" however she earned a great deal of respect from me as she displayed an emotional range I had not yet seen, and her role in the film afforded her the opportunity to more fully explore a more complex character than those she has portrayed in the past. Ultimately, ""American Hustle"" promised a big bang for the buck and delivered on every count. Russell's carefully crafted story combined with stellar performances by the film's stars created a movie not to be missed. Though it may miss out on the Oscar's biggest prize because of the Academy's trend to avoid financially successful films, ""Hustle"" should be by no means avoided anyone who considered themselves either a devoted or casual movie fan."

"davidgee","6","1","3","15 January 2014"," Jennifer Lawrence the best reason to see this
","Fresh from winning awards at the Golden Globes - including Best Comedy, this didn't really work for me - especially not as a comedy.<br/><br/>American HUSTLE wants to be a sort of update of THE STING. But what THE STING had, in abundance, was a deftness of touch which HUSTLE only serves up in fits and starts. It gets off to a slow burn and it's a half-hour too long. Christian Bale is clearly trying to outdo John Travolta's comic sleazeball in PULP FICTION, but although his predicament is funny, his performance isn't. Bradley Cooper relies too much on his looks and misses the chance to be entertaining as well as gorgeous. <br/><br/>The women are wonderful, as the Golden Globes have recognized, but I would have given the Best Actress award to Jennifer Lawrence rather than Amy Adams: Lawrence's blonde bimbo is in the league of those memorably fruity creations served up by the late great Madeline Kahn. The supporting men outshine the stars, especially Jeremy Renner as Mayor Carmine, venal rather than corrupt, a hugely likable 'Jack-the-lad'. Robert de Niro delivers an uncredited cameo as the 'Boss of Bosses', neatly spoofing Don Vito Corleone.<br/><br/>There's a non-stop soundtrack of 70s disco and soul hits which helps carry the movie past some of its longueurs. Costumes and cinematography are ace, but for my money American HUSTLE just doesn't come off as a comedy. It's not as stylish as THE STING, which had pitch-perfect performances from its male stars, and it lacks the 'gothic' touches that allowed PULP FICTION to provide a whole new definition of the crime- caper movie. <br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence is the best reason to see HUSTLE. If she was up against Cate Blanchett in the Oscars (where there can only be one Best Actress), it would be a close call. Between Blanchett and Amy Adams, my money will be on Cate!"
"Spondonman","7","1","3","12 January 2014"," Tulip Or Turnip
","There were many stylish and deep movies made in the '70's with thoughtful plots and acting and poignant soundtracks from The Godfather way down to The Story Of O – to go over the same ground again so soon takes some balls. It has to be special in some way to drag me back to that modern stone age while I still remember it so well, but unfortunately this isn't the film to do it.<br/><br/>Comedy? It's a pretentiously complicated and generally boring tale of conmen, politicians, gangsters, in fact all very similar people and their molls loosely based on fact. Very stylish photography and undeniably wonderful acting by all the leads doesn't help me – it's deadly dull, flat, stale and unprofitable from start to finish. The story is so tedious and the comedy is so grim that what should be interesting is not and it just left me cold. So what if people wore big curlers, were suspicious of microwaves and phones had wires way back then; now film itself is redundant, audio sound is so perfect but there's nothing new worth hearing and soon we'll be able to converse with our coffee cups. As the Kinks sang in 1977 Life Goes On! The whole enterprise was probably aimed at the billions of people who have no pre-digital experience at all, billions who it must be hoped have more patience than me. Wasn't there any room for the Eagles' Desperado or one of Dean Friedman's songs or hairdo's? Or more to the point the Who's Won't Get Fooled Again or even better, Let's See Action?! I recall the Duke Ellington band's classic question posed at the Newport Jazz Festival in 1956, not on the original LP shown so lovingly in this film though but just after the second Jeep's Blues on the 1999 CD release: Tulip or turnip/rosebud or rhubarb/fillet or plain beef stew – tell me dreamface/what am I to you? Tulip Jennifer Lawrence's great performance is perhaps the only reason to watch this - but even a quick snog between her and Amy Adams can't save this overall from being a Prize Turnip.<br/><br/>I'd be surprised if the DVD isn't remaindered and if it's ever on the telly more than an obligatory twice in the next ten years. It definitely is a well made film but presumably mainly for self-declared clever and arty people and not me; for this even to be in the running for Awards only tells me some hustling has been going on."
"Alec0312","6","1","3","10 January 2014"," Scorsese sans Scorsese
","David O. Russell, coming off the heels of his success with ""Silver Linings Playbook,"" works his talent on the crime genre of films with ""American Hustle."" Too bad it was a better film 20 years ago...when it was called, ""Casino."" Or was it ""Goodfellas""? Nevertheless, this crime drama/comedy comes across as a day late and a couple bucks short, yet still manages some entertainment factor despite a ""been there/seen that"" approach.<br/><br/>Christian Bale stars as a con man in late 70's who's scam is basically the precursor to ""I'm a Nigerian Prince"" emails of the late 90's. He eventually teams up with a bored secretary played by Amy Adams, and the two beginning tricking desperate chumps into pouring money out to get a bigger loan amount. Naturally, they are caught red-handed by the FBI, and pushed under the thumb by agent Bradley Cooper, with his Serpico beard and Garfunkel hairdo. The FBI cut a deal with Bale to sting a couple of corrupt politicians in lieu of jail time, because in the Hollywood world, the FBI loves to screw other people into screwing other people. Eventually the operation, titled ""ABSCAM"" (for ""Abdul Scam"") involves convincing a New Jersey mayor, played by Jeremy Renner, into accepting a bribe by an Arab Sheik for revitalizing the Atlantic City boardwalk's casino empire. But, being that this is a crime flick and the stakes are so high, things get muddled and messy, and not everything goes to plan. Along the way, other parties become in involved, including Bale's bored, unsatisfied housewife, played by Jennifer Lawrence, and the mob themselves, lead by a cameo'd Robert DeNiro. <br/><br/>The main problem with the film is that it feels almost out of touch with today's audiences. Had this film been released back in the mid-90's, it would've starred DeNiro, James Woods, Sharon Stone, Joe Pesci....ah hell, it would've basically been the entire cast of ""Casino,"" with Martin Scorsese at the helm. Much like ""Super-8"" was J.J. Abrams attempting to emulate Spielberg, ""Hustle"" is David O. Russell's homage to Martin Scorsese (who ironically, released ""Wolf of Wall Street"" late last year and was as much as an homage to himself). <br/><br/>Christian Bale's performance is a bizarre impersonation of Robert DeNiro (and gets even stranger when he's sharing a scene with DeNiro himself) and is more or less Bale attempting to wow the audience with his method acting of gaining 40 pounds, shaving his hair bald, and putting on a Bronx accent that is still stymied due to his mouth breathing. Bradley Cooper is reminiscent of a coked-out, neurotic James Woods who despite being the federal agent of the film, comes across as the least likable character. Amy Adams does well with her multi-layered performance, but there's something about Adams in every film she does that despite her being an Oscar worthy actor, she never accomplishes any standout performance. Despite her Oscar winning performance in ""Silver Linings,"" Jennifer Lawrence is woefully miscast in this role. I'm not saying she doesn't do a good job (she does), but her young age shows too brightly in this role as a single mom, which ironically I thought she was older in ""Playbook"". Her accent was also too minuscule for playing a working class Long Island princess. Jeremy Renner does fine as perhaps the most sympathetic character in the film, being a corrupt yet good intended mayor. Louis C.K., Alessandro Nivola, Jack Huston and Michael Pena round out the ensemble cast.<br/><br/>All in all, ""Hustle"" is a decent film and is in no way Russell's worst (that honor goes to ""I Heart Huckabees,"" which incidentally I enjoyed). But when your film credits include the intensely poignant ""Three Kings."" masterfully crafted ""The Fighter,"" and the strong but sweet ""Silver Linings Playbook,"" your reputation is always on the line after back-to- back Oscar winners. No doubt ""Hustle"" will be a good contender during the Awards season, but that's possibly because this year has been a drought for artistic merit. It's never good to win by default.<br/><br/>Rating: ***1/2 out of *****"

Unfortunately, I feel an interesting and involving plot has been sacrificed somewhere along the way. This makes the running time seem way to long.<br/><br/>And it seems that someone has had a bit too much fun with the dressing up box. For at least the first hour of the film I found the '70's costumes and hair etc distracting too much of my attention away from the story being told.<br/><br/>While the actions and decisions of Irving and Rosalyn seem consistent and understandable with their characters throughout, I cannot say the same for Richie. It seems a bit far fetched that he should begin so in control of the situation to being so easily seduced and duped by Sydney as the English Lady Edith. Not to mention losing it by beating his superior. (I thought Sydney had dropped her English accent long before she confessed to Richie!)<br/><br/>This isn't a bad film.

","Director Russell figures, wisely, that at this late ""Post 9-11"" date, nobody really cares if a big-budget scam movie is based on reality or whatever. So, rather ""tongue in cheek"" as the movie begins comes a disclaimer that some of the events actually happened telegraphs one shouldn't worry about the real ABSCAM story, but will hopefully chose to be entertained instead.<br/><br/>American Hustle does entertain, but at times it does so in such a ploddingly slow build that it tests the viewer's endurance. From the start one doesn't doubt that Christian Bale has once more (emaciated in The Mechanic) suffered for his art: packing on 35 or more pounds and sporting a shaved upper skull in order to don a scrap of a toupee to create one of cinemas most horrid ""comb-overs"" of all time. It's quite a sight to see Bale like this. His character is pretty complex and Bale seems to hold back in order to create an interesting dichotomy of sleazy Jersey conman skin with a secret, and highly intelligent, inner thinking man.<br/><br/>Like some other famous crime duos when the proper con-woman falls into his orbit the scams get bigger...And, much more profitable. Amy Adams plays Bale's accomplice and mutual love interest. Adam's character is much more polished on the surface than Bale's. However, underneath, they're cut from the same cloth. Adams is constantly displayed as ""eye-candy"" with revealing neck and hem lines, but she nails the role so well her looks are just part of her character. As one might expect as the cons get bigger it attracts the attention of an FBI agent named Richie DiMaso played by Bradley Cooper. DiMaso is all about career advancement and he sees an opportunity to get a con-man in his pocket for something much larger. Cooper has grown into a good actor, he gets across the drive of an agent that while ultimately getting some high profile indictments destroys himself in the process. Cooper's DiMaso really is a tragic character here and it really comes across. Fleshing out Bale's character, Irving Rosenfeld, is the fact he has a family which he is largely absent from, but not estranged. He cares for his wife while not actually loving her, and he truly feels that he is a father to her son from a previous marriage. I'm not sure what this tells us about Rosenfeld, perhaps that he has a chivalrous code? His wife is the lovely Jennifer Lawrence who really pulls limited screen time off with aplomb. There's nothing too amazing about the cinematography excepting it captures the era nicely and, largely, just gets out of the way. The direction and writing are a few notches above the median and Bale, Cooper, Adams, and Lawrence push it yet a notch or so more. There is such scant comedy it wouldn't bear mentioning excepting that what it entails is low-key brilliant if compact. I'm talking about agent DiMaso's interaction with his boss played by Louis C.K.. Robert DiNiro makes a clichéd appearance as a mob boss and the most interesting thing I can say about it he spoke in Arabic which added one more dimension to DiNiro's Mafia repertoire.<br/><br/>It's likely you could care less about learning what ABSCAM was. But, though this movie may be mostly based on that now iconic FBI sting, this isn't about setting history straight or even exposing it. It's a scam, or hustle, story and as such it ain't bad. Serviceable story and some decent acting bring it up to a 7 rating."
"lucasnochez","8","1","3","2 January 2014"," Review: American Hustle/Night Film Reviews www.nightfilmreviews.com
","The heist film genre is one of the most exciting film genres in recent memory, thanks to the likes of elaborate minds and stylistically driven directors. From Soderbergh's Ocean trilogy which began the trend of mainstream, modern-day cops-and-robbers films, to other very meticulously crafted caper films, the heist genre is one which is both exciting and compelling to crack before the climactic final act. American Hustle is a modern day, somewhat self-indulgent, patriotic heist film with outstanding performances, many good times and very few bad times. The beauty of Hustle lies in its amazing ability to fake it; whether it be faking an overly complicated narrative for no apparent reason or a meaningful story that never gets old, Hustle is a solid film that will con your heart, through and through. <br/><br/>American Hustle is a testament to a very powerful, respected and hard-working director. David O. Russell is a director who focuses more on his characters than he does on his story, and it is easily noticed in Hustle. Each and every one of the performances in his newest writing/directing credit is every bit as evolved and appreciated as his last. O. Russell has proved, time and time again, that his ability to get the best performances out of his actors is one of his many featured signatures. From Melissa Leo, Amy Adams, Christian Bale, Bradley Cooper, Jacki Weaver, Robert Di Nero, and Jennifer Lawrence, O. Russell brings a furious velocity to his characters in the form of his actors that have ended in Oscar glory, if not recognition, at the very least.<br/><br/>American Hustle is a con film showing the real con-artists as small time players against the biggest con artists of the world; the American government and the American judicial system. Hustle is a loose re-telling of the events following the investigation of the operation named ""Abscam"".<br/><br/>Like any good story being told, it begins, and will always begin with a girl. That girl, in this case, is Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams), or Lady Edith Greensly, either way, it starts with a girl, as do most American narratives. When low-level con artist and small-time businessman Irving Rosenfeld meets stripper Sydney at a party in 1978, the two begin a love-affair that involves low-level stakes at fraud and scamming, unbeknownst to Irving's unstable wife at the time, Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence). As Irving and Sydney meet investors and embezzle their money, they attract the attention of undercover FBI agent Richie Di Maso (Bradley Cooper). Desperate to make a name for himself, Di Maso entraps the two con-artists in a scam that includes the mayor of Camden, New Jersey Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner), various members of Congress, and the mafia.<br/><br/>While Irving's life spins completely out of control between spiralling cons, a love triangle between him, Sydney, and Richie, as well as his manipulating and out of control wife, Irving must master the fine art of deception so that he and Sydney can still come out with their lives.<br/><br/>Much like the marketing of the film, and true to the style of the director, the performances are at the forefront of Hustle. Turning in two of the best performances of his career (the other being the slow burning thriller Out of the Furnace) Bale solidifies his confidence as a serious method actor. Bale's dedication to the craft, whether it be his outrageous weight-gain or loss, heightens his performances.<br/><br/>Other stand-out performances include Amy Adams, whose confused and beguiling depiction of a desperate woman in search of love, happiness, and the American dream, is met wholeheartedly when she delivers lines like ""you're nothing to me until you're everything"". Adams sheds her good-girl image as she did for O. Russell previously in The Fighter, by playing the sexy pillar to her love interests. Much like Julia Roberts did in Erin Brockovich, I'm not sure if Adams deserves the supporting Oscar nomination or if her constantly revealing side-boob does. Either way, Adams seduces her leading men in high fashion, and ironically enough, low fabric.<br/><br/>Lawrence, who won the Oscar for Lead Actress with O. Russell's highly over-rated Silver Linings Playbook last year as another unstable, slutty persona, really gives a sense of her characters unwillingness to change. Lawrence's Rosalyn is a crazy, contorting character who shows that her character is way out of her league in her husband's world of deceit. Rosalyn is really a child in a grown man's world.<br/><br/>Renner hits it out of the park as Polito, an honest man whose sketchy manoeuvres as a person in power, really sheds the action-hero substitute Renner has been playing recently in franchise revival action genre films.<br/><br/>Cooper gives a great physical performance as he did also in Playbook, but unfortunately falls short and sidelined by Bale's unwavering performance. Plus, I'm not sure if the tight-curl perm really helped with the believability of his character or if it may have been a tad too distracting to Cooper's overall performance.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, as Irving states early in the film, ""we con everyone, we even con ourselves"". American Hustle is a much needed con of a film of heavy hitting dramas in a hopeful Oscar season. Blending an exhilarating mix of serious comedy and satire, O. Russell preaches some of his many valiant directing efforts by trusting in his highly-skilled actors and allowing them to use improvisation to develop the shape of the films rustic narrative. O. Russell's characters literally sing their hearts out to ensure the audience understands the subtle points of their deep emotions, and with the help of a highly effective retro-soundtrack to hit some of the confusing plot points.<br/><br/>Read the rest of this review at www.nightfilmreviews.com"
"caseymoviemania","7","1","3","2 January 2014"," Casey's Movie Mania: American HUSTLE (2013)
","The acting ensemble is a joy to watch for, with a few lively sparks here and there in this entertaining but uneven crime drama.<br/><br/>In just a year after writer-director David O. Russell hits jackpot with his winning quirky comedy SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK, he's back with the highly-anticipated American HUSTLE -- a movie which has already receiving tons of accolades from many critics and even hailed as one of the Oscar frontrunners come next year.<br/><br/>WHAT IS IT ALL ABOUT?<br/><br/>Loosely inspired from the FBI ABSCAM operation in the late '70s/early '80s (hence the opening title card that reads ""Some of this actually happened""), American HUSTLE first introduces Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale), a potbellied owner of New Jersey dry-cleaning stores who is also a slick con man. He meets Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams) at a party where they instantly falls for each other and ends up working together to con people's money with their elaborate scheme. They become so famous that one day they get caught red-handed by FBI agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper). Instead of putting Irving and Sydney to jail, Richie uses them to help him capture the New Jersey mayor Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner) as well as other corrupted congressmen and mobsters for bribery.<br/><br/>THE GOOD STUFF<br/><br/>I'm particular loved the way how David O. Russell incorporated various storytelling techniques such as flashbacks and voice-over narrations to introduce his four major characters -- Christian Bale's Irving Rosenfeld, Amy Adams' Sydney Prosser, Bradley Cooper's Richie DiMaso and Jeremy Renner's Carmine Polito -- in a lively Martin Scorsese-like filmmaking style. Technical-wise, American HUSTLE -- from Linus Sandgren's fluid camera-work, excellent song choices (e.g. America's A Horse with No Name and Wings' Live and Let Die), and right down to the meticulous re-creation of the 1970s location settings, hairstyles and flamboyant wardrobes -- is top notch.<br/><br/>But it was the actors that shines here the most. Christian Bale, who previously collaborated with David O. Russell in 2010's THE FIGHTER (which won him his first Oscar for Best Supporting Actor), looks almost unrecognizable behind his sunglasses, large belly and combover. It's refreshing to watch Bale in a laidback and warm performance that doesn't requires him to brood all the time like most of his usual roles in many other movies. Amy Adams is captivating who cleverly alternates her dual personalities -- one is Sydney, and another one is a British character named Lady Edith Greensly -- in such graceful manner. Bradley Cooper is energetic as FBI agent Richie DiMaso, while Jeremy Renner delivers a likable performance as the New Jersey mayor Carmine Polito. Finally, the biggest scene stealer here is Jennifer Lawrence, who excels in her mesmerizing and showy performance as Irving's estranged wife, Rosalyn.<br/><br/>MOST MEMORABLE MOMENT(S)<br/><br/>The hilarious scene where Rosalyn quarrels with Irving over a broken microwave, and the tense moment where Rosalyn and Sydney comes face to face together.<br/><br/>THE BAD STUFF<br/><br/>As a crime drama about deception and duplicity, it's kind of odd that David O. Russell and his screenwriter Eric Warren Singer doesn't deliver much in the subject matter, especially when everything is stripped down in mostly all-too-lightweight manner. The story feels lackluster while the movie takes time to find its proper footing after the wobbly first hour (apart from its lively opening scene).<br/><br/>FINAL WORDS<br/><br/>While American HUSTLE is hardly a great movie that I hoped for (which is definitely not in the same league with David O. Russell's previous two efforts, THE FIGHTER and SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK), it remains a worthwhile entertainment best seen for its colorful cast."
"writers_reign","5","2","10","3 January 2014"," Con With No Pros
","Although once again I find myself in the minority I am not, it would seem (from reading just the first page of reviews posted here) entirely alone. This film was released in England shortly before Christmas and I was not particularly drawn to it so I refrained from watching. But then it began to get money reviews from UK critics so I began to entertain the possibility that it might be worth a look. Today it moved to a Multiplex which is convenient to my home so I decided to check it out.<br/><br/>Bad move. I've never understood the fuss made about Christian Bale as to me he is barely competent as a journeyman actor. Apart from Amy Adams, who I really like, the rest of the cast was more or less unknown to me and after sitting through the film I have no plans to seek out their future work. I can understand Amy Adams wanting to get away from the wholesome image she has acquired, something of a Doris Day for nos jours, but surely she can't have been comfortable going through the whole film with her boobs practically hanging out and being obliged to say the f-word roughly once every reel. The problem is trying to work up a sweat over any character in the film. They don't actually bump into the furniture but neither do they offer polished performances; it's as if the director had been assigned a three week rehearsal period and decided after four days that the cast were ready to start shooting."

","Twists and turns. That pitches American Hustle better than its own plot. David O. Russell's latest is one that can benefit from going in blind, even if the trailers revealed next to nothing on what it's actually about (hallelujah). Featuring damn-near everyone from O. Russell's last two films, American Hustle definitely treads the too-much-for-its-own-good line, yet it still manages to come out on top.<br/><br/>For those who crave pre-viewing details, American Hustle deals with conning. A couple characters make a living out of conning people, who then get caught and forced to con others who are, themselves, cons. You could probably make a drinking game out of describing this movie's plot. <br/><br/>Even if the premise doesn't peak your interest, O. Russell has more than a few ways to fixate you. The movie opens with a small, humorous jab at the oft-used ""this actually happened"" title card in movies. Follow that up with a priceless hair scene and we have the start to a movie that builds and builds, all while immersing you. <br/><br/>Though there are many characters, Christian Bale, Amy Adams and Bradley Cooper are the real tri-force here. Bale gets completely invested in his character (once again) and is often tough to see beyond the hair, glasses, belly fat and other make-up. Adams dominates nearly every scene she's in, bringing a presence that's both vigorous and electrifying. As for Cooper, much like his Silver Linings Playbook performance, there's a constant sense of a man with too many nerves in certain areas, but they rarely snap apart. There's so much praise and discussion to go around for the entire cast, that you could write a review simply on that. Even comedian Louis C.K. gets some classic moments in a role perfect for his dry style of humor.<br/><br/>Just as important (if not more so) is the directing style, which has a Scorsese-like feel in that it's flamboyant, but not overbearing (save The Departed). The entire time there's a constant question of what's real and what's fake. Aside from a couple deliberate points, each scene keeps you wondering what's thin as skin and what's thick as bone for each character. Even those who aren't actual cons might just be putting up a little facade of their own. <br/><br/>Consistent second-guessing, first-rate performances and a lively directing style all lend very necessary contributions. American Hustle is one of those movies that keeps on giving. It hits you like a whirlwind with every scene on your initial viewing. Come back again and it's guaranteed to make you notice and appreciate a little bit more. With a bravado like this, David O. Russell is certainly doing well to solidify his place amongst other greats, such as Scorsese and the Coen Brothers."
"mm-39","8","2","10","21 December 2013"," A well crafted hustle!
","A movie about Hustling, with a mix of politics. Without giving away much of the story I found the movie grabs the viewer and leaves the mark wanting more or experiencing what will happen next. What makes American Hustle work is the characters. Christine Bale has another strong performance. Bale's character is smart and knows the art of the con. Tell them no which creates anticipation. There is what the mark wants to believe compared to what is actually is. Knowing the mark's intentions of what they actually want is the art. What surprised me with the story is the human empathy side of Bale's character. Amy Adams' character is the art of seduction. Amy stirs desire and makes an illusion of being sot after, unattainable, but comforting. Bradly Cooper is a rookie F B I agent who knows everything, has no experience, and does not listen to his supervisor. The minor characters are Jeremy Renner doing the best for New Jersey and and De Niro as a gangster who can see through any con. The movie's characters mixed into the art of the hustle create one entertaining movie. Eight out of ten."
"ferguson-6","8","2","10","21 December 2013"," Dirty Work
","Greetings again from the darkness. Over the years, there have been some very entertaining con artist films, and they range from outright comedy (Dirty Rotten Scoundrels) to cheeky (The Sting) to dramatic (The Grifters). My personal favorite is David Mamet's House of Games, a very quiet and subtle look at the con. The stylistic opposite of Mamet's gem is the latest from director David O Russell. It's like comparing Duke Ellington to Donna Summer - both of which are featured on this soundtrack.<br/><br/>For the past few months, I have said that this film's trailer is one of the best I have ever seen. The energy and visuals were enthralling and have had me anxiously awaiting a chance to see the film. So please understand when I say that the movie does not quite match the expectations, it's not really a criticism ... more of a tip of the cap to the marketing efforts. This is one showy, flamboyant, often frenetic wild ride that is also a bit messy and sometimes even clunky.<br/><br/>Hair, clothes, cars, music ... the best and worst of the 1970's ... are on full display. Christian Bale sets a new standard for worst (and most elaborate and labor-intensive) comb-over in film history. Bradley Cooper's perm wins the contest for tightest curls over Emma Thompson in Saving Mr Banks. Jeremy Renner's pompadour would make any rockabilly performer envious. And let's not forget the women. Amy Adams and Jennifer Lawrence provide a steady stream of flowing and floppy locks that would keep any shampoo or blow dryer company in business. The soundtrack, usually coordinated to story events, also includes Steely Dan, Jeff Lynne, Elton John and many others.<br/><br/>Director Russell's most recent films include The Fighter and Silver Linings Playbook. He is obviously infatuated with odd characters who are slightly off from society. What better topic than con artists so desperate to be liked that they spend all effort trying to rip off the gullible types? Now mix that trait with the ambitious persona of Bradley Cooper's FBI Agent and the US Attorney played by Alessandro Nivola, and you have a collision of worlds that results in a fictionalized account of the ABSCAM events of the late 70's and early 80's. I say fictionalized because the film starts with a banner that states ""Some of this actually happened"". What did or what didn't really doesn't matter here.<br/><br/>Who is playing whom? What is real and what is part of the con? Those are the questions that we as viewers ask, and oddly enough, these are the same questions the key characters ask. If they can't tell, we certainly have no chance.<br/><br/>This one is all about the characters. Mr. Bale (40 lbs heavier) bears no resemblance to Batman. He embodies the falsely confident con man. Cooper is a bit over-hyped in his role, while Adams is at her best in a role that is the film's most diverse. The real explosion comes every time Jennifer Lawrence is on screen. Not only do things blow up in her kitchen, but she jolts the film in each of her scenes. Some may be tired of Ms. Lawrence's recent success, but as a film lover, I put her screen presence very near that of Marilyn Monroe. She grabs our attention and holds it. That's talent that very few possess.<br/><br/>Supporting work that should be noted includes Louis CK as Cooper's reluctant supervisor, Michael Pena as a fake sheik (can they do that?), Jack Huston and Shea Whigaham (both from Boardwalk Empire), and the great and rarely seen Anthony Zerbe (one of the all time TV villains). There is also a high profile cameo that seems right in line with Russell's adoration of Scorcese's Goodfellas.<br/><br/>If you are looking for a film to analyze and dissect, you will be most disappointed in this one. If you are looking for a fun, wildly visual and very entertaining retro film, this one should fit the bill. Just keep your hand on your wallet and don't be one of the suckers."

","David O. Russell does amazing work. His movies always have incredible character development which is crucial to a good movie. The overall story was very well written, besides a couple confusing points but that's not an issue at all. The dialogue for this movie was above average, and really takes you back in time besides the few uh-oh's like the quarter in the payphone (it was 10 cents back in the 70's). As for the cinematography in the film it was superb, great angles and editing work. I give it a 9 because there are always little things that could have been done better. <br/><br/>The acting is what truly made this film an amazing film. Let's start with Christian Bale who plays Irving Rosenfeld, a con man, and boy does he sell it! Bradley Cooper plays an FBI agent that wants nothing more than to prove his worth to the bureau, and to fall in love. Nearly every character wants to change something about themselves except for one, Jennifer Lawrence's Rosalyn Rosenfeld. She knows who she is and doesn't change who she is throughout the film. All around, amazing acting by the cast.<br/><br/>The soundtrack was fitting for the film, especially the song Long Black Road by Electic Light Orchestra. Back to the cinematography, they did a great job recreating a set that resembles the late 1970's. Hopefully David O. Russell gets an award for this amazing film."
"PWNYCNY","8","2","12","27 December 2013"," Bradley Cooper is the greatest movie actor in the world today.
","This movie starts out as an unmitigated clunker. For the first half hour or so the story is a meandering nothing, featuring characters who are utterly devoid of interest. This movie is so flat that it gives cause to leave it alone, and chalk it as another waste of time and money. Then, all of a sudden, the movie takes on new life. It immediately becomes interesting, exciting, and above all, fun to watch, and the reason for that: Bradley Cooper. He saves the movie; in fact, he IS the movie. He so thoroughly dominates this movie, meaning, every scene, that the producers could have sent the rest of the cast home. Christian Bale is not funny; Amy Adams is not funny; Jennifer Lawrence is outright shrill; Robert De Niro isn't even credited; but Bradley Cooper IS funny, and engaging, and, most importantly, entertaining. He carries this movie. The story itself is ridiculous, another Hollywood parody on law enforcement, and suggests that federal agents can be co-opted and turned by con artists whose cons are so transparent that a child could see through them. Bradley Cooper rates a 10; the rest of the movie rates a 5. 10+5=15/2=7.5, round off to the next highest number, 8, hence the rating of 8."

","This dreck is assembled 13-year-old thinks-he's-smart-schoolboy style from an assortment of paint-by-numbers film elements the ambitious but woefully-unoriginal director David Russell has chosen from the collected works of his idols- and betters- especially Martin Scorsese, but also ""Chinatown""-era Robert Towne and a number of other '70s once-idolized anti-Hollywood-establishment honchos- Dennis Hopper, Bob Rafelson, Robert Altman, you name it. Have no doubt: Russell wants his name equal in the cinephile-intellectual's mind with these legends. ""With-it"" period music that may or may not be in synch with the actual narrative? It's here, and stolen straight from Scorsese's 1973 breakthrough feature-length, ""Mean Streets."" Wise guys with aching hearts and ""sympathetic"" (but only in the most obvious, simplistic Hollywood-esque ways) character flaws? Ditto. Acting as if in a '70s method class presided over by an increasingly exasperated Harvey Keitel? Here to the gills, provided to us by the likes of Christian Bale, Jennifer Lawrence, and Bradley Cooper, among others.<br/><br/>The story purports to be based on the Abscam sting operation by the Feds in the late 1970s and early 1980s, but is really more an excuse for Russell to show off to us his auteurist ""chops"" and for the increasingly annoying cast to preen and mewl before us.<br/><br/>The actual Abscam brought down several prominent U.S. members of Congress, including the once-beloved Harrison Williams, Democratic senator of New Jersey, and had one actual hero, former U.S. Senator Larry Pressler, Republican of South Dakota, the first American combat veteran of the Vietnam War to be elected to Congress, and who was captured on tape angrily walking out of a meeting when he thought it was a ""legitimate"" bribery scheme to influence U.S. legislators' votes on issues of Middle East policy. Not that you'd know any of this from this showy, extremely annoying, derivative, glitzy, full-of-itself waste of time. Pressler, now 77 and long retired, was that rarity- an independent-minded moderate Republican who refused to cave to any political fashion or trend, and least of all the fascist demagoguery that currently sits at the head of his party and has infected it at all levels. In fact, the contrast between the Republicanism of a Larry Pressler and that of Donald Trump and his toadies and enablers would make for a very interesting and absorbing movie in and of itself. Not that David Russell and his equally obtuse collaborators would ever imagine or wish to do anything of that nature- THAT would be too TRULY creative and original for us. So instead they give this flashy-gaudy third-generation-Las-Vegas-casino of a movie. No thanks."

Russell after having directed Silver Linings Playbook. This one regards trust in the world of con artists. Set in 1978 with Christian Bale as Irving Rosenfeld a businessman who meets Sydney Prosser, a stripper played by Amy Adams. Together they create a duo conning cash out of seemingly willing victims until they are seized by F.B.I agent Richard DiMaso, played b y Bradley Cooper. He offers them release on the terms that they help him convict four other con artist. Trust becomes an issue as viewers are not sure who is legit. Bale dons a bad wig and bulging belly in one of his best performances. He has one of his friends poise as a sheik in an attempt to access the mayor of Camden, New Jersey who in himself is seen as a respectable citizen. Amy Adams as Sydney struggles in juggling two men within manipulation and truth. Cooper as DiMaso uses questionable tactics to merge ahead and get others in the F.B.I to go along but the question arises as to whether he can maintain a level trust with Irving and Sydney. Jennifer Lawrence steals scenes as Irving's depressed wife whose son he adopted. She is destructive until she factors into the scheme in both practical and lethal ways. Jeremy Renner plays the unfortunate target for this scheme whose trust will be shot. Theme regards trust within the corrupt lifestyle of those who hustle it away from those who give it before they themselves are left barren. Score: 10 / 10"
"sickofenjoyingmyself","7","1","4","8 January 2016"," Great acting and enjoyable storyline
","American Hustle has some excellent acting performances. Christian Bale was great, Jeremy Renner was very effective in a role that I wouldn't have normally placed him in. Jennifer Lawrence was playfully impressive. The story is quite slow, which is extremely effective considering the unpredictable character development. I liked this, and was engaged as the characters began to unfold and reveal more and less of what you had initially expected. I did really enjoy it but for some reason I just feel like it was missing something. It kind of felt like something that had been re- modeled too closely on similar predecessors. Although I felt that, I still wouldn't take credit away from the acting performances. They made this enjoyable. I think that if Robert De Niro's character had been given more screen time and story line it would have added more quality. Bradley cooper was energetic although a little misdirected. All in all it is engaging and enjoyable. Lacking in action and adrenaline - not a problem for me - will probably be interpreted as boring by some."
"dave-mcclain","9","1","4","21 December 2015"," ""American Hustle"" has a lot of fun with a true story and makes us want to sing along.
","According to Wikipedia, "".ABSCAM was a United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) sting operation run from the FBI's Hauppauge, Long Island office in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The operation initially targeted trafficking in stolen property but was converted to a public corruption investigation."" That investigation and its results form the basis for 2013's ""American Hustle"" (R, 2:18). But the film is only loosely based on the real-life story. The first thing on screen are the words: ""Some of this actually happened."" ""American Hustle"" stars Christian Bale as con man Irving Rosenfeld and Amy Adams as his girlfriend and partner-in-crime Sydney Prosser. Irving is running a small-time loan scam on New Jersey locals and doing pretty well, but business really takes off when Sydney gets involved, puts on a high-class British accent, starts calling herself Edith and portrays herself as well-connected with the banks in London. Personally and professionally, things go swimmingly for the pair, until they run into Bradley Cooper's FBI agent, Richie DiMaso, who entraps Irving and Sydney/Edith, and then forces them to work for him. As in real life, the undercover activities shift from targeting criminals to targeting politicians (trying to get them to take bribes).<br/><br/>That's about all of the similarities between ""American Hustle"" and ABSCAM. Director David O. Russell (who also directed Oscar-winners ""Silver Linings Playbook"" and ""The Fighter"" and brings together the best actors from each of those movies to this one) focuses his film on the fictional characters that he created along with co-writer Eric Singer. This allows the movie to have some fun with both the characters and the story. As Sydney/Edith says in a bit of narration referring to something she did early in the film, ""There was a boldness about it. I didn't know where that boldness would take me, but I was gonna find out."" That quote also sums up my feelings as I watched this movie.<br/><br/>Russell populates his story with a variety of colorful characters. Irving has a pot belly and an epic comb-over, but as Sydney says in a bit of narration, ""There was a confidence that drew me to him."" Irving's attitude is summed up with his quote: ""We're all conning ourselves, in one way or another, just to get through life."" Edith (who distracts her marks – and the audience members – with her revealing outfits) shows quite the aptitude for the con games they're playing, and she's a lot more comfortable than Irving with the higher-stakes stings that they're helping the FBI run. Meanwhile, Camden, New Jersey mayor Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner) seems well-meaning and gets things done, but isn't completely ethical in achieving those results.<br/><br/>Given the time period and the tone and style of this film, pretty early on it reminded me of a combination of two great 90s movies which also told stories set in the late 70s and early 80s - ""Boogie Nights"" and ""Goodfellas"". Then, when a song from the former showed up in this soundtrack and a major cast member from the latter showed up on the screen, the parallels felt even stronger. And, as ""American Hustle"" progressed, I also saw elements of ""The Grifters"" and ""The Firm"", two more excellent 90s films.<br/><br/>As with those movies, in ""American Hustle"", it's both fun and interesting to guess who's playing whom and how all the characters are going to fare when the story has run its course. It's also interesting to see whether the use of a phony Arab sheik (Michael Pena, playing a Mexican-American FBI agent playing a sheik) helps or hurts the cause, and how Irving's crazy wife (Jennifer Lawrence) plays into the equation. (Yes, he's married, even though he's @#$%ing Sydney). Throughout the film, and especially when they finally meet each other, Adams' and Lawrence's characters seem to be competing for the title of ""Craziest Bitch in This Here Movie"".<br/><br/>""American Hustle"" features a smart and funny script, along with several award-worthy performances from basically every actor mentioned in this review. The soundtrack and use of music in this film are also pretty great! I loved the old, familiar songs, but I also heard a non-English version of ""White Rabbit"", and thoroughly enjoyed the short scene in which Jennifer Lawrence cleans her house while rocking out to the James Bond anthem ""Live and Let Die""! If you appreciate great acting and like an entertaining story, you really should, regardless of whether you're an American, hustle on over to your computer and find this movie. ""A"""

","I would have to buy into the criticism that the people who frequent this world are so hard to praise (although the female leads are quite striking, especially Amy Adams) that it is hard to gain an affinity for them. We see a sort of Bonnie and Clyde scenario (although the violence is not there) as a couple of odd bedfellows find each other and attempt to make big bucks until an FBI agent gets involved. Their future depends on their willingness to expose corrupt politicians and mafia types. There are several twists of plot that make things interesting, but it is often hard to clearly see what the endgame is. Now you don't have wrap everything up with a ribbon, but I'm still not entirely sure what happened and to whom. There is chemistry between Christian Bale and Amy Adams who has this sultry sort of Veronica Lake thing going. I enjoyed those scenes the most. And then there is Jennifer Lawrence, the wife from hell, who chews up every line. People who say the acting is poor must be on another planet. Anyway, this was worth seeing. Perhaps some editing could have helped a bit."
"hsm2310","9","1","4","6 October 2014"," Originality, Style and Wit written all over it
","David Russell is on a roll. He is reinventing himself with every movie. Thanks to his splendid filmography till date, we know that he has his own and enviable style of humor. In Silver Linings Playbook he created a new genre called serious dromcom. In American Hustle he steps up and infuses humor in a rainbow of other emotions with typical Russelesque style, a style which is shockingly original and entertaining. <br/><br/>A lot of credit should go to the fact that he has used his tried and tested cast in ever versatile Bale, coming of age -Cooper and one of the most promising female actors of these times in Jennifer Lawrence ( Oh! She is so lovable). She is so bloody convincing at everything she does that its almost impossible to not travel with her whenever she is on screen. Jeremy Renner as usual gets into the skin of the character without fuss and Amy Adams can take your breath away while she is trying to play seductive games with Bale and Cooper. <br/><br/>​The USP of American Hustle does not lie in its story (it is like so many other con movies that we have seen in past), it lies in the depth and range of human emotions and behaviors that have been covered and presented with amazing ease, butter smooth camera work, epic one liners and utmost attention of detail. Respect Mr. Russel."
"b5erik","7","1","4","10 August 2014"," Scorsese Light
","It's so obvious that director David O. Russell was trying to make his own Scorsese movie that I am stunned that more people haven't pointed it out. The use of music, the editing style, the use of narration, the way he directed his actors (and the way Christian Bale aped Robert DeNiro in his performance) - it's all VERY Scorsese. Or, more accurately, like Scorsese on auto pilot (or Scorsese light). Bringing in DeNiro for a cameo was almost like an admission of guilt on Russell's part. As if he were saying, ""Yes, I'm trying to make a Martin Scorsese type movie."" Don't misunderstand, American Hustle IS a good movie. Very good at times, but it is completely unoriginal in it's style and it is about fifteen or twenty minutes too long.<br/><br/>But throughout the movie I kept noticing the Scorsese-isms and the DeNiro aping from Bale. It became distracting.<br/><br/>Ultimately, American Hustle is a well made movie. It's just a well made homage to Martin Scorsese and Robert DeNiro more than anything else."

","Yes, for God's sake, I'm aware of the similarities to GoodFellas.<br/><br/>It's a strange human trait, but if an individual in a group professes love for American Hustle, there's always that one dude – The guy who believes he's most 'in the know.'<br/><br/>Regardless of any real opinions, he'll say, ""Yeah, I thought it was pretty good. But it draws too much from Scorsese's early work; namely GoodFellas.""<br/><br/>If you hear this in a professional business environment, at home, in the church confessional booth or what have you; I urge you seek out this monster, and silence their blowharding with a crescent kick.<br/><br/>Because David O. Russell's most recent effort is a spectacular film.<br/><br/>I don't think I can oversell this character study, with its ten Oscar nominations and three wins at the Golden Globes.<br/><br/>One is for 'Best Comedy or Musical.' Here's a diabolical scheme waiting to hatch: Remake The Producers (again) and secure a nomination for this award. No matter what the competition, it'd have to win by default, no?<br/><br/>Amy Adams took home a Globe for Best Actress and Jennifer Lawrence nabbed the gilded sphere for Supporting Lady.<br/><br/>As it pertains to performance in film, those were three of the most deserved awards distributed for the previous year.<br/><br/>I walked into the theater with my nose held high in the air. The movie looked overwrought with cliché, but I had seen the trailer several dozen times.<br/><br/>Plus, I was only familiar with one David O. Russell film by then; Silver Linings Playbook. For further reading on my historic disappointment in SLP check out my review.<br/><br/>(I caught The Fighter a month later; solidifying my certainty in Davey Russ's directing ability.)<br/><br/>If you haven't seen American Hustle, it's #2 on my 'Best Films of 2013' list, so go into it with reasonable expectations and you should be swept away.<br/><br/>What else can be said? It's a great movie that's sure to delight.<br/><br/>So if you haven't seen it and you're sensitive to potential spoilers, stop reading now.<br/><br/>There is plenty of material up for discussion surrounding this film. For now, I'll focus on several plot aspects I found noteworthy, and then talk a little smack about Jared Leto, before wrapping things up.<br/><br/>Jeremy Renner, who deftly performs a tense unfolding of his character's arc, plays what is potentially the most compelling role, Mayor Carmine Polito.<br/><br/>The opening title card before Fargo, the Coen brothers' film, is a comedic take on a common trend in modern movies. The appearance of the words, ""Based on a true story,"" is a complete red herring. Fargo's entirely fictional!<br/><br/>David O. throws his hat in the ring with another satirical take on the opening title card. At the beginning of Hustle the words read: ""Some of this actually happened.""<br/><br/>The message triggers a hearty laugh, and it's a great reveal (especially being unacquainted with the story's connection to reality.)<br/><br/>As I mention in my review of Elysium, the 'parable' is a prolific plot device often utilized in a clumsy fashion. Therefore, it often comes off as cliché or contrived. Neill Blomkamp avoids this by having the protagonist interrupt another character's allegorical narrative with a summary of the conclusion. (To astounding effect, I might add.)<br/><br/>O. Russell's version of the parable is a fishing story that Louis C. K.'s character (Stoddard Thorsen) tries to tell Bradley Cooper (as FBI agent Richie DiMaso) throughout the film. It's uproariously comedic, eloquent and dynamic.<br/><br/>While it serves to reveal subtle character traits, it's also a brilliant and original take on an ancient plot device.<br/><br/>Turns out I like my Cooper like I like my women: Unhinged and antagonistic.<br/><br/>That's a dumb joke but the sentiment towards BC retains credence. On top of his roles in Wedding Crashers and The Hangover, Brad's shown impressive villain chops, and we should all appreciate him a little more next holiday season.<br/><br/>Cooper, and by the same token Michael Fassbender (for 12 Years a Slave), were snubbed for the Best Supporting Actor Award.<br/><br/>But not to worry, because Matthew McConaughey, a handsome straight Caucasian depicting a character of similar description, will be winning an award, so they've reached their limit on that demographic.<br/><br/>I'm reminded of an award season several years ago, when Milk was getting a lot of press. Okay, yes, Sean Penn depicts a convincing portrait of a gay man. But the movie's boring! (And, side note, Harvey Milk wasn't the greatest guy in real life.)<br/><br/>Jared Leto (whom I don't mean to criticize, unless we're talking about acceptance speeches) did a fine job of depicting a transsexual. But I found his character enormously off-putting, and as much I appreciate the effort that went into the performance, Leto just doesn't do it for me.<br/><br/>But that's DBC, not the hustling Americans.<br/><br/>Ready for a strong opinion?<br/><br/>All of the cast's main players are wildly prolific in modern cinema, and judging by their performances in previous films, are among the most talented actors working today.<br/><br/>Every single performance I've seen by Christian Bale, J-Law, Coop-A-Loop, Amy Adams, J. Renner and Louis C.K., has been spot-on, nuanced and (for all intents and purposes) near perfect.<br/><br/>If that doesn't tell you anything about this film, nothing will.<br/><br/>Go out and catch American Hustle before it loses its crispy freshness!"

","I really enjoyed the premise of this movie; two con artists are forced to work with the FBI to take down a corrupt Mayor. It takes place in the late 70's. This movie seemed to capture the 1970's pretty well. It had a great look and the women (Amy Adams and Jennifer Lawrence) were beautiful. In my opinion, this movie should've won Best Picture.<br/><br/>Christian Bale stars as a balding con-artist named Irving Rosenfeld who meets and falls in love with Sydney Prosser, posing as English aristocrat ""Lady Edith Greensly"" Sydney helps Irving with his scams. When they are caught and captured by FBI agent Richie DiMaso, they are given a choice; either go to jail or help him with 4 additional arrests. They soon get mixed up with the Mafia and many schemes where Irving is forced to involve his wife. I would definitely consider watching this movie again someday.

","One of 2013's best films comes from modern film legend David O.Russell. Irving Rosenfeld (played versatility by Christian Bale) and Sydney Prosser (an amazing Amy Adams) are two con artist who get caught by FBI agent Richie DiMaso (a perfect Bradley Cooper). In punishment, Richie forces Sydney and Irving to help him take down corrupt congressmen and mayor Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner) in order for him to become respected and famous in the law world. Irving is well-rounded when it comes to the crime world due to his experiences as a con-man, which is why Richie requests he help him. Irving's loose-canyon wife Rosalyn (A hilarious and exhilarating Jennifer Lawrence) is caught between the situation, and struggles at parenting and keeping a strong marriage with Irving. Throughout the film we see interesting systems in taking down the congressmen and how Richie, Irving, and Sydney's relationships evolve. David O. Russells's screenplay is so creative and well- constructed and delivers monumental storytelling from his rich character development, complex plot, and interesting twists and turns. Every actor in this film is spectacular. Christian Bale delivers a very unique performance and proves he can act as any character. Amy Adams is just overall brilliant as a woman faced with difficult situations and adapting to her surroundings. Bradley Cooper is by far the most interesting character, as he evolves into a greedy agent who portrays a hypocritical, self-centered law enforcer. Jennifer Lawrence adds comedy and vital conflict to the story as Irving's wife who is cheated on and raises a son with Irving. The directing by David O.Russell is brilliant as he takes you into the 70's like no other filmmaker. Every shot and element of film was revised and put together masterfully and proves he is one of the best filmmakers of our time. The other elements such as editing, production and costume design, cinematography, and music make the film complete by adding cinematic value in a classic way. 'American Hustle' provides a complex plot with great cinematic elements that should provide intelligent viewers with a sense of artistic joy."

","American Hustle is a comedy-drama of a crime genre that is loosely based on the FBI ABSCAM operation of the 1970's and 1980's.It features two interesting actor/actress pair - Amy Adams and Christian Bale - together with another pair - Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper - that worked together in previously in Academy Award nominated films The Fighter and Silver Lining Playback respectively.The story is about two con artists that were forced to work with an FBI agent to capture a sting operation. David O. Russell directs.<br/><br/>During the 70's and the 80's,a ring of crooked deals were captured on video by the FBI at the backdrop of New Jersey.That led to almost a dozen arrests of U.S. senators, members of the U.S. House of Representatives and other politicians.Ambitious FBI agent Richie DiMaso forces the aid of the a con artists pair:Irving Rosenfeld, a small-time criminal who deals in stolen and faked art as well as fake loan scams; and his seductive British partner Sydney Prosser,who is also known as Lady Edith Greensly. The pair are forced to assist the FBI in nabbing other con artists and crooks in the area after being caught in one of his cons by DiMaso. When a chain of evidence mounts that leads towards corruption in the office of Mayor Carmine Polito, DiMaso concocts a scam that will ultimately bring down many politicians that includes Polito himself.Disgusted by their forced employment with DiMaso after he discovers mob ties that may ultimately lead to his own death,Irving and his partner make a ploy to begin a scheme of their own to get out from it.What makes matters worse is the fact that Irving's wife,Rosalyn tries desperately to retain Irving's affection and attention by constantly interfering with him.<br/><br/>This is definitely one of the best films during its year of release.The performances of Bale,Adams,Cooper and most especially Lawrence are definitely great and memorable.They played their characters interestingly and passionately as they were able to switch from comedy to drama with ease.Also,they obviously researched their characters very well.No wonder that all of them were nominated for an Oscar.Added to that,the movie has lots of fun and energy as it was engaging from beginning to end.Added to that,the killer 70's soundtrack definitely made it enjoyable as well.Despite lacking intelligence and the unevenness of the story,the viewer will definitely get their money's worth with the heartwarming performances of the lead stars alone."

"thisglimpse-1","9","1","4","14 March 2014"," From the Feet Up
","""American Hustle"" begins with one of the best opening scenes in recent memory. Before we see anything else, we see Christian Bale -- the guy who played millionaire playboy Bruce Wayne not that long ago -- meticulously arranging, pasting, and spraying into place a terribly elaborate and truly hideous comb over. It's funny, and it tells us volumes about this character. He's a con man, a master at the art of deception, and a very careful one. Every detail has to be exactly right, ""from the feet up"" -- all the way up to the fake hair. <br/><br/>But he's gotten himself into a situation where nothing's right, everything is slapdash, and he's out of control. It's only a matter of time before he ends up in prison, or worse. That's all thanks to Bradley Cooper, an FBI agent who caught on to one of his small time schemes, and is using it as leverage against him and his partner, Amy Adams into larger and ever more dangerous schemes, until they're looking at taking down powerful politicians, and ending up on the wrong side of the mob. Bale isn't happy about any of this; he's a small fish happy in his big pond; he'd rather be scamming gambling addicts than having a sitdown with Robert De Niro. <br/><br/>Some of this actually happened. The film is based on the ""Abscam"" scandal from the late '70s, loosely. The historical situation is pretty crazy in and of itself, and indicative of the dysfunction in American government and culture in the '70s. (""Argo"" this ain't.) In a nutshell, the FBI grew tired of being reprimanded by Congress, so the feds launched an operation against Congress itself. It involved a fake ""Arab"" seeking to invest millions into New Jersey's slumping economy, and willing to grease whatever palms necessary to get the casino licenses, citizenship and anything else needed to get the job done. Abscam brought down several Representatives and one Senator on bribery charges, but it also resulted in something called the ""Civiletti Undercover Guidelines,"" which basically was the Attorney General telling the FBI to never do anything like it ever again. <br/><br/>It's a situation a little too messy for a straightforward film adaptation, but David O. Russell likes to make messy movies. Russell's signature talent is his ability to both create and control chaos on screen. He loves to set crazy characters on colliding paths, and knows there are infinite ways to play crazy. It's hard to imagine any other director managing the scenes Russell manages, scenes in which three or four or five crazy people bounce off of each other at odd angles in fantastically entertaining ways. He's also skilled at swinging from zany to serious (and back) at the drop of a hat. It's kind of like watching Real Housewives: these people are nuts, but we care about them anyway. Actually, it's infinitely more entertaining than Real Housewives. <br/><br/>Russell has developed a consistent stable of actors he likes to work with -- or who like to work with him. Rumor has it he's an extremely demanding director, known for feeding improvised lines to actors from alongside the camera during shooting. Also, there's a video on YouTube of him ranting and raving at Lily Tomlin during the shooting of ""I Heart Huckabees,"" though Tomlin afterward said that everything was fine between them and she'd be happy to work with him again. Some can't take the heat, and some thrive in it. <br/><br/>Amy Adams is better in Russell's movies than in anything else she's done, and so is Bradley Cooper. Cooper has earned Oscar nominations for his two performances in Russell's films, despite playing basically the same character in both of them (manic and naive, goal-driven, desperate, prone to violent outbursts but somehow forgivable and even innocent.) I'm not convinced yet that Cooper is a great actor--I'd like to see more range in his performances -- but he has without a doubt created a very watchable character performance that can span multiple films. In that way he's kind of like Al Pacino or Woody Allen. <br/><br/>Christian Bale, on the other hand, is a man of a thousand faces (and mannerisms, accents, etc.) If the Oscar always goes to the actor who uglies up best, Christian Bale got robbed. He gained 50 lbs and looks terrible. I guess that's not as impressive at Matthew McConaughey losing 50 lbs., but McConaughey is still rodeo-sexy through most of Dallas Buyers Club. Bale just looks bad here, and that's good. It's amazing to me that the same guy can play Batman, Patrick Bateman and a crackhead boxing has- been who once knocked down Sugar Ray Leonard (or maybe he just tripped.) <br/><br/>But Jennifer Lawrence, who can seemingly do anything, might be the best part of the movie. She plays Bale's wife, whom he can't seem to get away from (he calls her ""the Picasso of passive-aggressive karate."") She routinely steals scenes by playing absolutely, but uniquely and distinctly, batshit crazy. She's the opposite of her nail finish--she's mostly rotten and a little bit sweet, and you can't get enough of her. You just keep coming back. <br/><br/>""American Hustle"" is a zany, screwball ride, but it's also a movie about survival and reinvention. It's about people who are conning themselves, who are desperate to get out of their situations and maybe their skins. Ironically, the only characters who have a firm grasp on their real identities are the cons . In the world these characters live in, ambition is the greatest sin -- ambition and lying to your friends."
"january8","6","1","4","10 March 2014"," I wish it had just been a caper movie.....
","I liked parts of American Hustle quite a lot. The title works on several levels. The performances were outstanding. It looked great. I just think it tried to do too much. It's basically a story about Irving Rosenfeld and Sydney Prosser, a couple of pretty good con artists who ran some pretty good cons, how they got caught by the FBI, and what they did about it. That's a foundation for a neat little caper movie. <br/><br/>BUT, Mr. Russell had Bradley Cooper attached, so he spent a lot of time on Mr. Cooper's FBI character, Richie DiMaso, Richie's fractious relationship with his supervisor and his growing obsession with Sydney, without really providing any motivation for him other than a hint of a drug habit and a suspicion that his ambition might be out of control.<br/><br/>Irving's wife, Rosalyn, plays a small but pivotal role, but Mr. Russell had Jennifer Lawrence attached, so her role became expanded to the point of becoming a distraction. About one tenth of Rosalyn's histrionics would have been just as effective.<br/><br/>When the story finally comes full circle, back to Irving and Sydney, the denouement seems to come out of left field. I'd have liked this movie a lot better if it had stayed with Irving and Sydney throughout. Then the payoff would have been a logical progression of events and a great deal more satisfying than it was."
"TheWormAndOnly","7","1","4","24 February 2014"," Hustling with style, and an unfortunate lack of focus
","Could there be anything better to start off with than the absolute critic favorite film of the year? I find it funny how moviegoers constantly refer to this film as overrated, when it actually makes American Hustle seem underrated in the end, getting hatred from non- critics the moment the Oscar nominations were announced.<br/><br/>I expected this movie to include everything movie critics are stereotyped as loving, and I wasn't disappointed. Heck, even I paid attention to those things, which made me really like American Hustle.<br/><br/>Two successful con artists gets put to the test when they go from hustling desperate people, to being forced by the government into conning powerful politicians of New Jersey and mafia overlords. The entire situation is risky, and could end up chaotic when not even the con artists can trust each other anymore and the desperate FBI agent pursuing them starts getting personal with one of the con artists.<br/><br/>Christian Bale absolutely kills it as con artist Irving Rosenfeld, while Amy Adams also does a fine job playing Irving's assistant full of dilemma, Sydney Prosser, though her British accent seems to wear off at certain points. Overall, the acting ensemble is one of the greatest I have seen in quite a while. Cooper's way of speaking and mumbling in different tones also makes his role as wild FBI Agent Richie DiMaso greatest performance so far, if you ask me, and he also gave me the most laughs. Jennifer Lawrence, while overreacting at certain parts, is damn good as the unpredictable wife of Irving, Rosalyn Rosenfeld. I still don't know if she was a genius all along, or just a dumb blonde.<br/><br/>And that is the biggest strength of the movie's rather long plot, the hustling. The whole point of the movie is how hustling to survive is a possibility and director David O. Russell successfully expresses that. This is also what is worth talking about after the credits roll; was it all planned from the start or was there actually any dilemmas?<br/><br/>Unfortunately the movie falls when the plot feels way too long. I thought we were nearing the climax when the con artists were going after the mafia overlord, and then I unfortunately figured out that only one hour and a quarter had passed. It definitely starts to drag on and 20-30 minutes could easily have been left out, like I feel we get way too much information from Irving, Sydney and Richie's lives when it would have been better if it had been more mysterious, like Irvings wife.<br/><br/>This is overall my biggest gripe with Russell's otherwise great directing. He definitely knows how to create stunning settings with great and memorable characters, whose performers act fantastic. He also manages to use the movies' great soundtrack whenever it needs to be used, and the last used piece of music fits perfectly with the ending. But most scenes simply don't flow together as well as they should, and they end up becoming many great scenes instead of a fantastic motion picture. For these reasons, a re-watch can be tiring.<br/><br/>So I love the setting, the soundtrack, the dialog, the acting and the ''Hustle'' of the film, and if only the movie was cut shorter and had flown better together, American Hustle would quite possibly had become one of my favorite films of the decade - 8.3/10"

","With such a famous cast and with a screenplay that was #8 on the Blacklist, O'Russell certainly had his work cut out for him!<br/><br/>Flared jeans, slinky dresses, elaborate fur coats and wacky glasses launches you back to the 70's, with a backdrop of old school New Jersey and Brooklyn setting the scene. The accents are also on point - Lawrence's American twang and Amy Adams' British tease are brilliant. <br/><br/>With a cast including Batman, Katniss Everdeen and Hawkeye, the bar was certainly set high, but every single actor pulled their weight and transformed themselves into their characters. Literally for Christian Bale's overweight, crazy combovered Irving who packed on the pounds to get into character. All of the actors are as good as the rest, working with each other not to steal the scene or be better than the other. Bale and Adams are brilliantly compatible and Amy's sexiness is finally shown. Cooper is fantastic at getting right into the nitty, gritty part of his character and Lawrence is made for films. She moulds herself to any role, embracing and completely nailing everything she is attached to.<br/><br/>American Hustle is captivating, intelligent and oh so stylish to watch.

The Richard character was totally believable with his ego driven eccentric drive to be someone, then we see his mother and his real life, so well done.

","American Hustle: the title talks on his own. This crime-comedy drama film shows us an incredibly transformed Christian Bale as the main character, followed Amy Adams (Man of Steel) as his ""not-so-secret"" lover, Jeremy Renner (The Avengers, The Bourne Legacy) as the Mayor of Camden, by the so much appreciated Bradley Cooper (The Hangover I,II and III) as an FBI agent, and the ""newborn"" beautiful star Jennifer Lawrence (The Hunger Games movies) as Christian's wife. Located in the United States of the 70's, this movie tells the story of Irving Rosenfeld, a con artist that meets a young and beautiful woman, Sydney Prosser, and falls in love with her. But wait: if you're now expecting the common and boring love story, hold on. You'll be surprised. Together, they start a new fraudulent business, flying in lower skies to maintain a certain safety. Nonetheless, one day they are caught by an undercover FBI agent, Richard DiMaso. This is where the real story starts, with a continuum of lies, frauds and deceptions between all the characters showing up in the plot, to end up... you will find it out. It was actually weird seeing Christian Bale as he was in this movie. After all, in our hearts he will always be our beloved Bruce Wayne, while in our heads the psycho-killer Patrick Bateman (pretty close to Batman as well, isn't funny?). But still, his performance was quite pleasant to the sight after a short while of adaptation. A fat, bald and emotional crook? He can be also that one person. But also the other characters are well-developed. Obviously, not being a psychological movie, there isn't so much room for a deep insight into everyone's personality, but it's still easy enough to grasp a general idea from their speeches, their acts, and of course the main narration. The plot was generally balanced and well-structured. The main sensation I had was that Russel didn't want to exaggerate with epic facts and events, as often nowadays happens with cinema. Appreciated choice. After all, this movie derives from a true story. Another good thing about it was that there is no redundancy of details, thus giving the viewer the chance to imagine again. So yes, in the end American Hustle counts as a ""Must-See"". Maybe not as those legendary pulps all of us know, but still its worth enough. With its sometimes grotesque humor, its thrilling plot, and well-placed casting, American Hustle gained its place into cinema's history."

","A film that polarises opinions, I see. I watched it cold, as it were, not having read any reviews before walking into the theatre, so I was able to see it without expectations or preconceptions.<br/><br/>It is about manipulation, about players playing, about situations spinning away from characters with their own agendas. FBI agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper) browbeats small-time con artists and lovers Irving Rosenfield (Christian Bale) and Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams) into helping him set up a sting designed to entrap corrupt politicians. Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner) is the streetwise but sincere political wheeler-dealer at the centre of the operation and Irving's wife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence) is a wonderful wild card, an engaging loose cannon functioning as a kind of neurotic deus ex machina.<br/><br/>The direction (David O. Russell) chops up real-time and flashback action, post-modernist style. Much of the dialogue was apparently improvised, and it shows - in a good way. Jennifer Lawrence in particular comes out with several choice, laugh-out-loud lines, but you don't know which (if any) are hers and which come from the laptops of writers Russell and Eric Warren Singer. The interminable, episodic ice- fishing shaggy dog story of DiMaso's exasperated boss, Louis CK (Stoddard Thorsen) is almost certainly scripted and worthy of Lawrence Sterne.<br/><br/>The late-1970s setting is meticulously observed, from Bale's ludicrous oldest-swinger-in-town comb-over to the whalefin lapels to the many medallions nestling on hairy chests (Did we really dress like that in the 1970s? Er, yes). The starring chest of the film, while we're on the subject, is the one constantly over-exposed, from every angle, by Adams's navel-deep cleavage. (Insert your own golden globes joke here.) It actually got a bit distracting over the 138 minutes. But I survived somehow. <br/><br/>American Hustle is an ensemble piece with no clear-cut heroes or villains, no white-hat-black-hat dynamic, no good-girl-bad-girl dichotomy. The characters think they are being proactive but in fact they are reactive; they wobble on shaky ground, their tumultuous allegiances, expediencies and relationships swirling in confusion, emotions running high, sexual tensions at snapping point. Who's playing whom? Is anyone really pulling the strings? What's the real scam? There is no telling. Complication mounts on complication as Russell scatters expositional red herrings all over the screen, the big tease. <br/><br/>And therein lies the film's chaotic genius. Pay attention to it. American Hustle is a work that repays concentration. Hell, you've paid for your ticket, get your money's worth and engage. This is no glib, easy, sit-back-and-munch-your-popcorn caper movie; it is demanding and difficult. The actors' performances are utterly convincing, without exception, and the characterisation sufficiently excessive to be human - which is to say, the characters are realistically fallible, occasionally over the top, and often none too pretty. They mess up. They get things wrong when the situation runs away from them, and it is always running away from them. They're just like the rest of us.<br/><br/>I came away firmly on the pro- side of the polarity. I'll be buying the DVD so I can backtrack over the detail I missed. Recommended."

","American hustle is just purely entertaining. Something that a lot of movies struggle with now. It's well written, very well acted, laugh out loud hilarious and you'll just have a good time whilst watching it. American Hustle's tone is very similar to Martin Scorsese movies. It's very real and sometimes is over the top but it finds the right balance between the two. The performances are fantastic all around. Christian Bale is great as the good hearted but troubled con man. Amy Adams ( who in my opinion delivers the best performance of the movie) is great as Bale's associate. Bradley Cooper is good as the naive Fbi agent. Jeremy Renner and Jennifer Lawrence are also very good and I would've liked to have seen them get more screen time. Even Louis C:k is great as Bradley Cooper's cynical FBI supervisor. Overall American Hustle is a great movie with lots of quotable lines and memorable scenes.

"ociopia","10","1","4","17 January 2014"," An American Tragedy
","American Hustle is a great movie. It's no surprise that it's nominated for Academy Awards in Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor and Actress, and Best Supporting Actor and Actress. It's that good. I've fallen in love with the director, David O. Russell. Christian Bale ""is"" his character and though he's repulsive, forty-five minutes in you've come to care about him. By the end, you feel deeply. How he inhabits this character is the definition of an academy award performance. Amy Adams is subtle, brazen and luscious. Bradley Cooper, so manic and over- the-top, he is just nuts. Jennifer Lawrence nailed her part. I mean just jaw-dropping nailed it. Mesmerizing. All of it is mesmerizing, from the costumes to the dialogue, through plot and the ploy. Oh boy. <br/><br/>American Hustle is a snapshot of a cultural phenomenon that occurred in the 70's in America. Sure, it's about some con artists and a sting operation paralleling Abscam. But it's much more.<br/><br/>In America today, people become famous by taking videos of themselves having sex and posting them on the internet. The rest of America seems to want to watch those videos. Then those new ""stars"" have a reality TV show. We're in an age of the cult of me where someone is famous for being nobody and their main talent is they think are somebody. <br/><br/>American Hustle reflects the time when the cult of me was beginning. Unless you lived in the 50's, it's impossible to imagine how conservative America was with women in girdles, shirtwaist dresses and pumps and Leave It To Beaver and Father Knows Best representing what Americans thought was ideal. Twin beds for married couples on TV and in movies. Many folks had left rural American and come to cities for jobs but things were still pastoral and provincial. The war was over and we were living in the American dream. But it was stultifying and stresses converged. The Vietnam War, the Birth Control Pill, lots more women in the workplace, a rise in divorce and latchkey children and much more. America started having a social fit, like a snake, it began to shake off the strictures of the 40's and 50's, up pops the 60's and real social upheaval. Sex, drugs and rock n' roll cogently says it.<br/><br/>Our egos were filled with the right to self expression and that was the ultimate goal, to be an individual and to be free. Of course that didn't work out exactly as envisioned. This is what American Hustle reflects. This is the understory that we see, throbbing behind the plot.<br/><br/>Start with personal vanity. Bale's pitifully hilarious, glued comb-over. Cooper's perm-rod acquired afro, Adam's plunging, breast-revealing necklines and Lawrence's nail obsession, capped by the fruity, rotten top coat, so Freudian. The four main characters are far away from ""down home, plain, no-nonsense"" America of the 40's, ""decent, aren't we all innocent, hard workers"" America of the 50's and even from the ""peace, love, turn-on and tune-out"" of the 60's. They have entered ""we are all movie stars or rock gods, whether wanna-be or full tilt."" This is Saturday Night Fever told about adults. This is glam rock gone wild, where even the men are obsessed with their hair. <br/><br/>The characters are slick and smart, the dialogue ""Whose Afraid of Virginia Woolf"" caustic and the movie incredibly styled, successfully, from set to costume to manner. I felt transported back in time in the disco scene, reminiscent at Amy's lovely breast-teasing outfits. This was what it was really like ""back in the day,"" though the ""plot"" of the con game and Abscam were not part of it for most, but certainly not so far removed either. Everything was loosened, for good or bad. It just fell where it might. That made it fascinating. That is what American Hustle so deftly depicts. Self-will run riot, damn the consequences.<br/><br/>I have read many reviews of the movie. Most called it a comedy. I would hardly call it that. Certainly there are comedic moments, but primarily it is a tragedy, an American tragedy that still reverberates."

","I found the story depressing, no characters you really wanted to root for, and the evocation of the 1970s unsettlingly accurate. I remember it as a grim decade filled with sketchy people making bad choices.<br/><br/>That's why I had to grudgingly give American Hustle 8 Stars. They totally nailed it. It's not a feel good movie. It's has no central character to identify with and root for. Everyone is flawed, but compelling. Just like life. The performances were top notch, IMO. Especially Christian Bale and Jennifer Lawrence. They totally committed to their characters and made these deeply flawed, often unlikable people unforgettable. The film was like a multi-car pileup. You don't want to see it, but you just can't turn away, and it just keeps building.<br/><br/>I did not enjoy watching this film. Yet after it ended, I couldn't stop thinking about it. This movie deserves every award it garners. Great cast. Great story. Deftly told. I think all the uncredited cameos speaks to the quality of the material. So many people wanted to be a part of this. I can understand why. It may never be a blockbuster, but it's a great piece of storytelling and a memorable ensemble piece. 20 years from now this will still be a film worth watching. Everyone involved should be proud of what they made together. The more time passes since seeing it, the more impressed I am with it."

Christian Bale in particular was fantastic and definitely award-worthy. Amy Adams and Jennifer Lawrence were very good. Bradley Cooper's performance I thought was a little over-the-top, and Jeremy Renner an odd choice as the Mayor of New Jersey (he was too young, particularly after seeing his children). Robert De Niro's almost unrecognizable cameo was memorable and reminded me (physically) of Laurence Olivier's ""Szell"" character in ""Marathon Man""! <br/><br/>Overall, an entertaining movie and interesting story.

"PacificHeights","Null","1","4","4 January 2014"," Hustle down to see this on the big screen
","Critics are raving about American Hustle and I agree with them. David O. Russell has released his best film to date. Loosely based on the Abscam scandal, American Hustle is the story of small- time crook and con-man Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale). He, along with his love interest and business partner Edith (Amy Adams), con and manipulate their way into a bust by nervous, twitchy, FBI Agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper). <br/><br/>Richie is tall and handsome. He's serious about his job and about his hair. Edith cons Richie while Richie makes Irving and Edith rat-out local politicians to avoid jail time for themselves. In the cross-fire we meet Mayor Carmine (Jeremy Renner), the only good character in the movie. Carmine is the mayor of Camden, NJ. He is a family man who is dedicated to making Atlantic City abundant with lots of job opportunities for his white and black constituency. <br/><br/>We also meet Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence), Irving's bored, volatile, passive-aggressive wife. <br/><br/>The movie is fast-paced, energetic, and highly entertaining. You actually start to care for scumbags Irving and Edith. You also care for DiMaso though his hung-ho, hero cop routine is hurting a lot of people, including good-guy Mayor Carmine. All of the principles give stellar performances in American Hustle. Christian Bale shines as charismatic, confident, con-man Irving. Amy Adams does an excellent job as co-con and cop-con Edith. Bradley Cooper has never been better than he is here in the role of Richie DiMaso. He plays Richie's comic, tragic, nervous, high-anxiety, overly ambitious, sexy, bumbling character to perfection. This is Bradley Cooper's best performance since The Place Beyond The Pines. Jennifer Lawrence also steals every scene that David O. Russell writes for her to steal with her signature aggressive, loud, in-your-way manner. Jeremy Renner turns in a solid performance as set- up, good politician, Mayor Carmine.<br/><br/>Don't miss American Hustle. It is the second best movie of 2013."

The strong story of the film is really the back bone and what keeps it going, through points of unnecessary scenes not related to the excitement of the film at some points it can be a bit slow, but with great character development and great humour you can overlook these and focus on the characters in more depth. The cinematography is some what similar, not the same but similar to Goodfellas in my opinion, I noticed shots in which Martin Scorsese is known and loved for. Yes the similarities are visible but in a way which you appreciate David O.Russell for his great love in Scorsese pictures. I thought the dialogue was beautifully written, which shows nothing but a great written screenplay. I believe more could have been done from the great screenplay, it seems David O.Russell shy's away from confrontation in the film and can sometimes become at points tedious and you wanting the film to more along awaiting the moments which will make you stick you to your sit which there are moments of but a few. All in all I believe this is a great movie, the characters which were performed by a phenomenal cast really brought the characters to life, making it a delight to watch. With a small delightful appearance from a remarkable actor also. In a negative I believe If the script was put into the hands of other directors some names being Brian De Palma, Scorsese of course, Ridley Scott and even Paul Thomas Anderson I believe we could of seen a more colourful, exciting and even more memorable picture.

","American Hustle is the fictionalized retelling of the real-life FBI operation called 'ABSCAM', which ran during the late 70s/early 80s, and which result was the conviction of one U.S. senator and six members of the U.S. House of Representatives – they were sentenced for accepting bribes from a FBI agent who was posing as a sheikh. During the investigation, the FBI were aided by a convicted con artist, named Melvin Weinberg. A film adaptation of this event was originally planned in the early 80s, but it failed to reach the big screen up until 2013, when David O. Russell sat in the director's chair and gave the world a very loose adaptation of the story – so loose that the opening title card in the movie says only that 'some of this actually happened'.<br/><br/>Set in the late 70s, American Hustle follows a pair of con artists/lovers – Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale) and Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams) – who ran a small con operation. One day they get arrested by the FBI and are soon given a choice, by the young and idealistic agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Copper), who says he'll let them go, if they help him perform 4 white collar busts. Irving and Sydney reluctantly accept their offer, and make a plan which involves a made up Arab sheikh, and which will hopefully attract other con artists for DiMaso to arrest.<br/><br/>American Hustle is like a postcard from the golden age of Hollywood, it reeks of old Scorsese movies (Goodfellas comes to mind first), and while others may consider American Hustle a rip off because of this, I found this movie to be a stylish, beautiful throwback to a time when mainstream movies were somewhat better than today. In this movie, the director David O. Russell collaborates with almost everyone he has collaborated before: Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence starred in his critically acclaimed, but in my opinion somewhat flawed, Silver Linings Playbook, and Christian Bale and Amy Adams starred in The Fighter. These casting choices are amazing, since everyone fits their characters and roles perfectly. Christian Bale, who has (once again) undergone incredible body transformations in preparation for his role, is memorable and great as the con artist Irving Rosenfeld; Bradley Cooper is magnificent in portraying the FBI agent Richie DiMaso and his troubled personality; and Amy Adams is absolutely adorable in the ""double accent/double character"" role she plays. Even Jeremy Renner, who had not previously collaborated with Russell, is perfect in portraying the sleazy, but likable Mayor Carmine Polito. Only Jennifer Lawrence's role, that of Irving Rosenfeld's wife Rosalyn, didn't really stick with me, since her character seems rather formulaic.<br/><br/>In one instance, during the shooting of the movie, David O. Russell said to Christian Bale ""Christian, I hate plots. I am all about characters, that's it"". Which is a rather strange thing to say since some people, from what I have read on the internet, had problems with the characters themselves, meaning they couldn't engage with them. And I must say – that is very true, sometimes it is hard to empathize with the characters (since all of them have some distinct unlikeable traits) and this may be a problem for some people because the movie is over two hours long. As for me, I haven't had such problems, but I still disagree with Mr. Russell, since I am all about the style and the old school way in which this movie is told, rather than the characters. Although, there is one thing in the movie that left me disappointed, and that was the ending, which felt dull and underwhelming. I must say, in the end, I felt somewhat hustled.<br/><br/>Rating: 8/10 Read more reviews at http://passpopcorn.com/"

I think they could have kept up the pace a kept the movie at one hour and forty five minutes or perhaps one hour and fifty minutes. Another critic I have is the amount of humour. There are some humorous moments but there could be more of them. Lastly, there could have been some more action and violence to give the audience some shock moments. But overall a good and entertaining movie definitely worth the money."
"ObservationBlogger","7","1","4","31 December 2013"," 'Love and Theft' – American Hustle (2013) A movie review
","Background<br/><br/>I was not a big fan by any stretch of the work of director David Russell. I liked The Fighter a lot, but I detested the second half of Silver Linings Playbook. I came the long way round to watching this recent critics' favorite. I was aware some months ago that Martin Scorsese was making a new movie called, The Wolf of Wall Street. I quickly got my hands on the book by the same name this movie is based. By the half way point, I was very disappointed splurging whatever I had to procure this garbage.<br/><br/>What didn't make sense to me was why Scorsese would put all his effort on promoting arguably one of the most vial, detesting and uninteresting characters in recent memory, that being Jordan Belfort. I had decided if The Wolf movie even closely resembled this scumbag's book, I would not pay to see it since I felt it a moral sacrilege to give my hard earn money to promoting his name in anyway shape or form. Criminals from Goodfellas I can understand, heck they were interesting and paid for their crimes. This guy Belfort as one reviewer put it, 'kills people's dreams - that's much more insidious'.<br/><br/>Don't worry there is a connection coming. As I browsed reviews of The Wolf on Wall Street movie, I noticed an interesting connection in what people were writing about it and David Russell's, American Hustle. What was this Scorsese connection between the two? I had to find out. As I mentioned, David Russell's previous attempt Silver Linings Playbook didn't resonate well with me and I was unsure if American Hustle would live up to the hype. I wrote a review about Silver which you can find under my movie reviews here.<br/><br/>Anyone even remotely familiar with Scorsese cannot deny that David Russell has lent heavily from Scorsese's quintessential best movies to make American Hustle . The narratives, the music and editing, in particular the first half of the movie all point toward a seeming homage to Scorsese's 90's work, specifically Casino. Even De Niro makes a key entrance in a role so reminiscent of Casino wearing the same ginormous glasses Scorsese left us with in the final scene. Many have described that Russell has borrowed more from Goodfellas, but I don't see it as much I do with Casino. Borrowing and immersing material from populist culture is not new to David Russell's work. I noticed in Silver Linings how a lot of the writing involved character's spilling their theories on popular books, quoting from classic literature, recalling superstitious notions regarding football teams, blatant marketing of iPods and musings about the greatest music. It seemed as though Silver was more a satire or social commentary about how materialistic and consumer obsessed our society is.<br/><br/>There is no denying that Russell in his new movie, American Hustle has once again demonstrated his passion for heightening the senses regarding materialism and social trends given its almost perverse saturation of 1970's references. He tries so hard to draw his audiences in by fairly superficial materialistic means like the barrage of 1970's music, John Travolta dancing, the uncanny focus on men and women's hair styles, cleavage, drugs, money, quirkiness etc etc and of course that's fine, the movie is based in the 70's. But how much of it seems real? Does hearing Goodbye Yellow Brick Road in the middle of the movie connect with what we are seeing on screen or is it thrown in because it will strike a chord with audiences?<br/><br/>One could argue, the movie eventually does stand on its own two feet. Unlike Silver Linings which leads to an eventual Strictly Ballroom squeamish sequence, this movie does the opposite. It leads to some great plot twists which enhance the explosivity of the situations our protagonists find themselves. Thank God, it is not predictable. American Hustle eventually does becomes its own beast. The acting is very good. Christian Bale as always is exceptional and the female cast, Amy Adams worth noting is excellent. I liked her seductress ways in The Master as well. Their are a lot of comical undertones and at times in your face laugh out loud moments you might find yourself questioning, 'Should I actually be laughing at this'? Ironically, there isn't much physical action in this, but the script is so super solid you wonder how a director could screw this up. There were apparently lots of improvisation in this movie which undoubtedly enhanced its spontaneity and feel of realism. The cheeky manipulation and seductive powers of the female leads was expertly delivered and how the embattled men craved their scanty approval was almost the stuff of Shakespeare.<br/><br/>These are modern times and this movie is for modern audiences. I admired Russell's The Fighter because of it's originality and I detested Silver Linings Playbook for the exact opposite reason. But American Hustle broaches the two. Love and Theft I call it, like the title of Bob Dylan's 2001 classic album which also borrows heavily from other sources, but still stands up on its own as something quite fresh. Fresh, how? That's hard to place your finger on."

","Awards season was approaching, and with the Golden Globe and BAFTA nominations being announced I presumed this film was going to be one of the contenders for the Oscars as well, and the trailer made it look very good as well, from Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated director David O. Russell (Three Kings, I Heart Huckabees, The Fighter). Basically set in 1978, con artists Irving Rosenfeld (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Christian Bale) and Sydney Prosser (Golden Globe winning, and Oscar and BAFTA nominated Amy Adams) meet each other and start a relationship, and posing as British aristocrat ""Lady Edith Greensley"" she seems to be improving his scams as they work together, but he cannot bring himself to divorce his wife Rosalyn (BAFTA and Golden Globe winning, and Oscar nominated Jennifer Lawrence), as she would get custody of his adopted son Danny (twins Danny and Sonny Corbo). The duo are running a scam loan business, but FBI agent Richard 'Richie' DiMaso (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Bradley Cooper) catches them, but he will let them go if Irving heps him catch four other crooks, Sydney is against this agreement, but Richie believes she is truly British, perhaps not of aristocracy, but she distances herself from Irving as she manipulates Richie in order to continue scamming people. Irving has a friend pretending to be wealthy Sheik Abdullah, as part of a scheme to con Mayor Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner) of Camden, New Jersey, the mayor has been struggling to legalise gambling and raise necessary funds, Richie's boss Stoddard Thorsen (Louis C.K.) and Irving object to his entrapment plan to catch Carmine for doing dodgy business, but Sydney secures an unauthorised transfer of $2 million, Stoddard's boss Anthony Amado (Jurassic Park III's Alessandro Nivola) wants the operation to go ahead as well. Carmine is convinced that the Sheikh is legitimate, and that he doesn't like Richie, the two become friends, but Richie does not consult the others as to who will be the Sheikh, he chooses Mexican-American FBI agent Paco Hernandez (Michael Peña), and later posing as this wealthy Arab they go to a casino to meet violent Mafia overlord Victor Tellegio (Robert De Niro), a necessary part to the deal before doing business, the mobster requires a $10 million wire transfer to know the Sheikh is legitimate, Irving knows that the situation is going out of control. Richie has been getting very close to Sydney, still convinced that she is British, but she becomes confused and aggressive after he admits he loves her, and drops her accent to reveal her true identity, Irving arrives and after all is explained tries to back out of their deal, but Richie tells them that if they do call it off Tellegio will find out the scam and kill everyone close or connected to them. Rosalyn is having an affair with mobster Pete Musane (Jack Huston), who she met at a party, as she feels unloved by Irving who she thought was with working with the Internal Revenue Service, after being confronted by him she agrees to keep quiet for husband to allow the Sheikh scam deal to go ahead, but she wants to get divorced by the end of it. Richie and Irving entrap members of Congress, with the help of Carmine, into receiving bribes, and videotapes them doing it, he needs $10 million from Amado to entrap Tellegio, so a meeting is set with the gangster's lawyer Alfonse Simone (Paul Herman) who accepts the transfer, Irving later reveals the scam to Carmine, the money is missing and an anonymous says they will give it back if Irving and Sydney are immune from arrest and the mayor gets a reduced sentence, Amado is prepared to have this deal, Irving thinks Richie either has the money himself is has been incompetent. But the big reveal is that Richie is the one that has been conned, a friend posed as Tellegio's lawyer for Irving to gain the advantage and stay away from the mob, Amado accepts the deal and Richie is dropped into obscurity, Irving and Sydney drop the conning game and open an authentic art gallery, and move in together, Rosalyn divorces her husband, gets married to Pete, and allows to share custody of Danny, the mob allow Irving to live as attention from them was deflected, but he does regret what happened to Carmine. Also starring Elisabeth Röhm as Dolly Polito, Colleen Camp as Brenda, Shea Whigham as Carl Elway, Saïd Taghmaoui as Irv's Sheik Plant and Licence to Kill's Anthony Zerbe as Senator Horton Mitchell. Only the year before director Russell was nominated many Oscars for Silver Linings Playbook, including all four acting categories, which had not happened since Reds in 1981, but it happened again for this film, and deservedly so, Bale is fantastic as the lead con artist, Adams is brilliant as his reliable but nervous confidant, Lawrence steals the show as the wife who is ditsy but can shoot her mouth off, and Cooper is likable as the cop who unknowingly becomes part of the game playing. This feels authentic, down to the obvious wigs, polyester suits and popular 70's music, but it proves itself to be more than a caper, it cunning and clever, and works as a great character piece, part of the fun is the stars playing off against each other, it is a highly watchable crime drama based on a true story. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Costume Design, Best Film Editing, Best Production Design and Best Writing, Original Screenplay, it won the BAFTAs for Best Original Screenplay and Best Make Up/Hair, and it was nominated for Best Film, Best Production Design and Best Costume Design, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy or Musical, and it was nominated for Best Screenplay. Very good!"
"zensixties","9","1","5","6 March 2016"," Great ensemble acting; my kind of film!
","I finally got to see the whole film, ""American Hustle"" (as opposed to the first 1/2 hour on a flight), and thought it was the best new film I've seen in a long time. Based on the true story of the ABSCAM FBI sting of the '70s, the couple Irving (Christian Bale) and Sydney (Amy Adams) tear up the screen with great chemistry, dialogue, and style. 1970s music encompasses the soundtrack and there is some great sophisticated humor to the script. <br/><br/>It was well done how the beginning which is about a con-artist quickly expands into a major FBI operation. Yes, it gets convoluted and some less sharp viewers will definitely be lost, but those who can follow the whole thing will be rewarded. It's such an absurd scenario setting up the fake sheikh, etc. that it's hard to believe it actually happened, but it did. I remember how ABSCAM was on the news all the time, but I as a kid had no idea what it was. This film explains it pretty well, with of course some dramatization. The names are changed, but the characters are real (Irving was Mel Weinberg).<br/><br/>Only issue for me is that they had to do the usual casting cliché, i.e. Robert Deniro as the mobster. Also it's too bad they made Bale actually gain all that weight. Would have been better for him and the film had they not. And there was an issue with the women actors being mistreated and getting lower pay than the men. But that's Hollywood for ya. This didn't win any Academy Awards; I'm not sure who did that year, but don't really care."
"MacTheMovieguy","8","1","5","23 July 2014"," There's a piece missing in this puzzle, and it is really just an indescribable piece.
","I actually saw this film a week ago. I've been sitting on this review, trying to figure out what to say. Or how to grade it. I almost feel like I need to see the film again, because I don't quite know how to explain my thoughts on it yet. Basically, I thought it was a good film. I didn't think it was a great film, yet I can't really pinpoint problems with the movie. It's just that feeling that you get when you're separating your ""favorite"" films from your list of ""good"" films. There's a piece missing in this puzzle, and it is really just an indescribable piece.<br/><br/>I think part of the problem is that when you assemble such a fantastic team, you automatically raise the bar for yourself. While I appreciate David O. Russell's obvious homage to Martin Scorsese films, it is not my favorite David O. Russell film. He set the bar so high with Silver Linings Playbook (my favorite film of 2012) and The Fighter (one of my favorites from 2011) that American Hustle just didn't get there for me. I can't help but think that Christian Bale has had more career-defining performances, or that Bradley Cooper was better last year in Silver Linings. The comparisons are there, they are immediate, but yet I can't pick a specific problem with the film.<br/><br/>The other problem is that I feel that this has been a really good year for film. Even films produced for a wide audience, including some sequels, have been fantastic. American Hustle gets lost for me a bit when I'm looking at my ""top 10″, because I think there are better films that will contribute in the long run to the overall ""history"" of film. American Hustle, for me, is more like a Seabiscuit. It's a really good film that deserves the praise it gets, but at the end of the day it wasn't the years best, and 10 years from now, people won't really be talking about it. But if it ever gets brought up in conversation, for whatever reason, it will be remembered for being good.<br/><br/>Probably the best work to come out of Hustle are the performances by Amy Adams and Jennifer Lawrence. For both of them, it's a bit of a departure from the work they are used to giving. Lawrence is much more mature here. She expands upon the maturity that O. Russell gave her in Silver Linings and projects it even more as the housewife to Christan Bale's character. She's the life of the party, she's loud, and she's aware of her own sexual prowess over men. For a girl who is still being cast as a teenager in The Hunger Games (Katniss is 17 in Catching Fire), it's an interesting parallel to see her play an adult role. Also, Amy Adams usually plays wallflower type roles, or girls who are learning to come into themselves. Here, she's sexually aggressive and dominating Bale in their scenes together. If anything, this film should be remembered for casting Adams against type. This is a role typically given to an Angelina Jolie type, but instead was given to Adams. Of all the performances in the film, I thought hers was the most ""award"" worthy.<br/><br/>And because I haven't talked about him, I will say it was nice to see Jeremy Renner in a more laid back, good guy role. So often Hollywood casts him as a bad guy, or as a tough guy. He's neither here, and his performance is endearing. It's not a particularly showy role, but it's a nice one for the Renner canon. O. Russell's direction also makes smart choices, which is why I called it a nice homage to Scorsese films. It feels like a new take on the Goodfellas tale. A man thinks he can make all the right choices to secure his future, but he ends up in over his head, and he struggles to try and find the exit. Surprisingly, in a non-Scorsese approach, there is very little blood shed in this film. Like, I think there was one person who died on screen the entire film. As a matter of fact, I can think of very little reason this movie should be R, except for some profanity and some sexual content, I suppose. If I had teenagers, I wouldn't have a problem with them watching this film.<br/><br/>I've been dreading this review, because I wish I could describe the ""minus"". There's something missing here, and even though I can't pinpoint it, I just don't feel like it is on the level with some of the other great films of the year that I've awarded A's to, like Blue Jasmine, Gravity, 12 Years A Slave, Prisoners, or Dallas Buyers Club. I would still definitely recommend this film, even if it isn't in my Top 10 for the year."
"CMTiago","7","1","5","23 February 2014"," Not as great as it could have been
","American Hustle is the latest project from Hollywood's recent rising director, David O. Russel. I wanna start by saying that I loved both The Fighter and Silver Linings Playbook. This was supposed to be Russel's step to something even greater, with perhaps a best director and best picture win at the Oscars. I'm sadden to say that this isn't that movie. Although it has grown into a major contender, it will probably walk away with few awards or even empty ended. As far as the movie goes, one of the things I enjoyed the most was Christian Bale's performance of this con man. Bale gives a stylistic feel to his character and is by far the richer in the film. Amy Adams also gives a good performance as well, and Bradley Cooper and Jeremy Renner are solid. I am a huge fan of Lawrence, and while she showed yet again her maturity in the role, she could have brought more to the table. Despite its cool imagery and decent performances, American Hustle fails on one important issue and that is its plot. The premise is good, but the plot is basically unattached to the con world and all its tactics. It misses the key element to fully entertain given its genre and I for one am a a little disappointed in this.<br/><br/>Rating 7/10"
"matthewbellas","8","1","5","27 January 2014"," extremely entertaining
","The Big 4 in the movie did some of the Best acting I've ever seen especially Bradley Cooper and Christian Bale and Amy Adams and Jennifer Lawrence were amazing. Huge Jennifer Lawrence Fan went to see this just for the fact that her and Bradley Cooper were in it enjoyed it even more when I found out that Christian Bale,Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner were gonna be in it Lawrence and Cooper are absolutely amazing together. The great Chemistry between Cooper and Lawrence continues in this movie following Silver Linings Playbook and Robert Deniro was good in the single scene he was in. Some consider this to be a remake of GoodFellas probable will never be as famous a movie as Goodfellas but still overall a very good movie I highly recommend seeing it"
"MaximumMadness","10","1","5","22 January 2014"," Hustle over to the cinemas right now and see ""American Hustle"", a highly amusing and charming gem of a film.
","There's something to be said for films that provide endless charm and plenty of smiles to audiences. Especially in an age of dark, gritty, moody reboots and over-bight, assembly-line cookie-cutter Hollywood schlock... it's like a breath of fresh air after holding your breath underwater to find a film such as ""American Hustle."" A release that will immediately make you feel better, and remind you of the magic of cinema.<br/><br/>Beginning with an amusing tease that ""Some of this actually happened"", we follow the story of veteran con-artist couple Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale) and Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams), who are apprehended by FBI agent Richard ""Richie"" DiMaso (Bradly Cooper) after a sting to catch them on a loan scam. The duo are promised to be released as part of a bargain, if they can help provide DiMaso with more arrests. However, a number of complications arise, including Irving's wife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence) who threatens to complicate matters and has an ongoing rivalry with his lover Sydney, DiMaso's sometimes reckless eagerness and growing feelings towards Sydney, Irving growing friendship with Mayor (and target for the operation) Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner), and constant complications to the ever-growing and changing scheme. Amongst many other often-comical foils to the plot.<br/><br/>This is a film that is most certainly all about the cast, and how they portray the characters. And it is one of the finest ensemble films I've seen in some time. While the entire cast is absolutely wonderful, I first have to give credit to the two strongest performers here- Jennifer Lawrence and Amy Adams, both of whom I am a massive fan of. Here, they really both become the heart of the film in different ways, conveying outstanding performances that left me in awe. I was particularly amused by Adams' dual roles, not only as Sydney, but also as the British aristocrat ""Lady Edith Greensley"", a false identity she created for her schemes, and an identity she is forced to slip in and out of often during the film. And Lawrence, who I first noticed in the very well-done ""X-Men: First Class"", before becoming an enormous fan with ""The Hunger Games"" and ""Silver Linings Playbook"", completely steals the show in her scenes, giving Rosalyn a lot of complexity, and conveying a number of different mindsets- everything from wild drunk to manically depressed and enraged. Lawrence has quickly become arguably the best actress of her generation. And I was more than thrilled that both her and Adams won their respective Golden Globs. (And I hope they do win their Oscars)<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is marvelous as well. Bale proves himself once again to be completely fearless, making Irving a complex, confident-yet- insecure-at-times individual, who is... well, physically very off- putting due to a large gut and a balding head. Bale is so much fun in this film. Cooper is also a blast, starting off somewhat noble before becoming a greedy, over-eager and cocky man who still has a lot of charm. Renner is also great as Carmine, a decent man who unfortunately gets sucked into some shady dealings. And I do have to give a shout-out to someone I think is very over-looked in the cast, which is Louis CK. CK portrays one of Renner's superiors at the FBI, and while his scenes are often brief, they are hysterically funny, very memorable, and very well-acted. I wish CK could have been nominated for at least a few awards, because frankly, he deserves them.<br/><br/>The production is absolutely great. Director/Co-Writer David O. Russell weaves a surprisingly complex-yet-accessible caper with his script (co-written by Eric Warren Singer), and it's full of much great humor. Even during scenes where it wasn't laugh-out-loud, the film's charm and jokes left a constant smile on my face and gave me numerous chuckles and giggles. Russell's direction is also top-notch and quite classy, providing us with the best possible visual storytelling. (Although I will nitpick that I didn't like a few shots where the camera would rapidly move into closeup, as I found it somewhat distracting, but that's a very small nitpick in an otherwise flawless film.)<br/><br/>I also really have to give a shout-out to the set and costume design. Set in the 70's, this film does a wondrous job conveying its timeframe, and the sets/locations were particularly beautiful. I also highly admired the costume design, which not only felt authentic, but lended a sort-of classic ""Hollywood beauty"" to the aesthetic. (Although certain wardrobe choices for certain actresses did lead to much distraction for myself as a male viewer. If you've seen the film you will know what I'm talking about.) And the musical choices were phenomenal. I almost found myself singing along in the theater during one sequence when Elton John's ""Goodbye Yellow Brick Road"" came on.<br/><br/>I really don't know what else to say. This is just a fun, fun, fun film. It's one of the most charming movies I've seen in years, and one of the most joyously humorous. I haven't enjoyed a trip to the cinemas this much in months, and I do think this film deserves every nomination and award it receives. (And I didn't even have the time to address certain other strengths, including a surprising cameo from a film legend that I won't surprise.)<br/><br/>""American Hustle"" is a perfect 10 for me."
"Firestorm-86","8","1","5","11 January 2014"," American Hustle Review
","""Some of this actually happened"" reads an early title card, rather than the traditional ""inspired by a true story"", these words provide a sense of relief. Director David O. Russell acknowledges the historical ABSCAM investigations that influenced this film but he isn't willing to let the details compromise the story he wants to tell. Like his previous work he is able to focus on the characters story than the plot. <br/><br/>""American Hustle"" is his second film of the past 12 months after ""Silver Linings Playbook"" and for this project he gathered an ensemble cast by combining Christian Bale and Amy Adams of 2010's ""The fighter"" with Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence and Robert DeNiro from ""Silver Linings Playbook""<br/><br/>The interaction between these cast members offers a unique chemistry that could never be replicated with any other actor each character has their own story and each story is told to perfection, but its when these stories intersect that the emotions emerge and the quirky sense of humour follows.<br/><br/>The hair-styling, costumes and set design is fascinating to examine and O. Russell emphasises the 70s look by using camera angles iconic to 70s movies, like John Travolta's strut in Saturday Night Fever.<br/><br/>American Hustle opens on Christian Bale's 'beer belly', as the camera tilts up, we see him piecing together a rather elaborate comb over. Gone is his physique from ""The Dark Knight"" Trilogy as Bale again puts his body through an intense transformation for his role in as Irving Rosenfeld. <br/><br/>Irving is an experienced con-man who along with his cunning partner Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams) is forced to work for FBI agent Ritchie Di Masso (Bradley Cooper). DiMasso pushes them into a world of Jersey power brokers and mafia that's as dangerous and alluring.<br/><br/>Amy Adams has never been better, she is sleek, sexy and seductive as Sydney Prosser The chemistry between her and Irving seems genuine, but the ease and comfort that she plays her British alias Lady Edith Greensly keeps us on our toes, whose side is she really on? Amy Adams is dazzling and guaranteed to feature in the upcoming awards season even her cleavage gets enough screen time to warrant an Oscar statue.<br/><br/>It's the hot-headed Ritchie DiMaso who transforms the most throughout the film. Played by Bradley Cooper, Richie is the young, ambitious FBI agent still living with his mother and with a point to prove. His ambition sometimes gets the better of him as he tries to bag some of the biggest crooks in the state. <br/><br/>Caught in the middle of this diverse threesome is Jeremy Renner as Carmine Polito, the passionate New Jersey politician who wants to recover the local economy and Jennifer Lawrence as Irving's wife Rosalyn – A real loose cannon and the most manipulative of the lot.<br/><br/>When Rosalyn almost sets the kitchen alight by putting metal in the new ""Science Oven"" (Microwave). She manages to manipulate her husband to show a bit of gratitude for extinguishing the flames. In a role written specifically for Jennifer Lawrence she continues to prove that she is the most versatile and talented actress in Hollywood. No matter what she's doing she is enchanting, even an unexpected rendition of ""Live and let die"" is captivating.<br/><br/>The biggest setback for American Hustle is its pacing, although never boring, the film does meander and the 138 minute runtime begins to be felt midway through, however this is somewhat redeemed with an energizing use of 70's music, featuring tracks from Elton John, David Bowie and the Beegees."

Bradley Cooper keeps impressing me more and more every time I see one of his movies. I am a big fan. Amy Adams was so hot and sexy in this movie and you will fall in love with her character too. Jennifer Lawrence was outstanding as the Italian princess. She reminded me of some members of my family. Without a doubt all 4 actors best movie to date. The movie also portrayed the time period very well. I felt like I was back in that time period. De Niro's part was small, but another classic performance!!!"
"jmoneyjohal","8","1","5","8 January 2014"," Best ensemble cast EVER?
","Multi layered crime film; American Hustle is a brilliantly directed picture with a terrific cast of varied talent that really makes the film standout. Helmed by director David O. Russell, who previously directed Silver Linings Playbook and The Fighter, both of them were standout films, but with this outing, Russell has made the finest film of his career. The story is not new, but what makes it standout is the cast, its chemistry and layered plot that manages to be very entertaining despite the fact that we've seen similar ideas before. The film is well executed and its cast are truly engaging. For me, anyhow there is not one bad performance here, and each actor just elevates the film that much more. The idea is simple, but the way Russell and company craft this film is what makes American Hustle a memorable and engaging ride from start to finish. With that being said, American Hustle will most likely be seen as a modern crime classic in the future. Like I said, this is David O. Russell's finest work yet, and with a cast like this, American Hustle is a must see picture that you won't want to miss. Brilliantly acted and directed, this picture is one of those films that soars above the rest while using a simple, yet well layered plot to create something truly memorable. Russell truly shines here, and saying that, I wonder how he will top this outstanding crime drama. If you love Crime films, American Hustle is a no brainer to watch. The film echoes of the finest films of the genre, And with a stunning cast of phenomenal talent, this film definitely stands out, and is one of the finest films of the year."
"jujuwalk","8","1","5","8 January 2014"," An Innocent World
","I happened to have watched American Hustle and Wolf of Wall Street in one weekend. They do have a lot in common. Both have long lines at the movie theaters. Both stories actually happened. Both involve swindles. Both protagonists rise from lowly pedigree. Both thriving professional lives are signed off by FBI. Both stories are about American reinvention, self-reinvention, deception, and self-deception. But there is one key difference: the self-consciousness about their make-believe persona. You always need that bit of a twist to make it tingle. Wolf of Wall Street lacks that twist.<br/><br/>American Hustle is not about a con, the techniques to make a con successful, but about a conman, who is fully aware of his own limitedness, from which he bootstraps his new persona, but don't whole-heartedly buy his own self-invention either, therefore ending up in an eternal survival mode. His confidence, his showmanship, and his hyperbolic style are not the cream on the top, but a crutch underneath. Christian Bale's acting so nicely captures this, especially the opening scene of him setting up his hair. The opening scene is actually my personal favorite. The close-up shot reveals the truth underneath: a toupee carefully put under his comb-over. The finish seems rather elaborate, or, exquisite, I would say. But you don't want to know what's underneath it. What an excellent metaphor that sums up the gist of a con! Bale's acting tops the exquisite finish with a necessary layer of irony. He is extremely careful when applying glue to attach the hair piece, tapping lightly to fixate it. The delicate hand gesture reminds me of a virtuoso pianist's fingers caressing the keyboard when playing Schubert's D960. With a toupee, like a talisman, safely tucked under his hair, Irving Rosenfeld has finished the transformation, more than ready to go on the battle field (or dance court) of con-art-marking. <br/><br/>But, all the ridicule aside, there is actually something laudable about Irvine. Everyone in the movie is somewhat delusional, except Irving. The FBI agent (Bradley Cooper) is desperate in striving to make a name for himself, to hold the whip in his office, stretching his actual capabilities so hard that barely cover the feet of the heroic man he imagines himself to be. But he at least shares one thing with Irvine: the desperate need for a transformation and self-reinvention. Irvine's wife (Jennifer Lawrence) is even more hilarious, whom the word ""delusional"" could hardly fit because she is beyond delusional. The scene where Irvine came back from almost being killed by the mafia guy she fell for precisely summarizes her state of beyond delusional. As Irvine was ranting about how her sweet love talk with the mafia guy almost cost his life, she cried: ""why can't you be happy for me?"" Sister, you really don't know what is going on. <br/><br/>Irvine's soul mate, Sydney Prosser (Amy Adam) is delusional too, but her delusion resonates with Irvine's. Everyone else's delusion is about a cause, something external to self, be it professional triumph (Bradley Cooper), domestic love (Jennifer Lawrence), or political or monetary success (other politicians and the mafia). But Sydney and Irvine's delusion is fundamentally about themselves. Both of them were born into a situation that they don't like, and both of them tried very hard to outgrow it: e.g. feeding and raising the new self upon Duke Ellington. Although the endeavor is precarious, they found each other.<br/><br/>Irvine, despite all the unexpected twists and turns, still tries to remain sane about something so fundamental to everyone: e.g. friendship, fathership, and manages to execute a con that eventually exculpates his lover and himself. Most of all, he is always vigilant about when he would exceed his limits. He is crystal clear about who he is, a conartist, no more, no less. The self-consciousness keeps everything under control, just like the small laundry shop he runs, not of luxury, but equipped with everything necessary. He is always unsure, and scared, deep down. If there is one thing he firmly believes in is that one day the whole thing will be busted. He is just unsure when the judgment day will come. So he hustles, hustling up just to make ends meet. If there is one thing I could recall after one year of seeing this movie, it will be Bale's depiction of Irvine's predicament, his fear, and the way he hustles to survive. <br/><br/>Last, but not least, American Hustle is a much more innocent world. <br/><br/>A dialogue from the scene where Irving Rosenfeld first met his soul mate Sydney Prosser: ""Is that Duke Ellington on your bracelet?"" Irving Rosenfeld asks. ""As a matter of fact it is. He died this year, youknow?"" Sydney Prosser responds. ""I know. I doubt anyone else here knows or cares about it,"" he said ""Well, I care about it. He's saved my life many times,"" she said. ""Mine too. Which one? ""Jeep's Blues,"" she said."

","American Hustle is a very messy movie. It feels like the type of movie that a teenager and his friends would get together to make, to try and pay homage to the likes of Scorsese. The problem here is that American Hustle is a movie from David O'Russell, a director whose past movies I enjoyed a lot, with the likes of 'The Fighter', 'Silver Linings Playbook' and 'Three Kings'. David O'Russell shouldn't have to look to Scorsese for inspiration, because he comes up with good original ideas of his own. American Hustle feels a lot like a rip of Goodfellas. Things such as structure, narration, character arcs; all very reminiscent of Goodfellas. And in my opinion, Goodfellas is the greatest movie of all time, so if you're gonna pay homage to it, you're gonna have to do it right. David O'Russell doesn't do it right, producing a complete mess that, although not a bad film, could have been so much more.<br/><br/>The screenplay for American Hustle is garbage. It's really awful, and I sincerely hope that it doesn't receive a nomination at the Oscars because it's pretty bad. The story is very convoluted, has no satisfying conclusion and the characters are fairly messy and disbelievable. One thing the movie gets right is it's humour, but even so, a lot of that feels improvised and probably isn't even in the screenplay.<br/><br/>Acting is okay, but none of these actors are really performing to the best of their ability. Amy Adams and Bradley Cooper feel like the only ones who really lose themselves in their roles, and whilst Christian Bale is good he's hardly at the quality he was at in the likes of 'American Psycho'. Jennifer Lawrence delivers what's probably her worst performance to date, she has a great screen presence but only because she overacts so much that it's laughable. Louis C.K is really great, his scenes with Bradley Cooper were my favorites in the movie, and Jeremy Renner does a good job as well.<br/><br/>Things like costume design and and set design are great, but that's all aesthetic stuff. American Hustle has the style but not the substance, which is where it really fails. There's no other way around it; American Hustle is a huge disappointment. You could go and see this movie which, although is not bad, is basically a fake Scorsese movie, or you could go and see the real Scorsese with 'The Wolf Of Wall Street'. I think you know what the wiser option is."
"TheSquiss","9","1","5","7 January 2014"," Thrilling ensemble piece of corruption and conmen. Fantastic to the last!
","American Hustle opens with the text: Some of this actually happened. Oh, that it were truly the case.<br/><br/>Well, actually it is. Sort of.<br/><br/>David O. Russell reunites the stars (Bradley Cooper & Jennifer Lawrence) of his starkly different but equally superb Silver Linings Playbook in a fantastic yarn, about a brazen conman, that bubbles along from the off and jostles the viewer along with its boundless energy and audacity. American Hustle lifts elements of a certain reality and weaves it into a fiction that is an absolute romp.<br/><br/>Conman Irving Rosenfield (Christian Bale) is a smalltime wide boy who falls completely for the seductive, sharp-thinking Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams) and forms a partnership for more not-so-petty scamming. Entrapped by FBI agent Richie Di Maso (Cooper), who has promotion in mind and far bigger fish he wishes to fry, Irving and Sydney are forced into organizing the mother of all cons that Richie hopes will bring down Mayor Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner), the big cheeses in the Mafia and a host of politicians. It is a convoluted and dangerous plan fighting corruption with corruption and with money, power and lives at risk. And hiding in the wings is Rosalyn (Lawrence), Irving's highly-strung, volatile wife.<br/><br/>There is so much energy coursing through American Hustle with writers, director and cast on terrific form. This is such a cleverly crafted and beautifully written film with an accomplished director, who can evidently juggle multitudinous strands and ideas, in the chair, and a starry cast that would struggle not to make the best of it. They do, and it keeps the audience riveted until the fat lady sings.<br/><br/>Bale, with a comb over that is so awful you have to love it, struts his portly stuff with arrogant panache. Frequently he displays signs of Robert De Niro (in his heyday, not the De Niro of The Family) but Bale is in a class of his own when it comes to method, intensity and versatility and though his Irving is no Adonis, like Sydney, we can't help but fall for him completely.<br/><br/>There are many films were the star power works on paper (Larry Crowne, any one?) but on film it is very obvious that someone forgot to invite the chemistry along to the party. Not so here. There is a fantastic crackle of electricity between the principal quintet and, though Bale is clearly in command of our attention here, it is in the company of his peers that he plays hardest. The relationship that develops between Irving and Carmine adds a gentleness to the boisterous mayhem that bubbles away behind the scheming.<br/><br/>Apart, both Lawrence and Adams are exciting in their performances as the ladies in Irving's life but, though this is the seventies, neither woman is a doormat and both hold the men around them by the short and curlies, one with guile, the other with desperation. And when they finally share a room, oh boy, hell freezing over could never be that glacial! Cooper, though not in the same league as Bale, adds another superb blend of bumbler and Jack the lad to his CV. Always watchable, inevitably entertaining, he is the equal of his co-stars in this wonderful ensemble piece that will remain vivid in the memory even when we are preparing to bid this year farewell.<br/><br/>American Hustle thoroughly delights, entertains and will surely end the year laden with gold honestly gained. Throughout, it is thrilling, funny, dramatic and intense. As the narrative unravels so do the plans of the protagonists, while their lives become ever more complicated by predicaments that could only exist in the mind of the most creative of writers.<br/><br/>Couldn't they? <br/><br/>For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page."
"NannonHarry","6","1","5","6 January 2014"," You won't feel conned by David O. Russell's deal!
","From its opening caption of ""Some of this actually happened."" to the twists and humour that ensues, American Hustle feels like David O. Russell's homage to Scorsese, not to mention a few Tarantino nods. Although it may not have the right pace of a crime movie, you won't feel conned by Russell's deal.<br/><br/>Hustle sees Russell reuniting with some of the leads from his two previous films - The Fighter and Silver Linings Playbook - which creates a stellar cast who are all on top form. Irving, played by an almost unrecognisable Christian Bale, is a bold, jazz-loving con man with one of the most outrageous comb-overs in movie history. His sidekick, a sexy Amy Adams, reinforces the confidence of the movie while retaining her characters charming vulnerability. And FBI agent, Bradly Cooper, brings naivety and narcissism to an oddly fitting role.<br/><br/>The supporting cast are outstanding too, with Jennifer Lawrence stealing every scene she's in as her role of the unhappy / unstable housewife creates the most laughs and pity. Lawrence also makes for, the already Tumblr famous scene of her singing along to Live And Let Die while aggressively cleaning, the most satisfying scene of the movie. With Carmine Polito not far behind, showcasing some of Jeremy Renner's finest acting to date.<br/><br/>Though the film does struggle with its uneven pace and through Russell's vision of the '70s with it's big hair, elaborate outfits and smoke machines. Due to Russell's love of ad-lib, the plot becomes hazy and you may not grasp every detail but the electrifying soundtrack is enough to keep you on your toes.<br/><br/>American Hustle doesn't quite have the full package but with its memorable performances - including a fantastic cameo - there's no question about how it already has 7 Golden Globes nominations under its belt. Everything you'd expect and more from a David O. Russell film.<br/><br/>Witty, sexy and very stylish with a soundtrack that's just as entertaining as the film itself. Where Russell's homage may dip in certain places, the killer ensemble and hilarious dialogue makes up for."

","I'll put my hands up and admit it, I'm an action buff, I don't typically go to see this sort of movie, especially at the weekend. However my wife dragged me along as one of her old school friends worked on the editing side. So in expectation of brownie points, I tagged along.<br/><br/>The first 20 minutes or so I felt it dragged a little, but slowly the cast started to reel me in and by the end of it I was begging for more. Absolutely beautifully crafted story with a fantastic cast. It's the first movie in a very long time (for me since Shawshank Redemption) which didn't have any weak players in the cast, not one.<br/><br/>Christian Bale and Amy Adams were stand out for me, but that doesn't in any way detract from the fantastic performances by the rest of the cast. I will be absolutely flabbergasted if this movie doesn't pick up an acting Oscar for at least one of the leading and supporting actors and a great fistful of nominations.<br/><br/>The story itself is carefully woven and I found myself rooting wholeheartedly for the ""baddie"" con artists by the end.

"The_Film_Cricket","Null","1","5","27 December 2013"," The most dizzying vortex of 70s polyester and butterfly collars since ""Boogie Nights.""
","""American Hustle"" opens with the construction of an unfortunate hairpiece. A balding man looks in the mirror, works his comb-over before gluing his new hair in place. When the process is complete, the result looks – hey! – not so bad. It's quite an intricate process. The careful application of these fake follicles represents, in a not-so-subtle way, the methods and application of almost everything that will happen for the next two hours, it's all subterfuge. We are invited into the world of a group of con artists, some working together and some being scammed themselves. We see how they operate on their marks and on each other.<br/><br/>The application of the script, like the hairpiece, is convincing too. Writer-director David O. Russell and co-screenwriter Eric Warren Singer have based their script on the FBI's famous ABSCAM operation of the late 70s in which several high-level politicians were caught in an elaborate bribery sting. Russell is bold enough to open the movie with a title card that tells us that ""Some of this actually happened,"" which frees up the story to be juicy enough that it isn't hindered by keeping the facts straight (actually, they've put together a story that is infinitely more interesting than the real thing). Their script weaves together the most fascinating con game since George Roy Hill's ""The Sting"" and the most dizzying vortex of 70s polyester and butterfly collars since ""Boogie Nights."" None of this would mean anything, of course, if we didn't care about the characters, starting with Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale, the one with the hairpiece), a Brooklyn-born business man who has made his bones with a string a dry cleaning stores all around Long Island. It's all a front, of course, behind the scenes he dabbles in fake art and loan fraud. With a bowling ball-shaped stomach and unfortunate hair, this is Bale's best performance since his Oscar win for ""The Fighter"", playing a guy who excels at the con but can't keep his personal life together.<br/><br/>His passage to the big time begins when he meets Syndey Prosser (Amy Adams), a sweet and sexy gal from Albuquerque who started as a stripper and has moved her way up the style ladder using a mixture of what she's got upstairs and up front. There's something vague about Sydney that we can't quite put our finger on. Most of her cons involve slipping into the persona of Lady Edith, a Brit with banking connections. Her alliance with Irving takes his con games to new heights. They become, not only partners in crime but also lovers despite the predicament of Irving's wife Roselyn (Jennifer Lawrence, a ball of passive-aggressive insecurity wrapped up in big hair and fake nails. She knows about his double-dealings, and has him by the you-know-what.<br/><br/>So too, does FBI agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper, sporting a very Brady perm), who nabs Irving and Sydney and employs them for a sting operation to catch congressmen taking bribes. What happens next cannot be revealed here. What has been revealed only serves as the set up. Each player has a role and must play his part, especially when part of the sting involves a meeting with a blood-thirsty gangster (Robert De Niro) who has skills they don't anticipate. De Niro is, of course, an old pro at these kinds of stories and brings a kind of scary tension to the proceedings.<br/><br/>The performances here are brilliant. Bale make his unattractive character work by means of quick thinking and experience at the con. Cooper comes in on the game and gets addicted to the thrill, even putting his own career on the line. Lawrence, as she did last year in Russell's ""Silver Linings Playbook"", shows a new side of herself as an unstable woman who comes into the game with a dangerous heir of unpredictability. At several points, she stands on the edge of blowing the whole deal.<br/><br/>But the best performance belongs to Amy Adams as a woman who understands the con game better than anyone else. You can always see her thinking, sizing people up, working the situation only moments before it is her turn at center stage. Moving from the persona of Sydney to Edith and back again, there are moments when we question whether she has forgotten which is real (are we being conned?). Adams' single best scene takes place in a quiet, almost whispered conversation as her two accents alternate in the same sentence. It is a remarkable moment that never feels like a stunt. It is worthy of another Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>What is refreshing is that the movie never feels slicked out. Everyone has a story and therefore has massive flaws. They are damaged people before the con starts and aren't improved once it gets underway. Russell makes us care about these people; otherwise the script would just be all mechanics. You like these people despite what they are doing. They are placed into a movie that moves and vibrates with color and madness. The irony, of course, is that while they are busy risking their lives to steal money, they only have to wait five years for the Wall Street boom of the 1980s and they could take it legally.<br/><br/>The soundtrack features songs from everybody from Donna Summer, to Duke Ellington to Steely Dan to Paul McCartney and Wings. The music plays as a Greek chorus, not just a period identifier. The music goads these disaffected people, all of whom are searching for something better, and are willing to risk their lives to get it.<br/><br/>**** (of four)"

Transported to New York/ New Jersey of the 70's the sound track brilliantly authenticates this movie, and serves as a perfect companion to the film. The set pieces, the wardrobe even the grittiness of the film itself reminds one of a movie straight out of the 70's Alluring and sexually charged in certain scenes as well as good points of humor to ease the tension.

","Print Page<br/><br/>David O. Russell out-Scorseses Martin Scorsese with ""American Hustle,"" a '70s crime romp that's ridiculously entertaining in all the best ways. ""American Hustle"" is actually a more thrilling and satisfying experience than Scorsese's latest, the upcoming ""The Wolf of Wall Street,"" which similarly was inspired by the true story of an irrepressible financial huckster. The unreliable narration and urgent zooms, the 1970s milieu of flashily dressed scampers and mobsters, the carefully chosen pop songs underscoring key emotional moments: all those recognizably Scorcesean signatures are there, yet Russell infuses them with his unique brand of insanity. This director has always has shown a fondness for characters who are on the brink of imploding or exploding, and with ""American Hustle"" he's assembled his own posse of stars from his last two films to serve as his personal acting troupe: Christian Bale and Amy Adams from 2011's ""The Fighter"" and Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence from ""Silver Linings Playbook."" But he's so skilled with these actors (despite reports of his exhausting methods of motivation on set), he not only finds a side to them we haven't seen in his previous films, he finds a side we haven't seen, period. Co-written with Eric Singer, Russell's latest is based on the Abscam sting operation of the late '70s and early '80s, in which a con artist helped the FBI catch members of Congress taking bribes. ""Some of this actually happened,"" a title card playfully informs us at the film's start, before Russell introduces us to the glorious sight of Bale's paunchy Irving Rosenfeld plastering a horrendous hairpiece onto his shiny dome. To play the swaggering Rosenfeld, the owner of a small chain of Long Island dry cleaners who makes his real money through fake art and fraudulent personal loans, Bale seemingly downed all that food he denied himself while shooting ""The Machinist"" and ""Rescue Dawn."" He meets his match at a pool party in Adams' Sydney Prosser, a scrappy young woman from Albuquerque with dreams of reinventing herself in high style. It's Sydney's idea to don a fake accent and take on the alter ego of the posh Lady Edith, a Londoner with elite banking connections—and in doing so, she kicks Rosenfeld's cons into high gear. (While all the choices from costume designer Michael Wilkinson are spot-on in their tacky period allure, Adams' ensembles are to-die-for: a plunging and sparkling array of sexy little numbers that help the actress assert her untapped VA-VA-wooziness.) Irving and Sydney quickly become partners in crime and love—but wait. Irving has a young son, and a wife: Lawrence's needy, vulnerable and spectacularly passive-aggressive Rosalyn (Lawrence). With her fake tan, high hair and vicious nails, Rosalyn is a force of nature. She knows just enough to be dangerous, which may make her an even bigger threat to Irving and Sydney than the federal authorities who are closing in on their operation. Her complexity and unpredictability make her fascinating to watch—she's just unhinged enough to think she's the voice of reason—and Lawrence is a radiant scene-stealer. Regardless of genre, it seems there's nothing this actress can't do. Cooper's Richie DiMaso is a hotheaded (and tightly permed) FBI agent who's eager to make a name for himself with a big bust. (Seriously, the hair is awful, almost as bad as Bale's; Russell even goes so far as to show Cooper wearing the itty-bitty curlers at the kitchen table. It's kind of adorable.) Richie exposes the lovers' scheme and forces them to help him net even bigger fish to get themselves out of trouble. But he also finds himself falling for the sexy Sydney—er, Lady Edith—and she may feel the same way. Or does she? Part of the fun of ""American Hustle"" is that it keeps us constantly on our toes wondering who's scamming whom. Russell doesn't judge any of these people for their idiocy or their aspirations. He revels in their quirks and foibles. The fact that Rosalyn is constantly on the verge of burning the house down, for example, ends up being endearing in Russell's hands. (Microwave ovens aren't for everyone.) We even end up feeling sympathy for Jeremy Renner as crooked Camden, N.J., Mayor Carmine Polito. He's a criminal, too: He's on the take and coaxes more powerful politicians to join him, all in the name of rejuvenating Atlantic City. Yet Renner makes us feel this gregarious family man's generosity, and the bromance that forms between him and Bale's character is actually sweet. Russell's film is big and big-hearted and more than a little messy, but that's apropos given the over-the-top characters, their insatiable greed and their brazen schemes. Sure, it looks like the cast went nuts at a Goodwill store and splurged on the grooviest duds they could find for an elaborate game of dress-up, but the clothes more than just a kitschy source of laughs: they're a reflection of their characters' ambition, a projection of their glittering notions of the American dream. The film is probably also a tad overlong, but it's a blast to hang out with these people, and Russell creates such an infectiously zany vibe around them that if even you notice the running time, you probably won't mind. For all its brashness and big personality, ""American Hustle"" is a character study at its core—an exploration of dissatisfaction and drive, and the lengths to which we're willing to go for that elusive thing known as a better life."
"whitly_12","9","1","6","13 January 2014"," A Surprisingly Great Movie
","I'll get this out of the way right now: I'm not the biggest fan of David O. Russell. Nothing against him personally, but, after having seen The Fighter and The Silver Linings Playbook, he just doesn't do it for me in general. The former was okay, while the latter crapped out with some dumb script contrivances in the third-act. He's like Quentin Tarantino: talented, but not my cup of tea. The only difference? Tarantino is too chatty and over-the-top, while O. Russell is overly blunt and melodramatic.<br/><br/>I say this because American Hustle genuinely surprised me. It's not the deepest movie by any means, nor is it the most profound, but it IS a well put-together film about how insignificant we really are in the grand scheme of things. Everyone is just trying to scrape by, even the incredibly ambitious, and denying that reality only makes your inevitable wake up call that much more disturbing. And this is what really makes the movie shine, even amidst the hilarity and shallowness that frequently goes on on-screen.<br/><br/>It's most likely that I'll end up being alone on this one, or perhaps in the minority, but this is one of my favourite movies of 2013. I found it more compelling than The Wolf of Wall Street, much funnier than Nebraska and even more of a well-written character piece than Saving Mr. Banks. I mean no disrespect to any of those movies, I liked all of them, but it was just no contest. I've been told that American Hustle will be forgotten in a year, but I say that it'll be more remembered than people give it credit for; after all, it has one of the greatest end- twists I've seen in the past decade! That has to account for something, right?<br/><br/>4.5/5..."

","New York City, 1978: Irving (Christian Bale) is a con man: cunning, smart enough and aware of how far he can go. In Sydney (Amy Adams) he has found a partner who can take his efficiency to the next level. Until FBI agent Richard (Bradley Cooper) turns up and threatens to bust their lucrative fraud business. So they agree to help him catch bigger fish so he can let them go. And off goes a ride that will see politicians busted, the mafia getting involved, relationships and marriages shattered, dreams destroyed and others transformed. In David O. Russell's film, everyone cons everyone else, he unleashes such a whirlwind of greed and hubris and treachery and sheer survival instinct that not only the viewer's head starts spinning but with it the entire film. The film is set in a grotesque 1970s universe that is absurdly exaggerated as it is atmospherically true. American Hustle is human comedy and Greek tragedy, brightly colored comic strip and panoramic tableau of an era, absurd caricature and warmly colored character tale. Everything is way over the top and down to earth, wildly ridiculous and stunningly realistic at the same time, a wild and colorful feast of a film that has the addictive power – and look – of an excellent narcotic, the embarrassingly inescapable pull of an orgy that goes way too far but which one cannot stop. Christian Bale is breath-taking as Irving, overweight, full of swagger and even fuller of fear, Cooper turns the ambitious out-of-control cop into a truly scary figure, Adams walks the thin line between deep vulnerability and excessive self-confidence. But the film's true miracle is Jennifer Lawrence as Irving' wife: desperate, hysterical, full of fear and a vague longing that explodes into one of the most screwed up characters in film history. American Hustle shows – and makes the audience feel – what happens when greed, personal desires and inferiority complexes react. It is like a weird psychedelic trip that leaves you confused.

","The con artist mentality – everyone is a sucker and the more you say NO to ""marks"", the more they want what you are selling; conversely everyone likes to play the film-flam game – that is the basic premise of David O. Russell's goofy, madcap new film American HUSTLE. And the Federal Government turns out to be the ultimate hustler in the ""idealistic"" pursuit of justice or ""entrapment""– a thin line that bends and sways depending on the ambitions of prosecutors. The word ""real"" is used in the dialogue over and over and over againdisguise is the norm – being ""real"" involves a rare moment of trust and exposure of your inner self which always reeks of a putrid scent, barely camouflaged by the fragrance of nectar that we employ as a shield of body armor.<br/><br/>This convoluted, crazily complex movie originated ""somewhat"" with a true story-the ABSCAM scandal of the 1970's. Understanding the source will help make sense of American HUSTLE, giving you the opportunity to relax and be entertained, without being distracted trying to puzzle out what is going on. ABSCAM was an FBI sting operation in the late 1970s and early1980s, initially trafficking in stolen property but later converted to a public corruption investigation. The FBI hired Melvin Weinberg, a convicted con man, to help plan and conduct the operation. ""Abscam"" was the FBI codename for the undertaking, because it involved Abdul Enterprises, Ltd., as its front company, using an FBI employee posing as Karim Abdul Rahman, a fictional Middle Eastern sheikh bribing targeted government officials in videotaped meetings. Suffice it to say Atlantic City and its burgeoning casino industry were in the mix, ultimately leading to the conviction of a United States senator, six members of the House of Representatives, one member of the New Jersey State Senate, members of the Philadelphia City Council, and an inspector for the Immigration and Naturalization Service.<br/><br/>Christian Bale (terrific) still handsome after gaining over 40 lbs playing the beer bellied mastermind and proud-of-it charlatan, Irving Rosenfeld (based on Abscam's Melvin Weinberg) who owns many dry-cleaning and window glass stores in the Bronx and Manhattan – all small time establishments fronting illegal loan activities. The movie opens with Irving fashioning his daily make-over on an elaborately funny and very serious comb-over – a source of pride and concealment before attending a cocktail party where he glances over and BAMMM sees a gorgeous Amy Adams who portrays the seductive, alabaster toned Sydney Prosser, and Irving Rosenfeld is hooked on the spot – meeting his match in brains and larceny. But this dame is a classy one, who has already ""masked"" her persona, and intuiting a fellow traveler responds to Christian Bale in kind. A love story is in the making, despite the fact that Irving is married to a surprisingly, (for me) wonderfully, eccentric, often inept, and unsuitable (to his chosen profession) wife, Rosalyn played by Jennifer Lawrence, who might be the most authentic person in American HUSTLER.<br/><br/>Adams and Bale join forces and become partners in crime, and business is soon flourishing until a wildly enterprising, tightly curled poodle cut, FBI undercover agent, Bradley Cooper (Richie DiMaso) shows up and snares them in his net. From then on our heroes are working for the impulsive, righteously manic, Cooper in order to stay out of jail.<br/><br/>And then the fun begins! Larger and more intricate schemes including Abscam (Arab scam) loom ahead. Passionate avidity blossoms as a Mafioso - a critical bit part by a barely recognizable Robert De Niro - gets enmeshed into the conspiracy. Despite harebrained shenanigans and lots of heedless bungling, and plot twists, the underlying romance perseveres, complicated by Christian Bale's hesitant equivocation concerning the age-old choice between wife and girlfriend. Another memorable character, a linchpin of the FBI shakedown operation - Jeremy Renner is startling as the oblivious, charismatic Mayor Carmine Polito of Camden NJ, complete with an Elvis-style mop of hair, and the only politician who actually cares and works for his constituents. He is the one genuinely tragic figure in this tale.<br/><br/>American HUSTLER is a complicated mosaic of cynicism, questions of credibility, legitimacy and the art of illusion tempting desire. The energetic soundtrack weaves through each scene punctuating the activity; passages are episodic - some hilarious and others predictable. Absurdity nesting in farce can be sublimethose resplendent moments appear and vanish like the hypothesis of the film itself."
"TheConnoisseurReviews","9","1","8","25 December 2013"," Jennifer Lawrence steals the show in this very entertaining flick
","""American Hustle"" is a pretty darn good, entertaining, and fun film. While I don't think it's director David O' Russell's best film, I still think it is his best directed. It is directed with a flashy style that really fits with the era of the movie. There are many over the top moments and exaggerated camera sweeps that really brings a lot of excitement on screen. The script is layered with hilarious dialogue and deeper meaning of living the ""American Dream"" than what is actually being presented on screen. However, I wish it did have more focus and a tighter story as it did feel like it was all over the place. The journey is also more satisfying than the actual conclusion.<br/><br/>The cast is great and the director really gets some amazing performances from the cast. Christian Bale, Amy Adams, and Bradley Cooper are great in their roles and play very dimensional characters. They make them come alive and their on-screen chemistry is great. However, the real stand-out in this star studded cast is Jennifer Lawrence, who doesn't have as much depth or screen time, but commands total attention on-screen. She embodies everything that the movie is going for by being over the top, zany, and full on entertaining. Every time she was off-screen, I kept on begging for more.<br/><br/>Overall, ""American Hustle"" is a really good movie that is equal parts entertaining and thought provoking. It never reaches any emotional highs and needs some focus, but David O' Russell's stylish direction, use of high energy music, and committed cast makes this movie something special. I give it 4.5/5"
"rollinthebank","9","1","8","25 December 2013"," My type of movie
","I do not understand any of the bad reviews overall it was the best movie i have seen in theaters since inglorious bastards. It was very well written and the acting was superb Jennifer Lawrence and Christian Bale should both be up for Oscars. I laughed and i loved the characters but most importantly the story line was perfect and original. Well done film that had depth and weight. The movie also got me to hate Bradley Coopers character which is not an easy thing to do because I am a huge fan. Easily the best movie of the year I believe it beats Gravity and Her but that being said you will have to see it yourself. I can not imagine anyone seeing this movie and being disappointed."
"maurice_yacowar","8","1","9","22 December 2013"," complex sting defines America as hustler
","With American Hustle David Russell counters F. Scott Fitzgerald's claim that in America there are no second acts. His major characters live out the American Dream that people can reinvent themselves, sometimes over and over, to the point that deceiving others can lead to their self-deception. This fictionalized version of the Abscam take-down reveals a world of Sammy Glicks. This is America as hustler.<br/><br/>The opening scene establishes the theme of deceptive appearance. Irving Rosenfeld (an himself transformed Christian Bale) laboriously engineers a pathetic combover. After this ridiculous introduction he grows into a very sympathetic character. Despite the range of his criminal enterprises, he cares for his adopted son, he's smart enough to fall for the smart con-woman Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams) and he has the conscience to try to save his new friend, the mayor Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner). The film redefines Irving from ridiculous to admirable — within the parameters of self-serving fraud. Even at his worst — preying on the desperate by commanding a five grand fee for the futile attempt to secure them a much larger loan — he remains more sympathetic than the greed-driven and impersonal banks of America.<br/><br/>Irving is also a more appealing character than the federal agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper), a working class loser with violent tendencies who goes manic trying to advance his career. Where Irving and Sydney remember who they are DiMaso fools himself through the schemes and deceptions he tries to command. His vanity and ambition are baser than Irving's and Sydney's desire to rise out of their limited origins. As Irving says, ""Did you ever have to find a way to survive and you knew your choices were bad, but you had to survive?"" We're satisfied that the lovers win and DiMaso loses. Irving and Sydney meet and first connect over their shared love of a blues song, but one without words, Ellington's Jeep's Blues. In the con's world words are less reliable than music.<br/><br/>DiMaso's vanity and superficiality (as in his curling his hair) aligns with Irving's wife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence). Where Irving and Sydney remake themselves ""from the feet up,"" i.e., intensely and completely, Rosalyn only remakes her image. She spends all her time doing her hair and her nails and frying under the sunlamp. At the end she achieves what she had refused — divorcing Irving — and settles in with a supposedly more devoted lover, the second-line mafiosa. At the end Irving and Sydney rewrite themselves again, as a couple, as parents of Rosalyn's son, and professionally legitimated as owners of — an art gallery, where the themes of crooked dealing, exploitation and the sale of an image over reality are likely to be renewed.<br/><br/>Like the intriguing characters in their various stings, Mayor Polito has made a political career out of hustling -- albeit for his constituents. The FBI here is itself implicated in the crooked hustle when DiMaso coerces our two chief cons into working for him, to con for the government. In the FBI there is one solid man of conscience and principle, played by the inveterate schnook Louis CK, when all his colleagues and superiors espouse the con. In an America that is all hustle, it is still possible for an honest person to survive — and for hustlers to define their own integrity. For more see www.yacowar.blogspot.com."
"FilmMuscle","9","1","9","22 December 2013"," American Splendor
","""Everyone hustles to survive,"" and that's the picture American Hustle's '70's quintessentially paints for the culture and mentality of America. Our very economic system encourages for loops to be taken as long as you secure those wads of cash, and, in the end, the easiest targets will receive the boot into a jail cell rather than the powerful and resourceful (the crooked and corrupt bankers and politicians who deserve to share a moniker with other criminals). Anyways, the whole concept is devoid of any sense of morality, and that essentially grooms Irving Rosenfeld (played by Christian Bale) and Sydney Prosser (played by Amy Adams) for the big leagues of scamming and reaping the riches. However, once they're finally caught by an FBI agent- Richie DiMaso (played by Bradley Cooper)- their sole responsibility is to catch a bunch of dirty politicians red-handed in bribery, and they're in charge of constructing the whole procedure. <br/><br/>There's no doubt that American Hustle gives off that ""Goodfellas"" vibe and is generally influenced by Scorsese's masterful work, but it also decides to incorporate even further playfulness. David O. Russell's signature style of directing in which he implements humor into the tensest or most dramatic of scenes returns. All throughout, I found myself confused if certain scenes were meant to be slightly funny or fully serious. Though I chuckled during some mainly parlous scenes that played out in a more outlandish manner (which instituted that element of humor), the majority of the theater room sat in silence. What I'm trying to say is that it's an incredibly fun ride. <br/><br/>First of all- and, in my opinion, most importantly- we witness some of the most brilliant, captivating, and intricate performances of this year from the likes of Christian Bale, Amy Adams, Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence, and Jeremy Renner- an all-star cast! Christian Bale, most evidently, remarkably strays from a recognizable appearance and instead sports an atrocious, but equally comical, haircut, an actual beer belly, and a Jersey accent. In sum, the guy transforms like no other. Moreover, all of these characters are granted their time to shine, and they all truly stand out with their own distinctive personalities. Russell means to emphasize this: it's all about the characters who glow with exuberance and complicacy. An abundance of fun is had by placing some of the most vibrant individuals into a complex predicament and then simply watching how they attempt to dig themselves out of such an extensive hole. Not only are we joyful at the sight of an obviously talented cast- not one stealing another's thunder- but we're also surprised by some brilliant- brilliant- cameos. The flamboyancy of these characters greatly stem from a terrific script that provides us with clever and hilarious dialogue. See, this cinematic wonder is so damn quotable as every other line carries amusement and farcicality with it. In addition, the intriguing narrative is serviced by an outstanding soundtrack, recalling the greatest '70's tunes (those violins are just daunting in 10538 overture- amazing track, by the way). <br/><br/>With that being said, the plot becomes a little confusing at times, especially at the beginning. The whole plan is so elaborate that the structure and details within moderately threw me off. One has to possess a somewhat clear idea of how the entire financial scamming business works in order to completely understand the more prominent events. A considerable amount of the confusion is thankfully removed as the story progresses and we hear Bale's explanative narration over the wild occurrences. Furthermore, the picture commences with noticeably slow pacing as we take the time to familiarize ourselves with the characters and their backgrounds. It definitely reminded me of Casino's fairly sluggish opening in which De Niro explains the multiple processes and conveys the nature of the crime-riddled environment we're about to be cast down into. Finally, when the scheme is set into motion, that's when the storyline picks up as we see the countless characteristics of these peculiar individuals make their mark. <br/><br/>Overall, American Hustle is an exceptional piece of cinema that delivers on what it promises. Normally, a predominantly nonviolent crime tale would feel strange and unfulfilling, but Russell knows exactly what he's doing here. With the help of superb and rich performances from A-list actors, this crime drama feels fun, suspenseful, risible, and impeccably crafted (considering the sublime costumes and the impressively effective presentation of the 70's)."
"griffolyon12","8","1","9","21 December 2013"," Not Perfect, But Well Made
","Director David O. Russell's new film, American Hustle, may not be Russell's best film, but he has clearly hit a stride in his career. American Hustle tells the inspired by a true story of a group of con artists in the late Seventies, coerced by the FBI to help them bring down crooked politicians. Like most films like these, the plot is labyrinthine, often hard to keep up with, and thusly has a few plot holes for such reasons. <br/><br/>Here's the thing, American Hustle is a well made, well acted film with some of Russell's trademark quirkiness creating laughs here and there, but the characters never become likable. These characters are all fairly deplorable and I'd be hard pressed to find anyone who'd honestly enjoy spending time with these people. With that said, Russell is at the top of his game in his shot design, further expanding upon the visual ideas of The Fighter and Silver Linings Playbook with this outing, then there are the performances. While Amy Adams' constant slipping in-and-out of her faux British accent kind of grinded on me after a while, Christian Bale with his beer gut and combover is phenomenal, and Jeremy Renner shines in each scene he is in as a New Jersey Mayor. <br/><br/>As a fan of filmmaking and good acting, I enjoyed American Hustle, but this is not a film that I will find myself revisiting due to the lack of emotional connection with anyone in this film. Plus, if you're going to make a film about con artists, as the filmmakers you have to be able to con the audience and deceive us with every twist and turn, and unfortunately this film did not, with most major surprises seen on the horizon at least two or three scenes before revealed. If you really want to see a con artist film that literally cons the audience, watch The Sting.<br/><br/>I give American Hustle an 8 out of 10!"
"dfle3","7","1","9","17 December 2013"," Dry, arch comedy with a straight face. 72.5+%
","The basic story in this movie is relatively straightforward...a couple of con artists (Christian Bale as Irving Rosenfeld and Amy Adams as Sydney Prosser) are nabbed by an ambitious F.B.I. Agent (Bradley Cooper as Richie DiMaso) who promises not to charge either of them so long as they can help him catch bigger criminals by using their skills as con artists. Irving and Sydney agree to this...Irving's wife Rosalyn (played by Jennifer Lawrence) isn't really privy to all of Irving's activities...illegal or adulterous. The start of the movie informs the viewer that ""some"" of the movie is based on actual events. Presumably accuracy hasn't been kept at the expense of good fun.<br/><br/>During the movie I frequently laughed out loud as the situation went from bad to worse for Irving and Sydney, or the stupidity of Rosalyn later in the movie (Lawrence shows a talent for character based comedy in this movie). Despite this humour, the movie did strike me as being a dialogue driven piece...a wall of dialogue. It's also 138 minutes long...putting those two things together, it was quite demanding of your attention, perhaps at the expense of just providing pure entertainment. It's not exactly intellectually taxing, just demanding of your attention. Even though I don't usually watch movies again, the thought of watching this movie again due to its demanding nature made me think that I wouldn't want to do that again in a hurry. I'd have to wait a decade, maybe. The way the characters relate to each other perhaps has a 'Brooklyn' vibe to it. Maybe some people might find that taxing too.<br/><br/>A way that the movie attempts to keep you intrigued is by making you question the motives of the various players...are Irving and Sydney using each other? What is real? Where does the con begin and end? Who's conning whom? This may provide pleasure for some as a viewing experience.<br/><br/>Can't say that I knew how to interpret this movie...initially I missed the introduction explaining that it was partly based on a true story. Without that knowledge, I was wondering whether the movie was a comment on the Hollywood factory (e.g. Bale putting on the bat costume, pretending to be a superhero as a kind of con) or a metaphor for the American dream...in the guise of reinventing oneself to reach higher...if that is indeed the American dream...I'm Australian...I don't know these things. If the latter, maybe that has something in common with the novel ""The great Gatsby"", which is regarded as a classic in America and has also been turned into a movie...multiple times. Would still be inclined to think that on some level this movie is 'saying something' about the American experience, beyond merely fictionalising a true story.<br/><br/>Another thing that struck me was how often the look of the characters reminded me of other people in movies or TV or real life. E.g. when I caught the start of the movie, with Irving elaborately doing his hair, I was reminded of Tom Cruise in ""Tropic thunder"", I think it was; Jeremy Renner as Carmine Polito reminded me of a young Liberace perhaps...or that kind of Teddy Boy look...if that is the right phrase; Louis C.K. as Stoddard Thorsen reminded me of Bill Bailey (the English comedian); one guy kind of reminded me of a young Michael Douglas; there's one mob guy who kind of had a George Clooney in ""O brother, where art thou?"" look to him (that I don't remember these character's names just reflects on how demanding of your attention this movie is); Bradley Cooper in one scene (or two) reminds me of Kevin Kline's turn in ""A fish called Wanda"". Sort of related, perhaps Bale channels Gandolfini as Tony Soprano in his performance at times. Jennifer Lawrence sort of reminded me of Renée Zellweger in her looks at times...but maybe that's just me?<br/><br/>Speaking of self-referential moments...I got the feeling that a member of the crew had the same surname as the lawyer who appears in the end of the movie...something like ""Tellegio""...if that is the case, perhaps it's a sort of in-joke or something? Maybe there's more of that too?<br/><br/>There is some good 1970s music etc. in this movie but it's not quite in the same league as ""Boogie nights"" on that front, which was stacked with the kind of songs I love from that era.<br/><br/>""American hustle"" is a true ensemble work and I suppose in a year in which no particular movie or performance has screamed ""Award!"" to me, the extra yards Christian Bale has put in to perform his role (putting on a lot of weight, by the looks of it...assuming it's not a fat suit), he'd be as worth a winner of a Best Actor award as anyone else. In other movies of his I've seen it occurred to me that he was often overshadowed by minor characters in star vehicles for him, like The Dark Knight (Heath Ledger's brilliant turn as the Joker) and Terminator: Salvation (Sam Worthington's character Marcus Wright was more interesting than John Connor). It's perhaps ironic that Bale may win an Oscar in a movie/character which isn't a 'star vehicle' for him. Unlike Batman, Irving is an interesting character...more filling and nutritious, acting chops wise than the caped crusader.<br/><br/>One last thingthe endingI did wonder if the film took a morally dubious stance on the targets DiMaso was chasingi.e. not sure that I share those sentiments."
"phd_travel","8","1","10","26 December 2013"," A showcase of fine acting - story could have been slightly clearer
","This rewarding true story of two con artists in the70s who are forced to assist the FBI is enjoyable and worth watching for the terrific performances Christian Bale gives a convincing accent and performance with his scary toupee. His partner in crime is played by Amy Adams who is given a racy role to show of her versatility as an actress and she looks stunning. Her low cut dresses were a bit overdone though. Jennifer Lawrence is very funny as the idiot wife. Bradley Cooper is alright but his role isn't that demanding.<br/><br/>The only minus point is that I got lost a couple of times in the latter third of the movie. The narrative could have been clearer. With such a complicated plot it helps to not break up the continuity and explain things a bit."

","Martin is getting old..but his work is still incredible. One of my fav. film of all time is Goodfellas and this movie matched it in it's pace/acting/story. Movies that stay with us weeks after watching it are very rare. I can still remember almost every scene in the 1990 flick. The running time seems very long on paper but the over 2 hour time line leaves you wanting more. The acting with Bale vs.de niro and cooper vs. liotta...can't be overstated. Bale steps out of his batman character and into a whole new persona. Amazing acting throughout and the over the top Oscar performance of Jennifer..and you have an instant classic. Is it as good as goodfellas?...no..but you'll enjoy the ride."
"johngreen-4","2","0","2","14 June 2020"," Great costumes and period piece sets but where's the plot?
","I got hustled and so did critics! I think critics were enamored with this movie's period piece sets, costumes and music which admittedly are exceptional. The plot however is terrible and isn't that really the foundation of any good film? I was amazed that this star-studded cast was able to make something of this film despite terrible screen-writing which is why I gave it 2 stars!<br/><br/>I usually have no trouble staying focused on slow moving films, but this one set a new bar - a low bar. Some action would have made up for its subpar plot, but even that wasn't in this film. Or some cleverness like in the Oceans movie series (which are admittedly over-rated) would have helped salvage this film. But that wasn't here either!<br/><br/>My best advice - if you haven't seen this highly nominated (and awarded) film yet; pass it up and find something else with a good plot, some action or some clever dialogue to pass the time."

","American Hustle directed by David O. Russell (The Fighter, Silver Linings Playbook) is a comedy-drama inspired by the real life events referred to as Abscam Scandal which happened in the late 1970s in USA when an FBI sting operation resulted in the conviction of several corrupt politicians including six Congressmen, a Senator and a Mayor.<br/><br/>Christian Bale plays Irving Rosenfield, pot bellied, pill-popping middle aged businessman who runs a of dry cleaning chain. However, he is actually conman and mints his money through fake art deals and hoodwinking people desperate for money with false promises of loans. He is trapped in a loveless marriage to the unstable Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence) and whose son, Danny, he had adopted. He meets his match in the smart Sydney Posser (Amy Adams), an ex-stripper and present day clerk at the Cosmopolitan magazine with soaring ambitions to reinvent herself. Mutual attraction gradually leads to a rollicking partnership when she suggests that she could assume the identity of Lady Edith Greensly, with a fake English accent and ""connections"" to London banks. The two thrive in mutual company and live the high life till they are trapped by the zealous FBI agent Richard Di Masso (Bradley Cooper). When Di Masso throws them an offer of immunity if they aid in arrest of four big league criminals, Irving and Edith/Sydney hesitantly agree to it. They try to entrap the popular Mayor Carmen Polito (Jeremy Renner) who is desperate for funds to rekindle the economy of Atlantic City. The stakes are raised higher with the involvement of the mob, the resultant involvement of some Congressmen whom Di Masso want to entrap, the growing unease between Irving and Edith/Sydney, Di Masso's growing feelings for Edith/Sydney and the edgy, unpredictable Rosalyn who is hovering around the scene like a gathering storm.<br/><br/>Will Irving and Edith/Sydney succeed in fulfilling their end of the deal ? Would Di Masso emerge the hero for netting the big fish ? Does he forge an emotional connect to Edith/Sydney ? And, what role would Rosalyn play in all this ? The rest of the movie navigates us through this murky waters as these characters try to con each other (& themselves) in a roller coaster ride with loads of fun, witty dialogue, authentic 70s setting and some really well chosen songs that accompany the tense proceedings.<br/><br/>
While Silver Linings Playbook was evidence enough that David O. Russell is a master of creating complex characters that connect to the viewers, in American Hustle, he weaves sheer magic with an ensemble of such quirky characters played by a stellar cast. He has carefully chiseled out each character with a clear set of chinks and eccentricities which make them very human and enables the viewer to emotionally invest in them.<br/><br/>Given such well written characters, it is but natural that the A-list stars that inhabit them revel in their respective roles. While his mastery in physical transformations is legendary, Christian Bale is simply superb as the tense conman who is apprehensive of the dangers involved in a high-stakes con and desperate to save his family and his love. Matching him every bit is a smouldering Amy Adams revelling in a complex character as she oozes sex appeal in her plunging necklines, fakes an English accent and alternates effortlessly between emotions whether when being hopelessly in love or her desperation for reinventing herself or her frustration on being cornered. Bradley Cooper plays the hot-headed over-ambitious FBI agent out to make a name for himself with elan and Jeremy Renner is good as the well-meaning Mayor. Robert De Niro leaves a lasting impression in a small role as a mob enforcer.<br/><br/>Yet, it is Jennifer Lawrence who steals the show in a cameo as the feisty, unstable Rosalyn who feels frustrated with a marriage in shambles and craves for love and attention. As a loose cannon who could derail the carefully mounted con at any moment, she brings an intensity to a role which could have easily been a caricature. All of 23 years old, this talented lady is already a winner of Academy Award winner and stands a good chance to win another one this year for Best Supporting Actress. She has loads of talent and I may not be exaggerating if I say that she could well be the emerging as the Sachin Tendulkar of her art.<br/><br/>David O. Russell, in mounting this delectable entertainer on a large pitch-perfect period canvas, appears to have finessed his mastery in presenting memorable features populated by volatile characters. He has presented us a winner here that is already a front runner at the Academy Awards with a clutch of nominations after having won several at the other award shows.<br/><br/>EXCELSIOR, indeed !! An exhilarating experience that is sure to leave the viewers look forward impatiently for his next !!"

","Man oh man,this must be one of the most hilarious con stories. I truly applaud the writers, who based this terrific plot on real events. During the opening scenes of this movie one can read a statement saying: ""Some of this actually happened"". And it did. Christian Bale's character was loosely based on Melvin Weinberg, an international con artist and informant, and his girlfriend Evelyn Knight, who both helped plan and conduct a FBI sting operation. These 2 con artists were both facing a prison sentence at the time (the seventies) and in exchange for their help, the FBI agreed to let them out on probation.<br/><br/>The plot is genius, but wait until you hear the dialogues! These dialogues are what makes American Hustle such a hilarious thrill to listen to over and over again, because rarely ever before have I heard such absurd, hilarious, yet still true to life dialogues, that are just to die for. One line after the other is just sheer joy to listen to.<br/><br/>I must applaud the acting as well. How could I not applaud that! Robert de Niro has a very small ghost part in this movie. One of his most perfect and creepy roles ever! But no credits at the endtitles for his performance! NONE. They sneaked De Niro in...and he is scary as hell. Christian Bale, Amy Adams and Jennifer Lawrence reach the stars with their performances which are so incredibly funny, but still so believable and adorable at the same time. Director David O Russel proves with this movie again that he definitely is the new born director star of the new American cineman. After ""The Fighter"" and ""Silver Lining Playbook"" he hits the jackpot again with ""American Hustle"" in which Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper both star again.<br/><br/>Everything is perfect in this movie. Everything. American Hustle has won dozens of awards around the world, won golden globes and got 10 oscar nominations. I have seen this flick now a dozen times or so and I still enjoy it as much as the first time. American Hustle is truly up there with the modern classics. It is a feast for the eye, because of the hilarious, yet serious acting performances, portrayed onto the silver screen with mesmirising photography and cutting edge editing, based on a fantastic seventies soundtrack. The story is simply to die for. Genius. And you wont stop laughing. I am in movie heaven. Sheer Brilliance !"

","The mesmerising Christian Bale, as always, gives his very best to his role. The talented Amy Adams also does her best with a limited role.
But I continue to be disappointed by the new breed of Hollywood ""A-listers"" including the congenitally awful Lawrence and one dimensional Cooper. Why do these two keep being cast in films? Why do they have fans? Lawrence in this role feels like a student hamming it up (badly) in a school play and, as usual, almost ruins the film for me. Cooper adds nothing but irritation and the occasional cringe. The film had potential but it needed a better cast of actors to bring the film to a higher level."

"OliviaMessier","7","0","3","21 January 2017"," Great film, needs an alternate cut
","This is a great film with a really interesting story, a wealth of characters and story lines; it has great acting, chemistry between actors and is completely unpredictable.<br/><br/>There is no way anyone could predict what would happen next, because they keep ""changing the rules,"" shifting goalposts and finding new targets, using previous targets as bait.<br/><br/>The problem with this film is the long sequences of music at the start of the film that add nothing but tell us ""it's in the 70's"" - montages that accelerate the story with music playing in the background are fine, but not just mood setting scenes. There were scenes were the characters were listening to music and talking about it - that's just a waste of time.<br/><br/>I think a lot of people got bored at the start of the film because of the music sequences and once they get in that mood, there's no coming out. That slow start sours the rest of the film, which is filled with mystery, drama and comedy.<br/><br/>The music, for those who don't like 70's music, can be grating. Between the music playing in the background, montages, people playing music, Rosalyn singing at home while cleaning, big band playing during a dinner event, the music really starts to get to you. <br/><br/>I'm only a fan of some 70's music and I think it would've been better to have 70's inspired music than actual 70's music. Listening to the McCartney's, The Bee Gees, Santana, Elton John, etc. gets really boring after a while. You know all those films that play Deep Purple's Hush? This is one step away from that. There's a ton of 70's inspired music out there, which would be a breath of fresh air rather than play tired old songs that we've all grown sick and tired of.<br/><br/>I don't think an alternative cut would change the soundtrack, but at least it would cut the fat from this film.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, this is a good film. With some editing and trimming I'd even give it an 8."
"westcoastryda5","6","0","1","6 December 2016"," Not that good
","This movie is... OK but not so good. The plot itself is good and at times it is funny and entertaining but overall it lacks depth and seems to be lost in a limbo between comedy and drama without reaching the level of coherence and fluidity of other great movies and TV shows of its genre. <br/><br/>The movie begins at medium pace and appears as though it's going to pick up, but never really does. It basically crawls throughout the movie and at the end it finally sprints toward the finish line. I usually enjoy Jennifer Lawrence's performances, but in this movie I IMO, she was a little outside of her comfort zone. Somehow I feel as though she overacts and underacts at the same time. She's trying too much in an inconsistent matter that end up looking half awkward and not very genuine. Kind of like an SNL impersonation skit where it is done purposely and ironically in the context of a comical skit. <br/><br/>Other than that, the other Character performances were good, I almost forgot that Christian Bale is also the batman. Finally, Louis C.K in a ""serious"" role was interesting as a reminder that the movie (and life in general?) shouldn't be taken too seriously."

Bunch of movies has been made about con artists and mainly they are better than this one. The movie is interesting, but mediocre. Leading four really did a good job. In my opinion, in this movie, Jennifer did not deserve to be nominated for Oscar, but Bale, Adams, and Cooper nailed it.

"fluturoj","6","0","2","4 September 2016"," Eye-opening
","I found the movie to be a very good reflection of real life in terms of complexity of personalities. <br/><br/>The real-life lessons: don't ever believe someone so easily just because they say so. It it incredible how fast characters in this movie believed the others just because they said so. They believed false characters as for example they believed the actor was the lawyer or the sheikh just because someone said they are. They believed someone had connections to London just because they said they did. They believed someone was telling the truth about an investment opportunity just because they said they knew someone in their neighbourhood. We, in real life also do this every single day. It is quite frightening to see how easily we could be scared, lied, investigated. It reminds you that there are people out there that know this and take advantage of your trust. It is very easy to say to someone I am this and this person. If you do it, they can't easily verify that and if they do it you can't verify that. Another thing, don't touch crime. If you don't touch it you don't leave evidence no matter what you say. An example that actions speak louder than words even when it comes to justice processes (even though you get sentences even for just speaking as we saw). And finally, the small fishes are always the first to be caught and the first to go and sometimes the only ones. And also Richie DiMaso's failed attempt to get on papers and be huge shows that when you get blinded by goal so that you become cruel (blackmailing people into working for you, beating your boss) to achieve it, you get humbly reminded by karma that that is not the way to get it<br/><br/>Character development: amazed. The characters are externally strong all grey not just white or black with the exception of the mayor that came across as so innocent and white that was ready to commit crimes so that his community develops."
"jake-law123","7","0","2","6 June 2016"," Slightly over-hyped, yet still one entertaining piece.
","Knowing David O Russell's style, I knew going into this that I was going to have to deal with some over the top quirkiness in the characters and style, which I can usually tolerate in his films. On one hand, he handles his actors extremely well with top notch directing and handles his script very carefully as well. On the other hand, he lets his style slip out of his hands and spill out all over the screen in an over abundance of random bantering from characters, and depraved scenes of sexual frustration that get played off as comedic.<br/><br/>Christian Bale and Amy Adams are two con artists who are forced by an FBI agent (Bradley Cooper) to set up an elaborate sting operation on corrupt politicians, including the mayor of Camden, New Jersey (Jeremy Renner). Meanwhile, he has to deal with his estranged wife (Jennifer Lawrence) who constantly gets in the way of his plans. I was invested because this is the first time David O Russell has tackled crime drama. He still manages to blend black comedic undertones with the colorful, sporadic writing on the surface.<br/><br/>The casting and performances are probably the film's biggest strong suit. Christian Bale is hilarious and convincingly serious at the same time. Anytime he's on screen, he squeezes every last drop of investment into his character that the scene calls for, and it pays off. When he gets upset, angry, or scared, you really see it on his face. In a film like this that's really flashy, it's amazing how much emotion he displays while the audience is getting energized by the soundtrack. Amy Adams is sexy and deceitful, which we get out of every single scene she's in. Bradly Cooper is quickly becoming one of the most promising actors in this day in age. He is unpredictable in every scene he's in, but he manages to keep it straight and real at the same time. Jennifer Lawrence is unstoppable, portraying yet another emotionally distressed woman with husband problems, and no filter on her mouth. The only thing I wasn't sure about was the random Robert De Niro cameo.<br/><br/>One main issue I do have with the film is that the style, while entertaining, distracts from the plot. I usually encourage this behavior from Russell in previous works, but this time it left me a tad overwhelmed. It hammered itself in scenes that were completely unnecessary. The film went on a tad too long, and definitely could have trimmed some scenes that were needlessly thrown in there for stylistic purposes. The writing is solid, but the quirky character trope just throws me off at times and makes it hard to focus.<br/><br/>Overall, the film really energizes and excites you in each scene, making for one very entertaining film. I feel like a few people love the flashy style, which I can appreciate, even if it distracts a little. For that reason, I find it a tad over hyped, but not enough to take away any enjoyment. Russell is getting more mainstream, which is showcasing in his films. I just hope it doesn't get to his head, and I look forward to what he can do in the future."

","For me, J Law's acting talent stole the show. I saw her in 'Silver Linings' and the first 'Hunger Games' a while back, so again I didn't have any real preconception of what she would be like. But in this movie, her acting was just on another level. Every scene she was in carried so many emotions, and you'd couldn't tell if she was going to explode at any point (a'la the bathroom scene with Sydney). The things her character gets herself into in this film, even while she's still at home, are just out right slap your knee hilarious, especially the argument scenes. <br/><br/>Direction was a large positive for this. The way the camera moves is so subtle yet so effective. There are a lot of clichés that it could have fallen into, but O' Russell was very clever, and everything about the way he directed it was planned out perfectly. The camera seems to interact with the characters emotions, so you're really seeing this on more than one level."

Why? Well, because it just doesn't have what it takes to support repeated viewings.<br/><br/>An impressive cast puts on an equally impressive performance for sure. And just if anyone is in doubt, yes, it is Christian Bale who outshines everyone in the movie with his particular performance. But it was also interesting to see Bradley Cooper in a role such as the one he had in ""American Hustle"".<br/><br/>It is a rather long movie, but it does provide enough entertainment for the entire 132 minutes that it is running.<br/><br/>""American Hustle"" is well-worth watching for the performances, characters and dialogue alone."

","It is 1978 and conman Irving Rosenfeld has been forced to help the FBI set up a sting against a New Jersey mayor who wants to see casinos developed in Atlantic City. After this brief introduction the action jumps back some time and we see Irving meeting his business partner/ mistress Sydney Prosser. They work their cons together until Sydney is caught in an FBI sting by agent Richie DiMaso; he gives them a choice; either they work with him to entrap much bigger players or she goes to jail. DiMaso's boss isn't keen on his operation; especially when he starts going after senior politicians, the mob and requests large sums of FBI money to impress their targets. If this wasn't enough Irving's wife is somewhat unstable and he isn't happy when Sydney gets close to DiMaso.<br/><br/>The opening scene introduces protagonist Irving perfectly; we see him walking around with his paunch on show and rather bald; he then proceeds to glue a hairpiece on and carefully sculpt his remaining hair about it; he is clearly vain and a phoney. This leads to a quick and effective introduction to the other main characters and the situation. The cast which is loaded with big name actors such as Christian Bale, Bradley Cooper, Amy Adams, Jennifer Lawrence and Jeremy Renner do a great job making the story believable. There are plenty of amusing moments but there is also a sense of danger once our protagonists start getting involved with the mob. The '70s time period was nicely captured with clothes and hair that came close to parodying the era; seeing Bradley Cooper with rollers in his hair and sporting a 'Medallion Man' look was hilarious and the necklines of Amy Adams' dresses plunged to a level that bordered in indecent when people say the '70s were 'The decade that taste forget' they meant this sort of look!"
"bryank-04844","6","0","1","22 August 2015"," 'American Hustle' is one hell of a spectacle on the big screen, and while it may lack meaning and depth, it sure is a lot of fun to watch.
","Formally titled 'American Bulls**t', director David O. Russell has generated a lot of buzz for this film over the last few months. Coming off his Oscars for 'Silver Linings Playbook' and 'The Fighter', you might think 'American Hustle' might be on par with his previous two films. While this movie is indeed great, it lacks any sort of depth or meaning that Russell has embraced in his previous efforts. But what he lacks in depth and meaning, he makes up ten fold in acting, characters, and insanity. I have no doubt that this 1970's comedy con-artist film will wow audiences with its comedy and sex appeal, but don't expect a ""think piece"" here. With tons of other choices this holiday season, it's difficult to say how this will do at the box office, but with an A-List cast and the amount of hype this has, I imagine decent returns.<br/><br/>Russel and Eric Warren Singer wrote the script to this film that plays out a little like 'Goodfellas' and 'Boogie Nights', and is a very fictionalized account of the Abscam scandal by the FBI on big politicians in the 70s and 80s. Before the film starts, there is a title card that says, ""Some of this actually happened"", which garnered quite a few laughs. Instead of getting a boring look at the real sting operation in a film, Russel decided to write over-the-top characters and some hilarious incidents to spice up this story. Hell, the first 5 minutes of the film is literally Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale) combing his remaining dozen hairs in an epic comb over and applying glue for a wig.<br/><br/>Instead of diving into the ins and outs of the particulars of this Abscam case, Russell goes head first into the bizarre characters he has created and all of their flaws. The con artists are everywhere here. The police, FBI, and are main characters who are Irving and Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams), duo who are in cahoots, swindling people out of money and art. They are so successful at it, they have a legitimate business office and make tons of money. Irving and Sydney are even lovers, but Irving is also married to Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence) and has a young son. Rosalyn is one of the funniest characters put on screen this year and Lawrence gives her and this movie so much life as she makes everything about her and would even go so far as to say she is responsible for all the good things in life.<br/><br/>However, FBI agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper) arrests Sydney and Irving, and instead of putting them in jail for years, forces them to do a con job to take out corrupt politicians. And we're not talking about rape or murder corrupt type of stuff, we are talking about taking money from big investors to fix their turbulent city and make it better during the 70s. Thus, the long con is set in motion with each player conning everyone else, and quite possible the audience. The big mark here is Mayor Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner), who is a great man, who doesn't do anything illegal until DiMaso, Irving, and Prosser basically force him to take money from a fake noble Sheik.<br/><br/>Every actor shines here with Bale playing an overweight and balding character who struggles with his two lives and situation he is forced into. Adams is simply amazing and truly cons us all from start to finish. Seeing Renner is a great 70s wig and his swagger as a politician is quite epic as well. And Cooper here is just magnificent, and is a manic and deeply desperate man who is trying to get on anyone's radar. His commitment to this role is just amazing. Louis C.K., Jack Huston, and Michael Pena all turn in hilarious performances.<br/><br/>Russell uses his camera much like an early Scorsese in this film as we twirl and waltz through this fun move. 'American Hustle' is one hell of a spectacle on the big screen, and while it may lack meaning and depth, it sure is a lot of fun to watch. The soundtrack is killer here as well."

I loved the music, art direction, costumes, and actors but I found the writing to be weak and confusing tone as a viewer. I didn't know what was going I some of the time. Jeremy Renner's Carmine Polito is actually a likable person despite his shady corrupt side. My biggest problem was that the agent and Rosenfeld look so much alike. I often confused Bale and Cooper in their roles. They just look too much alike. I felt Jennifer Lawrence was miscast as Rosalyn Rosenfeld.

The majority of characters were played with a huge amount of talent. Jennifer Lawrence, tho i thought the casting was weird, really did a great job at pulling of a psychotic woman. She frightened me.

","Director David O. Russell brings life to this crime-dramedy based on a real-life scandal that took place in New York in the late 70s and early 80s. American Hustle features a stellar cast of Christian Bale, Amy Adams, Bradley Cooper, Jeremy Renner, Jennifer Lawrence, and Louis C.K. The plot follows Irving Rosenfield (Christian Bale) and Sydney Prosser, a duo of con-artists who are unexpectedly dragged by FBI agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper) into an operation against corrupt government officials, including Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner), mayor of Camden, New Jersey. Jennifer Lawrence plays Rosalyn Rosenfield, the eccentric wife of Irving Rosenfield, who gets involved in a love triangle between her and Sydney Prosser. Louis C.K. plays Stoddard Thorsen, Richie DiMaso's boss. While all the characters are fictional, most of them are based on the real-life people that were involved in the events this film follows.<br/><br/>American Hustle is an enchanting and beautifully written film, David O. Russell does a magnificent job on bringing a story of political corruption to life. As the film goes on, the plot moves very well and steady, and propels with some darkly funny moments and solid dialogue from its talented cast. However, I can't say that was fully entertained by the story. The story does have its moments of complexities that fall somewhat incoherent. Fortunately, the plot never loses its energy. Eventually the story reaches a point where everything starts make sense and gives viewers the opportunity to grasp a stronger understanding. Aside from this, the characters and performances is made what really make the film shine. Christian Bale puts on an amazing performance as Irving Rosenfield. The immense effort Bale latches on to prepare for this role is something of true astonishment, by gaining forty pounds and maintaining a flabby physique, very opposite to the method acting technique he used in 'The Machinist' when he lost an absurd amount of weight to play an insomniac machine operator. Amy Adams is also impressive in her role, probably her best role in her career. Bradley Cooper does well as the FBI agent, sporting a rare 70s curly hairstyle to resonate with the story's setting. Jennifer Lawrence's performance is definitely the best out of all. Her character was quite interesting because how unpredictable she was and her eccentric personality. Her character was very similar in some ways to her character in Silver Lining Playbook (2012), which won her an Oscar for Best Actress. These actors demonstrate some engaging chemistry between each other, and show great appeal to what viewers can describe as ""charming"".<br/><br/>American Hustle maybe one of 2013's best films. The film presents brilliant performances, great story, and an incredible production design. I am quite surprised this film didn't win any Oscars, although it was nominate for ten. This film is probably the high point of the most of the actors' and actresses' career."

It almost makes me ask if some of these people have seen more than two or three movies before, or have only now just noticed that movie script writing is far and away the lowest ""art form"" ever endured by any culture, before we start.<br/><br/>Neither The Godfather nor Goodfellas broke new ground in any sense. Indeed, they both relied upon deeply instilled pre-existing notions and stereotypes, including just a sprinkling of reality when convenient to the story. Pandering, patronizing, catering to the basest of 'instincts,' all wrapped up in a neat package (excellent directing and cinematography on a completely banal story, the Hollywood way). And I'm not sure if any movies were more 'self indulgent' than those two.<br/><br/>I'm not saying that this movie matches those two or other likewise ventures in grandeur, but it does have at least some semblance of an ""Indie"" treatment of the matter. Of course the movie is not ""perfect"" in telling the very non-simplified story at hand; there's no way that it -could- be. I don't see how one could tell a story as messy as this one with out the presentation itself being a bit 'messy' in some respects. (If you want grossly over simplified with fantastic production and classic actors, see reference in second paragraph above).<br/><br/>I have no complaints as to the acting (at least not much). Christian Bale seems to always be put in an acting role about half a notch 'above his level,' but by the end of the movie we (or some of us, at least) think it turned out just about right. Same here. Amy Adams and Jennifer Lawrence were pretty darned good, indeed fantastic sometimes, so much as the script and story allowed. Both were a great strength to the movie, stole scenes as opportunity presented, etc., no question.<br/><br/>I have some gripes about the script writing, as always, but given the subject matter and the era being presented, I (and I hope that others) cannot overlook the fact that the women in this movie were far better represented and given a lot more credit in having more than two brain cells than in the much more popular 'Mafia standard' movies. The instance of Rosenfeld's wife (J Lawrence) explaining to him that she had started reading Wayne Dyer's books, so now they had to get a divorce, made me keel over, actually. But what mattered is that she took a notion to improve herself, and had gained a notion of an independent self at all, not a popular notion in that milieu.<br/><br/>It used to be so simple; ""you marry my money, I marry your body,"" and now (in this movie) both parties come to the late conclusion that there's more to it than that, by both meeting new acquaintances and (in the case of the wife) actually reading books. Yes, by a (at the time) ""new age Guru."" But if she started reading books at all, she would have eventually moved beyond that. The salient point is that she ventured out beyond her ""I'm so afraid of change"" world at all.<br/><br/>Sorry for all the disappointment to others who started out with the intent of ""trying to be generous"" in inappropriately assigning the task of this film as being a follow up of any sort to the mafia classics, but there's a lot in this movie you missed out on in pursuit of that folly."

","This is one of those movies that really shows you what the actors involved are capable of. If this movie wasn't full with already established actors it would've been a career making movie. The cast is INSANELY good and I think that's where people split about whether or not they like this movie or not. If you're interested in this movie for the story you might be a little disappointed. It's ALL about the characters. <br/><br/>The idea of a con man is very interesting and can make a good ""Look at how awesome this guy is"" kinda movie. That's not what this is. Again it's ALL about the characters. Christian Bale gives us a real person. It's not the typical slick guy that looks suspicious from a mile away but still gets away with everything. It's all about survival. Amy Adams is phenomenal. All this little things she does remind me of a Meryl Streep performance and her beautiful eyes are made for cinema. Bale's character and Amy Adams character match like chocolate and peanut butter. They might be my favorite couple I ever saw in a movie. They work together so well, understand each other and they're both MASTERS in the art of bullshit. At one point they get cornered by Bradley Cooper's character. This is where the survival part shines. How will they use there skills to get out of this. How far will they go? <br/><br/>The movie is loosely based on the real FBI sting operation called ABSCAM in the late 70's early 80's. I can picture people being drawn to this movie just for that reason. I hope that those people can accept the fact that this is a fictionalization instead of a adaptation and enjoy the movie for the work of art it is. I was drawn to this by the director (David O. Russel) and great actors involved. It's rare in a movie with GREAT lead characters (Bale and Adams) to have a just as good supporting cast. This movie pulls it of. Bradley Cooper, Jeremy Renner and Jennifer Lawrence and even Louis CK (Who I hope is going to do more movies) do some great stuff in this movie. <br/><br/>Combine all that with a great soundtrack that compliments the era and some great cinematography that's beautiful but not distracting. I Love this movie and think it's a must see for anyone who appreciates the art of film making. (9/10) <br/><br/>Favorite quote: She was the Picasso of passive-aggressive karate."

","I think a lot of the reviews have some validity, both the good and the bad, but I think most of them are way too critical, and probably too praiseworthy, for that matter.<br/><br/>For me, I thought Christian Bale and Jennifer Lawrence were stellar. Carmine, played by Jeremy Renner, was a bit like a doe with his sad blue eyes. The plot was pretty weak, but Russell apparently said he was more interested in capturing character interaction, rather than a strong storyline. I think he fell a bit short in capturing that. I felt as though I wanted to be more involved with Irving's guilt towards Carmine, but Renner's performance was just a bit too weak for that to happen. In fact, all these connections between the actors seemed to fall a bit short in intertwining with each other, which is too bad because Bale's character was really awesome.<br/><br/>I wasn't impressed with the cinematography, however, wardrobe, hair, props, were pretty awesome. But that shouldn't be the thing that holds the movie together. <br/><br/>All in all, it was a decent escapist movie, but if you want a true character study done right, check out Revanche, or The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford. If you want to escape into the stereotyped party scene of the '70s watch Boogie Nights or Blow. If you've seen those, American Hustle might be a good fix."

","American Hustle (2013) tells the true story which can be seen as bizarre enough, yet it's clear from the outset that director David O Russell's primary touchstones are cinematic, most notably, Scorsese's Goodfellas as seen through the refractive prism of Paul Thomas Anderson's Boogie Nights, with a smidgen of Whit Stillman's The Last Days of Disco sprinkled in as seasoning. In terms of awards fodder , it also owes a debt to Argo, following its winning formula of handsome stars with outlandishly retro hair arrangements reliving American stories from the late 70s that are too implausible to be entirely made up. What makes the film work are the stellar Oscar nominated performances from the main cast, which is why American Hustle is a stellar yet over flawed film. For a rewatch 07/05/17' American Hustle is quite the film, as it's story and plot are quite confusing at times but overall the acting performances and chemistry from the cast is what makes it standout. It somewhat drags on and the story isn't very typical which is why we see such hate from casual film fans, calling this film ""boring"" and ""overrated"""

","It's funny to see how a movie that garnered ten Academy Award nominations and nearly unanimous love from the critics is receiving such backlash from the regular moviegoers themselves. I saw it in theaters and I loved it. Now for my second viewing, I did not find it quite as wonderful, but I still loved it. It is a hilarious, stylish adventure that takes a few pages from Martin Scorcese. This movie screams Scorcese, but it has a character-driven approach that David O. Russell knows so well. It is a very fun and hilarious movie and it is quite entertaining to soak in the absurdity of the film.<br/><br/>David O. Russell's film is inspired by the ABSCOM scandal that took place in 1970's/1980's New Jersey. Irving Rosenfeld and Sydney Prosser are two con artists who were caught in a loan scam by FBI agent, Richie DiMaso. DiMaso offers them a release if they participate in his sting operation which will bring down U.S Senators and Congressmen as well as Camden's mayor, Carmine Polito.<br/><br/>The film has an impeccable cast and they all put on a good show. Christian Bale and his wacky hair played an over-the-top con artist quite well. Amy Adams was excellent as his seductive British lover. It's funny to see Bradley Cooper play a dimwit as he does so well here as the FBI agent. Jeremy Renner does an excellent job as Mayor Polito. However, Jennifer Lawrence may have delivered the best performance as Irving's crazy wife, Rosalyn.<br/><br/>Overall, American Hustle is a great movie. It may not be Russell's best, but it may be his most stylish and funny film to date. With the Fighter and Silver Linings Playbook, he is on a role as of late. The film is very stylish and it even made the 1970's attire look appealing. The costumes are bright and colorful. The production design is just as stylish. I also loved the soundtrack to the film, as we get excellent pop songs reflecting the mood of the film. A good film that deserves more credit from the general audience. I rate this film 9/10."
"bowmanblue","7","0","2","13 January 2015"," Balding Batman
","American Hustle is a pretty good crime/con caper, but I can't go on without mentioning Christian 'greatest Batman ever' Bale's getup. He looks truly ridiculous. However, this is totally intentional, as he plays someone as far away from Bruce Wayne as he's ever likely to get (his hairpiece alone deserves its own credit at the end of the film). Bale plays a conman, operating in the swinging seventies with his lover (behind his wife's back, by the way), Amy Adams. They're happily scamming away when the fall foul to FBI Agent, Bradley Cooper (with almost as great seventies hair as Bale, only more of it). To keep them out of prison, he enlists their help setting up a scam to catch the big, political fish with their fins in the proverbial cookie jar.<br/><br/>It's fair to say that things don't go according to plan (for anyone!). And, what you're left with is watching all the main leads doing their best to stay one step ahead of those who they're trying to rip off, while also staying one step ahead of each other, before finally staying one step ahead of anyone who might be trying to put a bullet in the back of their heads.<br/><br/>When you get a film with a fair amount of main characters (all vying to make their mark on the picture), you get more plot lines than your average ninety minute movie. Therefore, you have to stay focused to work out who's currently double-crossing who. Plus, despite all the A-list leads giving naturally excellent performances, it doesn't mean you'll go away actually liking any of them. It's hard to find too much sympathy for people who make their living ripping others off. Even those representing 'the law' are a pretty shallow (and some might say 'borderline psychotic') bunch.<br/><br/>However, if you're looking for an adult con/crime caper with plenty of great (if a little weird-looking) A-list stars then you'll certainly find what you're looking for here.<br/><br/>Oh, and if nothing I've said convinces you it's any good, it also has Robert DeNiro thrown in there for an extended cameo – always a bonus!"
"InMyHonestOpinion","8","0","2","9 January 2015"," Some of this actually happened...
","This is another one of those films I waited a long time to see after its initial release, no real reason, I mean I like all the actors, the directors, the idea. I guess I just got lazy at some point. Am glad to say that I have finally seen it and I am rather impressed.<br/><br/>Some of this actually happened Is the way this film introduces us to its world. From that moment on we are taken along into an underground world where underhand dealings and big amounts of money exchange hands between some nasty individuals. Irving Rosenfeld is a con artist who lives in the New Jersey area when he meets the very lovely Sydney Prosser the two form a strong friendship and realise that two heads are better than one. The pair go about the underworld wheeling and dealing until the one day they are caught by FBI agent Richie DiMaso in a loan scam. DiMaso convinces the pair into helping him catch some of the larger criminals in his city to be given a reduced sentence. The agreement is if they help him catch out four more criminals he will let them go<br/><br/>The plot is very clever the story in its entirety is very loosely based around the FBI's ABSCAM files from the 70's; this of course is when this film is set. An amazing soundtrack accompanies the film as well; I have to say I was really happy with some of the tunes featured throughout. The standouts though were by far the four main actors they were superb in their roles. I have read that a couple have been abused about being too over the top I didn't feel that at all. I loved everything about them, sure it was like watching a scene from Jersey Shore at times but it worked so well. Brilliant acting all around. Christian Bale (The Dark Knight, American Psycho)plays Irving Rosenfeld and is great, apparently he put on a lot of weight for the role; that is one thing I didn't feel was useful though, it didn't make him stand out any different at all, so I'm not sure why that happened. Amy Adams (Man of Steel, Enchanted) plays Sydney Prosser aka Lady Edith Greensly and again was brilliant in her role. Jennifer Lawrence ( The Hunger Games, X-Men: First Class)plays Rosalyn Rosenfeld and was easily the standout for me, she made this film, she really took the her character to the limit, loved seeing her in a different role to Katniss I think is what really helped her stand out for me if being honest. Bradley Cooper (The Hangover, Limitless) plays Richie DiMaso again he was great. I honestly can't say enough about these four in this film they were all so good together and really helped each other out.<br/><br/>I did find it a little longer than necessary and there was one very big plot hole, other than those two very insignificant things though I loved American Hustle. It's a film that has been made to be enjoyed. The director David O. Russell (Silver Linings Playbook, The Fighter) has done a fantastic job picking up the pieces of this film and delivering what he has.<br/><br/>Definitely worth watching, a great laugh, great music and some of the best lines from some very talented people."
"anneschultz96","9","0","2","26 December 2014"," American Hustle combines opulence and excitement with universally understandable themes and a striking sense of humanity created by unbelievable acting performances.
","Thrilling and scenic, yet nuanced and emotionally capturing, American Hustle is a wonderful film that left me with both questions and answers about the human condition hidden within the excitement stemming from the glamor and twisting nature of the piece. Though the technical aspects were seamless and inventive, particularly the creative use of perspective employed by the director and cinematographer as well as the almost distractingly perfect use of costumes, the true weight of the film rests in the intensity and quality of the acting. As an, albeit young and fairly poor quality, actress myself, much of what I focus on and take away from a film is the acting performances. In the case of American Hustle, I was not to be disappointed. The performances given in this film by Bale, Adams, Cooper, and Lawrence are breathtaking. Each captures a unique character with endless depth and absolute commitment. As a leading man, Christian Bale embodies the a schemer who is a master at survival at all costs. However, his ability to bring a sense of relatable normality elevates the twisting plot and paints the picture of a new kind of conman. Amy Adams however is the true showstopper. She fills the screen with an overwhelming sense of power without losing her ever present vulnerability. The duality of her character reflects the universality of confusion, loss, desire, and truth. As impressive as always, her performance left me wanting more. Both Cooper and Lawrence excel in their roles as well, illustrating the danger of desire and remaining human through their lack of likability as characters. Additionally, though not as impressive as his costars, Jeremy Renner breaks type in an excitingly effective way, forcing me to reevaluate my opinions of him as an actor. As a whole, the flaw of the film was only that it lacked a certain intangible wholeness that I personally am left with after enjoying a movie worthy of ten stars. However, I would recommend it wholeheartedly, solely based on the amazing acting that is enhanced by the effectiveness of quality vision, direction, and implementation. It is truly a great film."

","American Hustle is one of those movies that will be appreciated for it's directing and it's actors. It's thought of as a movie for movie fans, but as a movie fan, or a 'film fanatic' I actually found this to be David O.Russel's weakest movie to date. <br/><br/>The Fighter was an amazing movie, and The Silver Linings Playbook was great, but American Hustle just barely scraps by as very good. This movie feels like it should belong to Bale, however, Jennifer Lawrence character is primed to steal the spotlight whenever she can, and she does. <br/><br/>Problem with this is that her character is a chaotic nascence. While her acting is great, her character doesn't seem as much fun as it seems a hassle to portray given her poisonous nature. <br/><br/>Further can disappointment be added to how Amy Adams feels underused, even at her best. Her character is central to just about every other major actors in this film, yet the degree of sympathy we should feel for someone caught so in the middle of everything is under-minded by the difficulty of figuring out whether or not she's truly a good or bad person. <br/><br/>Bradley Cooper also feels sold short, with more focus on his looks and his character's determination than any actual development. The movies plot feels more confusing at times than it should be and I attribute this to the film being longer than it needs to be; something that befalls one too many Oscar hopeful films. <br/><br/>American Hustle did not win best picture because it didn't stand a chance, but because it was not the best. While the movie is worth the watch, and a very good film at the least, there are better choices out there for a serious drama."

","The hype for this film made it look so interesting, but upon watching it, I found just the opposite. The film was acclaimed to have comedic attributes to it, but I saw no comedy. Instead I watched 138 minutes of the actors yelling at each other and/or beating up each other. Bradley Cooper's character made the plot seem almost unbelievable since he severely beat up a man and had no repercussions from it, and got trusted with a large sum of money from the FBI. The mobster had a mustache like a pedophile, yet he's a mobster. That just really did not make sense to me. Finally, there was really no resolution at the end of the movie. All of the characters just really made matters worse for themselves in stead of better.The FBI agent botched the entire investigation, the con artist's wife left him for the mobster, but no one resolves any problems."
"thedriver829","7","0","1","22 November 2014"," Well Acted, Stylish, but Also Self-Indulgent and Disjointed
","Hype can be a major killer when it comes to movies, and American Hustle is a huge example of this. There was a lot to be excited about here. The cast was huge, with big named, really incredible actors brought on board. It has David O. Russell in the director's chair, coming off his back-to-back critically acclaimed movies ""The Fighter"" and ""Silver Linings Playbook."" It has the feel of a Scorsese film, with the music that feels like a throwback to the 70s. And it holds a 95% on Rotten Tomatoes; that alone garners this movie a chance. So why did I walk out of this movie dissatisfied?<br/><br/>Largely it has to do with the overall structure of the movie. It has everything that it needs to put together a fantastic movie, but feels very disjointed, like they didn't know how to put that puzzle together. It also feels like it has a touch of self-indulgence thrown into the mix, like O. Russell wanted to make his own version of Goodfellas, only without the flow and consistency of that film. And ultimately it ends up feeling very jumbled, very inconsistent, and very unsatisfying.<br/><br/>Of course there is still a lot that this movie can be praised for. All the actors do a tremendous job, the two main standouts being Christian Bale and Bradley Cooper. Amy Adams does a good job as well in the main female lead role, and Jennifer Lawrence does a great job as well (even though I feel like she is completely miscast and not as incredible in this movie as everyone makes her out to be). There's also some great dialog, great editing as well. The overall tone is fun and it definitely keeps you interested in what's going on. I just felt if they had found a much better way to bring all of this together, it would have succeeded a lot more than I felt it did. Hopefully next time, O. Russell remembers that to back up his great actors, settings, costumes, soundtrack, and dialog with a solid and stable story."
"debbystardust","7","0","1","19 November 2014"," Interesting Movie
","I did enjoy watching this film. I am openly nostalgic for the '70's, although I was around two years old when they ended. I was unfamiliar with the scandal the film explores and it was interesting to learn about it. I feel this movie compares and contrasts the characters of Irving (Christian Bale) vs. Richie (Bradley Cooper) as men, while doing the same with Sydney (Amy Adams) vs. Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence)as women, not in light of the values of the '70s, but according to current attitudes and social values. The movie seems to pose the question ""Who is the better man/ woman?"" and ultimately, but weakly, seems to settle on Irving and Sydney.<br/><br/>As a teenager, my world view was shaped by a book called The Lonely Crowd, which explained that modern life was increasingly shaped by ""other-directed-ness"" as opposed to ""inner-directed-ness"" of traditional American life. In short, while the Victorian was guided by an inner moral compass and was the ultimate judge of his own success or failure, the modern American is judged on a social plane and on how his or her behavior is viewed socially. I was reminded of this book while watching the movie. Irving and Sydney are ""heroes"" as con people because they are good at reading and responding to social cues and using them to succeed. Rosalyn's and Irving's marriage is presented as not as ""real"" as Irving and Sydney's affair, because our modern values see relational feelings as more substantial than a more traditional view of the sanctity of marriage. Rosalyn is a stay at home mom, but that is presented negatively vs. Sydney's ""career"" as a con woman, which again, reflects our values and not the '70s view of homemakers. Richie is also seen in a more negative light than Irving, because he is not as good at perceiving the social reality; he is over emotional and brutish, he cannot ""seal the deal"" with Sydney or his career.<br/><br/>Visually, the movie has fun with the '70s wardrobe. Amy Adams looks a bit too modern while the male characters are dressed in styles which are now regarded as tacky, from Bradley Cooper's ""Mr. Brady"" perm to Jeremy Renner's plaid coat. Amy Adams' body becomes almost a character itself, with her ever present plunging neck line and as her physical flirtation with Bradly Cooper leads his character off track professionally. Jeremy Renner somehow manages to make his pompadour and plaid coat look great and appropriate, but poor Christian Bale looks terrible in his ""rapist"" glasses and messy balding 'do. Combined with his harsh accent, I find it difficult to believe that he could be a successful con man, as I don't see how anyone would trust him. In fact, he looks like an illustration in the dictionary that might appear next to the word ""con man."" The movie does seem to celebrate his social savvy, but we see little evidence of his ""wisdom,"" except his vague idea of ""hey, maybe we should stay away from these mafia guys"" in the scenes with Robert De Niro.<br/><br/>I enjoyed watching this movie and I feel it raises great questions, but it reflects 2013 and not any year of the '70s. We are fascinated by the '70s because things have changed so much. The movie is memorable for the performances of the cast. Jennifer Lawrence, Louis C.K., and Jeremy Renner all did great jobs as supporting players."
"brchthethird","6","0","1","14 November 2014"," Actors run amok in an excellent recreation of 1970's period detail
","American HUSTLE is a movie which is only nominally about the Abscam sting operation in late 70's/early 80's. The real heart and soul of this movie lies in the many fictional characters created for it, who are all conning each other in one way or another. Basically, the movie is about what people do in order to survive. This is a very compelling theme which is suitably explored over the course of the film, but it lacks enough narrative focus to really leave an impression. Yes, it is wonderfully acted and has some funny scenes (as well as one tense scene with a great cameo), but David O. Russell let his actors run amok with the script and it shows. On the positive side, the film features some of the best period production design and costumes I've ever seen, as well as an impeccably chosen soundtrack. Tonally, Russell seemed to be going for a Scorsese feel. This was nice, but I would have rather that Russell put more of a personal stamp on the material like he did with his previous film SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK. Still, despite being a gelatinous mess of a story, American HUSTLE is a well-made, well-acted film but not much more."

","A fair movie working on the template of Goodfellers but without the violence or tension. Acting was reasonable, although many of the characters are slightly cardboard in their presentation. There is a twist at the end but to be honest, it was neither a surprise nor a shock - it was just the way it was - which is a testament to the movie's ability to engage.<br/><br/>I liked the story - but as a film it missed something - which was disappointing. A film to watch but not rave about. 70's moments really didn't fit in - one might have expected Travolta to jump in and add some character to the scenes. I'm guessing the make believe testosterone scenes of lust were supposed to capture one - but it didn't work for me.<br/><br/>The character I really liked was Jennifer Lawrence who I thought played her role exceptionally well."

","On the opening screen we read the words ""Some of this actually happened"". Indeed, the Seventies hair styles and clothes suck you in in such a way that if you lived during the era, the story almost seems like it could be believable. Take the name Carmine Ippolito - it sounds so familiar yet...<br/><br/>I thought this was just such a brash, audacious flick pulled off by some of the more talented con artists of the current crop of young actors. Christian Bale is always changing appearances for his pictures, Bradley Cooper is right in his element as a smarmy FBI agent, and Amy Adams is both gorgeous and repulsive at the same time. And Jennifer Lawrence - I'll go out on a limb here to say that when she planted a big wet one on Amy Adams' kisser, that was one of the most outrageous moments in screen history, right after that monologue on f...'d up, poisonous choices. I had to pause the picture right there for a moment to soak it all in.<br/><br/>With ten Oscar nominations it's a shame the picture didn't score in any category but it was a pretty tough year with plenty of bold flicks and outstanding performances. I'm going to watch this one again just to catch some of those great lines like Irving (Bale) describing wife Rosalyn (Lawrence) - ""She was the Picasso of passive-aggressive karate"". Wasn't that just brilliant? It's a line any guy could use to describe his significant other. There's only one let down when the whole thing is all over, we never do find out how the ice fishing story ends."

","The Colour Purple of the 21st century, this glamorous, super stylish albeit hollow crime drama got 10 Oscar nominations and went away with nothing. It's not hard to see why. Christian Bale and Amy Adams, 2 criminals, end up helping the FBI catch other hustlers. What follows is an endlessly complicated plot with more twists than a rubix cube, until finally we reach the end. Some of this actually happened, as the opening title card says. AH is primarily an acting showcase. Christian Bale's best actor nomination was something of a mystery, but he does more than put on weight and don a wig, and he's very entertaining. Bradley Cooper is excellent, Amy Adams is electric and is especially impressive as she has the hardest role in the film. Jennifer Lawrence steals the show from everyone and she absolutely crackles with energy. David O Russell, takes a story which doesn't need a lot of stunning visuals and fills it with vibrant camera-work while the production team do a good job recreating the 70s. Not bad for a film with some awful haircuts.<br/><br/>Everyone loved AH at first, but it has since faced a backlash. The hype machine strikes again. The plot doesn't go anywhere, and since it constantly spits out twist after twist you never know what's going on. It is also totally style over substance and it lacks depth and purpose. The dialogue does have plenty of energy, but it does little more than prolong the scenes. It's certainly a visually stunning movie and quite a fun one at times, but did we really need to endure endless twists, aimless banter and all of that in your face style over substance for over 2 hours? Seriously? I'm glad it didn't win best picture, because if it had it would have become the new Crash. It's not a bad movie, but if you're looking for something which is actually Oscar worthy check out any of the other 8 best picture nominees of 2013. It's bizarre how people whine and moan about style over substance yet they shower films like this, Pulp Fiction, Avatar and How To Train Your Dragon with praise even though they are completely style over substance. Still, even if it's not Oscar worthy, I still enjoyed it.<br/><br/>7/10"

","I have heard a lot of good things about this film and I must say this film is over-hyped and overrated but that does not mean it is bad it is in fact pretty solid. This film documents a couple of con artists having to work with the FBI to con important members of the hierarchy of new jersey while dealing with their own problems. Now this film is really co led by Christian bales and Amy Adams and both do a really good job and prove that they still have great acting abilities. The supporting cast also does a really good job with what they are given. Bradley cooper is the FBI operative they work with and he has great chemistry with Adams and bale, who provides another look inside this group. Jeremy Renner is my favourite character in the film and his role in this film proves just how solid an actor he truly is. Jennifer Lawrence is also in this film and she is good even though I do believe her character should have had a lesser role. There was also some fun cameos like Louis ck who was a good comedic character in this film. However, for all the great acting in this film the story just annoys the he'll out of me. This film just concentrates on too many people and really lacks focus throughout which really hurts the films narrative. The script is also a bit of a mixed bag in my opinion because the dialogue between the characters is really good but it also suffers from trying to be a little bit too funny and not truthfully succeeding in this department. The style is also a bit of a mixed bag with it being lavish and bright which is cool it just is over the top for this story really. Overall this is a solid hustle film but it is not worthy of all the Oscar buzz it has."

The cast is fantastic, and they are running on all eight cylinders, with the always impeccable Mr Bale anchoring the entire movie perfectly. Jennifer Lawrence almost steals the movie, she is truly brilliant and playing way beyond her years. There is a somewhat similar feel to this and ""GoodFellas"" in terms of great actors acting great, along with the way it's all put together with the setting being about 40 years in the past, the use of music and character narration etc, and maybe this is not as bold or as ground-breaking as that movie, but this is still quite an accomplishment."
"amsby17","6","0","2","7 September 2014"," The World of the 70s Perfectly Done But Directors Chooses Characters Over Plot
","Director David O. Russell takes viewers through the velvet suits and wood panel interiors of the 70's like it was yesterday. Wardrobe, set-design, and hair and make-up were all surprisingly well-done and added believability to this period piece (based on actual events surrounding the ABSCAM scandal). Actors Amy Adams, Christian Bale, Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence bring big star power to the film. Plus, the dialogue rings true and the characters are somewhat multifaceted. So what's missing from American Hustle? Perhaps it's that all these elements - even done to perfection - still aren't enough to make a really good movie from beginning to end.<br/><br/>American Hustle showcases the skills, intelligence and anxieties of life-long con man Irving Rosenfeld. Enter Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams) his muse and prime love interest (aside from his wife played by Jennifer Lawrence). Director (and screenwriter) Russell cleverly keeps the audience (and characters) guessing as to what in their lives is real and what is fake (who's playing who). Predictably, Irving and Sydney find themselves in some trouble with the law - cue FBI agent Richie DiMaso (played by Bradley Cooper). Irving isn't without conscience and has some qualms about what Richie now wants them to do, but with his hands tied, he's forced to move forward with Richie's power-hungry ideas. Relationships amongst the characters develop and evolve until the film's conclusion. Taking pointers from Ocean's 11, both the movie's characters and audience learn the big reveals together.<br/><br/>So, it's kind of fun to watch Adams dance around in revealing dresses and to see Bale painstakingly tamper with his ridiculous comb-over hairdo - but it's not enough. A great movie moves at an unnoticeable pace. It flows through scenes effortlessly - it flies by in a delightful flash and you didn't even notice how much time went by at all. I checked the clock at least three times during American Hustle. Dialogue and plot in some instances played out unnecessarily slow and dragged down the other elements of the film that are well done. Despite some surprises at the end, this movie didn't hold my interest. Russell is known for strong characters and less for storyline development but this selective emphasis hurt the picture as a whole."
"sherrisouth","5","0","1","1 September 2014"," Well the costumes and sets were great
","First of all the movie is too long and should have had some editing. Christian Bale did a plausible con man with a not too convincing comb over. Amy Adams' costumes kind of over shadowed her performance, and Jennifer Lawrence was OK in a kind of Goldie Hawn type of character. Cooper was not convincing as the FBI agent - how would they hire someone who has a powder keg temper and doesn't double check the details? Renner was good as the over the top Rat Pack type Mayor. The movie was nothing to brag about and I was disappointed because I felt that the plot was thin and not cohesive at all. Could have been so much better... Tidy ending where everything somehow works out."

","Classic Film making. I wish it could have been done so well, without some uncalled for dialogs.<br/><br/>Yes, there is a plot, there is a twist and there is more to add to characters than what they are, and there is style. This is what classic films are made of. Interesting characters, good plot and good production values. Yet, there is something missing called good dialog and good screenplay, that would have made this good film a great film.<br/><br/>I liked it, but I was OK with it and did not feel any better after watching this. The dialogs are made up of nail polish and hairstyles which seem so irrelevant actually. Yet, they are made to fit into the plot. What role will a nail polish play in a con man's life. Indeed I dozed off midway through the first hour and when I woke up 10 minutes later, nothing changed, I could catch up with the film pretty easily. That's the pace of the film. It's slow and involves lot of talking. <br/><br/>I have no problem in listening to dialog, but dialog of this kind is tough to bear. The plot is about money and the dialog seems to deviate all that. So that's the main thing that did not work for me. Else, unquestionably it is a good film technically. The art direction, costume design, make up are wonderful. Cinematography was good but at times, there was noise on screen. My biggest crib is editing. Was it deliberately made into such a long movie? I am sure if I were the editor, it would have been considerably less in time. <br/><br/>The best part though is acting. All the actors have performed exceedingly well. From Christian Bale as Irving, the protagonist to Robert De Niro who comes in a guest role. It is terrific acting. I do not want to say anything about the plot, but just giving the meaning of hustle here. <br/><br/>The music used was also good, the Jefferson Airplane song ""White Rabbit"" is in Arabic and is nice. Others songs are also good. <br/><br/>hustle : To obtain something by deceitful or illicit means; practice theft or swindling. <br/><br/>A 3/5 will be just for this.

","A con artist and his con artist mistress, being blackmailed, after being caught conning, to con an unsuspecting politician in the hopes of catching the big time cons – this is the plot of American Hustle.<br/><br/>Richie DiMaso is the FBI agent, hungry to make a name for himself, not happy with catching two small time crooks, Sydney Prosser (Lady Edith Greensley) and Irving Rosenfeld. Instead he uses these con artists to help him catch more in exchange for immunity from their crimes, continually upping the stakes. Not satisfied until he has several politicians and the mob within his reach.<br/><br/>David O. Russell reminds me of the directors of the past that had a reliable inner circle of actors he recycled over and over in movies – clearly favoring Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence. Both talented actors who seem miscast in their roles as neither are able to fully become their characters. You, as the viewer, can't help shake that it is Bradley Cooper being the hungry FBI agent Richie DiMaso and Jennifer Lawrence pretending to be the unstable wife Rosalyn Rosenfeld, the latter being far worse than the former.<br/><br/>Amy Adams' multilayered portrayal of the master con artist manipulator Sydney Prosser (aka Edith) steals the show in the role. Unfortunately, this is not particularly difficult given her costars' performances. The character development is there for all roles, but just not brought to life. Better equipped, though lesser known, actors would have elevated this movie to a point where it was a runaway for the Oscars.<br/><br/>I was absolutely charmed by the costume design by Michael Wilkinson and believe that his innate ability in capturing the late 1970's helps captivate the audience, drawing them into this comedic drama. I am sure true fashionistas knowledgeable in style trends will point out flaws but the polyester clad bodies, exposed chests and prevalent curlers will be awesome fun for the ignorant viewer.<br/><br/>All in all, it is a fun movie filled with good music and an entertaining story line as you root for unlikely con artist protagonists.

"brando647","9","0","4","28 July 2014"," Great Retro Vibe and Awesome Performances
","So, I had the realization recently that I'd never actually seen a David O. Russell film. I've somehow gone as long as I have without them, despite hearing nothing but great things about them. I've seen his films come and go and there's never been one that's been interesting enough for me to watch. Until American HUSTLE. I'm a sucker for the sixties and seventies, and the film's got a nice roster of talent: Christian Bale, Amy Adams, Jennifer Lawrence, Bradley Cooper, and Jeremy Renner. Honestly, the images of Bale with a gut and a comb-over were enough to garner my interest. It's just so bizarre. I'm glad I checked it out because it was one of the more entertaining movies I saw in 2013. It's funnier than I expected and I love a good con-man tale. American HUSTLE is apparently inspired by real events. Specifically, the Abscam investigation from the late seventies. The film focuses on the con artists at the heart of the investigation: Irving Rosenfeld (Bale) and Sydney Prosser (Adams). After being busted for fraud, the two are given a second chance when approached by FBI agent Richie DiMaso (Cooper). DiMaso's interested in the bigger picture of political corruption, and he wants Rosenfeld and Prosser to cooperate with the operation. Their first target is Carmine Polito (Renner), the mayor of Camden, in hopes of getting him to accept bribes from a fictional Arab sheik in return for funding to rebuild Atlantic City. The operation gains traction and soon DiMaso's got the opportunity to go after Congressmen, as long as the plan isn't ruined by Rosenfeld's crass wife (Lawrence) or the threat of involvement from the mob.<br/><br/>For starters, I love the film's design. Kudos to design team for recreating everything about the seventies and giving a cool authenticity to the whole film. The music, the fashion, and the production design all bring the seventies to life and the cinematography from Linus Sandgren takes it to another level. I've got to say, this movie is gorgeous to look at. The soundtrack's great and builds on the vibe with tunes from Elton John, Santana, and, my personal favorite addition, the title track for LIVE AND LET DIE from Paul McCartney & Wings. You almost wouldn't recognize Bale as Rosenfeld. With his gut hanging over his pants and a hilarious comb-over that we watch him carefully construct in the opening scene of the film, he oozes seventies swindler in his retro suits and aviator sunglasses. Jeremy Renner reminds us that he's more than an action star as the scam's main focus, Mayor Carmine Polito. With his Jersey accent and pompadour hair, he disappears into his character pretty effectively and becomes the only real sympathetic character. Polito does what he does in the movie with his sole intention being rebuilding his beloved town. He sees the ghettos and the hard times and sees the arrival of the ""sheik"" as his chance of reviving commerce. Renner's great and breaks away from the Marvel/Hawkeye role that I (and probably many people at this point, seeing as it's how his most prominent recent role) associate him with.<br/><br/>It's not fair to focus on just Bale and Renner because everyone in this movie is great. Everyone seems to step out of their comfort zone a bit for roles that you wouldn't normally attribute to them. Bradley Cooper, usually a handsome leading man, is an ambitious FBI agent who quickly discovers he's the butt of the joke. Jennifer Lawrence turns on the white trash for her role as Rosalyn, Irving's wife. Yes, her character is aggravating (a stereotypical Jersey wife, if garbage reality TV is any indication) but you see the motivations behind her often dangerous behavior. If nothing else, it's interesting to see her as someone so damaged and crude. The characters in the film are all interesting in their own ways and I love their natural interactions. I'd seen there was a good deal of improvisation on set and, if that's the case, it worked out well. I love the natural flow of conversation and I think, for it to have turned out as it did, the actors/actresses had to have really inhabited their characters. As a result, American HUSTLE is a lot of fun. I was surprised to find that the movie ran for almost an hour and a half but you never feel its length. It's got a great flow, even if the ending feels a little rushed. Once the mob becomes involved (with an awesome cameo I didn't see coming), the film sort of runs for the finish line and ties it up a little quicker than I expected for a scam so complex. If I were to have any complaints about American HUSTLE, I suppose it'd be that the whole Abscam thing seems overly complicated at times without knowing some history behind it but it's not enough to detract from the fun of this film."
"jb_campo","7","0","3","27 July 2014"," Superb acting - wild story
","American Hustle is one of those movies that you will spend time afterwards thinking - what happened, who did what, why? You know, similar to Memento when you keep thinking about what was real versus flashback or future view.<br/><br/>The strongest part of this movie is the incredible acting delivered by all the characters. Christian Bale is fabulous - how does he go from Batman to a fat con man? He delivers big time, as does Amy Adams as his co-con in crime. Jeremy Renner also delivers as this somewhat crooked politician who is trying to do good, or at least, you think so. I didn't like Bradly Cooper as the FBI agent, but maybe that's why he was good. He comes off as a total dufus. Finally Jennifer Laurence delivers a fine performance as a messed-up housewife used to living the lie on Long Island. Bought and paid for, but she always wants more. And somewhat of a ditz who insists she's smart. Yeah right. Terrific acting all around.<br/><br/>The plot is what kind of drags the movie around. You try to hang in there and figure out who is who, good or bad guy, FBI, mobster. Mostly it keeps you guessing who is the con and who is being conned. This movie may have you recalling The Sting, with Paul Newman and Robert Redford, if you want to see something similar.<br/><br/>I am not surprised this didn't win any big awards at the Oscars. It's a very interesting film, but no real big - oh or ahs, or I see now time moments. Just an entertaining film that will leave you fulfilled with terrific acting, but a hard to follow script. I think you'll enjoy it. I did."

","To be honest, the movie's plot was not all that great. The entire conflict was not too great, in fact it was very average as movies go. With that said, it is still a great film! Its not the mediocre plot that makes it great, its the characters. The character development in the film is spectacular, by the end of the movie one feels like they can actually relate to the helplessly lost characters from the movie. Christian Bale and Bradley Cooper masterfully act out their individual characters, as do Amy Adams and Jennifer Lawrence. There is quite a lot of arguing and swearing, which makes the movie very intense and in some circumstances difficult to watch. Other than that its wonderful, would not recommend for under 16 year olds though."
"jimbo-53-186511","6","0","2","15 June 2014"," Good, but the critics have definitely made it out to be much better than it actually is
","'If it sounds too good to be true, then it probably is'. That is how the old saying goes when describing most cons. Act 1 sees Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale) and Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams) setting up a bogus money lending scheme in which they offer 2 lend unsuspecting people up to $50,000 as long as they put down a $5,000 deposit. Of course, the 'marks' never receive the money that they're promised. They basically exploit people's gullibility and people's greed to make themselves a tidy fortune. However, things come to a head when Irving and Sydney are set up by FBI agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper) who poses as a potential client. He arrests Sydney, but says that he will let her go free if both herself and Irving assist him in setting up 4 'marks'. Irving and Sydney now find themselves working for Richie in order to avoid Richie taking further action.<br/><br/>I've noticed a few people have criticised American Hustle due to the fact that it has so many unlikeable characters. Whilst I wouldn't go as far as saying that any of the main characters are necessarily likable, there are many characters that it is easy to 'sympathise with' rather than 'like'. The main character I connected with was the character of Rosalyn (portrayed by Jennifer Lawrence). I'll admit that initially her character comes across as being a bit of a bitch, but it soon becomes clear that all she wants is to be loved - this explains why she takes off with the first man that shows any interest in her. She isn't used to affection as she had been living in a loveless marriage with Irving so it's only natural that she'll lap it up. OK, she does use their son to manipulate Irving and to try to control him, but again I think this is merely because she desperately wants him to stay with her. Bale's character was a little more complex - he has to try and balance his 'hustling' and his need to be a good dad to Danny. Although Irving is fairly cold towards Rosalyn, he absolutely adores his son Danny and will clearly do anything for him. It was nice to see that Irving went straight in the end as I always felt that he was a good person deep down. By contrast, I found Amy Adams character (Sydney Prosser) to be much less interesting and I also felt her acting was a bit weak. Bradley Cooper was good in his respective role as over confident and volatile FBI agent Richie DiMaso - he shows his instability by beating up his superior officer - although quite how he avoided being suspended, sacked or at the very least interviewed after this altercation is a bit of a mystery.<br/><br/>From a technical point of view, the film is well directed and the era has also been captured very well. The film is generally well acted (with the exception of Amy Adams). The film is a bit long and does lag at times, but never to a point where it becomes boring.<br/><br/>FINAL THOUGHTS; Good film that is well directed coupled with good acting. Over-hyping by the critics is ultimately the film's undoing. It doesn't particularly bring anything new to the table, but it is, for the most part, an enjoyable and engaging film."

Thankfully, I got to see it recently and with the word of mouth and the critics nearly giving it 100% universal, irrefutable praise, I thought I was going to watch the greatest thing. A visual representation of chocolate and peanut butter meeting for the first time.<br/><br/>It was close but not quite that.<br/><br/>Overall, I thought the film was okay but maybe my expectations were too high. The soundtrack is filled with great tunes from an era where music was made to endure the span of time, the premise was definitely interesting, and the cast is filled with ridiculously talented actors who are each giving their all (and more) in their performance. Even Jennifer Lawrence, an actress I'm usually indifferent to and don't really see the hype that surrounds her, blew me away her role. And did I mention the awesome hair on Bradley Cooper and Christian Bale?!? But all jokes about perms and comb-overs aside, the actors and actresses within this tale were incredible.<br/><br/>The real killer for me was the fact the film's plot and story unfold very slowly and, sometimes, feels like it is going nowhere or like it has no clue where it is going and decides to just take a nap. I wasn't expecting a flashy, fast pace crime caper film but I wasn't expecting to not get sucked into the story and have the two hours and crumbs of its running time feel like it is taking twice that amount of time to get somewhere. I could feel each second slowly chug its way around the clock and I wasn't able to get fully invested in the film to the point where the time just flew.<br/><br/>Did I think ""American Hustle"" was bad? No. Were my expectations too high? Quite possibly. I enjoyed a lot about the film but my inability to completely consume myself into the story and plot made the film just okay in my book.

Russell can make a period piece like this into a good movie, and I forgot to mention Robert De Niro's great cameo appearance in the film. With great 70's music from Danny Elfman, including cinematography, costumes, art direction, and set decoration. Christian Bale gives his best performance since his portrayal as Batman in Christopher Nolan's Batman Trilogy, and Amy Adams since her portrayal in Steven Spielberg's Catch Me If You Can."

","This is one movie that can explain how good actors can turn a relatively floppy plot in to a good movie. Cristian Bale was amazingly absorbed in to the character making this movie to an engaging one for every one to watch. Amy Adams was also great with on & off distractions of the audience by her cleavage. Bradly Cooper was really impressive & now he is coming up with more characters that he can do something other than those last couple of dull character in Hangover. Jennifer Lawrence once again proved she's grown up more than to her age as an actress and the way she annoy the viewers in this movie with her voice and acting was superb. <br/><br/>After all it was a good movie mostly because of the actors who had given the maximum to this."

","I had never heard of the Abscam scandal before ""American Hustle"" got released. As a newbie, and understanding that the movie is a fictionalized account, I was impressed. This collection of people conning each other blows the mind. Practically every character in the movie is a despicable person in some way or another: the swindlers, the politicians, etc. Like ""The Wolf of Wall Street"", it shows a world of unabashed fraud, packed with people who have no qualms about anything that they do.<br/><br/>I found ""American Hustle"" to be a good movie. Christian Bale, Amy Adams, Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence and Jeremy Renner put on fine performances. Some of Lawrence's scenes made me feel as if I was walking on eggshells. The intricate corruption that Abscam exposed seems more relevant than ever amid the continuing economic slump. You'll probably like the movie.<br/><br/>James Zogby of the Arab-American Institute noted a major omission: because the FBI had a man pose as a sheikh in the effort to arrest the corrupt politicians, it pushed a negative image of Arabs."
"rasmushelms","9","0","2","19 May 2014"," A Stylish, Character-Driven, Hugely Entertaining Film
","Out of all the critically-acclaimed films of 2013, ""American Hustle"" is one of the few deserving the immense hype surrounding it. Last year David O. Russell delivered ""Silver Linings Playbook,"" which garnered Jennifer Lawrence her first Oscar. In my opinion, ""American Hustle"" is even better. <br/><br/>As with ""Silver Linings,"" the characters are what drives the film. Here we have the con-artists Irving (Christian Bale) and Sydney (Amy Adams), the ambitious cop Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper), the delirious wife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence), and the good-guy politician Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner), each ""hustling"" to achieve their goals. The mind games between these characters is what makes ""American Hustle"" so compelling, and the great performances from the cast add to the spectacle. Christian Bale seems to be channeling Robert De Niro, who also delivers a great, albeit brief cameo performance, while Jennifer Lawrence provides some of the funniest scenes of the year. <br/><br/>Just as important as the characters is the direction. The style of the film bears many similarities to Scorsese's ""Goodfellas"" and even ""The Wolf of Wall Street"", although ""American Hustle is by far the better of the year's flicks. However, David O. Russell relies even more on a superb 70's soundtrack, which features music from Electric Light Orchestra to David Bowie, matched with slow-motion sequences to set the tone for the scenes. When matched with the great costume design and cinematography, it makes for a very stylish film. <br/><br/>Even more so than most of the year's Oscar-nominated films, ""American Hustle"" seems to have experienced a backlash of angry users on IMDb knocking the film's rating down significantly. This is a shame, because ""American Hustle"" is far better than what users are giving it credit for. However, this is probably due to mainstream audiences being taken back by the slower pace of the film, in contrast to the energy of ""The Wolf of Wall Street,"" which I think is absurdly overrated on the site. ""American Hustle"" certainly will not appeal to everyone, but for those who appreciate indie films ""American Hustle"" deserves a watch."

","This movie is good for what it is. It has almost everything you'd want in a crime caper - its funny, its slick, the soundtrack is great, the cast have fantastic chemistry, but the plot.........well, meh.<br/><br/>There should be no doubt that by now you will either be hearing great things or bad things about this movie. Some think its Oscar gold, whilst most think of it as the most overrated movie in a decade. Well make no mistake, the film is by no means Oscar material and I think that hype hurt the films reviews somewhat. If the film had not been hyped up so much, people might have liked it more. It's not really an award worthy movie (at least not the amount that the film has got), but is a good movie on it's own. The cast shine in their roles, but when you're up against films like 12 Years a Slave, a heist movie can only go so far at the academy. The banter between the characters is also very funny, almost reminiscent of Scorcese-esque dialogue. Even when the characters are angry, you can't help but laugh. The only real weak point of the movie is the plot and how it's executed. The plot concerns a group of con men who gradually get in deeper and deeper with the FBI and the mafia due to their scams. At times you will be wondering ""where is this movie going"" or ""wait, what just happened"". Sometimes the plot moves forward in importance very suddenly without emphasizing it to the viewer and the inner workings of the scam will go over your head unless you're in the same line of work, study it very extensively or are very familiar with the scam that the film is based on. It's the kind of plot that will have your brain scrambled by the end of it, and to be honest, I don't see that plot being understood better through multiple viewings.<br/><br/>All in all, American Hustle is a good solid movie if you just want funny banter and characters, but I wouldn't go into this movie expecting a great plot if I were you."
"eddie_baggins","6","0","1","24 April 2014"," Entertaining but highly over-rated
","After finally watching American Hustle I just had to look up the meaning of the word ""overrate"" and this is what I found -<br/><br/>1. have a higher opinion of (someone or something) than is deserved. ""an overrated player"" synonyms: assess too highly, overestimate, overvalue, rate/prize too highly, think too much of, exaggerate the worth of, attach too much importance to; praise too highly, exaggerate the merits of, over-praise, oversell, glorify, magnify; informalblow up; rareover-prize ""it is easy to overrate what Frederick achieved"" antonyms: underrate, underestimate <br/><br/>Much of what you see above you is a perfect summation of what American Hustle is, a film overrated to the point of complete saturation. Upon release critics and audiences alike were swept away in a frenzy of hype for a movie that, while highly enjoyable in many respects, is also completely and utterly unmemorable and way tpo self assured to ever become anything more than a slight Hollywood romp.<br/><br/>David O. Russell is a director who in recent years has found favour where once he had mere art-house aficionados. Hustle, much like his previous and even more offensively overrated Silver Linings Playbook saw the director strike awards gold and box office gold with a story and script that wafts in it's own importance. Much was said about just how witty and biting the dialogue in Hustle is but personally I felt it's nothing more than a sneaky smile inducing type of event. Russell seems to have said to the cast ""speak loud, fast and at times mumble"" as much of what is said on screen is done in such an over the top, unbelievable way that its hard to see these characters as real people or in fact care for them and their various plights, and that's where the film falters above all else.<br/><br/>The lead characters in the piece, Irving and Sydney, are well played by Bale and Adams, with Adams in particular the most worthy of the critical lauding the ensemble received. Bradley Cooper, who is once again cast in a role that feels like a different take on the same character, is nothing more than annoying while Lawrence has moments of both averageness and softly spoken greatness. The story these characters inhabit is such a complicated and murky one that we the audience really needed more to hold onto to carry us through, but you'd be hard pressed to care whether they succeed or fail with such an unlovable bunch; in the end it's likely you'll wish you spent more time with Jeremy Renner's mayor than any of these ""cons.""<br/><br/>It's hard to fathom that Hustle received 10 Oscar nominations this year, but justice was served with it walking away empty handed. Sometimes a film comes along and strikes a cord with a moment in time and that's what Hustle is, a quick con that succeeded at the time yet in time will be quickly forgotten about. It's an enjoyable 2 hours thanks to a intriguing real life scenario and some interesting acting but overall American Hustle is not as cool as it so clearly thinks it is.<br/><br/>3 intense comb-overs out of 5<br/><br/>For more movie reviews and opinions check into -<br/><br/>www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com"

","At first, I thought the critics had gone a bit overboard for this one, with all their talk of Scorsese and screwball comedy greats like Howard Hawks, but after I'd watched it (twice), I was totally won over. The screenplay cuts a few corners, and Russell like to keep things in flux, with the result that the complex plot can be mystifying at times. That's about it for the negatives. Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence play very much the same characters that they did in ""Silver Linings Playbook""—the manic motormouth and the neurotic know-it-all—but a bulked-up Christian Bale and Amy Adams take things to a much higher level as the two lovestruck grifters, Irving and Sydney. The dialogue is sharp and convincing, and despite Russell's fondness for improv and spontaneity, he keeps the pacing very tight and wisely saves the best plot twist for last. In contrast to ""Silver Linings,"" this time he ties things up beautifully in the closing scenes. Other highlights: The wordless opening shot, with Irving arranging his triple-decker combover, gets your attention right away, and JLaw can really sling that 70s psychobabble. Great supporting cast, especially Jeremy Renner as a populist Jersey pol; Elisabeth Röhm, as his wife, does a lot with just a few of lines of dialogue and some eye-catching underwear."
"julian-mumford","8","0","2","12 April 2014"," A good film, although difficult to categorise
","The film starts with someone's hair, so very carefully styled yet built on delicate foundations. A metaphor perhaps for a character that is balanced if all is where it should be, not so much if something falls out of place.<br/><br/>Irving Rosenfled (Christian Bale) is a small time conman in 1978, when he meets Sydney Prosse (Amy Adams), with her cut glass English accent and ""high society"" connections, he instinctively knows they can be of use to each other.<br/><br/>Irving is married to Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence) who represents everything Sydney is not. Rosalyn is not the sharpest knife in the drawer but has a habit of stumbling on philosophical nuggets purely by chance. The couple have a young adopted child that binds Irving to the massively dysfunctional family, whilst indulging his obvious attraction to Sydney without too much pause for guilt.<br/><br/>The pair commence a lucrative scam whereby they promise loans using Sydney's connections on receipt of a fee, the loans are not be real but the fee is and remains in their pocket.<br/><br/>All is good, despite the mixed up relationship situation, until the pair sting the wrong guy. Enter FBI low level agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper), who uses the leverage he now possesses to trawl for a bigger fish, a much larger and more dangerous catch.<br/><br/>Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner) is the basically good New Jersey mayor who falls within the web spun rather naively by DiMarco. This is a time when bribes, favours and the like was the way of doing things. To get the wheels of development turning, a little ""grease"" is often required. Carmine knows this and works the system not so much for his own advantage but for the community as a whole. As the web expands and catches bigger well connected targets, the scams involving a ""sheik"" start to snowball dangerously out of control.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence yet again proves her ability to play characters that confound audience expectations. Shining particularly brightly when miming ""Live and Let Die"" whilst cleaning the house in her yellow kitchen gloves. Bale is almost unrecognisable in both physical appearance and behaviour, his billionaire superhero left determinedly in the bat cave. Bradley Cooper adds another solid turn to his growing resume, at turns all knowing and yet wading ever deeper into a whirlpool he cannot possibly control.<br/><br/>Adams is solid, both smart, tough and vulnerable and initially accepting her role in this Shakespearean tragedy, before taking action to get what she wants. Renner as Carmine is especially good as the one decent man in the piece, albeit the one person unknowingly taking the biggest risk. The film builds to a crescendo where you really cannot fathom how the story will be tied into anything resembling a conclusion.<br/><br/>The fact that there is some satisfaction when the lights go up, is a testament to the writing, an ending that could so easily have gone another way, if the usual movie screenplay writers had their way.<br/><br/>Summary <br/><br/>A good film, although difficult to categorise, a comedy, a character study or a tragedy is difficult to say, between these three stools the films falls, not always completely successfully.<br/><br/>Certainly director David O. Russell does not make it easy for the audience, some of who may get frustrated at attempting to decide what exactly they are watching."

"michael-themistocleous","9","0","4","5 April 2014"," O Russell creates a Scorsese knock-out
","In recent years, Martin Scorsese's films have been enjoyable, but as films, it seems anyone could have directed them. Shutter Island wasn't a Scorsese. American Hustle seems to take off where Scorsese left his signature touch, with David Russell creating a great Scorsese styled film.<br/><br/>American Hustle is almost a new Goodfellas. Through a mix of drama and comedy, Russell creates a film that gives a kick to the audience. It's based off the ABSCAM scandal of the '70s. Eric Singer delivered a factual script, which when handed off to Russell, was turned into a laugh out loud, audacious comedy, which made the movie what it is.<br/><br/>One of the aspects of the film that helped create the world that it took place in was the performances. The main cast consisted of Christian Bale, Amy Adams, Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence, and Jeremy Renner. The chemistry between the cast is exactly what 2013 needed. Although it's an entirely famous cast, the focus isn't placed on them, but rather the character. Christian Bale's Robert De Niro impression may have seemed like a bit much, but once that is out of mind, his character sinks into the performances by his colleagues. Bale's character is one of the most like-able assholes since Royal Tenenbaum in Wes Anderson's The Royal Tenenbaums. This is a great accomplishment.<br/><br/>While the film starts off with a tad bit of confusion and rather slow, it does pick up pace, and when the pace is picked up, there's no stopping this comedy. The quick paced film is reminiscent of the speed of screwball comedies of the '30s and '40s. Again, this is beneficial. The film has a purpose, and it shows that it will accomplish what it needs to tell the audience.<br/><br/>Director David O. Russell is no stranger to critical acclaim, and he understands how a film should be made. American Hustle under his direction is Scorsese's gang films meeting Tarantino's off-beat comedy and dialogue. It's an unorthodox creation, but the different style really makes this movie stand-out, especially in comparison to the films being released along with it (Saving Mr. Banks, Walking with Dinosaurs).<br/><br/>Alongside the direction, another aspect of the film that just made it really stand-out was the cinematography. The director of photography was Linus Sandgren, who created a vibrant film. While the colours weren't as bright and decorative as a Wes Anderson film, they reached out and held the audience. They were colourful, big, bright, and didn't take away from the film like something as The Great Gatsby remake of this year. The shots were handled professionally, and edited together to involve the audience. From close-ups of microphones to moving shots of characters interacting, the screen gives the audience a chance to interact with the heist and scandal. Sandgren's work also shows Scorsese influence, which ties this film to the work of the great director again.<br/><br/>The weakest point of the film is the ending, which isn't all that terrible. The issues with an ending is it has to be perfectly fit to the film. American Hustle is a narrative piece, for better or for worse. Through the many monologues of Cooper, Bale, and Adams, the audience gets to understand the plot throughout the eyes of everyone with importance. While this adds depth and excitement, it is ultimately a monologue that makes American Hustle hit a low. The final monologue is a narrative to explain everything that happened at the end. As a fan of Woody Allen, writing and dialogue is always a great add-on, but sometimes things are better left to visuals, especially this ending. This doesn't ruin the film, just holds it back from absolute brilliance.<br/><br/>American Hustle is everything the trailer makes it out to be and more. It's interesting, provocative, sexy, intelligent, entertaining, and engaging. Although a different style of comedy, it finds itself among The World's End and This is the End for funniest films of 2013. It's definitely a movie to look into, and one to have a theatre experience with."

","American HUSTLE has an impeachable cast, a 70s zeitgeist ambiance (sterling soundtrack, hairstyling and wardrobe selections), a not-so-bulletproof script, but the film is nonetheless a hail of David O'Russell's consistency in his endeavour of characters-centred dramedy, he relentlessly supplies improvisations for his actors to illicit their spontaneous interactions with maximum dynamism, meanwhile his slick camera mobility complements the narrative steadily with intentional oomph to woo the audience, a strategy functions unexpectedly well after the one-two punch THE FIGHTER (2010, 8/10) and SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK (2012, 7/10), now American HUSTLE repeats the mojo, altogether ricochet him to the rarefied echelon of a three- times BEST DIRECTOR nominees, and an auteur status rosily awaits. <br/><br/>It is a con men's tale superimposed on some real events, don't wait for a revelational twist in the end, it is a flat-out chicanery hatched by pro con artist Irving (Bale) and his business partner/inamorata Sydney (Adams) dragooned by a hotheaded FBI agent Richie (Cooper), a bold plan to snare politicians to bribery through a forged Arabic sheikh who promises to invest the Atlantic City while also incriminates an intimidating mafia boss (a surprising cameo here), things may run a little off-track thanks to Irving's big-mouthed bimbo wife Rosalyn (Lawrence), but in any rate they pull off the scam and to all appearances the only collateral damage is the aspiring Mayor Carmine Polito (Renner). <br/><br/>The storyline goes high-flown all over the place, from the telling voice-over of Irving and Sydney narrating their lot to the summary engineering of the swindle, and a highly-anticipated showdown between the wife and the other woman, O'Russell never get cold-feet in pitching viewers against the heightened melodrama, plus he is also a cunning gamer of deploying ticking bombs but never ignite them, the set pieces of giving the game away (language is always a ruthless traitor) are elaborately engaging, anyhow even in the worst-case scenario, its wacky caricature can deaden the threats and we are riding on the devil-may-care road again. <br/><br/>A consecutive home-run for 4 nominations in all acting category after SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK is a marvellous feat, Christian Bale is a fervid shapeshifter, downplays Irving's cautiousness and shrewdness in the teamwork while highlights his fatal weak point, that is he is incapable of controlling his women, both Sydney and Rosalyn, his oscillation is palpable although we may feel in deficiency of sympathy for him. As much as I adore Amy Adams, her role is not entirely within Oscar-calibre, she confidently carries her story halfway through, then gives way to be a sidekick, even during the confrontation between her and Rosalyn, which should be her moment, she is eclipsed by the more coruscating Jennifer Lawrence, who is getting more and more accustomed to act over her real age, which is always appreciable and more approachable to its core audience. Cooper, a scene-stealer especially when he co-exists with a more reserved Bale, spontaneously hilarious especially when he confronts his boss (Louis C.K.) the (never-ending) fishing joke, the assault and mimic scenes are killingly comical. Renner is the unsung hero here, there is something ambiguous under his ideal husband/politician archetype and he is the one embellishes his character with a patina of the unpredictability of human nature. <br/><br/>The film is all about disguise, Irving preens his bald dome with a toupee, Sydney's fake British identity, Richie's curly hair, and who knows what is Carmine's non-shown self, the facade is a prerequisite to their self-esteem, Rosalyn maybe both the dumbest and the wisest of them all, she gets what she wants in the end and her conception of the nail polish with a scent of putridity is spot-on. <br/><br/>The best line of the film? My pick is ""it is almost scary, how easy it is to take money from desperate people"". A rude-awakening and a truism hard to swallow."

","When I walked in to see American Hustle, I expected to see a period piece with high stages, con artists, visually pleasing locations, beautiful women, handsome men, twists, plots, counterplots, bluffs and reveals, all that good stuff. Essentially a caper film with star studded cast.<br/><br/>Well... I got some of that. It certainly wasn't what I was expecting. What I ended up getting can't really be called a caper film. Sure it has all the elements of one, but the tone, the focus and the way the story was told are all vastly different. It's more of a crime comedy-drama, which isn't a flaw per se, but it's something you need to take into account before you raise your expectations.<br/><br/>The greatest strength of American Hustle is its cast. All the main actors are amongst Hollywood's finest and it shows. Christian Bale has once again undergone a mindboggling physical change and completely loses himself into the role of Irving Rosenfeld, a pudgy conman with ""an elaborate combover"". And the rest are equally as talented and they do have chemistry together.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the plot leaves something to be desired. It's not bad, really. It's just that at the moment of writing this review, about a month after watching the film, I have difficulties remembering what the story was all about. There was something about a cop trying to bust some corrupt officials, something about a sheik, that one scene with Robert De Niro (easily the best one in the movie), some marital angst, Christian Bale showing off his beer belly... And that's about all I can remember. Not a very memorable movie, is what I'm saying. The film makers clearly had an idea they were going for. They were trying to shoot a bit more realistic caper film with heavy touches of unscrupulous humour, but they ended up juggling one ball too many and the whole thing lost its focus.<br/><br/>Still, not a bad film and I'm pleased I saw it once. The productions values are really high, especially in the costuming department, the acting is topnotch and it managed to elicit a few laughs from me. If you can enjoy a movie simply for its charm and its characters, then this is an easy recommendation. But if you're looking for a clever plot with deep meanings, keep looking."

","""American Hustle"" is a fun, entertaining film. It's not serious or thought-provoking like some of 2013's Academy entries; It's not introspective, nor is it reflective. Rather, it plays much more like an ""Ocean's 11/12/13"", where the propulsion is derived primarily from the creation, growth and resolution of interpersonal relationships. True motivations, aspirations, honesty and love are what get us hooked.<br/><br/>Having recently watched two of 2013's other Oscar films - ""Gravity"" and ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" - I can honestly say that ""American Hustle"" was the most fun I had of the three. I laughed consistently, especially during many of Jennifer Lawrence's turns. I thoroughly enjoyed Louis CK's turn as Bradley Cooper's boss, consistently not knowing whether Cooper was going to earn him a pink slip or a promotion. However the character I most enjoyed was Bale's Irving; a good man with heart and a soft spot for (unstable) women.<br/><br/>The highest praise I can bestow upon movies anymore is the obvious ""re-watch"" test.

"doug_park2001","7","0","2","31 March 2014"," ""The art of survival is a story that never ends""
","American HUSTLE is a whimsical social satire on greed and the amoral rat & mouse game of FBI/governmental entrapment, with a lot of insightful stuff about the world of appearances, selfish human agendas, and the phoniness in general behind them all. Set in the late 1970s, it captures (and ridicules)that era very well, especially with its use of 70s theme music for specific scenes.<br/><br/>While American HUSTLE kept my attention throughout its two-plus-hour length, it may move a little too slowly for some tastes and could definitely use more hard tension. Much of the persistent humor is of the smirk-guffaw variety. There are also frequent attempts at lol-slapstick, but the exploding microwaves and one guy beating another over the head with a telephone just aren't particularly funny. This film would probably have worked better if it had just stuck to dry satirical humor, keeping the one hilarious exception of the impromptu after-the-big-bust party by the feds. Anyway, there are some twisty surprises here and there, not all of which are very believable, and it ties up a bit too easily at the end. Though American HUSTLE works well as light but meaningful entertainment, the fact that it just doesn't go as far and deep as it could have keeps it from being the rip-roaring success it might have been. Better plotting, more suspense, and sharper surprise elements could have won that Oscar.<br/><br/>All the same, Christian Bale (as not-so-bad-a-guy con artist Irving Rosenfeld), Amy Adams (as Rosenfeld's indispensable cohort Sydney Prosser), and Bradley Cooper (as self-serving FBI agent Richie DiMaso) give some nice performances here, with special kudos going to Jeremy Renner as Mayor/FBI target Carmine Polito."

","I'd really give it an 8.5 but closer to 9 than to 8. This isn't All The President's Men or a movie in love with itself. The statement read 'Some of the following events actually occurred' instead of Based on actual events. That should tell you what you need to know about the tone of the movie. <br/><br/>Apparently 1980 girls cuss like a sailor and dress like sluts. It is humorous. Someone said correctly ""It was a caricature of actual events."" Cooper's character is over the top which makes it more fun. I recommend if you don't mind heavy swearing.<br/><br/>Overall a fun movie. Everyone played their part well. The story is interesting."

","When David O. Russell's Silver Linings Playbook was the first film since 1981 to be nominated in the four acting categories, we didn't know history would repeat itself so soon. His film this year, American Hustle, matched that record and was leading with 10 Oscar nominations — the most in 2014, only tied with Gravity. In the end, the movie didn't win in any of the categories.<br/><br/>The film stars actors from his 2013 film, like Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper, in addition to Christian Bale and Amy Adams, and the two female actresses won Golden Globes in January for these performances.<br/><br/>The comedic story is loosely based around the FBI ABSCAM about two con artists (Bale and Adams) in 1978, scamming people through investments by posing with false identities. Things get interesting when an FBI Agent (Cooper) discovers them committing a loan scam but offers to let them go free if they can catch and incriminate other crooks in an illegal act. The magnificence of this film comes from the comedic, smart, and wild screenplay delivered by brilliant actors whom you can barely recognize from any of their past roles. The brilliantly written conversation captivates you as a true crime-drama should. Christian Bale's character of Irving is hilariously bizarre, with his comb-over and beer belly, but oddly mesmerizing. As Sydney Prosser (Adams) will say early on in the film, ""He had this confidence that drew me to him"".<br/><br/>Amy Adams is also in a role rarely seen before. As a powerful and very sexy manipulative woman, she puts any past expectations of a shy girl from her previous roles far behind her. However, the star of the show seemed to still be Jennifer Lawrence, gone from Hunger Games heroine to self-obsessed wife to Irving. Even with less screen time, Lawrence is riveting, and particularly frustrating, as she portrays an irrational and uncontrollable woman who threatens to destroy the entire plot and the lives of everyone around her. If the brilliant comedic screenplay isn't enough for you, the fantastic presence and performance of comedian Louis C.K. as frustrated boss to Bradley Cooper will please any comedy fan.<br/><br/>American Hustle has received widespread acclaim, and with good reason. The acting is spectacular, with an impeccably chosen cast. The characters are mesmerizing, and the screenplay is as witty and smart as it is funny. Although it seems to fall short of life-changing, memorable for decades to come, or filled with heart-wrenching inspiration, I don't always need or want those qualities from a movie. If you're looking to be as moved as you were when watching 12 Years a Slave, this just isn't the movie for you. But American Hustle did exactly what I was waiting for in a movie this year: it entertained.

","Just watched AH last night and I really enjoyed it. I can see why it was up for so many Oscars because it doesn't allow you to breathe. If you miss something, forget it...it's gone and then you have to rewind your DVD to watch it. There's a lot going on, but I thought Mr. Russell gave us characters that we care about, and that's an important part of any movie. The soundtrack was awesome and mixed with the movie a la Boogie Nights. I laughed a lot at Louis CK's character, and the ending was satisfying. Overall a great watch, even if you really had to pay attention to what Mr.Bale was mumbling for the 2 hours. A great 2 hour ride!"

","THE GOOD: performances, technical values, several good scenes. THE BAD: weak narrative, worst overuse of classic rock songs since ""Elizabethtown"".<br/><br/>Now that the award season is over, maybe we can move past the hype, the anti-hype, the plants, and the trolls, and have an actual discussion of ""American Hustle"".<br/><br/>David O. Russel's trait is tragicomically focusing on characters and relationships with their families, both real and surrogate (similar to Alexander Payne and Paul Thomas Anderson), and how their particular psychological issues affect those around them (a la Woody Allen). What sets him apart is that his characters' relationships are dynamic, fluid, changing. For ""American Hustle"", he attempts to marry this to a riff on ""Goodfellas"". <br/><br/>The result: while ostensibly being a fast-paced, witty, sprawling semi-biographical tale about cops, robbers, politicians, and scams in the 70s, with very stylized directing and boiling tension, it really is something else. Russell focuses on two themes, the first being how its characters deceive themselves and others, carrying facades, multiple identities, double-relationships, hypocrisies, and false beliefs about themselves - all while striving for attention and recognition. This is started with the first shot, that of a character assembling his daily false appearance. The second theme is about characters vying for power, alternating between becoming the lead player and secondary players. When they are secondary characters, they blend into the background, sulk, form new alliances, and strike back. Russell gets great performances from his actors as they navigate these dynamics, with Amy Adams perhaps getting the heaviest work-out. <br/><br/>What we get is almost two movies, going back and forth. We have some clever, well-made scenes of a con set up and its dangerous potential aftermath, and then some artfully crafted scenes where the characters bond, boil up, and fall apart. Russell rarely succeeds in getting these two movies to work together, and when transitioning, tries to throw in some stylish moves. Some of these work well, at other times he makes some awkward decisions, particularly with an overuse of the soundtrack. I liked the movie, but it would often disengage me, and I was wondering if we had arrived at the end. Some scenes felt repetitive. I am not certain is the disjointed narrative is due to the editing, or it is due to Russell re-writing a different screenplay. <br/><br/>There are more pluses and minuses. The wardrobe and set design are outstanding. However, Russell is less successful at portraying southern New Jersey (Camden is essentially East Philadelphia, but is portrayed as Newark/Western New York) than he was at portraying e.g. Boston and Philadelphia in his recent movies.<br/><br/>There are several unforgettable scenes in this movie (e.g. Adams' character's seductions of Cooper's character, the mobster interview with the fake sheik, some of Jennifer Lawrence's character's tirades of unaccountability). If only it had been glued better together."

","Two con artists get trapped in a operation by a FBI officer which aims to expose the political leaders and mafia.When this goes too far ,everyone around them gets in it and it becomes a nightmare. American Hustle is surely a win as a period movie which depicts the ABSCAM operation done during the 1970's and 80's. I never heard of this sting before watching the movie. After watching it ,i searched everyone connected to it. According to that ,this is an entertaining turn by David O. Russell,as his style. He made it funny,raunchy and clever. Great screenplay combines with marvelous actors and throw in 80's songs,you get a classic. I would specially like to state Christian Bale's impeccable acting skills,he kills every scene and dialogue.His weight gain is another treat to watch.Seriously this man is a shape shifter. There isn't any role left which is physically demanding.Hats off. The second best thing in acting,of course,Amy Adams,seductive,sexy,kinky,naughty,strong and best character. She is too good and you barely get your eyes off of her. Bradley Cooper is just the right mix of ambition and cunningness. Jennifer Lawrence's character mostly annoys but that is good thing because it was meant to be that way which means she did her job in a most best way possible.Unaware of anything what is happening ,her unpredictability creates crazy situations but she is so sweet in some scenes. Jeremy Rener play his character smartly and most accurately,the look just suits him very much.Every other supportive member is good. Just loved the cameo by Robert De Niro and the twist ending. Yes,it has its flaws but who cares ?after watching it whole they just vanish. Overall,this is exuberantly fun movie,this is how a crime comedy period drama should be made."

This reminded me of a HIGHLY GLOSSY Killing Them Softly or The Counsellor, both great movies, however this American Hustle was just such a sugar coated movie it was ridiculous. I understand the deserved nominations and awards but to me this was a long drawn out story with not too much interest sake for me other than Amy Adams. Don't get me wrong, one of my favorite actors is Christane Bale, but it was the way the movie was executed did not fully keep my attention satisfied. I found my mind wandering around during the whole movie really, thinking about why isn't it shorter, or why is there so much ""glitter"" going on when it could of been toned down.<br/><br/>Extravagant lifestyle I get that, the vision and feel they wanted to portray for this time period of when the story was happening. Not sure if I was completely sold on the environment.<br/><br/>Storyline seemed like a better book read than a movie watch. I was first tempted to buy this movie before it came out but now after watching it on the plan from Dominican Republic I am not going to buy it. A little disappointing for me, oh well.

","David O. Russell and his entire crew created one of the most impressive films of last year. Strange it was so highly honored by everybody but the Oscars. If ever there were a candidate for Best Ensemble Cast American HUSTLE wins hands down. Loosely based on the Abscam, which for those who have forgotten, 'Abscam—sometimes written ABSCAM—was a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) sting operation run from the Bureau's Hauppauge, Long Island, office in the late 1970s and early '80s. The operation initially targeted trafficking in stolen property but was converted to a public corruption investigation. The FBI, aided by a convicted con-man, videotaped politicians as they were offered bribes by a fictional Middle Eastern sheik in return for various political favors. The investigation ultimately led to the conviction of a United States Senator, six members of the United States House of Representatives, one member of the New Jersey State Senate, members of the Philadelphia City Council, the Mayor of Camden, New Jersey, and an inspector for the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service.' Given that bit of reality, Russell and cast and crew created a stingingly brittle yet funny movie.<br/><br/>American HUSTLE is set in the alluring world of one of the most stunning scandals to rock our nation. It tells the story of brilliant con man Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale), who along with his equally cunning and seductive British partner Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams) is forced to work for a wild FBI agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper). DiMaso pushes them into a world of Jersey powerbrokers and mafia that's as dangerous as it is enchanting. Jeremy Renner is Carmine Polito, the passionate, volatile, New Jersey political operator caught between the con-artists and Feds. Irving's unpredictable wife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence) could be the one to pull the thread that brings the entire world crashing down. Elisabeth Röhm is Carmine tacky wife, Louis C. K. plays Stoddard Thorsen, Michael Peña is the Mexican man pulled in to impersonate Sheik Abduklah, Alessandro Nivola is the smarmy Anthony Amado, and Jack Huston is the guy Rosalyn goes after – Pete Musane. <br/><br/>The costumes, hair, clothes, and sets mirror the tacky 70s and make us all remember how over the top we were. But setting the core of reality for this fictional movie aside, here are some of the finest acting performances on film to savour."

","FBI agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper) convinces Irving (Christian Bale) and Sydney aka Edith - Prosser (Amy Adams) to run a con on Mayor Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner) because he feels the Mayor is dirty. Later this scenario is expanded to include some members of Congress. And, still later the MOB gets involved. Oh oh!<br/><br/>While watching for the first half hour when nothing really happens except to get us to know that Richie and Edith run cons and make a lot of money, I couldn't help being mesmerized by seeing if Edith's breasts (no bra) would pop out of the thin bands of cloth covering them. This went on for quite a while. They didn't, but I focused anyway. <br/><br/>This was nominated for Best Picture. Did I agree? Not really because this should have been seamless and it wasn't. It was okay, but the real winners in here were Amy Adams and Jennifer Lawrence (Rosalyn, Richie's wife). Not to say that Christian Bale and Bradley Cooper weren't good, they were but nothing special (no Oscars for them, eh?). I don't think this movie would have been as good as it was if Adams and Lawrence were not in it. They were the breaths of fresh air for me. They made everything make sense when this meandered a bit in places. <br/><br/>There seemed to be an obsession with hair. Richie had the worst comb-over of all comb-overs and why they went with this was a mystery. I felt like screaming at him, ""get a wig or go bald"" as either one of those choices would have been better. I kept waiting for another character to brush his head in a friendly gesture. And, then there is Mayor Carmine's hairdo. It was an imitation of Steven Van Zandt's (Silvio in the Sopranos TV show) pompadour. When Jeremy Renner was on screen all I saw was his hair. As for Jeremy Renner himself I felt he felt somewhat out of place not being in a bomb suit or combat dress with an assault rifle in his hands. But, he did a good job as did everyone.<br/><br/>Humor was attempted by Richie constantly asking his boss Stoddard Thorsen (Louis C.K.) for money, a plane and hotel space to further the sting on the Mayor and the Congressmen. Oh, yes, an Arab Shiek (Michael Pena) was also involved to look like the sting had impeccable backing. The confrontations between Richie and Thorsen were not funny to me, but this is the closest they came to humor. Pity.<br/><br/>The reason I said this was not seamless was because too many of the stars in here had too much screen time and a lot of dialogues so it was hard to concentrate - as we normally would have - on the Star of the movie. They were all- of- them, the stars. See? <br/><br/>Oh, Robert DeNiro had a cameo in here. (9/10)<br/><br/>Violence: Yes, not much though. Sex: No. Nudity: No, but they came close. Language: Yes, but not too much."

Cooper is a crazy over the top not to smart agent who forces them to work for him until he gets four arrests then they are free. The first person they set up is Renner who plays a high haired New Jersey Politician who is loved and respected by his people. They make him believe that a Saudi Prince wants to invest in New Jersey.<br/><br/>Seeing Renner in this role was strange as every movie that I have seen him in recently he has been some kind of soldier but here he plays a not to bright Politician that everyone loves and he has a genuine big heart about the future on New Jersey.<br/><br/>American Hustle also shows Cooper as the way over the top FBI agent who pesters his boss and beats up his partner to get what he wants for what he thinks is going to be a huge sting bringing down mob bosses, Politicians and Congressmen.<br/><br/>American hustle 2What he doesn't realise is that he is dealing with some serious con artists who are one step ahead of him all the way. The biggest clog in their plan is Bales wife Jennifer Lawrence who is the neurotic wife and doesn't know when and what she has got in the middle of, almost giving away the con on multiple occasions.<br/><br/>As I said before American Hustle has an all star cast and not one of the big names fail to shine. Bale must have put on ten to twenty kilos for this movie. Most of that in his belly. He also has one of the worst comb over's I have ever seen. Not only has American Hustle a great cast and a great story but there is a lot of black dry humor involved.<br/><br/>I saw American Hustle in the cinema and though there are no special effects to make it any better from home viewing I still enjoyed it.

"YJLcool","7","0","2","16 March 2014"," An overly long, draggy dialogue-heavy film despite stellar performances from its casts
","American Hustle is a loose retelling (as stated at the beginning of the film, ""some of this actually happened."") of the FBI ABSCAM operation of the late 1970s that led to a few bribery convictions which involved a U.S. senator, six members of the House of Representatives, a State Senate, members of the Philadelphia City Council, the Mayor of Camden, New Jersey, and an inspector for the Immigration and Naturalization Service.<br/><br/>The story is about two con-artists, Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale) and Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams) who was forced to cooperate with an FBI agent, Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper) to arrest 4 high-flying con artists so they can be pardoned from their crimes. However, what initially seems to be an operation that targets stolen property trafficking eventually lead to a huge, elaborate public corruption investigation, which goes out of control and involved the mafia as well.<br/><br/>Sounds interesting? It seems so, on paper. In film, to commit a con job normally requires heavy exposition, to explain the elaborate plan without failing to engage the audience along the way. The film failed at doing that.<br/><br/>Despite its unexpected plot twist, the film suffers heavily due to its pacing and length. It's overly long and filled with constant, ceaseless dialogue-heavy scenes, with literally no action to provide the thrill factor, which most general audience will find it to be boring. It's all talking, talking, and talking. Acting, acting, and acting. It goes on and on...The film drags too long until when something unusual happens (the point where the operation starts to go beyond control), it's a little too late as many would have lose interest by then (fortunately not me, but quite close though).<br/><br/>Most of the actors done their utmost best, delivering their award- worthy, charming performance to the film, which is mostly the reason why the film received such critical acclaim upon its release. But, don't believe the hype. This film was no better than any of the other Oscar award-nominated films of 2013. The film does provide a few occasional laughs here and there, there's some witty dialogue delivered perfectly by actors on-screen, but that's it.<br/><br/>Overall, it's not a bad film, it's just not a solid entertainment and not nearly as much fun as you would expect it to be. It would certainly benefit the film if the director is willing to cut some of the unnecessary scenes in film.<br/><br/>Rating: 7/10 http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2014/03/movie-review-american-hustle.html"

When you look at him in this movie you forget that he has gained weight for it, that he wears a creepy wig, you forget the opening scene with the glue and the hair and the hanging belly. You see the character. A strong, fun, touching man who has a vision and is a pro in what he does. <br/><br/>The rest of the cast is good too. But one step behind. In other pluses - The Dancing scene in Studio 54 - The soundtrack - so 70s but without all the cliché."
"kumarihpx","Null","0","3","14 March 2014"," Amy Adams outshines them all - even Jennifer Lawrence
","So, David O. Russell hates plots, he's quoted as telling Christian Bale. Well that's evident from this movie. Other than a reward for ensemble cast - which is a category for some awards and which this cast did win - this movie definitely does not belong in the best film category. Consequently, you will notice that I don't mention any of the character names because I can't remember them because the plot is very thin. <br/><br/>The acting was absolutely fantastic, though. If the director set out to make a movie that simply showcased each actor, he succeeded. But, a movie really has to be more.<br/><br/>I was riveted by Amy Adams, who I find fascinating, enthralling, and very, very sexy in a fresh-scrubbed way. She was Stunning, in the literal sense, as I was actually distracted when he was on-screen: looking at her face, her eyes, her lips, her chest, her legs, her gorgeous hair, and OMG the clothes and shoes! Her acting! Just wow. I would not have it any other way, even though I missed some of the details of the movie; I'll see it again later for the other stuff. I haven't had this reaction since seeing Kristen Scott Thomas in GOSFORD PARK. Every time her face came on-screen (a lot and close-up), everything else disappeared. Same thing here. Of course, some of the shots were of just Amy's shoe. Same reaction. <br/><br/>On a side note, I could not help thinking of Julianne Moore as Amber Waves in BOOGIE NIGHTS. This was an extremely happy memory for me as its when I began to truly follow Julianne Moore's career and I haven't been disappointed since. I believe this is where I start to follow Amy's career with the same focus. <br/><br/>Amy's face is amazing because you can see everything about her character in it. And, it's so complex a portrayal that the lifting of an eyebrow or the twitch of a lip betrays some completely opposing emotion that's also happening with this character on a deeper level. Layer upon layer. I adore these complexities and it's why I love actors and great movies they are in. Amy is featured here as much more than a face; her entire body is used to tell the story -- truly shown off in ways we've never seen. And the belly button-cut dresses only scratch the surface of how revealing the camera is of her body. I know now that she's got lot of freckles on her legs, too, what her toes look like, and even as she's gotten so thin in Hollywood. I also know now that she bleaches her teeth; I don't particularly like this because it's the essence of Hollywood fake-ness now. Nevertheless, I could watch Amy all day. I plan to buy the DVD later so I can do just that! <br/><br/>I was so entertained by Jennifer Lawrence that I could barely stand it. I giggled almost non-stop when she was on screen that I actually worried I may be bothering others in the theater. Also,with Jennifer, I constantly felt tense because she was like a live wire and you never knew what she'd do next. I remember Sarah Paulson saying that working with Michael Fassbender on 12 YEARS A SLAVE was challenging / exciting because he is dangerous in his acting. Same here, though lots of times you cringe over what her character just said and did. But she's such a fun roller coaster ride. <br/><br/>Christian Bale, as always, is amazing. It's sad because he's raised the bar for himself so high that I expect nothing less of him now. I do have to note here that it disturbs me how drastically he changes his body, and so frequently, for movie roles. This can't be healthy and it seems to me kind of pointless and unnecessary. It DISTURBS me. Please stop. <br/><br/>I don't know much about Bradley Cooper but I hated his character so much I really wished he would just go away. He has giant, blindingly white teeth, so I found this distracting - but not in a good way. He was the too-loud, popular guy in school who clowns behind the teacher's back. You just want him to shut the hell up. Although, I will say that I LOVED his pseudo-perm! It really tickled me. <br/><br/>I can't stand Jeremy Renner. He was a tough face in an obvious wig. His character was the king of Con, so much so that he had conned himself with his own B.S. -- a regular politician in other words. <br/><br/>Elisabeth Rohm had a great turn in this. I was drawn to her character but could not place her face. Eventually the credits told me it was her. I'm quite happy to see her in higher quality gigs. <br/><br/>What else? Back to plot. They could he shortened the movie by leaving the DeNiro character out. He was fluff and I was not awed by his presence or anything so, MEH whatever. <br/><br/>Overall, an exciting ride but a little loose and meaningless to some extent as an overall movie. I only give it a high rating because of the superb acting and the thrill I got from seeing these performances (oh, and the clothes, too). Hilarious with Jennifer Lawrence. Grounded by the magnificent Amy Adams. All hail Amy - forevermore, a shining star."
"Jakestro","8","0","3","13 March 2014"," Good film, but if this would've won Best Picture perhaps the con would've been on us
","American Hustle is written and directed by David O. Russel<br/><br/>So, here comes what most critics like to pick as the Oscar favorite – it shouldn't be, greater films than this has been released since (IMO), however there is no denying that this film has already been laden with a ton of award nods and a good amount of award wins. Such as award wins via the Golden Globes, the SAG etc. And a good amount of nods via the Oscars, BAFTA Awards etc.<br/><br/>This could be described as director David O. Russel's own mini-avengers, he re-teams with his actors from The Fighter (Bale and Adams) and Silver Linings Playbook (Cooper and Lawrence) to bring you a 70′s period comedy/crime piece, some of which ""actually happened"", according to an on screen caption at the start.<br/><br/>Now, here's my thought and opinions on the film, but first off let me tell you that it is OK for me and you to disagree in some areas, that's what makes the film community so great and awesome. All film is subjective. That being said, let's jump in.<br/><br/>American Hustle is a good film with more comedy than perhaps you'd be expecting – BUT it's just that, a good film. Not the masterpiece critics have been raving about. Its over-the-top nature is very evident in many places of the film, and tonally, occasionally I can see how that would wrong foot the audience.<br/><br/>Lavished with Oscar nods for acting, it's fair to say that in my opinion Christian Bale and Bradley Cooper are the only ones who deserve the nods. Now, I don't think either of them deserve to win (perhaps Bale), but at least I think they both deserve it more so than Adams and Lawrence. Lawrence who I fear may be going home with her second Oscar this year, which would be undeserved for this role. Had she been nominated for HG: Catching Fire, I might have been a lot more OK with it.<br/><br/>From the start, Bale convinced me as the film opens with a long one-take scene (which I love) whilst he exerts massive effort to create the perfect comb-over.<br/><br/>Lawrence, as Irving's young wife who behaves like a brat (and admittedly brings some funny moments) plays her character kind of over the top, I got the sense of over acting, this isn't to say she was bad but definitely not as good as she is getting cred for. I mean even Jeremy Renner puts her to shame with a very quietly dignified character as someone who's trying to do the best for his people and the city.<br/><br/>Now something I think should only be used to a certain degree in a film like this, is the use (or rather over-use) of voice overs. Now, in a film like The Wolf of Wallstreet the story is told from a single and specific POV, that's why it works. It is him telling us his side of a story.<br/><br/>But in a film like this, no.. The over-use of voice overs leads to feelings of dizziness and convolution in the story. I think on some level Russel aimed at disorienting and confusing the audience, perhaps it was to take our minds away from the fact that you never really cared all that much about most characters in the film, and as the story unfolds it's almost as if Russell is determined and will stop at nothing to stop you from keeping up.<br/><br/>In fact, American Hustle is really a simple story. It is a simple story that has been put layer upon layer of unnecessary convolution. At its heart, it's about the pursuit of the American dream, but that does not shine through in the end. The movie has some pretty good comedic elements to it, and I think Louis C.K. is to thank for a lot of it. I've seen some critics call this David O. Russel's version of ""Goodfellas"", personally I think it might be his attempt at making his own classic but it does not come close.<br/><br/>All in all, American Hustle is all about the spin; ultimately shallow but with some great performances, admittedly it's a very intriguing choice for such awards success, because whilst it's still a solidly showy film, it's not a totally engrossing one, with costumes, scenery and era recreation taking centre stage.<br/><br/>Maybe best costume or set design or something like that, maybe (but not really) even best cinematograpghy.<br/><br/>But if this movie wins Best Picture, the con is perhaps, on us."

I would have liked a more straight ahead drama because ABSCAM is a fascinating case whose innovative law enforcement work and colorful villains would make a great movie in and of themselves. <br/><br/>There is some great acting in this film. Jeremy Renner conveys a lot of heart as the mayor of Camden. Robert DeNiro absolutely steals his scene as a mob boss' right-hand man. It's the best role he's had for some time. Christian Bale is so versatile and is able to completely inhabit the characters he plays. He is one of the best actors working these days. Jennifer Lawrence is great - very brave and passionate. Shea Whigham is very good in a small role business associate of Bale's character. Elizabeth Rohm is great as Renner's wife. Amy Adams is fair but she doesn't command attention in the way that Lawrence does. I don't think Bradley Cooper showed a lot of range in Silver Linings Playbook or in this. When he tries to convey anger, he just sounds desperate. <br/><br/>The film is well written and the final twist is great, but this seems like it should have been divided into two movies. The tone of the film is so uneven that I can't give it a higher rating. The plot has a lovely twist at the end, but for me, the love triangle plot line was a big distraction. Some of the awkwardness among the characters is even played for laughs which also seems to detract from the possibility of showcasing how ABSCAM was investigated. <br/><br/>David O. Russell is a fantastic director. I have enjoyed all of his films, but to me, his earlier films - most especially Flirting with Disaster and Three Kings showed his great ability to establish a consistent tone throughout complicated movies better than his last two. He needs to simplify a bit."

","SPOILER-Good fun, but too long, and not as great as its rep. The ""Dese and Dose"" accents wander, except for the British Bale, who's perfect. Anyone notice that the American Adams is faking a British accent (which is also erratic) for most of the film, while the actually British Bale is ""doing"" American for the entire movie? Despite all his accoutrements (the fake comb-over, the real pot belly), the movie comes down almost entirely to watching Bale's -or should I say Irving Rosenfeld's- sad, frightened eyes. Bale has been amazing ever since ""Empire of the Sun"" 27 years ago (one of the greatest child performances ever). For an even better slice of 70's cheese, try ""Boogie Nights"" , which is also too long."
"PatrickDelfanian","10","0","4","9 March 2014"," A strong cast of actors alongside a great writing
","If, like me, you have a thing for the 70s, American Hustle is your movie. To me, the whole thing is about the setting. A great costume and scene design and attention to details, makes American Hustle look like a movie not just set in the 70s, but from the era.<br/><br/>The movie shares the excellence in direction and acting with director O. Russell's previous movie, Silver Linings Playbook, also starring Lawrence, Cooper, and DeNiro. One cannot find a problem with acting. All the actors, especially Christian Bale deliver great performances portraying memorable characters. The achievements in acting are of course due to a great direction by David O. Russell, who in my opinion deserved an Oscar for his work on the movie.<br/><br/>Singer and Russell did a great job writing great dialogue, while avoiding the common mistakes that could happen in the movies of this genre. Though the movie uses flashbacks, many of which could not be avoided, the importance of story telling through the dialogue is not forgotten and the story is told in a proper way. Not only the have written a solid, strong con story, the paid enough attention to the drama, creating lovely characters and establishing proper connections among them.<br/><br/>American Hustle is a great journey of cons, tricks, and elaborate plans. The journey ends after two hours, but the experience is not easily forgotten."

","First of all, let me take something out of my chest. WHAT?? You have freakin' Robert De Niro in your cast of actors and you just waste him in a quick apparition? NOOOO!! WROOONG!! You don't freakin' do that!! This is the guy who was Don Corleone on The Godfather II, this is the guy who did HEAT with Pacino, this is the Raging Bull from the Martin Scorcese movie, this is one of the Goodfellas! The guy is a living legend!! How can you waste him on your movie?? How?? That doesn't exist! He's every single movie maker's wet dream! If I had De Niro in my cast I would use him, I would put him in every single solitary key scene I could think for my movie!! Specially because it's a work of fiction!! You don't freakin' waste De Niro like that!! Period!<br/><br/>Fffffffff...<br/><br/>Now that we took this out of the way, back to the movie. As I said, my only complain with this, is that one, De Niro was wasted here, I'm sorry everyone, this is soooo wrong to me! Apart from that, it's a great con movie, one of the best since the Danny Ocean trilogy or since Now You See Me from last year. I have to congratulate every single actor in it, Bale, Adams, Cooper, Renner, Lawrence, De Niro, and all the rest of the cast for the amazing and mesmerizing performances! I particularly enjoyed the subtlety with that David O. Russel showed in the movie that the three main characters had something to hide, as we see Irving in the beginning trying to set his fake hair, as we find that Amy Adams character had a different identity and as we see that Richie fakes his hair curls, so no one can be really trusted. Every single detail of the story is well thought and the story flows smoothly and even makes us laugh sometimes. Also, great soundtrack as well, going from themes by Duke Ellington to Chicago, Elton John, Paul MacCartney, Santana, George Michael, ELO, Ella Fitzgerald and many others! It's a great movie that, even not earning anything in the Oscars, I strongly recommend that you take a look at!<br/><br/>The only fatal flaw in the movie was wasting a great legend like De Niro, I just can't let that pass! Otherwise, it's worth checking out!"
"japamo","7","0","2","6 March 2014"," The Con Goes On and On and On...and So Does the Hair!
","American Hustle"" (hereafter ""AH"") is a reasonably entertaining and engrossing variation of the sturdy ""Small-Time Con Man is Pushed Into the Big Leagues"" plot. The small-time con man is the paunchy and sleazy-looking Irving (Christian Bale) with ratty hair that has a life of its own. Irving gravitates toward scams and fraudulent businesses because he remembers the racketeers and hoodlums taking advantage of his glass-selling father, and wants to be the on the winning side. Mainly he dabbles in selling art forgeries and using the proceeds to arrange phony loans to desperate customers. Somewhat amazingly, he attracts the romantic attention of a sultry, slinky red-haired distaff con artist Sydney Prosser (alias: Lady Edith Greensly) (Amy Adams). Together they stage more lucrative, but still relatively low-level scams. Irving keeps Sydney as a mistress and comforting muse and morale-booster because he is married to shrill, maritally frustrated, and seemingly dense Rosalyn Rosenfeld (Jennifer Lawrence from the ""The Hunger Games"") and has a young son by her. Almost inevitably, Irving and Sydney choose the wrong mark for one of their bogus art sales - excitable, eager, but somewhat meatheaded mama's boy Richard ""Richie"" Dimaso, FBI Agent.<br/><br/>To avoid jail time, Irving and Sydney agree to help ""Richie"" orchestrate an ""Abscam"" inspired sting operation intended to expose at least four U.S. congressmen for bribery and, I think, violation of immigration laws since a ""wealthy Sheik Abdullah"" (actually Paco Hernandez) offers to fast-track his American naturalization process for a hefty fee. Somehow, all this action also involves ""slightly unscrupulous"" New Jersey Mayor Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner) and his desire to develop waterfront property businesses and casinos to help his constituents. And that's the plot of AH.<br/><br/>Besides the reasonable pleasure of watching the scams (and counterscams and double-crosses) unfold and unravel, AH also vividly and convincingly re-creates the outlandish and kooky zeitgeist of the '70s with well-chosen '70s song classics (like Steely Dan's ""Reeling in the Years"" and Wings's ""Live and Let Die""), the occasional parties, and introduction of new gadgets like microwaves, which Rosalyn learns are hostile to aluminum foil. Especially, AH does not forget the hair styles. Irving isn't the only one with follicle trouble; his wife Rosalyn's 'do looks like yellow spaghetti; Mayor Polito has the Elvis pompadour; even FBI agent Richie (in a hilarious sequence) shows how he gets all the little curls in his hair as his mother yells at him to fix the fish tank filter. Richie's exasperated and brow-beaten FBI superior and mentor Stoddard Thorsen (Louis C.K.) provides some humorous bits as he tries to stop Richie from squandering funds on an entire hotel floor for the scam, and to relate and finish an ice-fishing experience he had with his brother as a kid. Jennifer Lawrence (as Rosalyn) is a hoot as the complaining ""bubblehead"" who nevertheless has valid objections against Irving's treatment of her and even advises him on a Plan B when one of his cons (can't remember which one) starts to go south. From time to time, AH also provides voice-overs (mainly from Irving but sometimes from Sydney) explaining his philosophy, his motivation, and the movie's plot.<br/><br/>Thus, AH has its positive qualities, but for me the movie stumbled somewhat because it fails to follow Irving's credo to work on small, simple cons. The straightforward plot starts to wind back upon itself as cons get conned and counter-conned and players get played and counterplayed. Robert DeNiro's fleeting and almost-stereotypical but expectedly effective portrayal of mobster Victor Tellegio wanting a piece of the ""Sheik""'s action actually, I humbly think, needlessly complicates matters. Eventually, at about the midway point, AH becomes, as another Amazon.com reviewer puts it, ""yawny"", and I momentarily lost track. That was unfortunate for me, because the climax and denouement of AH, with some ironic turns and fates for characters we expected otherwise that the midway point might have explained.<br/><br/>Overall, I generally recommend the movie and its various retroactive pleasures (including predicaments that could have been solved by cell phones and Internet access if they had existed in the early '70s), especially the funky coiffures. But try to keep your attention focused, because AH's con goes on and on and on, and might leave you behind if you're not careful."

"TdSmth5","6","0","3","4 March 2014"," Had the makings of a good story.
","A group of people are in a fancy hotel room in the 70s discussing some deal with a sheik. A briefcase is pushed in the direction of one of them. He gets outraged and leaves the meeting. The others push one of the guys to go after him.<br/><br/>Rewind to the beginning. Irv as child saw his father, the owner of the local window business, taken advantage off so he decided to even the score by breaking all windows he saw. As an adult he inherited the business, ended up owning some dry cleaning businesses and became a loan shark but the kind that don't give out any money, just charge a non-refundable fee to the desperate. At a party he meets Sydney who's way out of his league. But they were made for each other. All her life she dreamed of nothing but being someone else. She took on the persona of an English girl with financial connections in London.<br/><br/>Together they become better con-people and their business booms. One day one guy shows up who is way too happy for a guy out of his luck. Irv has reservations. Sure enough, he's an FBI agent. He makes a deal with the two after watching Sydney sweat for a couple of days in jail. If they con four other con-men they're free. But agent DiMaso has bigger plans. The name of a popular New Jersey politician comes up--Carmine Polito. He finds an equally ambitious district attorney. DiMaso's boss on the other hand wants nothing to do with his plans. Irv and DiMaso concoct some ludicrous plan to ensnare Polito. And Irv and Sydney plan to con DiMaso and use him. The idea is that a sheik will invest millions on Polito's plan to revitalize Atlantic City.<br/><br/>And now we're back were the movie starts. Irv runs after Polito and becomes his friend. He finds out that Polito is a genuine good guy. He cares only about his constituents and his large family that includes an adopted kid. We learn more about Irv. He has a wife and he treats her son as his own. We learn also about DiMaso. He's got a fiancée and a religious mother. Throughout this adventure, Irv and Sydney have a falling out, Sydney and DiMaso become close, Irv's wife will get them all in trouble and Irv has second thoughts about Polito taking the fall for no good reason. DiMaso sees a chance to catch not just local dirty politicians but Congressmen and Senators, who unlike Polito are all too happy to take a suitcase full of money. The mob gets involved too, since we're talking about casinos and gambling and the deal will have to be between the non-existent sheik and a Miami mobsters. Irv's wife has an affair with a mob captain. These two will provide the catalyst for the eventual unraveling of all this.<br/><br/>American Hustle starts out fairly strong, for the first hour or so. Then it runs out of steam in a spectacular fashion, keeps going for no good reason and barely recovers near the end. It's a reverse Scorsese show--the rise and fall of an FBI guy. Performances are very strong over all. Some of the situations the characters are put in a quite absurd but the actors' bravura make it work. At least, there is plenty of cleavage to make the boring half watchable.<br/><br/>When it comes to the relationship between the three main characters, the story is narrated from those three perspectives: Irv, Sydney and DiMaso. For some reason the director and editor lose sight of the main story at some point and focus on soap opera bits instead of advancing the story. When they manage to pick it up again, it's almost too late. And the way the resolution is told is surprisingly anti-climactic. There was a good story here but it's buried in non-sense. There are some good lines, too, but plenty of meaningless stuff that someone thought sounded real bright. 30-40 minutes could have easily been cut making this movie what it should have been- a smart, at time funny, and exciting drama about likable con-men, the mob, and the FBI."

","Yet another crime movie based on real events like recent 'Pain & Gain'. It was the star's collision, everyone competed with each others. Giants like Christian Bale, Bradley Cooper and Jeremy Renner fought to show their masculine strength. In another stream Amy Adams and new sensation Jennifer Lawrence had war to rule feminine parts. Overall, it is the celebration time for movie buffs to see multi stars in one screen.<br/><br/>As usual Bale's appearance did not surprise me. He's one of the actors from Hollywood who do a variety of experimental roles in his movies especially in physical appearances. Bradley Cooper had a good time recently with many blockbusters, so in a movie to share screenspace with Bale will boost his professional growth in his career graph.<br/><br/>Amy Adams is a good actress, but she's not attracted to me though she was great in this film. No doubt Jennifer Lawrence was thrown an incredible performance with her small role. Yet both are very enjoyable to watch, especially expected that particular cat fight moment.<br/><br/>Let me tell why you should not miss this movie. The cast was the great strength the movie had. Robert De Niro's guest appearance made it more fuzz and the puzzling story created lots of guess games among viewers. I must say it was well scripted by the writers and crafted beautifully by the director of 'Three Kings'."

"pcrprimer","9","0","6","1 March 2014"," Great mix of comedy and excellent acting
","Watching this after 12 years a slave was an excellent choice since you can't help but be absorbed in this light-hearted movie filled with stars. Bale once again loses himself in the character as he is barely recognizable as the overweight, balding con-man. Amy Adams also delivers as his partner in crime, while wearing a wardrobe that would make Princess Giselle blush. Not having watched any of Jennifer Lawrence's award nominated performances in the past, I was worried that she might stick out like a sore thumb amongst the great actors. I was wrong, and she absolutely delivered at the same level as the rest of cast. Bradley Cooper also showed that he has some range, and had a great Louis CK impersonation. De niro, Renner, and Louis CK are all very good in their roles. The only thing weak about the movie is the plot and script, which wasn't as tight as could be. I felt that you are drawn to the strong performances, but there is no synergistic effect in terms of story. But after having read in the trivia section about how Russell encouraged improvisation by the actors, I could see why the movie feels like it does. Fortunately, he used that as a strength of the movie. I forgot to add that the movie has an amazing, almost Scorsese- esque soundtrack. Plus the camera work had some very cool shots where it would quickly move in on the actor's expressive face from a distance. As well, although Jennifer Lawerence was good, I still don't think that she deserved the Golden Globe. Lastly, the ice fishing story was great."

Almost during the entire film he seems to be a not-so-sharp-lad, but at the same time I wondered if he wasn't capable of some surprises...<br/><br/>Then there's the greedy FBI agent, Bradley Cooper, a funny guy who beats his boss...<br/><br/>The other characters that I consider important are the pretty and dumb wife (Jennifer Lawrence) and the goodhearted mayor (Jeremy Renner).<br/><br/>Overall it's an enjoyable film, with some (few) sense of humour, a simple (with one twist) story and good acting."

Being a huge fan of 70s-80s movies I personally felt the flavor of films like Godfather, The Sting and of course The Goodfellas (almost a re-take on its screenplay).

","How can someone hate this movie? It is so perfect. Scriptwriter Eric Singer originally named it American Bullshit. That should have been the title but other than that it is a ride you don't want to miss. AH is David O Rusell's masterpiece. It talks about how we con ourselves and others to survive. The comedy is just the icing on the cake. David is the definition of Actor's Director. What he can make his actors do is not something many directors are capable of. Now the actors (Drumroll Please) Christian Bale is sporting a potbelly and a weirdly elaborate comb-over. Was it over the top? Definitely yes. Was it necessary? Maybe,Maybe not. But that does give a persona to Irving Rosenfeld. This movie shows Christian's capability as an actor. Amy Adams is so good as Sydney Prosser. Her performance of a confused but determined conner was amazing. The fact that she was confused put the WOW factor in her performance. I am a Bradley Cooper loyalist. I love most of his movies. But AH, is unlike any of his other roles. His effortless blending of comedy and seriousness was fabulous. I know Jared Leto will win the Oscar but Bradley deserves it more. Cooper was considered a Chocolate boy type of actor and this performance just tells his critics to shove it. Jennifer Lawrence's performance was the best. She was the best conner of 'em all. Her rendition of Live and Let Die was funny and dramatic at the same time. She should win the Oscar and not Lupita Nyong'o. American Hustle has a 50% chance of winning The Best Picture Oscar and not 100% because the Academy will be biased towards 12 Years A Slave. BTW this movie was much better than Wolf Of Wall Street. WOWS was a movie just showing hookers, drugs, alcoholics. It didn't have any real story. AH and WOWS should not be compared."

","Donna Summer was hot. Microwave ovens were new. Politicians were corrupt. Marriages were breaking up. Cleavages were revealing. (But were they really that revealing?) Yes, I'm talking about the seventies. 'American Hustle' is, above all, a portrait of that decade. <br/><br/>It's not just the music, the clothes and the hairdo's. It's the crazy half-heartedness of this decade, squeezed between the hippies of the sixties and the yuppies of the eighties, that's captured beautifully in this film. Everything seems messed up. Corrupt congressmen get busted by the FBI. The FBI gets conned by con men. The con men betray their friends to stay out of jail. Did anything go right in the seventies? Do we remember this decade for anything remarkable? Did anybody have any backbone? The answer from 'American Hustle' is clear. And it's negative. <br/><br/>I liked the film a lot. The story is very well-structured. It centres on small time crook Irving Rosefeld, who decides to snitch on his friend, Carmine Polito, a small town mayor with mafia connections, who eagerly accepts money from an Arab sheik who in reality is part of an FBI-setup. Sounds complicated, but it isn't really. To top it all off, there are some subplots about marital infidelity and FBI-infighting which are supporting the main storyline. I liked the way how the plots intertwine, when Irving's unfaithful wife almost destroys an FBI-operation because she can't keep her mouth shut. <br/><br/>All actors are very good, but I liked Jennifer Lawrence's performance best. She plays Irving's mindless and selfish wife Rosalyn, who refuses to divorce her husband. Her unpredictable behaviour and crazy remarks make her scenes really stand out. <br/><br/>Ten Oscar nominations is a few too many for this film, especially considering that 'The Wolf of Wall Street' got only half that number. But I wouldn't mind if it won an Oscar or two. Let's make that Jennifer Lawrence and David O. Russell."

Russell bandwagon I remember ""Three Kings"" being an enjoyable watch other than that his films don't stick with me. With the exception of ""Silver Linings Playbook"" which I haven't gotten around to watching.<br/><br/>Let me just get this out the way I am sick to death of films claiming to be ""true stories"" this cliché has been played out since the 70's, please stop! Yeah so as I said I went into this film a little apprehensive expecting the film to have over-hyped it due to the success of ""Silver Linings Playbook"". Boy was I wrong the film was a great as people say the casting left a bit to be desired I personally think Jeremy Renner, Christian Bale and Amy Adams are awful actors on the other hand Robert DeNiro, Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence are on top of their game.<br/><br/>Bale plays flabby, balding con man Irving Rosenfeld one half a of the cunning double act with Adams' character Sydney Prosser a smart talking ex-stripper with an awful English accent making up the other half. Both of whom are making a decent living from an investment scam they have going on, enough to enjoy like an support Irvings beautifully crazy wife Rosalyn played by Lawrence who spends her days looking gorgeous, spying on her husband and setting the kitchen on fire, yes more than once ha.<br/><br/>Their work however takes a very bad twist when overly ambitious FBI agent Richie Di Maso forces them to work with him for his complex undercover plan. An investigation into the corruption involving Carmen Polito New Jersey Mayor played by Renner who is a newcomer to the ever growing Russell contingent he has been creating.<br/><br/>Needless to say Di Maso uses his FBI pull to pull off one of the more elaborate plans you are likely to see based in a 70s movie. Irving not being comfortable framing his new politician friend Carmine after realising he is really a decent family guy. Like Irving the audience isn't really wanting Carmines downfall which in itself is the major downfall of the film because we are left with no true ""movie villain"" like you would expect in such a film.<br/><br/>The only really menacing person in the whole film is when De Niro makes his ""cameo"" as the Florida mobster's right hand man whom the FBI are hoping to get their hands on. In this one and only scene we see of De Niro we are given the most tense scene of the whole film when he comes within seconds of ripping the Keffiyeh (I hope that is right) off of Michael Peñas head.<br/><br/>The attempt at a love triangle with Cooper, Adams and Bale was wasn't very enticing it got to the point where I truly didn't really care who ended up with whom. I just kind of felt sorry for Lawrences character who is such a lovable bimbo.<br/><br/>Overall the film was a lot better than I had expected, I personally do not think it is Oscar worthy like some people are saying I can see this years Oscars mostly going to ""12 Years A Slave"". However, for fans of the actors and or fans of the era the film is a great watch and I highly recommend that you check it out but do not expect an emotional roller coaster like Russell given with ""Silver Linings Playbook""."

Nearly every role, from the headliners to the bit parts to the cameos, are filled by some of the hottest, most critically-beloved actors of their generation, and they clearly relish rocking their ironically unhip (and therefore hip) comb-overs and ginormous glasses and outrageous blazers and tawdry-sexy dresses. There's no denying that the cinematography and the casting and the 70s- hits soundtrack are tailored to a tee. It screams, ""Yes, I am a Big Hollywood Movie,"" and it knows it can pull that look off and we won't roll our eyes or look away. Very well, some of us will; there are those, in the run-up to the Oscars, who are calling it Oscar bait, suggesting that it's cynically ticking off the boxes the Academy wants to see ticked: Jennifer Lawrence, check; stars ""selflessly"" obfuscating themselves behind faux-ugly makeup, check; a throwback to a time today's Oscar voters are nostalgic for, check. The movie is all the more fun to watch because it has these things. But it has more than that, plenty enough to justify the awards it's gotten and the awards it will get. It's not the main plot, which is Capers 101 with some predictable twists. It's also not the gray areas or the subtexts, which by the end are surprisingly black and white and cut and dry. The extra mile is the characterizations, huge and clear-cut personalities that are also finely-detailed and reveal new layers with each scene. Everyone is flawed, but everyone is well-intentioned, and it's hard not to like all of them even as they cultivate sleazy, selfish dislikability. The characters' tangled relationships and personal battles reduce the 200 million dollar stakes of the principle con to a secondary concern, or perhaps it is more accurate to say that they give the con meaning beyond the merely monetary. In this, screenwriters David O. Russell (who also directed) and Eric Warren Singer hit the same notes that define the Coen brothers' films, except that Russell and Singer have a softer, more sentimental touch. It's ""American Hustle""'s above-average writing, and the well-above-average acting required to sell such a script, that the Academy has recognized, and not just the movie's in-vogue surface qualities and shiny package."

","I'll be honest with you and say that I expected more from this movie. It was a classic crime drama that I have seen before. The scenario was good but it wasn't special. What made this movie good was the acting. I am big fan of Christian Bale and I am very happy with how he dealt with this role. He was perfect in it. Amy Adams and Jennifer Lawrence were both great too. I was a little bit disappointed with Bradley Cooper because he didn't quite fit into the role he played, but that is from my point of view.<br/><br/>Anyway the film is good.

","The movie was fantastic, Amy Adams and Jennifer Lawrence are my favorite actresses and they exceeded my expectations. When Rosalyn starts dancing around well cleaning it just showed that she is indeed a little off and not the best mother or wife. I loved Bradley Coopers permed hair, it really tied into the 70's vibe along with the no bra rule. But the show was stolen away by Christian Bale, what a great actor, he can go from Batman to a con artist without being associated to either one of them. Even though he was less attractive with the extra weight his acting made everything that much better. Please go see the Oscar nominee and Golden Globe winner, they won for a reason. Great movie, a must see if you love a compelling story and intriguing characters."

","I'm not sure how much of the story is true, it doesn't really matter to me. <br/><br/>All I can say about ""American Hustle"" is that it had a lot of energy, good acting (especially Christian Bale), three-dimensional characters and a good enough story to keep my interest until the end.<br/><br/>Keep in mind that this is a comedy at heart and I can not help but notice the similarities with ""The Wolf Of Wall Street"". While there are noticeable differences in style, the two movies can easily be considered spiritual-cinematic-siblings. <br/><br/>I recommend ""American Hustle"" to a mature audience with a (mature) sense of humor and appreciation of good acting."
"billygoat1071","8","0","1","8 February 2014"," Fascinating Trick
","American Hustle begins with a title card written ""Some of this actually happened"" which in mind immediately indicates that the film doesn't entirely care about the actual events of the Abscam scandal and rather follows its more comfortable storytelling as an acting playground meant to win awards. The ambition was neither breaking any grounds nor trying to be complex, but to deliver what the director and the actors do best, plus taking those pleasures to a pulpy setting. Nevertheless, it's a very entertaining film and whatever it ended up might be exactly what the film itself wants.<br/><br/>If you've seen director David O. Russell's last two films then you may know what you're going to get. Unpredictably, the characters are the center of the plot, but now each of them shows their own perspective by narration and backstories, mashed together to move the process of their schemes. Their personal struggle and moral dilemmas aren't exactly as subtle as it deserves, the film's biggest interest is to add humor and flavor within the situation, but it manages to make it a lot interesting because indeed that is what the movie does best.<br/><br/>But that does not mean it never gets to be serious, the deepness is mostly relied on the performances. Christian Bale somewhat transcends by embracing whatever his character needs to be and he handles it excellently. Amy Adams is best when she's expressing the confusion and pain of her character, result as a great enough performance. Bradley Cooper once again shines by his charisma. Jennifer Lawrence brings her natural energy which makes her role's unhinged personality rather effective. It's inevitable to mention how the direction attempts to make its own Goodfellas, but I guess the film is having fun imitating the style. The rest of the surface is just covered with stuff worth of gold.<br/><br/>American Hustle is pretty self-indulgent, glossed over with rich production. It's definitely not a bad thing, but there are things that could have been somewhere much farther, but again the film doesn't seem to care. It just wants to be stylish and ironic, giving plenty of life by its terrific actors. Some might think it's a scam for not taking the history seriously, but look, there is a humorous opening title card and a glowing quality that will blind the audience from its lack of depth. American Hustle is not perfect, but it's a fascinating trick that is worth seeing."

","The story set up in the 70's when a con man named Irving Rosenfeld and his seductive partner, Sydney Posser, are forced to work for a FBI agent, Richie DiMaso. He pushes them into a world of powers-brokers and mafia. <br/><br/>In this Choral Polar D. O'Russell is paying a tribute to Scorsese cinema. One of the most overwhelming fact about this film is the cast transformation and how amazing all their performances are. We knew already that all those actors are great and in this film each and every one of them play their part and they play it well. Dialogues are efficient and seem quite natural, maybe because O'Russell already worked with them before, know them and how they could play it. Characters are dealing with issues such as reinvention, ambition and manipulation. Irving and Sydney are successful in their business as they keep it small enough and simple. However when the FBI agent starring by Bradley Cooper appeared, he's bringing them into a whole new level as he's eager to level up an be remembered. Our Bonnie and Clyde of the 70's are founding themselves in a very complicated scenario. On the one hand Irving starred by Christian Bale pop out as the mastermind who came out with plans. On the other hand Sydney (Amy Adams) is empowered by her sexuality over men characters: over Irving but mainly over FBI Agent DiMasio. In fact, it's crazy to see that so much things happened and actually work predictably at the end. There's so much events going on in the same time, that viewers could be finding themselves a little lost at some point. Finally American Hustle is solid, awkward and funny though I don't see the point to nominate it for best comedy. <br/><br/>It's entertaining and pretty well edited."

","The acting was very well done by all the main character. Particularly Jennifer Lawrence did a good job, she was hilarious (Golden Globe well deserved) and this did not surprise me. However Jeremy Renner surprised me a lot with his performance in this movie. So far I never liked him but he played his part very well. You could not dislike his character Carmine. In fact he made me feel sorry for Carmine.<br/><br/>Before I get into that, what is the movie about? Well, this story takes place in America, late 70's early 80's (which explains the wigs). The main character, Irving Rosenfield, is a small con man who grew up in the Bronx. He learned how to survive (in expense of others if I might add). He is married to Roselyn. He married her because she was a single mom and he wanted to do her good. He adopted her son, Danny, and loves him like his own. When Irv meets the lovely Sydney Prosser they start to broaden their audience and are very successful with their cons. Until Richie Dimaso walks in, an FBI agent. To get out of their jail time, they have to bring in four other cons. They start small but once Richie gets involved it gets bigger and bigger until it runs out of control.<br/><br/>This movie made me very anxious. I got goose bumps because of the way they try (and succeed) to sell products that don't exist, sell people, use people and don't really care what happens to those around them, like Carmine Polito. Awful story of how ugly situations can get when you don't watch out or aren't careful."

I couldn't believe it was her. I saw her in Hunger Games and that did little to allow her to spread her wings. What a wonderful future this young girl has. Hunger Games was OK for the kids I guess and it would be difficult for anyone to rise above the tripe that franchise espoused. I couldn't get by one hour of the first one!

I can't really say what exactly, the word 'action' is not right, but I don't know how to say it another way.<br/><br/>Several times during the movie I found myself a bit bored. Lots and lots of dialogues, which isn't necessarily a bad thing but just is not something I am a big fan of. Of course I did not go to this movie with the mindset of an action-thriller, but still I missed some tension during the film.<br/><br/>I, however, did really like the end of the movie.

"softball2","7","0","1","2 February 2014"," Not necessarily Oscar-worthy but an entertaining time at the movies.
","I hardly ever write reviews, but a lot of the negativity about American Hustle got me riled up. I believe that some people write bad reviews just to show their superiority about their understanding of film. A lot of the reviewers on IMDb give the movie a 0 or 1 and talk about walking out in the middle of a movie. I rarely see anybody walking out of any movie, so I'm thinking that they're just making this up. Just enjoy a night out and don't be so serious.<br/><br/>With my rant out of the way, I'd like to give a thumbs up (but not an Oscar-worthy thumbs up) to American Hustle.<br/><br/>I really think that most of the bad reviewers didn't understand what the movie was supposed to be about or had misconceptions about it going in. I don't think David Russell was looking to make another mobster or crime movie. It was all about the characterizations and little about the plot. During the movie, you weren't always sure who was conning who and I think that's not a bad thing. People's motivations are not always black and white. The soundtrack, sets and costumes really caught the spirit of the time. The dialog, while sometimes too loud and difficult to make out, felt real.<br/><br/>Christian Bale's Irving Rosenfeld, while not necessarily someone you'd want to spend some time with, was a totally unique individual. Anybody who says that Amy Adam's character didn't have a lot of sex appeal probably has low-T. Bradley Cooper's FBI agent was a bit over the top, but entertaining as well. Louis C.K., as Cooper's boss, was great. And Jennifer Lawrence is Jennifer Lawrence, 'nuff said. Kudos also to Jeremy Renner, who was perhaps the most sympathetic character of them all.<br/><br/>Sure, the movie was bit overlong and sometimes confusing to follow. However, the brilliance of the acting held my interest. There were also a lot of funny moments (particularly scenes with Jennifer Lawrence and Louis C.K.). I can't figure out how people say that they didn't laugh at least once.<br/><br/>Overall, it wasn't the greatest movie that was ever made (like some serious reviewers think), but it had so many good things going for it. I give it an entertaining 7 out of 10."
"chaos-rampant","Null","0","1","2 February 2014"," Were they always the same two?
","It is a year of American excess in film: Spring Breakers, Wolf of Wall Street, The Canyons, Bling Ring, this.<br/><br/>The shape this excess takes here is con-men creating stories of entrapment, fictions, but finding themselves intimately vulnerable in them. Both as we watch, and even more powerfully in retrospect of the whole thing, we are able to see that for example when the girl exposes her real identity to the FBI guy, it may be a con as well as a genuine opening up. It can be both at the same time and there's no way to know, so we find our own selves caught in that ambiguous simultaneity. <br/><br/>It's always an illuminating opportunity to observe truth in the middle of illusion. Illuminating because nearly every aspect of life is propped in this way, we always take the first leap into a role (be it a job or an affair), creating or entering a commitment that will allow us to invoke a self worthy of it. I may doubt myself, for example that I can make a good lover, but even that must be built on having decided to find out. We build the ladder that will get us up there means we have already made the decision to get there.<br/><br/>I leave out the irony of the main story, where the FBI agent is the ambitious shark and the politicians being bribed are essentially trying to speed up what's good and needs done, creating jobs. That's fine, an extra tension here, goodness as a matter of how far you follow up a story.<br/><br/>The main thing here for me is that slippery edge of personal truth. Is Bale's character 100% faking his jealousy over the kiss?<br/><br/>Yet look what happens. The elaborate con, the fact so much time is given to it and we go through so many situations, cons us the fragile tension of simultaneous truth only to substitute it with a logical one in the story: people being conned (politicians and mob). <br/><br/>When he pulls the rug from under our feet in the end, as con films usually do, we stick to the construction of a retrospective simple truth of them having been in control the whole time. I miss the question, how much of their love was tangled up in the mess they leave behind? Are they same two?"

True, performances are catchy - particularly Christian Bale as Irving Rosenfeld, Bradley Cooper as FBI Agent Richard ""Richie"" DiMaso, Amy Adams as Sydney Prosser / Lady Edith Greensly, Jennifer Lawrence as Rosalyn Rosenfeld, Robert De Niro (uncredited) as Victor Tellegio - characters have comical behaviors and lines, but the plot is uneven at times, the thrill fades away, and several activity lines do not provide additional value to the whole story, contributing the length only.

"khanbaliq2","8","0","2","2 February 2014"," Some of this actually happened. So what?
","Only a year after the successful Silver Linings Playbook director David O. Russell delivered another comedy-drama. American Hustle is overall a good film but it's a step down for Russell because it's not as original or entertaining as Silver Linings Playbook or The Fighter. Russell's and Eric Warren Singer's screenplay has two interesting characters. They're Rosalyn Rosenfeld and Carmine Polito. Jeremy Renner, playing Carmine, is likable as usual in his role. He brightens the proceedings every time he's on screen, and it's not only because of his hair and suit. Renner is definitely one of the best and most charismatic actors in Hollywood. Jennifer Lawrence, playing Rosalyn, is really the star of the film. Like Amy Adams she wears a number of revealing dresses but, unlike Adams, she's young and she looks like a hottie in them. As to be expected her acting is excellent, but she's also the focus of the film's humor. The other three leads in the film are less interesting characters. However, they've been given the most screen time. I consider Christian Bale to be a good actor. He's just not an outstanding actor. Sure, he takes his work very seriously and he has been very effective in some of his roles. But in American Hustle he doesn't bring much charm to Irving Rosenfeld. Russell's screenplay doesn't help because Irving is neither likable or interesting. The screenplay also suffers from a lack of originality. It recalls Fargo (1996) and Goodfellas (1990). There are clever or funny lines here and there but overall it's not that interesting or well-meaning. Its real strength is in its outlandish characters. Amy Adams and Bradley Cooper have the same problems as Bale. Adams does a good job portraying Sydney's emotions though, and Cooper infuses Richard with his usual energy. I'm not a fan of Russell's direction or Linus Sandgren's cinematography. American Hustle is an intelligent film but it's just not that compelling. The story and the characterization needed to be better. I think that Jennifer Lawrence should have had a bigger part, just like in Silver Linings Playbook. I recommend American Hustle. My recommendation isn't enthusiastic though."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","0","2","1 February 2014"," Two times two plus one more (and then.)
","Don't be late if you do not want to miss what has been unabashedly publicized – how Christian Bale sacrificed his looks by acquiring a pot-belly that was a part of his 50 pound weight gain, as well as a head with barely discernible hair. Well, the pot-belly you get another chance to see in a later scene showing him sitting opposite Amy Adams, soon after their respective characters made their first acquaintance. However, the delicious scene showing the elaborate creating a full head of hair with glue, synthetic and real hair comes only at the beginning. However, if you ask me, any and all of these sacrifices made by performing artists in the name of performing arts are completely and conclusively dwarfed if you have seen Charlize Theron in Monster (2003).<br/><br/>The plots develop along two dimensions. First, there a convoluted heist some of which have actually happened, as playfully intimated at the opening credits. Based on an F.B.I. project in the 70s but with all real names changed, it tells how agent Richie (Bradley Cooper), in exchange for passing up a sure-win prosecution, forces con couple Irving (Bale) and Sydney (Amy Adams) to join him in cooking up a con trap (involving a phantom super-rich sheikh) to round up a corrupt mayor (Jeremy Renner) and half-dozen Congressmen. A delicious addition to form a quintet is Irving's estranged (but no luck in divorcing) wife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence). Supporting this top-notch quintet is a marvelous ensemble which leads me to wish that this movie will be rendered into a musical someday.<br/><br/>The other is a love story (or love stories, as there are complications). The very moment Irving and Sydney meet, they are magnetically attracted to each other. Through alternate VOs from these two love-at-first-sight victims, we get the feeling that it's akin to two bridge players who perfectly understand each other's bid without even checking systems in advance, or two opera singers who strike up a perfectly harmonious resonance with the very first note coming out of their vocal cords. This made-in-heaven match however is not without vicissitudes. The charismatic charm of Richie is one reason and, believe it or not, cluelessness has a certain charm of its own as Rosalyn steadfastly insists on clinging onto Irving's life.<br/><br/>The summary line refers to the two lineups David O. Russell assembled from his two recent successful movies (between which were 6 Oscar acting nominations producing 3 wins): Bale plus Adams from ""The fighter"" and Coopers plus Lawrence from ""Sliver lining playbook"". ""One more"" is Renner. Finally, ""and then."" refers to a terrific cameo for which the film promoters, critics, as well as IMDb, are at pains to hide the credit. As a responsible audience, I am not going to ruin the fun. The character is indeed a cameo, one top gangster who in his hit-man days 20 years ago was best known for not burying his fine work to make sure that a point is made. By saying as much, I am afraid I have already let the cat out of the bag."

","With all the hype surrounding American Hustle, people are going into it expecting the next Citizen Kane and trust me, it is far from perfect. The plot is ridiculously hard to follow, but the acting is what is this film's saving grace. Forget a plot, it doesn't exist with this film. There is no clear cut storyline and anything that matriculates to something remotely close to a plot is left hanging high and dry. However, this is not a bad thing. To its credit, Christian Bale and Bradley Cooper are impeccably cast and Amy Adams shines in a career high point role. Jennifer Lawrence is wildly entertaining in this film despite being miscast in a role that was clearly geared towards a much older actress. The real star throughout this film is Jeremy Renner. His performance is being criminally underrated by critics and audiences alike, in my opinion and deserves some sort of recognition especially with a heart breaking scene between him and Bale at the end of the film.<br/><br/>Overall, this is an entertaining and brilliantly directed film that seems to have thrown out its script in the middle of production. Either way, American Hustle is entertainingly flawed despite the ridiculous hype behind it. David O. Russell directs the hell out of every scene and chews through each frame with electrifying camera-work and brilliant acting which keeps this film from being a total wash. This is a great film but has garnered some pretty ridiculous raves from critics of all sorts where The Wolf of Wall Street (which is a better film in my opinion) has not. But, for what it's worth, check this film out, you won't be disappointed."

","Those viewers with long memories might notice resemblances between David O. Russell's film and George Roy Hill's THE STING. In both works, the principal center of attention is on the psychology of conning; how people can render themselves perfectly plausible to their victims and get away with it. However there is one important difference: whereas the earlier film took a jokey approach to the subject-matter (complete with Scott Joplin-inspired ragtime score), American HUSTLE takes a long hard look at the lives of Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale) and sidekick Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams), and shows how their lives are fundamentally empty. Although Rosenfeld protests his enduring love for his wife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence), it's clear that his main focus of attention is on sustaining the con. When it threatens to get out of hand, he tries to withdraw, but finds himself unable to do so. Likewise Sydney; although she is a masterly impersonator of a British aristocrat, she has nothing much else to fall back on. In the world of late 70s New York, it is every person for themselves - even the cop Richie DiMasso (Bradley Cooper) is out to exploit everyone around him. In the end, Irving and Sydney come to a decision - the only way to extricate themselves from difficulty is to plan the ultimate con. Their lives will not improve as a result, but at least they will be safe for a while. American HUSTLE is a long, controlled, brilliantly acted movie. Director Russell's camera focuses on the protagonists in minute detail, taking a long hard look at their relationships, while suggesting that such relationships only work if the con works successfully. If the con fails, then relationships come crashing down. The late Seventies New York atmosphere is brilliantly evoked; the city is both attractive yet terribly seedy, a place where only the fittest survive. The soundtrack, with hits from the period, only serves to enhance this mood. This film has been nominated for several awards, and justifiably so."

","I enjoyed the film immensely. I'm surprised by the negative reviews listed below. But if your basing your decision to see the movie purely on them, please, don t be swayed by this negativity, for its both unfounded and wrong. This is a wonderfully entertaining movie with a terrific plot and fine performances. I especially enjoyed the complicated love triangle between the main character, con artist extraordinaire Bale, and his secret lover, and partner-in-crime Adams, and how they navigated the tricky terrain with his despised floozy wife, who used the son as a bargain chip, and which ultimately kept him tied to her, creating enormous tension and frustration between him and his true love, Adams; who wanted him all to herself, naturally. This is a accurate portrayal of millions or love triangles the world over. I thought this film did justice to these very human dilemmas.<br/><br/>I also enjoyed the central theme of the film which was about 'hustle' or conning and master manipulation. The way the two characters of Bale and Adams enacted these 'roles' to trick an unwitting public to part with their money for fake art or as a hefty fee for a large personal loans the debtor would never receive. That aspect of the film was truly entertaining very interesting on a psychological level, for its people like that, The Bernie Madoffs and Wall-street-wolfs of this world, who do that exact same thing. These are the sort of people we need to be watching out for! Thanks Film for the heads up! <br/><br/>Anyway, The main character I found endearing and very human, for his loyalty to those who really mattered in his life: son, girl friend, city-mayor mate; his thieves honor, and instinct for survival. He was a fully realized character, flesh and blood, all thanks to a spell binding performance by Bale. To begin with it annoyed me, all these overly-contrived mannerisms Bale used to get into character, all the eye glass adjusting and staring at the floor, but after thirty minutes those mannerisms took on a life of their own, and represented the man in some essential, fundamental way. Stand up performance, I'll say no more on that point.<br/><br/>Amy Adams was sexy and wonderful and brimming with mistrust and confused but intense emotions for her married, in a sense unattainable lover. Her love and desire for him was visceral and genuinely-felt. Jennifer Lawrence was spectacular, but has too much of a baby face I felt to play a mother. But she nailed the slightly unhinged, needy mother character. I don't really like Bradley cooper as he always plays the same person, cocky bratty rich boy, and he played this guy in this movie. But maybe that's why he was cast, as he could never really penetrate the intrigues and trickiness of the desperate duo of Bale and Adams, who were under his thump but always two steps ahead, and taking him for a ride most of the time; he was too simple-minded to understand the depth of their swindle and manipulation. Cooper conveyed this clueless, simplicity-of-mind, well. His comic relief moments I found juvenile and beside-the-point, and they took away from the rhythm and seriousness of the film. I.e., Bradley cooper, goes and knocks his boss out with the edge of a telephone, the comedian CK Clark, and screams epithets down the phone in a coke-fuelled fit of rage because he doesn't get his way, Wow that's so damn funny! NOT! The few comics scenes present contributed nothing to the film and should have been edited out, or redone. De Niro's cameo as real-deal Mob Boss was visceral and unnerving. Renner playing a warm, socially-conscious Italian-American was also a nice touch."

So, after this two huge successes I have to confess that I had tremendous expectations for ""American Hustle"". Adding to this, I have to confess that having Christian Bale, Amy Adams, Jennifer Lawerence and Bradley Cooper in the cast was one strong reason for having great expectations. <br/><br/>""American Hustle"" is basically the story of a couple (Christian Bale and Amy Adams) which is forced to work for a FBI agent (Di Maso) who wants to capture some of the most powerful criminals including politicians and mobsters. A story about power, corruption and love where the huge wish of Di Maso puts everyone lives in danger. <br/><br/>Christian Bale's character, Irving, was so wonderful to see on the screen. It was full of life and confidence and his relationship with Sydney (also brilliantly played by Amy Adams) only reinforced the strength and power of his character. A lovely couple with a troubled relation. Most of their problems were caused by Irving's wife (played by Jennifer Lawrence) who manipulated Irving, forcing him to stay with her and with their son. <br/><br/>But when Irving and Sydney met Di Maso, their lives are turned upside down and they have to fight for their lives while they are helping the FBI on this huge case. <br/><br/>""American Hustle"" it's therefore, more than just a story of a con man that hustles to survive. Its the story of four characters that hustle to survive. And it's not difficult to understand why all the main actors/actress are nominated for Oscars. <br/><br/>I was so amazed with the atmosphere of the film right from the beginning. It was captivating, powerful and fun. It was an excellent film that confirms again that David O. Russel is a talented director. With such amazing characters and a wonderful story, ""American Hustle"" it's, without any doubt, one strong contender to this year's Oscars."

","American Hustle is a very good movie. The script is well written, and the acting is very good. Among the performances, Christian Bale was superb as a con-man whose tricks become unhinged with time, Amy Adams was sexy yet vulnerable, Bradley Cooper made some comic scenes work extremely well while Jeremy Renner was a true delight as the naive Mayor. It's funny, I never thought Amy Adams was hot, but American Hustle totally converted me. Her cleavage should have also been nominated for Best Supporting Actress. I really enjoyed this movie, I think it's one of the big favorites for the Oscars. I can't understand how some people can say this is a bad movie, the acting and writing is great."
"hkauteur","7","0","1","26 January 2014"," HK Auteur film review - American Hustle
","David O. Russell's latest caper American Hustle is fundamentally more interested in its characters than doing anything with them.<br/><br/>The story is a fictionalized account of the FBI ABSCAM operation in the late 1970s. Irving Rosenfield (Christian Bale), a con man, falls in love with Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams), and the couple start running a con operation together. Everything seems perfect at first, but Irving refuses to leave his adopted son and wife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence), who refuses to divorce him. When FBI agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper) catches Irving and Sydney in a loan scam, they are forced to help him make four arrests for their release.<br/><br/>What happens with the characters never matches the depth of their characterizations. As the narrative switches perspectives and cross-sections into the inner monologue of several characters, it keeps the viewer perpetually wondering who is the main character of the story. The con, or more specifically the plot, is cast to the side. The joy of watching the construction of the con is not present; O. Russell is not interested in those nuts and bolts.<br/><br/>Christian Bale, Amy Adams, Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence are all very good and very free in their parts. Louis C.K. even has a funny supporting role as Bradley Cooper's FBI superior who is frequently bullied. Despite of the nominations, the acting is not Oscar worthy. It just seems like it should be.<br/><br/>O. Russell directs like an acting coach running a class exercise, having the actors improvise scenes and go off script to no end. The scenes do feel raw and unrehearsed. At its best, energy is building and chaos seems to be imminent, like a lit fuse burning its way to the end of a dynamite stick that we cannot see. At its worst, it feels plodding and going over information we already know. The inverse effect is it makes the actors, as good as they are in their parts, look like they are playing dress up. So as much as it wants to be an anarchic character study, the final result is oddly shallow.<br/><br/>American Hustle does not quite live up to its awards hype. The truth is, it was over-hyped from the beginning, and somehow David O. Russell has everybody believing he has made something good. Or somehow the people just want to believe he has made something good. Good for him, but I really doubt anybody will be talking about this film six months from now when the hype dies down. <br/><br/>For more reviews, please visit my film blog @ http://hkauteur.wordpress.com"

","Not-too-dramatic/not-too-thrilling crime tale carried by an ensemble of lead actors from Russell's previous films THE FIGHTER and SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK based on the ABSCAM operation from the late-'70s/early-'80s which includes sting operations on corrupt politicians, perms and comb-overs! Everything in this outing is a little too easy: the humor is simple, there are no extraordinary characters despite a cast of A-list-ers, and the plot is rather bland. Despite all the so-so, it all comes together to be a slightly-above-par flick that is worth having a look to judge for yourself.<br/><br/>*** (out of four)"

","In a sense the film is just like its characters. For example, Christian Bale's comb over hairstyle for the movie describes it perfectly: elaborate, misleading, entertaining, and attempting to be something it's not. First off, the film looks great and presents it's self well, like the characters do, but it's all there to just make up for what it lacks underneath, which is heart and substance. The film prances around too vicariously in an attempt to find it's footing between a good looking comedy to portray the theme of pretending to be something more while being empty inside, or being a drama with an awkward pacing and strange comedic timing in an act to seem sincere in proving it has something to say. Overall, 'American Hustle' is pretty solid with great performances, set designs, and a stellar wardrobe department but is definitely a hit or miss depending on how you look at it. Some of it works for me, some of it doesn't. Even though it's not David O. Russell's best work in comparison to his others, it's still pretty entertaining."

","This is an exceptionally difficult film to score - there's lots to like here and lots to loathe.<br/><br/>Arguably, the same could be said for Wolf of Wall Street except the editing here, though not great, isn't up to the tragedy level of WoWS (did they cut *anything* from that film???) so there's still stuff in here that coulda/shoulda been cut or improved.<br/><br/>The script, like the acting and the direction is both good and bad at times and how much you are affected by the good/bad on offer here will be totally down to personal sensitivities and will make this either a completely ordinary or a reasonably entertaining experience for you.<br/><br/>For me, both Cooper and Bale were outshone by their female counterparts - Cooper I found intensely irritating throughout - Bale's role is by necessity less showy but it's a mixed performance for me with elements of his Patrick Bateman performance showing through all the extra hair, makeup and glasses etc.<br/><br/>Amy Adams is extremely sexy to be sure but the director spends so much time luxuriating over her body (and for some reason her legs and feet - perhaps he shares my fetish ...) that anything that may be notable about her performance was lost to me.<br/><br/>The real acting kudos here goes to Jennifer Lawrence who I think stood out in almost every scene she was in and I'll be looking out for her future work ...<br/><br/>All in all, this is worth a view but you probably want to leave your brain at the entrance and pick it back up on the way out ...<br/><br/>Like many ""big"" films recently, the general standard of how well the film was *crafted* seems to have slumped to levels I've not seen since the late 1970s.<br/><br/>This is something I've witnessed in films like Gatsby(what the hell?? Awful!!), Wolf of Wall Street (45 minutes of worthy stuff stretched out for three hours) and 12 Years a Slave (decent but massively over-hyped with a weak script) - is it all getting just a bit too easy for folks up in Hollywood these days cos someone, somewhere, sitting atop this stuff is falling short in their duty imo ..."
"teajel","8","0","2","25 January 2014"," ""American Hustle"",O.Russel tasteful and brilliant takes on the line of morality issue.
","The Endeavour of a stylish and captivating acting make up for a very much interesting and fun around joyride with some sense of morality issue. In the line between right and wrong lies a complex sense of pleasure and justice. There is a sort of entanglement that sometimes confusing and hard to choose one ""right"" thing over another. The bigger picture is the world is not black and white, yet certainly ""grayish"". A theme like this is nothing new in the world of Hollywood cinema, either in the past or present. It is almost revisited on a yearly basis and most of the time it turns out to be a let down or plays out on over pretentiousness. Fortunately enough, this is not one of it due to a clever storyline and bold direction of David O Russel.<br/><br/>While it isn't entirely based on any factual history or rather infamous past events, Some of it is inspired by an FBI operation in early 1980 called ""Abscam"", which involved a fake Arabian from a part of New York to trapped some major player who conducted big corruption that eventually led to exposure and prosecution around those circle of involvement. Whether it was a success or a bust, the story didn't focus on its truth. Instead, its revolves around an experienced con-man named Irving (Christian Bale) in verge of pulling the biggest con of his entire career of conning innocence people in the purpose of setting up a bait for FBI to trap a corrupt, yet naive Major Carmine (Jeremmy Renner) from city of Camden. As Irving prepares for the meeting with Carmine, he is washing his face along with the calm before song ""Horse with No Name"" by famous early 70's folk band America. With helps from his attractive mistress named Sydney and FBI Agent named Richie who planned the idea and controlled the operation. As the meeting went down Irving, Sydney, and Richie sit down with the major to persuade him to take the money that they have planned before. In a sudden way, the mayor begin to feel uncomfortable by Richie nervousness and resulted in his rejection toward it before leaving in emotion. Afterwards, Irving immediately angered and blaming Richie about the failure. In reverse plot of show and tell, Irving then describe how he eventually walk into the situation. In a subtle way of how he began as a con before his first encounter with Sydney and his entrapment of a false marriage with his obnoxious wife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence), how he manage to maintain it because of his beloved son and his principal of playing it safe.<br/><br/>It opens up in a very stylish way as of Scorsese gangster movie. one particular that closely resembled is ""Casino"". The three musketeers of con artist that consist of Christian Bale,Bradley Cooper,and Amy Adams are already a scene to be captivated. As it capture how these three gifted Actors enters the picture before they goes on to the roller coaster ride of mixed emotions. as the story progress,it becomes prominence that the star-studded cast has seamlessly integrate within each scene. The leading character arch is Christian Bale brilliant portrayal of Irving. Bale's method acting signature hasn't been tiresome or predictable, instead his control of the character has elevated the film emotion through his given perspective. Whether in his downfall of self-entrapment in relationship or when his money making trickery hit a jackpot His performance could easily conveys sympathy and sometimes a necessary laugh. Another high remark goes to Amy Adams captivating performance as Bale's partners in crime. Adams could easily switch from being witty into more dramatic approaches toward her character. another example of brilliant method acting is shown through the show-stealing performance from Jennifer Lawrence as Irving repulsive wife, yet also annoyingly funny most of the times. a credit is due for Lawrence perfect comic timing and moody portrayal. it is one of the reason why the movie is also genuinely hilarious and honestly ironic. in part of another supports,Bradley Cooper is also a solid addition for the cast excellence. despite being overlook,his witty improvisation and straight forward sarcasm is also due for a credit."

Jennifer Lawrence seems to be all the craze right now and her plays a great crazy. I could definitely see multiple Oscars being won for this one. The love story is something not seen very often in films of today and proved to be very unique. Compared to Wolf of wall street movie I would definitely say American Hustle takes the cake for best crime drama of the year.

I am a huge fan of her work, the only regret I have of this film is that I didn't see enough of her in it. Seldom do you see actresses in Hollywood play a character 10 years older than her actual age, and JL does it with incredible accuracy. I am as big a fan as there is of JL but I want to give a shout out to Amy Adams as well, she is spledid in this role.

"rukeen","8","0","2","21 January 2014"," Lack of gripping accompaniment, but still hustle
","American Hustle appeared to be very stylish, musical and funny piece of cinema. However impression is mixed as, on the one hand, you are led to believe that the situation of our main heroes is complicated and bloody dangerous. On the other hand, soundtrack is super positive all the time, mood is too good for something really bad to happen. I personally found the movie much less intriguing than it might have been according to the story, it also could have been shorter. Don't get me wrong, I really liked the soundtrack and sharp-witted dialogues, the plot is also not on the surface. It's just the strange mix of those things you get confused with - love, crime, humor and easiness in the air. <br/><br/>Despite the presence of well-known actors, David O. Russell deserves big compliment for pushing them to the limit and beyond. Christian Bale did a fantastic job on transforming himself into a charismatic wise character, not just genius selfish central figure viewers used to see behind his roles. <br/><br/>Though it is quality and definitely worth attention of every movie fan, I would not lay much emphasis on this film in the context of best picture Oscar competition among 2013 nominees."
"All_Seeing_I","9","0","3","20 January 2014"," An inconsistent tone doesn't make it any less enjoyable
","I bought my ticket thinking this was going to be a ""spoof of superhero movies""; perhaps my friend was wondering what else Louis CK and Christian Bale would be doing starring in the same film. Perhaps it was these wildly inaccurate expectations, perhaps it was the fact I've grown cynical about the general quality of mainstream Hollywood releases, but when all was said and done I really, really liked this movie.<br/><br/>The film starts off with a small cast of characters but quickly widens into a complicated (but never too complicated) ""caper story"" about an ego-motivated FBI agent trying to entrap a group of politicians and mobsters for his own personal glory. A group of interesting and mostly sympathetic characters gets brought into the mix, who (aware or unawares) find themselves in more and more danger as his plan grows more elaborate.<br/><br/>It addresses interesting themes like overconfidence, greed, cowardice, how one can pursue admirable goals outside the law, how seeking justice for its own sake can sometimes harm, how a normally worthy cause can be pursued for all the wrong reasons, and the difficulty of pulling yourself out of a morally problematic position when it has spiraled into something far worse than what you had originally imagined. <br/><br/>None of this is to imply that this is somehow an intellectual movie. Other stories have explored these themes in more profound ways, and at times it feels as if the film is using its moments of levity as an excuse not to dive as deeply into the aforementioned issues (both intellectually and emotionally) as they could have. (""But...it's just a comedy!"") Then again, maybe this was deliberate, as treating this kind of material too seriously can often backfire. Sometimes it is good to know your limits, in which case a decision like this is not cowardice - but in any case, the writers have still woven an interesting, entertaining story out of the material (brought to life expertly by the director and actors).<br/><br/>The movie is still not perfect. It only barely manages to keep all the characters and their relationships in the forefront, making me wonder how many scenes had been dropped along the way. This may sound like a serious criticism, and sometimes it really did feel as if the film was ignoring an important player or dynamic for a little too long. But none of it got to the point that it ruined the story, or made me stop being interested in the characters. Impressively for a film made in modern Hollywood, no major character is left underdeveloped. And in spite of cuts (?) for the sake of pace, relationships are at least fleshed out well enough for us understand what is playing out, and to feel invested in them.<br/><br/>More importantly, it strikes me that this may only be a consequence of so many characters playing an important role in the story (though never to the point where it gets convoluted or confusing). Ordinarily I do not see this as a virtue, but when it is done in a convincing way, and when their personalities and dilemmas are interesting, it makes their occasional ""leaves of absence"" more forgivable. It is a strange way of complimenting how interesting and/or well developed so many of the ""secondary characters"" were – we feel as if they are getting short shrift, that they are being ignored for too long, but only because in many other movies their counterparts would be so poorly developed we would not really care! Our attentions would be focused on the few interesting characters in the movie (if we could find any at all).<br/><br/>One other point the film has in its favour is the skill of its ensemble cast - which, for the most part, was very well chosen and has great chemistry. Many people I know in my personal life have mentioned how convincingly Jennifer Lawrence played a woman many years her senior; I did not even recognize her at first. (Perhaps this should not be surprising; she is an actress after all, but it is interesting how often we suspect performers are just ""playing themselves"".) In any case, it is certainly a far cry from Katniss Everdeen. I enjoyed the (not quite?) subversion of the ""dumb blonde"" stereotype; you can never be sure just how much of it she has figured out.<br/><br/>I am sure I would notice a few logical problems on repeat viewing – they are all but inevitable in most plot-heavy stories. Whatever. In spite of its flaws this is a well-made, entertaining movie. I would certainly recommend it to the general audience member.<br/><br/>There is a more serious flaw I have touched on, however, and that is the film's somewhat inconsistent comedic tone. Sometimes it gives us much- needed comic relief that really hits the mark, but other times it plays out in a really goofy, over-the-top way that feels out of place. (One of the opening shots is a perfect example of this; while thematically appropriate, it is a ridiculous gag that makes the character look more clownish than he is and really does give a false impression of what is to come). As genuinely funny as these jokes were, and as sparingly as they are sprinkled throughout the movie, there is just enough of this goofiness to give it a kind of ""Seth Rogeny"" vibe that might compromise some viewer's emotional investment. It's no ""Back to the Future"" either, which was silly in a way that was whimsical and heartwarming. This is a different, more serious story demanding a different kind of approach, and some of the jokes and gags really do feel out of place here, perhaps even jarring.<br/><br/>But never mind. 8.5/10, rounded up to 9 because some of its flaws were probably difficult-to-avoid consequences of its strengths."

The performances were superior.

"CWJohnston","7","0","1","20 January 2014"," Great period film, but a slow and trudging story and pace
","There are some good acting performances and an interesting story that unwinds in a 70's period that is masterfully recreated throughout. But the specifics of the confidence games or ""cons"" are glossed over when they are in fact vital to a film that is based on a true story. The relationships between con artists, con artists and marks, con artists and agents and politicians and gangsters receive the lion's share of the script. The pacing of dialog that frames the relationships for the audience is often slow, methodical, and offers a good opportunity for most movie-goers to make a quick trip to the restroom without missing much. This film over-develops some of the characters out of fear of under-developing them. The final product that has wowed so many pundits is in my humble estimation one that is comparable to watching a championship American football game---a collection of talented performers on a grand and entertaining stage----played on a wet surface on a rainy day and plagued by penalties, injury time-outs, replays and lengthy commercials."

The movie itself is a ''big con'' kind of movie, reminds me of ''Sting'' with Paul Newman and Robert Redford, but with a modernized feeling. Christian Bale delivers and does not disappoint with his relaxed, witty 70's look, being supported by a naive Bradley Cooper, but that also adds to the duo credibility. Jennifer Lawrence holds up to the expectations playing the mobster-style wife. All in all, I liked the cast, I liked the scenery and design and I liked the overall plot twists in the film."

Russell makes another masterpiece after Silver Linings Playbook. Although, if I had to choose, I'd say that I liked Silver Linings Playbook better. The highlight of the film is the performances. Christian Bale steals the show as the potbellied, smooth talking, Irving Rosenfeld. Bale completely immerses himself in the role, by packing on the pounds & speaking in a classic New York accent. His ridiculous hairdo adds to the hilarity. Amy Adams is great as Irving's seductive mistress, Sydney Prosser. Bradley Cooper is hysterical as Richie DiMaso. Cooper proves his acting ability yet again, after Silver Linings Playbook. Jeremy Renner is impressive as mayor, Carmine Polito. Jennifer Lawrence is unbelievably hilarious as Irving's annoying & nagging wife, Rosalyn Rosenfeld. Her eccentric character further solidifies the fact that, Lawrence can play any role & is one of the best actresses of modern times. Louis C.K. is brilliant as DiMaso's boss, Stoddard Thorsen. Michael Pena is funny as Paco Hernandez/Sheik Abdullah. The supporting characters are effective as well. American Hustle is a must watch! It's a strong contender for 'Best Film' at the Oscars, this year. Go for it!"

","Having seen and loved The Fighter - and having heard a LOT of good things about Silver Linings Playbook - I came into this film with fairly high expectations, and I must say I was not disappointed.<br/><br/>American Hustle is original, intriguing and delightfully over-the-top, with great performances by the entire cast. David O. Russell is a real actors' director - in his films he manages to bring out some of his cast's best work, and he really gives them all a chance to have fun with their characters in this one. All of the five lead characters are beautifully fleshed out, none suffering from being predictable or two-dimensional, and Bale, Cooper, Adams, Lawrence and Renner all get a good chance to show off their considerable talents. This is Russell's second film to achieve Oscar nominations in all four acting categories, and you can really see why. Bale and Lawrence's shared scenes in particular are great fun to watch. The attention to detail is also impressive - everything from the costumes to the hair to the soundtrack feels authentic and really helps to emphasise the film's distinctive character. That being said, this is by no means a perfect film - there are occasional problems with pacing, and the script, which for the most part really works with the tone of the film, drops a bit in places. Also, I didn't quite feel the same connection to it as I did to The Fighter - Hustle just didn't delve as deeply into its material and that did lessen the extent to which I could feel truly engrossed.<br/><br/>So all in all, this may not be one of the best films ever made but it sure is damn good in many respects - it's humorous, engaging, authentic and heartfelt, and a good deal more original than a lot of films out there. Well worth a watch. 8.5/10"

","Alright i watched the movie in the wee hours of the night along with my cousins and yeah we did expect a bit like end of the movie showdown. Yeah i know i am a fan of David Russel's other movies like 3 kings, The fighter and yeah i did peek through Silver Linings Playbook. Some of the ensemble cast from the SLP are there as well but i will get straight to the point.<br/><br/>American Hustle begins with "" Some of this actually happened"" stuff, yeah it did, way back in the late 70s. I wasn't born back then but the world was coming out of the Cuban crisis, the oil crisis and even some cities in the US were being developed through lot of outsourced stuff ohh alright this is getting into unnecessary discussion.<br/><br/>The real point is about the acting and hell yeah Amy and Jennifer gave their best performances till date and nobody is going to deny that. Nope.<br/><br/>Like i said earlier in the summary the pacing was slow as i guess Russel was trying to get the audience familiarized with the characters and the way their lives were being unfolded along the way through continuous voice overs with the 3 lead actors. Christian Bale with his method acting, Bradley cooper his usual self trying to be charismatic as a FBI agent trying to run the show, Jeremy Renner as the Mayor of Camden who is trying to get buyers in developing the city. And one special mention of Robert De Niro, his was a surprise cameo. Okay i don't want to spoil much but way back then the Bureau was trying to curb the corruption with some special sting operations and they did get to arrest some people from the congressional committee and even the mayor as mentioned in the movie as well along the way it unfolds. It might have been one hell of a sting back then and lets hope for the sake of the story that operation did in fact move this slowly as well. But come on seriously some of us will be shifting through our seats and screaming in our heads what the hell is wrong with these guys, nope that was not right we have to say why the hell are we going through this stuff anyway.<br/><br/>Now we did get to see a history lesson fictionalized which was represented well not because of the damn story but its convincing actors and for that i will give a rating of 7.<br/><br/>That's all guys, which is what i can say, damn i should have gone to Wolf of Wall Street at least."

","""She was the Picasso of passive-aggressive karate.""<br/><br/>American Hustle is an entertaining and fun film with the best performance from an ensemble cast all year. Director David O. Russell delivers a solid comedy and brings out the best from his actors which in my opinion really are the highlight of this film. I think American Hustle has been over-hyped a bit, and perhaps I went to see it with way too high expectations, but despite being entertained and enjoying this I still felt like this was a bit of a let down for Russell compared with his other films. The comedy worked really well thanks to a slick and clever script, but the crime elements lacked some thrills. I also had some issues with the pacing of this film; it started off really slow and didn't pick up until halfway through the film when the science oven scene took place. A lot of credit has to be given however to the attention to detail because it really felt like a groovy 70's film. It had a lot of style and the hair and makeup in this film deserves an Oscar. In the opening scene where you see Bale's character getting a comb over you know you are in for a ride. American Hustle is an ambitious film that explores the American Dream and the need to reinvent oneself through some very memorable characters. The characters are the real center of this film.<br/><br/>The film is very loosely based on the Abscam political scandal that took place during the 70's in New Jersey. Irving (Christian Bale) is a successful con man who has survived thanks to keeping a low profile. He immediately falls in love with Sydney (Amy Adams) when he meets her at a party and introduces her to his world. She actually helps him thrive in his business thanks to her seductive powers, but they get into trouble with the law when an FBI agent named Richie DiMaso catches up with their illegal actions. Being the ambitious agent that he is, Richie doesn't want to settle for these small crooks and forces them to help him catch bigger fish like corrupt politicians and power-brokers. Sydney tries to convince Irving to flee the country together, but he doesn't want to leave his son with his unpredictable wife, Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence) who would never let him take the boy. Things get dangerous when the mafia get involved in the scam and Irving befriends the local Mayor, Carmine (Jeremy Renner), who despite having good intentions gets caught up in the middle of the mess. Irving and Sydney will have to pull out their greatest con job if they want to come out of this alive.<br/><br/>This entertaining and ambitious film succeeds thanks to a wonderful cast. Christian Bale and Amy Adams give outstanding performances in the lead role. Bale went through an extreme physical change gaining several pounds for his role and Adams looks sexier than ever with all the 70's glamor. They are completely believable in their roles and share several funny moments on screen. Bradley Cooper is also great as the wild and impulsive FBI agent who wants to get to the top as quick as possible. The scenes he shares with Louis C.K. are hilarious. Jeremy Renner is probably the weakest character in this film, but his quiet performance is solid. Despite all these great performances no one stands out the most as Jennifer Lawrence. She truly shines in this film and deserves an Oscar for her supporting performance. She's unstable and volatile while being very manipulative and she's just extremely funny in this movie. It is a memorable performance and Lawrence is turning out to be one of the best actresses of our generation. The cast are responsible for making this film such a fun and entertaining one. The film may not be original or groundbreaking but it is a near perfect imitation of other great films kind of like the replicas of the paintings that Irving sold. ""Now who is the master, the painter or the forger?"" That's Russell's question for the audience for the audience to decide."
"Filmer_Funner","10","0","4","17 January 2014"," Bale. Adams. Cooper. Lawrence.
","The film could have been renamed ""Bale. Adams. Cooper. Lawrence"" and it would be a more accurate description of the plot. The only twist this film does wonderfully is that its plot is in fact, just characters. But, what extraordinary characters they are. Refreshingly stylish, hilarious... just plain entertaining.<br/><br/>The film opens in an almost ridiculous manner, with Bale's character (Irving) 'building' his hair... only to be hilariously 'deconstructed' minutes later by Cooper's character (Richie). A simple, yet ridiculous notion, yes. But a brilliant foreshadowing of almost the entire film's ridiculous, yet entertaining play.<br/><br/>This film is fun, its wild, and its sexy. The awkward characters make for fantastic interactions which carry the film like a long conversation. It is an enjoyable watch, a magnificent depiction of how films can be a great ride without much of a story, if any. An excellent example of how actors can totally encapsulate entertainment.<br/><br/>For those of you expecting a grandiose enveloping of the mafia, I would suggest The Godfather (my #2 film of all time) for a more explicit, and 100x better film in that genre... however this film has no such intention and deserves respect for what it was trying to do... give audiences a dramatically entertaining film with hilarious characters showcasing some of the best actors of this generation."

","There's no doubt why the movie got nominated for 10 academy awards. Everything in the movie whether its the impeccable cast, the storyline, character development and the occasional humor, everything is just mesmerizing and crafty. David O. Russell keeps on surprising us with his variety by experimenting with different genres, but the real turn on is that how easily he takes a paradigm shift from drama to thriller setting a SCORCESE-TYPE Ambiance in this masterpiece of a movie.<br/><br/>Apart from the director, the movie belonged to the one and only Christian Bale who has garnered another Oscar nomination for yet again a David O. Russell project. What can I say, Russell keeps on trusting this man and he keeps on delivering . But the real USP of the movie is the unpredictable and satirical Jennifer Lawrence (portraying Bale's wife in the movie) who is just a phenomena in her every scene outdoing herself once again. In and all, American Hustle is a complete package with a spellbinding story and some great acting. Go for it if you prefer watching quality films over the span of your precious two hours."
"DareDevilKid","9","0","4","16 January 2014"," A Triumph in Every Department
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK) Rating: 4.2/5 stars<br/><br/>A movie that merits the word ""best"" in multiple departments and facets, in order to do right by the sheer spellbinding effect it has on you. One of the best movies of the year and certainly among the most accomplished con movies yet. It boasts of one of the most enthralling original scripts written and some of the subtlest and sublimest intertwining of comic undertones witnessed on screen. The editing and cinematography are top-notch from first scene to last and copiously serve in elevating the aura of the film.<br/><br/>Another factor that weighs heavily in ""American Hustle's"" favor is its all-star cast that's right up there with the greatest star casts ever assembled on screen. What's even better is the fact that each and every member of this all-star cast are also brilliant performers in their own right. And just when you think you've seen it all, the movie unleashes one of the most unexpected twists and jolting climaxes seen in a con film. This is undoubtedly David O. Russell's best film hitherto. His thoroughbred masterpiece.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, Christian Bale delivers his best act since ""The Fighter"". It's also Bradley Cooper's best act that equals the heights he scaled with ""Silver Linings Playbook"". Plus, we are treated to another stellar performance from Amy Adams (why hasn't this fine actress won an Oscar yet beats me). Jeremy Renner holds his own in a slightly underwritten role and against his more seasoned costars. Jennifer Lawrence just keeps getting better with each passing film. We are fortunate to witness her best performance ever and that's saying a lot as she manages to even outshine her grand turnovers in ""Winter's Bone"" and ""Silver Linings Playbook"". Finally, there's a nice, little tidbit for us midway through the film, in the form of one of the most marvelous cameos showcased on screen, enacted by Robert De Niro and played out as a tribute to the legendary actor's venerable career."

","Today, I watched this with my movie theatre-working friend who had seen it previously. I knew of its Golden Globe wins for Best Picture-Comedy or Musical, Best Actress-C or M: Amy Adams, and Best Supporting Actress: Jennifer Lawrence. And this morning, there were Oscar noms for Picture, Director, Original Screenplay, and all four acting categories for Christian Bale and Bradley Cooper as well as Ms. Adams and Ms. Lawrence. Now, my friend said it was okay after seeing it for the second time. Me, I'm pretty much the same in reacting to it. I mean, there were some funny moments and some compelling scenes and dialogue exchanges but after a while, I did admit to feeling confused at some tone changes and whether we're supposed to feel for some of these characters or not. I thought the Bale character the most compelling of them and if he wins, I'll be glad. The other nominated performances don't seem as compelling but I wasn't too bored even when some scenes seem to not have much of a point. I suppose I would have to watch again to maybe get a better flow of what this picture was trying to accomplish. Still, American Hustle is worth a look."

It is only when the conning starts, things becomes exciting and 2nd half gains the steam and deliver a knock-out climax sequences. Screenplay is a like a roller-coaster ride. Kudos to the costume-designing, art direction and cinematography for bringing back the 1970's period. It is difficult to point who was best in terms of acting. Christian Bale leads the pack with his varied experimental looks and he is as unusually outstanding. Cooper will surprise you with his wild, aggressive display of character.

","Most in-famous sting operation? Tehalka of course for us. But for the US, it was ABSCAM in the late 70s, where the FBI enrolled an expert con man to trap corrupt officials, which led to the conviction of a United States Senator, and six members of the United States House of Representatives among others. Enough entertainment in the tale, just needed a little bit of spice to make it stand out, and director David O Russell does just that in colorful style with impossibly crazy characters in American Hustle.<br/><br/>""You are nothing to me unless you are everything"" - Sydney Prosser<br/><br/>It is 1978, and in this fact-fiction mash-up, con artists Irving Rosenfield (Christian Bale in an almost unrecognizable half-bald hairdo), and Sydney Prosser (a stupendously sexy Amy Adams) are partners and have successfully pulled off loan scams and forged artwork for a few years. Irving is sly and laid-back, Sydney is all smarts, steel and driven- the perfect foil. Scheming FBI agent Richie Di Maso (a stylish Bradley Cooper) catches the pair and agrees to let them off only if they help him make four big ticket arrests. Throw into the mix Irving's unstable wife Rosalyn (a scene stealing Jennifer Lawrence) who is best described by Irving as "" The Picasso of passive-aggressive karate"", pretty much hell breaks loose 30 minutes into the film. Shades of Scorsese in Russell's work as the script goes hula hoops as characters begin double and triple crossing each other. All the main characters have are crazy in one way or the other but have one thing in common- they are all losers who think they are winners. <br/><br/>The leads do a fantastic job, no wonder all of them have been nominated for the Academy awards. Bale's Irving could not be more different than his Batman. Paunchy, pathetically focused on the final strands of hair on his head, he is kind of a romantic hero caught between his wife and his lover- both being different kind of nuts. Cooper is passionate and ambitious. Adams is the stripper who has reinvented herself as the classy girl, while the beautiful yet unhinged Lawrence is the proverbial spanner. The who is who of Hollywood keep popping in to make things stand out even more. There is comedian Louis CK as a FBI boss, Jeremy Renner trades his bow and arrows for an Elvis pompadour and a gullible corrupt New Jersey mayor, Michael Pena is a Sheikh, and since this is a film that is as much about gangsters as it is about corrupt officials, Robert De Niro has to be there too!<br/><br/>Does the end justify the means? American Hustle does not ponder much on morality and corruption. Instead it focuses more on creating delightful characters going bonkers to a witty script to the tune of a dreamy background score (Bee Gees, Sinatra, David Bowie, Santana, Elton John, Chicago). pretty much all that we can ask for from a movie.<br/><br/>Must watch- 10/10"

","People believe what they want to believe. Everything else after that is essentially window-dressing. Or so Irving and Edith would have you believe. They make fantasy reality and they grist to survive.<br/><br/>And they do so in a quite thoroughly entertaining manner. Considering it's a complex but simple scam, I found myself often confused but immensely absorbed in what was taking place. You have a beautifully acted menage a trois, bubbling under the Coen-esque complexity of a con artist gwan rogue.<br/><br/>The realisation of Christian Bale was a lovely moment, the skit with the hair sets things up brilliantly, and I was engaged throughout. Lovely score, and feels entirely spot-on in terms of the age it tries to capture. Groovy movie, well worth seeing and check yourself on the way home, cos you might have changed."

","The movie is not bad, but personally I found it too long and drawn out at some points, and without a ""hero"" or a central person to root for or care about. However I was absolutely and completely impressed by the acting skills of Jennifer Lawrence. Forget ""Silver Lining"", it was a school play compared to her performance in this movie. She has matured and mastered the art, and if she does not get an Academy Award for this role, they are blind and unprofessional! It is only due to her and to the soundtrack that I award this movie such a high mark, because otherwise it was just alright, but not a remarkable motion picture. And since I still have to write something to get to the minimum length, bravo to Christian Bale for putting on a beer belly and the ""nice"" haircut."

And this is coming from a Superman fan, not Batman. He completely owns the screen, i could not fault him at all. Jennifer Lawrence is as beautiful as the day is long and does a bang up job as the long suffering alcoholic wife. Lois Lane, ahem,sorry, Amy Adams, was as fantastic as she herself was beautiful. Jeremy Renner did a great job with his all too small part. This cinematography was awesome. The soundtrack was great too.<br/><br/>Its not without its small faults. Its pretty long and the story does drag in one or two scenes.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper was OK, kinda annoying in parts but nothing to cry about.<br/><br/>This is a story driven film with great performances.

","Not as charming as Silver Linings Playbook but with enough heart. The cast performances and the 70's setting help the film shine and whilst the script doesn't ignite me I think it's a worthy film. Silver Linings was a film I enjoyed, loved a lot at some points and mainly stuck with because of the cast. I feel the same about this, It's certainly not bad, it's just not one I completely love. The film did look wonderful, the detail and costumes really fitted with the decade portrayed and although the plot seemed to be a little unfocused it held together in the end. I have Silver linings on DVD, I probably won't be getting this, but I do look forward to the next collaboration from Lawrence, Cooper and Russell."
"hawrnball","6","0","2","10 January 2014"," Hustled by its own director
","I am reluctant to award this film a score as high as a 6, but I could not in good conscience rate it any lower because there are very earnest efforts by some of those involved that outweigh the bad taste left in my mouth by others.<br/><br/>Rarely before have I seen a director torpedo his film so spectacularly. David O. Russell is competent, often incredible, but, alas, American Hustle, alongside I Heart Huckabees, suffers at the hands of his tremendous hubris. His direction is clumsy, plodding, and erratic. <br/><br/>Thanks to his cinematographer, however, the frenetic camera-work is effective in establishing tone and setting. The soundtrack choices are spot-on, though there are long stretches of non-diegetic silence in scenes that would have benefited from some musical momentum. The production and costume design are the perfect icing, but therein lies a problem. Russell is more concerned with recreating the era, which he does, than telling a coherent story.<br/><br/>Much of the film was reportedly improvised and a story was derived from that. The opposite approach should have been taken because Russell does not how to handle a heavily improvised product. Some great films have come from spontaneity, but he director needs to know what to do with it, which Russell never does here.<br/><br/>Throughout the interminable and floundering first act, the viewer is hammered with flashbacks and exposition. In themselves, those elements are essential, but writers Russell and Singer forego weaving them into the plot, and instead throw as many things as they can onto the screen to see what sticks. <br/><br/>The multiple voice-over narration is overdone and most likely could have been omitted without any hindrance to the story. We hear about a character or a plot development as we see it. We hear about characters' inner thoughts but then they are said out loud by those characters on screen. It's superfluous, it's distracting, it's arrogant, it's plain unnecessary.<br/><br/>It is when Cooper's character becomes integral to the plot that the film gains direction and intrigue. There is never any huge revelation, twist, or really a main climax for that matter, but Russell is known for telling stories driven by character. It's not a bad thing, especially here, because the cast is able to handle it.<br/><br/>In spite of, or perhaps because of, Russell's misdirection, the cast picks up his slack and carries the rest of the film. Chemistry is near impeccable, and most of the actors are at the top of their game. <br/><br/>Amy Adams proves herself as one of the better actresses working today. Her seductive and mysterious performance commands the screen. Cooper's character is the most complex and he takes to task and absolutely delivers. He raises his game from last year's Oscar-nom turn in Silver Linings Playbook and, at last, is fulfilling his promise as an actor. <br/><br/>Lawrence, while minimal in her role, gives the best performance of the film. She offers plenty of comic relief, and fortunately rises above what could have been a role of sassy one-liners (e.g. Marisa Tomei in My Cousin Vinny). She gains more out of the script than was probably written and gives her character depth and appeal. I've yet to see more of the award frontrunners of 2013, but I would be remiss to neglect her furious housework to the tune of ""Live and Let Die"" as one of the greatest scenes of the year.<br/><br/>And then there's Christian Bale. The man has a presence, certainly, and he is by no means a weak actor. He is an uninteresting one, which is debatably worse. He is so self-aware in his method that nothing feels authentic or organic. Like Johnny Depp, he confuses physical alteration, makeup, and costume with actual acting, and graces us with the same performance we've seen a dozen times before. He bases his character on a series of mannerisms, mannerisms that don't belong to the character but Bale himself. He tilts his head, grins evilly, breathes heavily through his mouth, and has an occasional screaming rant before returning to composure. He's Patrick Bateman. Only fat. With a combover.<br/><br/>Is American Hustle watchable? Certainly, once you get over the hump of the first act. I recommend it highly for the stronger elements as they are worth watching. I can't decide whether the whole was greater than the sum of the parts--I did leave the theater satisfied, after all--or if the sum of most of the parts were greater than the whole. Either way, Russell does this film quite the injustice because it could and should have been something incredible. As it stands, I give it a 6."
"bkrauser-81-311064","8","0","3","10 January 2014"," American Hustle: A Story of Us
","People's first impression of American Hustle is usually geared towards the period detail; the polyester, the disco, the hair etc. What first came to my mind after watching American Hustle (2013) (other than how great it was) was an essay I read in a political science course I took while in college. I cannot recall who wrote it but the crux of the paper tangentially connected mob racketeering to government national defense. If you are a small business owner in a mobtown, at some point a wiseguy is going to approach and say something to the ring of, ""this is a nice establishment, it'd be a shame if something were to happen to it."" From there, you're paying protection money so you don't get your legs broken by the guys who are ""protecting"" you and so you and your business doesn't get hassled by other ne'er-do-wells. The irony of course is you're paying an exorbitant fee for something you would have never ""needed"" if these wiseguys were to just disappear. The government, or so the paper continues, operates the same way.<br/><br/>In American Hustle it's easy to see how there might be similarities between government entities and organized crime. In this case the arm twisting wiseguy is overzealous FBI Agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper) who extorts con-couple Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale) and Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams) to help him bring down some bad guys. The problem is Richie's eyes are too big for his stomach as he starts by entrapping Newark mayor Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner) then sets his sights on the entire east coast mob in one big glorious sting.<br/><br/>The acting all-around is superb with Christian Bale deserving special mention for his transformation into the shlubby Rosenfeld. With an elaborate comb over, a heart condition and a beer-belly to boot, Rosenfeld is probably the last person you would expect or want to be our hero in shiny armor. Yet underneath his laggard appearance, which took two herniated disks to create, rings the heart of a true mensch as well as the mind of a genius.<br/><br/>Also worth mentioning is the always amiable Amy Adams who, as with most female leads, is the conscience of the film. Yet there are many unexpected things about her role, not the least of which is her British accent. You can tell there are a lot of machinations on her mind not by her expressions but what isn't seen in her eyes and face. She's capable of not just playing a good hand but running the table, yet she chooses not to out of love for Irving. It's not an impractical love or a vacuous love but true commitment based on trust and sacrifice.<br/><br/>For better or for worse, the only solid foundation the audience can perch their assiduity is on the very real love of Rosenfeld and Prosser. Everything else is seemingly up in the air and kaleidoscopic punctuated by David O. Russell's patented controlled chaos. While the plot may be purposely murky and the unethical behavior of all involved is sardonic, there is a sense that the couple will end up alright in the end; even if there are so many people out to use them. Hurray for genuine, talented actors and striking character work. Without it American Hustle might have been a lesser version of Casino (1995) but ends up being in a category of its own. Like a delicate mix; a confidence story with the heart of The Sting (1973), the feel of Goodfellas (1990) and the look of Saturday Night Fever (1977).<br/><br/>I won't ruin the ending of the movie but I do want to mention one insignificant scene that nonetheless encapsulates the movie's intrigues. In the scene DiMaso feels he has finally gotten what he needed. He sits in a room celebrating with colleagues while a recording plays on a large tape recorder on the desk. As the tape plays, you hear a man saying that he and his associates will bribe and intimidate anyone who stands in their way.<br/><br/>It's a golden moment for the FBI who had deceived, extorted and yes, even intimidated people to get what they wanted. It's a scene drenched in irony because it highlights that striking and ominous similarity between those who protect us and those we need protection from. With the news speculating over NSA surveillance and CIA drones, it's interesting to see a movie that dismantles and examines that paradigm. In the words of Frank Costello in The Departed (2006) ""When I was your age they would say we can become cops, or criminals. Today, what I'm saying to you is this: When you're facing a loaded gun, what's the difference?"""

","American Hustle is establishing a sequence of good films by David O.Russel, the last two being also acclaimed by critics and received tons of nominations to great awards, but if one can be considered a masterpiece is American Hustle. <br/><br/>The cast, I don't need to say, it's terrific. The main characters are interpreted by actors that are living a great momentum in Hollywood, and all of them being really really strong names. Bradley Cooper, is excellent as the Richie Dimaso, and as I really liked him a lot in his previous role with D.O Russel in Silver Linings Playbook, I hated him now. Jeremy Renner was terrific in Hurt Locker, and found success lately with the Avengers, but I liked him(surprise) a lot more in this film, and the mayor Carmine was one of my favorite characters. Amy Adams with a impressive streak of receiving five nominations to golden globes in less 7 years. That's great. She was in a lot of great stuff lately as well, my favorite of her acting efforts being in The Master. Jennifer Lawrence is the dearest of Hollywood and actually the most bankable actress in the world, don't know how that proceeds, but I really liked her in almost all the roles and really liked almost all the films she was in Christian Bale, no comments, because I don't think it's necessary at all. OK, one. Guy is great. Fact.<br/><br/>Now that I did a few comments(obligatory, perhaps) about the cast, let's talk about the film. Yeah, the film uses a lot editing, and I'm generally hate when a film uses by resource to talk the story In flashbacks after a supposedly great conflict, and then when the development is over it go back and continues the story where it's paused I mean, I really hate that, because is so unnecessary,and it kind reports a problem in the film.But, I mean, a very big but(:-D), the editing somehow, works, and a lot, for this film. It genuinely thought that the flashback story was the only way to keep things interesting. So, the edition was really, really great, and the result was very good. This coming from someone that really don't likes overly edited story lines. But in talented hands, overly edited films can be masterpieces(look at Pulp Fiction and Memento, for example), so in filmmaking all it's possible. And in the talented hands of David O. Russel, American Hustle became the second film ever that appeals to this annoying flashback resource and against all odds become a great film. But I just talked about the editing. Now I'll talk about the story. The characters are a great part of it. They are all charismatic and funny in their own way. I liked it a lot, really. It's humorous, but it's surprisingly(my surprise) hilarious most of the time. I was expecting something like a dramatic comedy, but in a percentage I would say that 90% of it is comedy while the rest is drama. So, definitely not a drama like some are saying(what they are thinking anyways?)<br/><br/>The one liners were terrific, because they were idiotic and utterly nonsense. Russel had a great control of the story though, he knew how to balance the things, and due that, the dramatic scenes had a great impact. It's also with a few twists, like 'who is in which side' and stuff like that. This film may con you, literally. It's after all a extremely catchy story, worth of various re-watches. And is definitely one of my favorite films right now. 9.9/10"
"kimahanson","9","0","5","13 January 2014"," Well worth the price of admission; one heck of a ride
","That American Hustle owes a huge debt to Goodfellas and director Martin Scorsese cannot be disputed, but it also had an intimacy that Goodfellas lacked, an ability to draw you in and make you like these truly unlikeable characters. From Christian Bale's fat, bald, bizarre comb-over con man, to Bradley Cooper's frantic, fanatic FBI-hero wannabe, to the two outrageous, gorgeous ladies – Jenn Lawrence and Amy Adams, whose plunging neckline garments left nothing to the imagination (and made us wonder once again, just how our ridiculous movie rating system works) – and then on to Jeremy Renner's wonderful, heart-breaking performance as the mayor of Camden, N.J. – this film's director, David O. Russell, had us all in thrall, once again. Not as quirky and enjoyable as Silver Linings Playbook, in my opinion, but still a very entertaining ride, American Hustle is worth the price of admission. Significant cameo aside (though a very delightful surprise), there is a scene where the con man and the mayor bond while singing ""Why Delilah"" that could have been shot in one of my cousin's rec room finished basements. Yeah, it was that authentic."

Though her role may not big as huge as the trailer may suggest she steals every scene and keeps proving how she's been Hollywood worthy in these recent times, Keep it up Jen! <br/><br/>We even get a special cameo which i shall not spoil.<br/><br/>I wouldn't recommend American Hustle for everyone, its a great film but i can see how it can bore a lot of people but overall it's a well made film that deserves a good chance from severe movie goers or fans of the cast and genre."

","American Hustle is a crime comedy-drama film, loosely based on the FBI ABSCAM operation in the 70s and 80s. . Released on December 13 2013, it is directed by David O Russell with screenplay by Eric Warren Singer and Russell. The film stars Christian Bale, Amy Adams, Bradley Copper, Jennifer Lawrence and Jeremy Renner. It is delightful for any full time writer to write a review on this film.<br/><br/>Irving and Prosser have been arrested in a loan scam, but Richie DiMaso a crazy FBI agent proposes to free them if Irving assists him with four additional arrests. It is a fictional film where Irving Rosenfield (Christian Bale) and Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams) is forced by DiMaso (Bradley Copper) to throw themselves into a world of jersey mafia. It is an enchanting but dangerous world. DiMaso wants to set up a sting operation to ensnare corrupt politicians, including the Mayor of New Jersey Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner). Both Rosenfeild and Prosser pose as advisor's to a fake Sheikh in order to bribe him. Polito is charming and charismatic and is trying to restart gambling in Atlanta City but struggles to raise money. It is also a love story of Irving and Prosser who met at a party, got attracted to each other and fell in love. The only unsavory detail in this love story? That Irving is married to Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence).<br/><br/>DiMaso's over eagerness to catch Polito makes the latter suspicious and he leaves. But Irving convinces him about the legitimacy of the Sheikh and arranges for a meeting between them. With Polito convinced that the Sheikh is genuine, the former arranges a meeting between Sheikh and a violent mafia overlord Victor Tellegio who demands a $10 million to prove the Sheikh's identity. On the other side Richie gets attracted to Sydney who tries to back out of the deal. With Carmine's help Richie succeeds in entrapping a number of Congress members into receiving bribes. But in the end, Richie's whimsicality convinces Irving to join hands with Polito and tell him the truth. Carmine abuses and assaults Irving and tells the latter that he had only tried to improve New Jersey. In the end a disgraced Richie is removed from the case. Irving and Sydney move in together to start a legitimate art gallery.<br/><br/>In the film, David O Russell has shown a fondness for living on the edge. There is unreliable narration and urgent zooms, extravagantly dressed schemers and mobsters. He has succeeded in bringing out the best from every character with their own quirks and foibles.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the end result is a tad messy and a little long, but you will be positively content with the film and enjoy hanging out with all of the well etched characters."
"zken","10","0","4","12 January 2014"," the film of the year is a misunderstood work of genius!
","I am on the road but outraged at the negativity toward a brilliant film. Not only does this movie nail the 70's in so many ways, but mirrors current events (New Jersey) in such perfect concordance, that it seems completely predictive of a thousand news stories circling the planet. How current does a movie have to be when it looks deep in the heart of darkness in American politics and then it all plays out right in front of us? As someone who lived in the middle of this kind of political world, I could not stop laughing at the perfect characterizations by a director who has assembled the best cast since Altman. Christian Bale and Amy Adams create a pair of con people that forever change the way you look the whole world of corruption. This is a classic work. And as I left the sold out theater, the audience seemed as astounded as they should have been. As far as the negative views on this site, you missed a film I will never forget."
"rtp4242","6","0","2","12 January 2014"," America Hustle: Bale et al. do the hustle in the 1970's.
","Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale) runs a dry cleaner's store in the Bronx. Irving then branches out into making loans, where he doesn't loan any money but is guaranteed a non-refundable payment of 5,000 dollars. Irving also dabbles in selling forged art. Irving is basically a con man. He meets a woman named Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams) at a party and the two all in love with each other. Sidney adopts an English accent and becomes Lady Edith, and they con more local businessmen of their money. One day, Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper) walks in to Irving's establishment and asks for a loan. Richie is really an FBI agent, looking to root out local corruption. He will let Irving and Lady Edith walk if they give him four corruption convictions. Irving gets Carl Elway (Shea Whigham) convicted, but DiMaso has his eyes on a much bigger target, the mayor of Camden New Jersey, Carmine Polito. (Jeremy Renner) Richie is planning on a scam to trap Polito using a fake Arab Sheik, Sheik Abdullah (Michael Pena) to provide one million dollars in funding to renovate Atlantic City, using Polito as an intermediary. Richie has a suitcase of money waiting to give Polito as a kickback, but Polito gets squeamish, and it's up to Irving to close the deal. Does he succeed? <br/><br/>I like American Hustle, but it's largely because it does a good job approximating the 1970's and because of strong performances by Bale, Cooper, and Renner. For all the good in this movie, I've noticed a troubling trend. Movies are taking scandalous behavior and making it seem frivolous and lighthearted. ABSCAM was a serious scandal in the late 70's, many politicians went to jail for bribery, ABSCAM was another example of the dysfunction between government and the governed in the wake of Watergate. But writer/director David O. Russell chooses to fictionalize ABSCAM, and make it seem like the FBI is running amok and it portrays Polto as a hero. Russell uses the word entrapment several times in his script. Frankly, that is editorializing and that is something a fictional movie should never do. Russell trivialized mental illness in Silver Linings Playbook and that bothered me, now he trivializes political corruption,and that is too much, because now he is dealing with reality and not just a fictional story. Russell is not the only one who is guilty of this, Martin Scorsese does much the same in the Wolf of Wall Street.<br/><br/>The acting by the male leads is superb. There are three aspects of the characterization of Irving that made it stand out. The first is the comb-over, Irving's comb over becomes a metaphor for the character. Irving goes to great lengths to hide that he's bald, just like Irving goes to great lengths to hide the fact that he's a con-man. In the end both the fact that he's bald and a con-man become glaringly obvious. Second is Bale's weight gain, call it method acting or whatever you want to call it, the weight gain was effective, it helped the viewer forget that this was Christian Bale, and put the focus back on the character. Third, Bale's Bronx accent was impeccable, it's a very easy accent to get wrong, and he nailed it, further adding to the believability of the character.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper continues his strong string of performances going back to Silver Linings Playbook. Cooper plays Richie as a megalomaniac, who puts his hair up in curlers to maintain a certain look. Richie's hair is also a key to understanding that character. He's vain and self-important and has delusions that he can root out corruption on a large scale. Jeremy Renner plays Carmine sympathetically, a little too sympathetically, the viewer actually believes that Carmine is working for the best interests of his town and his state. The female leads don't fare as well. Amy Adams has trouble switching between an American and British accents, and Jennifer Lawrence is too young to play such a mature and worldly character. Lawrence also has trouble with the New York accent.<br/><br/>The direction is nothing outstanding, there are no iconic scenes or quick edits, but the pacing is good, the two hours and 18 minutes goes by quickly.<br/><br/>For more movie reviews, hustle over to my blog reviewswithatude.wordpress.com"
"jcbutthead86","10","0","4","12 January 2014"," An Excellent,Entertaining Comedy/Crime Drama From David O'Russell.
","American Hustle is an excellent and entertaining Comedy/Crime Drama that combines great direction,a terrific cast,a wonderful script and a fantastic soundtrack all of those elements make American Hustle a great film that has to be seen.<br/><br/>Set in New York City in the late 1970s,American Hustle tells the story of two con artists,Irving Rosenfield(Christian Bale)and Sydney Prosser(Amy Adams)who have been forced by FBI agent Richie DiMasso(Bradley Cooper)to participate in a FBI operation called ABSCAM,a sting operation to set up corrupt politicians including Camden,New Jersey Mayor Carmine Polito(Jeremy Renner)and gangsters. As the stakes become higher and with danger coming at every corner Irving and Sydney have to figure out how to get out and survive.<br/><br/>Throughout the history of cinema,con artists and Grifters have been covered in movies ranging from The Sting(1973),The Grifters(1990)and now American Hustle,an amazing film from beginning to end that keep your attention with fantastic movie making that never stops. Right from it's weird and offbeat opening American Hustle is a movie that combines Comedy,Crime Drama and a true life tale that is funny and quirky and at other times serious and intense giving viewers a movie that plays by it's own rules and creates it's own world. With American Hustle David O'Russell gives us a movie that is dazzling bringing viewers into the crime world of the 1970s showing the personal and professional lives of con artists,federal agents,politicians and gangsters never knowing where the story or it's characters will go and even though AH is a fact based story the movie is not too dark. When you look at American Hustle you will see that the movie was obviously influenced in many ways by Director Martin Scorsese's classic Gangster epics such as Goodfellas(1990)and Casino(1995)with the way the camera moves,the style and look of the film,and the use of narration but instead of Gangsters and Mobsters O'Russell replaces them with con artists and Grifters. The Scorsese influence is definitely felt throughout but O'Russell takes the style and feel of Scorsese's films and makes it his own with great success. The Comedy in AH is great and hilarious because the laughs are never forced on viewers or telling them when scenes are funny but lets the viewers figure out when scenes are funny whether it's in some of the scenes or in the main characters dialog or actions. The Comedy is balanced out by the Crime Drama elements as well which are done with attention and detail like a other Crime Dramas and you are gripped with every scene that involves cops and crime. But the Crime Drama element isn't always serious and is entertaining. The beautiful photography by Linus Sandgren and amazing production design by Judy Becker truly add to the film and give AH a realistic look and feel of the 1970s with vibrant colors and sets that pulls you into the world that AH wants to portray and it's one of the main reasons that the movie succeeds because with the great photography and production there is a brilliant and accurate look of the 1970s that just makes the movie come alive. The main characters in the film whether it's the con artists,federal agents are fascinating and interesting with laughs and depth because with each main character everyone wants to succeed at what they do whether it's good or bad. Also,with the characters there is no black and white but a gray area that is complex and real and you will relate to some of the characters in some ways. The screenplay by Eric Singer and David O'Russell is impressive and well-done with dialog that is a mixture of being funny and serious. The ending of American Hustle is truly wonderful,surprising and unexpected and fits with films about con artists and Grifters. An outstanding conclusion to a great movie.<br/><br/>The whole cast is amazing. Christian Bale is excellent and at his best as Irving Rosenfield,with Bale bringing intensity and emotional(and physical)depth to the role. Bradley Cooper is brilliant and funny as FBI agent Richie DiMasso,with Copper being offbeat and dramatic. Amy Adams is terrific and beautiful as Sydney Prosser,Irving's partner in crime and has great scenes with Bale,Cooper and Lawrence. Jeremy Renner is outstanding as Mayor Carmine Polito,a New Jersey politician. Jennifer Lawrence is amazing and sexy as Roselyn Rosenfield,Irving's attractive but overbearing wife. Also,lookout for a great uncredited appearance from Robert De Niro in a great performance as Victor Tellegio,a high level gangster. Louis C.K(Stoddard Thorsen),Jack Huston(Pete Musane),Michael Pena(Paco Hernandez),Shea Whigham(Carl),Alessandro Nivola(Anthony Amando)and Paul Hermane(Alfonse Simone)give good performances as well.<br/><br/>The direction by David O'Russell is brilliant and stylish,with O'Russell always moving the camera with tracking shots,close-ups and a nice visual style. Terrific direction,O'Russell.<br/><br/>The score Danny Elfman isn't always used but good when it's heard. The film has a great soundtrack with songs by Elton John(Goodbye Yellow Brick Road),Wings(Live And Let Die),The Temptations(Papa Was A Rolling Stone),Duke Ellington(Jeep's Blues)and more. Outstanding soundtrack.<br/><br/>In final word,if you love David O'Russell,Comedies,Crime Dramas or movies in general,I highly suggest you see American Hustle,an excellent,entertaining Comedy/Crime Drama film that you never forget. Highly Recommended. 10/10."
"kmcloone96","7","0","3","11 January 2014"," American Hustle is a great movie with a greater identity crisis
","With a cast consisting of names such as Christian Bale, Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence, Jeremy Renner & Amy Adams, it's difficult not to be slightly excited about American Hustle. All of these are accomplished actors whom have starred in great movies, so I had fairly high hopes for this film to say the least. <br/><br/>American Hustle tells the story of Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale); an accomplished con-man who makes his living scamming clients out of thousands of dollars. Along with his British accomplice Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams), the couple make large amounts of money by combining their skills and knowledge, until an FBI agent by the name of Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper) busts their scheme and forces Irving to work for him in order to catch other criminals in the act. Things become increasingly complicated once Irving's troubled wife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence) comes into the mix, along with many other characters nobody would want to be mixing with. <br/><br/>Before getting into some of the issues with which the film suffers, it should be known that, as expected, all of these actors perform to an incredibly high standard. Even the scenes which seem fairly redundant (and there are a few) are largely redeemed by this all-star collection of talented individuals. The leading roles played by Christian Bale & Amy Adams were particularly memorable, but they in no way overshadowed any of the other performances. The script was slick and fast-paced, which is exactly what you would want from a film of the 'hustle' genre. This should come as no surprise as the director of the film, David O. Russel, has worked with most of the actors previously. <br/><br/>It's difficult to pin-point exactly what was wrong with American Hustle, but I left the cinema feeling slightly more empty than I had hoped. The acting was entertaining, the soundtrack was stellar and the directing was fast-paced to match the mood of the film, but it didn't have the 'wow' factor I had hoped. Don't get me wrong, it was consistently enjoyable and there were very few moments I felt bored, but there wasn't really anything that raised it higher than the average film aside from the performances. The plot became slightly tangled due to the number of things happening throughout, and never really had highs which would push it up a few marks. Also, it seemed like the film was trying to be a comedy at parts, with certain lines of dialogue being genuinely funny, but then other scenes cemented it as a crime drama. If humour was included more frequently, maybe it wouldn't have felt so peculiar. <br/><br/>American Hustle is a very entertaining crime/hustle movie which contains countless excellent performances from well-known actors, but also one which lacks the suave tone of it's characters. I enjoyed it and could recommend it to people, but I don't think I could urge anybody to go and see it immediately. As mentioned however, the soundtrack really was something to behold, with many era-specific songs featured."
"MovieDude1893","5","0","3","11 January 2014"," Slapdash, but fiercely entertaining
","American Hustle (O. Russell, 2013, B) <br/><br/>Here's an endlessly likable, shaggy, fizzy cartoon of a picture. The acting is so good here that it makes up for the lumpiness of the screenplay. It's lifeless for the first 20 minutes or so, working at an energy level that doesn't really grab the audience. Then, once thing starts cooking, it zigs and zags into various moments of suspense and lunacy to varying degrees of success. I'm convinced this is the best Cooper has ever been; his scenes with Louis CK are all direct hits. Lawrence is purposefully obnoxious (although the inter-cutting of her crooning ""Live and Let Die"" with Bale's situation feels forced and falls flat). Bale is strong as usual. The most revealing aspect of his performance is that he still has a sense of humor, thank God. Perhaps the finest here, though, is Adams who takes a manic character and steers it toward the believable. As an expression of her range and ability, it's a total star turn.<br/><br/>I dunno if I can say this is a very good film, though. There's something in the script's messiness that's at once too apparent in the film, but also crucially missing in the aesthetic. It's slapdash, but not in any meaningful way. Still it's fiercely entertaining and the first O. Russell film I've really enjoyed since THREE KINGS. That's worth something."
"emilyelizabeth1283","9","0","4","11 January 2014"," Amazing screenplay
","If nothing else will hook you to see this movie, go for the explosion between Jennifer Lawrence and Christian Bale's characters. That fight is one of the most intense, real interactions I've seen in a movie for a long time.<br/><br/>A lot of things pleasantly surprised me in this film. A 70's era con artist with atrocious comb-over of Brooklyn origin is not a persona I could imagine for Mr. Bale. But from the first scenes where he speaks I buy him immediately. The incredible twists and turns the story takes illuminates toward the end that the focus and narrator of the movie is somehow the most innocent and straightforward of all the characters introduced after the initial self-introduction that lets you know he is aware that he is conning people and that he is justified in doing so. He sees himself as doing what he's gotta do, and in fact, he has a big heart when it comes to his family. He feels obligated to stay with his wife and kid, despite the torture put upon him by a needy, whiny, do-nothing wife. But the characters are complex, taking twists and turns almost as layered as the plot itself. And this delivers, I believe, the intended effect of forcing you to take a step back in all the confusion to see the chaos and meaninglessness of each characters' self deception. It is a truly brilliant screenplay by Eric Singer and David O. Russell.<br/><br/>The impression the viewer receives at the outset paints Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale) as the lead of the amoral, self-serving action slowly sucking in others, beginning with the beautiful Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams). He will be the brains of the operation, perhaps, it makes the most sense. But then there is a fascinating delineation of plot that now involves cop Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper), Mayor Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner), Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams), and Irving's own wife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence.) Irving is no longer the ringleader. Perhaps the most tragic and hopelessly self-motivated character in the whole deal is the civil servant DiMaso, whose ""good intentions"" slowly reveal themselves for what they really are. He is so desperate to make a name for himself that he is willing to create criminals in order to take the praise for catching them, let alone his incredibly moving emotional frustrations that alleviate themselves through intermittent eruptions in the film, fueled at the foundation by a maddening emptiness and lack of self identity. What may have painted itself as a steamy romantic affair between DiMaso and one of the leading ladies quickly turns into a sickening and violently desperate grasp for an end that neither party has the foresight to see crashing to the ground before they've even started. Every single character is so incredibly rich, I'd like to take a look at each one briefly...<br/><br/>http://funkyforestfirstcontact.wordpress.com/"

","Irving Rosenfeld along with his cunning and seductive British partner Sydney Prosser are forced to work for wild FBI agent Richie DiMaso. <br/><br/>DiMaso pushes them into a world of power-brokers and mafia that's as dangerous as it is enthralling. <br/><br/>A volatile, New Jersey political operator is caught between the con-artists and Feds. But its Irving's unpredictable wife, Rosalyn who could be the one to pull the cord that brings their worlds crashing down.<br/><br/>Apart from The Fighter, it's really difficult to place any of Russell's movies into a genre. Try Silver Linings Playbook, most would say Drama, but its funny, romantic, thrilling and musical.<br/><br/>Is you could stand this next to any other movies, it would cross Goodfellas with Boogie Nights, and just a pinch of Oceans 11.<br/><br/>Its a caper movie for sure, but the characters are richly explored, and each personality has a wonderful impact on the film. Bale of course is wonderful in this, channelling early De Niro by way of Tony Clifton. The look on his face when he has an accident with his hair in the opening scene, is laugh out loud funny.<br/><br/>The film is brilliantly funny in places, but it has such a dark arc to it, Coopers random outbursts of anger and De Niros appearance are both sinister and give the film a sadistic edge.<br/><br/>Adams has never been better, and Lawrence proves she is going to be one big star.<br/><br/>Many have said that they walked out, or its boring. Well those who walked out have missed the beautiful twist come the end, and the others, well, your wrong.<br/><br/>Its not going to win many awards, but its a fun ride."

","The scams, the characters and the movie itself are all in it together. ""American Hustle"" reminded me of ""The Prestige"" in that manner and both are led by Christian Bale and both masterpieces. There is a message about escape of own boring humdrum existences and upgrade and while many fantasize about it, like going to the movies. These characters all did it in their interesting and twisted ways. Some through lust, criminal benefit, some for good and some because they had no other better choices, as in with our leading man and lady , Christian Bale, and Amy Adams. He was was as convincing and she was constantly alluring, which was all part of the scam, as if being a beautiful and smart woman wasn't enough, she added the English accent and foo-foo name and everyone went over the top for her! The film is masked by the era in style, attitude, with an angel-light gritty glow that drapes the scenes while a 1970's soundtrack pulls us along. There was ironic humor (Live And Let Die), sadness (Dirty Work, Goodbye Yelowbrick Road), youthful excitement (I Saw The Light) and innocent danger (Evil Ways) in the music that spotlighted the naiveté of the characters and of the era itself. The Abscam plot and fact that the trap ensnared more than its goal was another example of this unbridled greed of the times, but it is all about character and characters."
"akash_sebastian","8","0","3","11 January 2014"," David O.Russell Surprising and Entertaining Us Like Always!
","David O.Russell very well knows how to surprise and entertain his audience. The last two films he made, one a sports-drama ('The Fighter'), and the other a romantic comedy/drama ('Silver Linings Playbook'), were brilliantly directed. And now in this movie, a crime-drama set in the late 70's, he brings back four of his talented stars, two from each of his previous two movies, and gets a spectacular result.<br/><br/>Though the story revolves around con-artists, feds and politicians, the amount of depth it has and the way it explores each of its characters is what's beautiful about the movie. The hopes, the dreams, the ambitions, the cons, the fears, the loneliness, the pain - everything is at a human level, which makes the characters so genuine and relatable. It had been long since I saw a crime-drama which had deep characters rather than caricatures walking around.<br/><br/>Christian Bale, the perfectionist, completely embodies the character of Irving Rosenfeld who's a fat, partially-bald and witty con-artist. Amy Adams and Bradley Cooper are terrific as well in their new characters. And Jennifer Lawrence, who has such less screen time compared to the other three, really shines as the naive blonde ball-busting wife (of Irving) with a big mouth and careless attitude. She plays it with so much heart, and her confrontational scene in the ladies' washroom with Amy Adams is unforgettable. Jeremy Renner and Louis C.K. are wonderful additions to the cast, and fit in quite well.<br/><br/>Another thing I really have to mention is the movie's soundtrack. It's breathtaking, and really encompasses the feel of the character's emotions and the era it represents.<br/><br/>I hope Russell keeps coming up with such brilliant movies."
"SteveMierzejewski","9","0","3","11 January 2014"," So far, the best film of the year
","This is a tight movie. The acting is tight, the story is tight, and the direction is tight. There are no loose ends, nothing unnecessary, and no lapses in acting. In short, this is as close to a perfectly made movie as I've seen for some time. I would suspect a number of Academy Award nominations to come from this film. I would especially note Christian Bale and Jennifer Lawrence's performances, but all of the acting is outstanding down to the lowest member of the supporting cast. I would be very surprised if David O. Russell is not nominated for best director. Best picture? Well, so far, I've seen nothing better. Even the music that adds to the late 1970's/80's atmosphere is well-chosen.<br/><br/>Since the story is so tightly put together, you really don't want to go out to feed the dog or you're likely to miss some fine point that will leave you wondering what's going on when you return. The story itself is not demanding but the motivation behind the characters' actions requires some build up. The relationships are strange but believable.<br/><br/>Don't expect a serious drama. Yes, it has its serious elements but there is ample humor here, though it is admittedly somewhat offbeat humor. Nonetheless, I guarantee you will get some good laughs.<br/><br/>So, why not give it ten stars? That's more of a subjective point. My scale is absolute, meaning that a ten star movie has to have qualities that put it well beyond other films. Will it endure? Will people consider it a classic 20 years from now? Could you watch it multiple times without getting bored, even when you know the ending? Does it have philosophical depth that illuminates principles beyond the film itself? Actually, I did watch this a second time. I wanted to look more closely at the interactions between the characters. It held up on the second viewing. I appreciated the acting even more than I did on the first viewing. In 20 years, I may even upgrade my rating to ten stars, but, for now, let me just say that this is one you should watch."

I'm also noticing a lot of Internet hate directed at the film, with people referring to it as a narrative mess, too light and fluffy, not as good as they were hoping it would be. I don't think it's a great film, and not even Russell's best (that honor belongs to ""I Heart Huckabees"" for me), but I don't know why people hate it so much, as if the film has personally betrayed them in some way.

Watching this movie, it struck me that Jennifer Lawrence has the sass and believable ""denseness"" of Lucille Ball along with the sexiness and vulnerability of Marilyn Monroe. She can play a character who lives in her own world as well as anyone around. Lawrence is a one-of-a- kind talent. I don't know what she's like in person, but there must be some of these qualities in her off-screen self. She's riveting to watch, and so were all the others in this movie.

","American Hustle opens with the sight of Christian Bale as we've never seen him before: It's Batman with a beer belly and a bad comb-over, one which we see him meticulously craft – strand by strand -- in front of a mirror. It's a metaphor for -- and a foreshadowing of -- the elaborate deceptions we're about to witness.<br/><br/>As the opening disclaimer exuberantly states: ""Some of this actually happened."" Director David O. Russell's seriocomedy is loosely based on the Abscam scandal/sting operation of the late 1970s. Bale and Amy Adams play a pair of con artists who are nabbed by an ambitious – and often unscrupulous -- FBI agent, played by Bradley Cooper. Cooper's character promises to let them walk in exchange for their help in taking down other corrupt characters. But as we soon see, nearly everyone in this movie is scamming someone else.<br/><br/>All the major characters are pretending to be something that they are not in order to manipulate others and get what they want. The main theme is the struggle of these characters to maintain their facades while suppressing their true selves. They may be able to fool others, but can only fool themselves for so long.<br/><br/>The film is, at its core, a love triangle involving the characters played by Bale, Cooper and Adams. It examines how true love can give someone the courage and desire to be truly honest with another person. The leading trio gives impressive and dynamic performances, disappearing into their roles. All three leading cast members have previously appeared in one of Russell's films, as have supporting players Jennifer Lawrence (who maximizes her limited screen time, stealing ever scene she's in) and Shea Whigham. Russell (Three Kings, Silver Linings Playbook) reuses so many actors; he seems to be in the process of starting his own repertory company. Comedian Louis C.K. also adds to his burgeoning film resume with his second terrific supporting role of 2013 (his part in Blue Jasmine being the other). The weak link is Jeremy Renner, who is badly miscast as a New Jersey Mayor.<br/><br/>The movie captures the period perfectly, from the fashions and hairdos -- right down to the tin lids on jars of Skippy peanut butter. Russell propels the action with a superlative musical score of wall-to-wall (mostly)'70s hits. He even uses the old school Columbia Pictures logo from that era.<br/><br/>With American Hustle's Me Decade time period, its criminal underworld setting, heavy use of voice-over narration, numerous wide-angle tracking shots, freeze-frames and aforementioned generous use of pop hits on the soundtrack, it would be understandable if someone mistakenly believed that The Wolf of Wall Street wasn't the only movie Martin Scorsese directed this past year. I'll simply assume that this movie is Russell homage to Scorsese. (He even includes one of Scorsese's frequent collaborators in a surprise cameo.) The movie's primary flaw is the fact it's a little lacking in the pathos department. Because nearly every character in the movie lies, deceives or manipulates in some way, it's hard to root for anyone. So, the resolution, when it arrives, is rather joyless."

","I have rarely come out of a film buzzing as much as I did leaving the theatre after American Hustle. Director David O. Russel has brought us a film with a razor sharp script involving story and incredible acting.<br/><br/>I would like to start with Christian Bale:<br/><br/>Bale continues to show he is one of the top actors in Hollywood, he can go from being Batman to American Psycho to his brilliant co-star role in the fighter. Here he plays a brilliant con-man. He had to put on a lot of weight for this role and he looked every bit the part. He was phenomenal in this movie. <br/><br/>Bradley Cooper was also fantastic in this movie.<br/><br/>Amy Adams was sexy and alluring and really showed what a talent she is as an actress. I recently enjoyed her role in ""Trouble with the curve"" here she plays a completely different characte,r and her scenes with Cooper and Bale dripped with sensuality and intensity. Even still Jennifer Lawrence possibly stole the best supporting actress Oscar from her; as she was a mixture between completely insane, but also funny and also mesmerising. She brought everything and her character almost brought the hustle and Bale down. This is an amazing performance from Lawrence. The whole supporting cast did its part, and a special mention to De Niro as the terrifying crime boss. His one scene is so intense you will still be talking about it afterwards.<br/><br/>I won't go into the plot, but the directing was cut from the same cloth as a great Tarantino movie in terms of razor sharp dialogue and moments equally tense, but also with a comic edge. This film has everything and I thoroughly recommend it."
"takashi_kupo","4","0","1","9 January 2014"," American Tussle
","I expected so much from this movie, and did it deliver? Well, let's see: It has an amazing ensemble cast. Each with their Oscar statues or Oscar nominations. Those cast members each turn in a good to great performance (if the script was there for them). The costumes are fabulous, the set pieces are good, and the cinematography is great. But throughout the film there are things missing. And not just little things that you can't put your finger on. There are big, tremendous, Jennifer Lawrence head banging to ""Live and Let Die"" things missing.<br/><br/>For starters, the director's choice to start the movie off with a scene from somewhere near the middle is just confusing. The only thing that we learn from that scene is that Irving (Christian Bale) is a balding fatty who is pretty good at covering up his hair. And honestly, it's confusing, because Edith (Amy Adams) has an accent that disappears and reappears about five times during the first fifteen minutes till she narrates to us that she's actually an American. We don't find out why she has an English accent until that fifteen minute mark, and honestly, I'm still trying to answer the question of whether it's worth the first fifteen minutes of confusion.<br/><br/>But unsettling editing choices aside, the script itself is just generic. I don't' want to bore you with all the details of movies that have done these particular cons better so I will cut to the chase: We have a con artist movie which is really about the characters. But without a tightly sewn plot, and endearing character development, those characters are meaningless. Sure they are acted very well, but the only person who actually goes through any meaningful change is Rosalynd (Jennifer Lawrence). Her epiphany that it's okay to break the family tradition is satisfactory for the story because she learns something and she changes. And literally, she is the only person in the film to ponder whether she can change and thinks it's tough while on the other hand, you have someone like Irving and Edith who are just trying so dearly to keep the lives they have that when they do change, you just don't believe it.<br/><br/>There's a scene at the end that really takes the cake too. One that proves this movie need about six more months worth of rewrites and planning before it went ahead with production. Irving finally comes to his senses and has to confess to the only friend that he's ever made that he has lied to that friend and will make said friend go to jail for a long time. What transpires though is a phony and outrageous schtick of a scene followed by a monologue where Irving confesses, ""I will regret losing that friendship for the rest of my life."" Never really contemplating that the friendship he had was based entirely on lies and that it was a set-up from the beginning. That not once, was any real action Irving took, with the exception of his confession, in the best interest of their ""friendship"".<br/><br/>The script was completely hackneyed, overwrought with clichés and tropes, and terribly reminiscent of better con movies from the past. The only saving grace of the film which puts us at 7 stars (and which might change in the future if I re-watch it) is the performance of Amy Adams and Christian Bale. Jennifer Lawrence is a star here too, but her choice to use a New Jersey accent, then drop that accent during every scene, is terrible. Bale really does the best with what he has and is always reliable when it comes to transforming his entire body for a role (I love that he commits to being an overweight, balding con artist). And Adams finally shows us what she's worth in a leading role, convincing us that she comes from where she says she comes, and that she doesn't want to be the person she started out in life being. Her emotions are so genuine throughout and it's easy to get caught up in hurricane at any moment.<br/><br/>So, watch Hustle if you dare. But don't go in with high expectations because that will just hurt you for the two hours that you watch it."
"peakcrew","8","0","3","9 January 2014"," Unusually, I liked this film a lot.
","This is the sort of film I'd usually go out of my way to avoid. I don't like crime capers, I find David O. Russell, Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Laurence totally over-rated, and I hate wobbly cameras (has the tripod industry gone bust?). My favoured type of films are science-fiction and animation. I went to see this almost entirely because of Christian Bale and especially Amy Adams, of whom I am a big fan - and even more especially because of her wardrobe in this movie :-) The 8/10 I've given it is therefore quite a big thing, since I reserve that for excellent sci-fi ...<br/><br/>This worked for me because it was intelligent, unpredictable, and some of the acting was truly first-class. It annoys me that some Oscar-worthy performances are going to be ignored just because there is a film about slavery out this year. Amy Adams and Christian Bale were, as ever, excellent, and it was good to see them stepping out of their traditional roles - Bale away from good-looking hard man to out-of-shape baldy with a lot of weak spots, and Adams from the cute good-girl to a knowingly sexy vamp. Bradley Cooper, on the other hand, was predictably awful: I do not see what anyone finds so good about this man. He is predictably one-dimensional, and seems to make no effort to get into a character. However, the revelation was Jennifer Laurence - I doubt I will ever like her, but she really showed that she can *act* in this movie! Her role as the shallow, manipulative wife showed that criminals are far from the worst type of person in the movie.<br/><br/>I know that some people are criticising the plot - well, for me, this is one of the solid points of the film. It reflected real life in that it wasn't tidy, people did things that might not have made total sense, and it meant that the ending could have gone any of several ways. I am delighted the team went for a happy ending, because for a while I was worried that the movie was going to do something I utterly detest - change from a light-hearted comedy to one in which a great deal of violence is inflicted on people. (Indeed, another category of movie I avoid like the plague is one in which violence is shown in real-life situations - I have not seen, and will never willingly see, ""The Godfather"" or ""The Fighter"" etc., for instance.) I was a little disappointed that there was some entirely gratuitous violence that went unpunished, since it did nothing to advance the plot (seriously, are we expected to believe that a law-enforcement officer can beat up and pull a gun on a senior officer and get away with it??) A final point of excellence is the soundtrack. It was good to hear some songs that are not usually heard in movies, and I'm especially pleased that Jeff Lynne will be raking in the royalties, since he is one of the most under-recognised musicians of the last forty years, in my mind (I think there are three tracks of his in the movie)! Overall, this was one of the best films I've seen for some time. I can see why it might have annoyed some people, and I don't know if I would actually have gone to see it if I didn't have a free ticket from my phone operator (thanks, Orange Wednesdays!), but it was worth the 2+ hours to discover something really special."
"rogerdarlington","Null","0","3","8 January 2014"," So much talent and so much fun
","""Goodfellas"" meets ""The Sting"" in this gloriously fun black comedy co-written and directed by David O Russell with a cast to die for. I confess that I would have gone to see it for Jennifer Lawrence alone and she gives another wonderful performance as the blousy and totally wacky wife of the narrator Irv played by Christian Bale looking a million miles from his lean role as ""Batman"", all bespectacled, bewigged and paunchy. The revelation though is Amy Adams who is terrific in the best (and sexiest) role of her career as the Irv's partner in hustling and in fornicating Sydney. Then there is Bradley Cooper as the manic FBI agent who wants to use Irv and Sydney to ensnare some bigger fish and Jermey Renner as the first of those biggest fish.<br/><br/>As if this wasn't enough, there is a surprise cameo role by a big name actor who is uncredited. Plus the five lead actors almost have a sixth companion in the form of their hair, three of them appearing in rollers and one of them with a quiff which alone makes it clear - as if the clothes and the music were insufficient - that we are in the late 1970s.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the movie, we are told that ""some of this actually happened"" and that is a reference to the ""Abscam"" operation mounted by the FBI with the aid of a fake sheikh. But nothing and nobody is real here; everything and everyone is obfuscation if not outright deception. At one point, Irv describes his wife as ""the Picasso of passive- aggressive karate"" and Russell draws from a varicoloured palette of talent to present us with an animated version of Hieronymus Bosch."
"bobsgrock","Null","0","2","7 January 2014"," The Great Con Divide
","With a star-studded cast, lavish cinematography which so effectively evokes the 1970's bewildering chic style, and a plot line intended to rekindle memories of other hustling movies from this era such as The Sting, American Hustle has all the glitz and glamor necessary to become both a popular and critical acclaim. The co-writer and director, David O. Russell, has emerged in recent years as a force to be reckoned with. His most eclectic collection of works includes delving into the world of existential detectives fighting nihilism, a truth-based story of an underdog boxer fighting for his and his troubled brother's reputation, and a romantic tale of two mentally unstable people falling in love. Clearly, Russell has a wild imagination and he puts it on full display in his most ambitious and commercial project to date. Loosely based (as it so willingly tells us up front) on the ABSCAM scandal of the 1970s, Russell treats the case like a true filmmaker: he takes what he wants, abandons what he does not, and shakes it all up to create a perfect concoction of Hollywood craftsmanship and subtle plot manipulation.<br/><br/>This is not to say that these traits are condemnations. Indeed, in the world in which Russell attempts to let this movie live, these are necessary hallmarks, as Christian Bale so smoothly tells us, ""Everyone hustles to survive."" Russell must have smiled with delight in writing that line since it so precisely reveals the justification needed both by the con artist characters in the film and the filmmakers in which they reside. Obviously, he prefers a character study to a straight-up Ocean's Eleven type double-crossing plot structure. Such an ensemble cast has swallowed his bait. Nearly everyone loves playing dress-up here, not just with clothes but also hair, jewelry and accents. It's an actor's dream come true. Bale goes method, as he so often does, gaining a gut and giving himself a noticeably bad, fake comb-over, which Russell fonds over for several minutes in the film's opening. Bradley Cooper wears mini-curlers to make his straight hair curly, lives with his androgynous mother and a woman who says she is his fiancé, and seemingly lives passionately for his job as an FBI agent determined to crack down on corrupt bureaucrats, politicians and ultimately, the Mafia. Jeremy Renner must have needed several bottles of hairspray, but mostly plays it straight as a mayor with a heart of gold, evident from his large, multi-cultural family, who wants only to protect his community from financial crisis. <br/><br/>While the men fuss over their looks so profusely, the women in this film almost certainly went overboard as well, though for them the effect must have been even more profound. Amy Adams and Jennifer Lawrence raid the Elizabeth Taylor closet and layer themselves with furs, backless and strapless dresses of the gaudiest colors, as well as hairstyles that would make any 18th century French woman jealous. If it seems that there has been too much emphasis on the look of this movie, it must be stressed that the movie stresses these elements on its own volition. It grows almost to the point of overpowering the story and characterization. Most audiences will claim to not have a problem with it, but for those trying to see what lies behind the material elements will prove difficult.<br/><br/>While Russell freely admits to not basing his entire story on true events, the fact that he even inserted the title card ""Some of this happened"" at the beginning shows his desire to remind us that the acts and personalities of these characters are rooted in reality. Why is this necessary information to digest before the film begins? The intended effect on the audience, presumably, is to trick us into believing more of the outlandish results and developments as we continue to watch. No matter what we see, we are still reminded some variation of these events did happen at one point to people faintly like the ones we are watching on the screen. At this point, is it even worth mentioning? Why not simply take a story like this and use it as a launching pad for a completely new and different take on the con game sub-genre? Even if this was Russell's original intent, it still renders the use of that title card almost entirely useless.<br/><br/>Perhaps the greatest fault one can find with this film is that it is too self-conscious. Having focused so much effort on the look of the film, one gets wrapped up in a story that is all surface with little substance. Yet, on one level, this may be a clever ruse by Russell. After all, the entire story is about various people conning one another for various reasons, as well as themselves into acting in ways they wouldn't ordinarily consider. Though this would seem to rustle up some emotional conflict, Russell practically telegraphs his intentions through dialogue and the actors' faces, thus deflating any intent of luring us in for the whole movie. All the actors are clearly enjoying themselves, especially Lawrence who plays her role as a sassy, fiercely unstable woman determined to hold on to whatever remains of her shattered life. It is a brave performance, although in the end she remains mostly obsolete to the story. By contrast, Adams is thoroughly stunning in all her outfits as well as a great counterpart to the introvert and conflicted Bale. Indeed, all the actors chew the scenery as though it were delicious beef jerky. The result is a mostly interesting, though altogether somewhat unfulfilled experience which is a letdown considering the buildup this film gives itself. In a way, this is just another con by Russell, but the audience may not be as receptive as the FBI."
"chrisdmeads-304-886334","8","0","4","7 January 2014"," A Highly Entertaining Crime Film
","American Hustle is David O. Russell's successor to the excellent Silver Linings Playbook, bringing together the stars of that film and the stars of his equally excellent effort, The Fighter. It is as a result of having such a talented cast at his disposal, that O. Russell manages to make a needlessly complicated narrative an entertaining piece of cinema in the vein of masterpieces such as Goodfellas and Boogie Nights.<br/><br/>The film is very loosely based on a real FBI scam conducted in the late 1970's and stresses this right at the start in order to help you suspend your disbelief throughout this crazy thrill ride. We're introduced to a pair of con artists (Christian Bale and Amy Adams) who are ultimately coerced by an eager FBI agent (Bradley Cooper) into using their particular skill sets to entrap corrupt politicians in order to secure their freedom. However, as the scam develops and the mob gets involved, it soon becomes clear that Christian Bale's loose cannon of a wife (Jennifer Lawrence) may be the one to ruin the whole operation for everybody involved.<br/><br/>American Hustle's main quality does not derive from its plot but from its hugely flawed characters, who have been expertly brought to life. Christian Bale looks almost unrecognisable as the out of shape conman Irving Rosenfeld. He is highly believable as a man who has been forced by his lack of options to operate on the wrong side of the law in order to survive. Amy Adams gives arguably the best performance of her career as con artist Sydney Prosser, who like Irving is doing her best with her limited options and envisions a better life for herself. The electric chemistry between these two characters is upset by Bradley Cooper's FBI agent Richie DiMaso, creating an interesting love triangle. Completing this outstanding core cast are Jennifer Lawrence who once again proves her excellence as Irving's mad manipulative wife Rosalyn and Jeremy Renner, whose portrayal of well-intentioned corrupt mayor Carmine Polito is brilliant.<br/><br/>The main theme that unites all of these characters is their pursuit of the American dream. Whether it's Irving and Sydney's dream of simply a better life or Richie's dream of making a name for himself and landing a gorgeous woman or Carmine's dream of building something bigger, everyone is doing everything within their power to achieve their dreams. The film not only provides a commentary on how the ideology of the American dream had such a profound effect upon 1970's American society, but also on how all of life is essentially a con. American Hustle suggests that people are constantly conning one another to get what they want and are even conning themselves just to get through life. This makes the con artists who are usually vilified in other films more grey and human, as they're portrayed as a more extreme reflection of society.<br/><br/>The period detail in American Hustle is very high quality and matches the benchmark for period detail set by US drama series Mad Men. All of the costumes and aesthetic details contribute to creating such a rich world and well and truly immersing the audience in the story. Authentic music from the 1970's is scattered throughout the film with famous songs such as Delilah and the Bond theme song Live and Let Die making an appearance. Music is such a key part of American Hustle and there are many serendipitous moments when the perfect song is used to convey the mood and tone of a scene.<br/><br/>However, there are a few faults that prevent American Hustle from being a truly amazing film. Despite only having a runtime of just over two hours, the narrative isn't meaty enough to warrant this amount of time and the film begins to feel drawn out towards the end. This feeling predominantly stems from the fact that a number of scenes are too wordy and could've done with some editing. Furthermore, in order to understand all of the intricacies of a simple enough plot, you'll need to pay very close attention as the plot isn't explained as well as it could be.<br/><br/>Ultimately, American Hustle is a very funny and entertaining crime film with many talented performers performing at the top of their game. Whilst you can't help but feel slightly conned by the fact that a film with so much talent that promised to be a masterpiece falls short of this feat, you should still see this excellent film that looks set to win many awards."

","Not being a huge fan of David O Russell's last two features, I went in to American Hustle with an air of doubt and cynicism. But by the end credits I was left aghast that I might not see another thoroughly enjoyable film in 2014.<br/><br/>David O Russel has always emphasised his overlying importance of character empathy over plot and this becomes evident throughout the film. Plot wise this films still holds up (on first viewing anyway) and galvanises the films enjoyment, but the care and meticulous handling of each character is where the true pleasure blossoms from.<br/><br/>Kudos goes to Christian Bale who although an exceptional actor, always feels a little vain and unable to blend into a film when not cast as the leading actor. But here Bale reign's in his performance allowing the rest of the cast to work off of him to great delight. Hopefully we can see more of this within his career.<br/><br/>Great entertainment, that I would recommend to everyone. Although flawed I believe this a film that takes its flaws and embraces them."

","Can anyone possibly look half descent... and dare I say charming with a beer gut and a horrid toupee? The answer is yes, Christian Bale looks awkwardly dashing to say the least in this master piece from D. Russell. He somehow manages to over shadow Bradley Coopers fabulous curls with his ""stunning"" figure. By the end, however, you won't remember the dead animal on top of Bales hair line or his amazing dialogue or the beer keg Bale is carrying around under his shirt.. What will manage to stick with you will ultimately be the endearing way Christian carries himself. He is considered one of the greatest actors of this generation for good reason. <br/><br/>Any who, enough of putting Bale up on pedestal all by himself. Lawrence is just a remarkable actress as we have come to realize. She has fit into any role she has set her mind to. We are beginning to witness the young actress become a household name. As for Cooper , it was only a matter of time that he finally acquired a script worthy of his acting skills. Major ""kudos"" to Russell for bringing together a cast worthy of being deemed the ""dream team"" of Hollywood. If you love Drama and great actors with a ton of witty catch phrases to spew out through the course of a film you will love American Hustle. De Niro only appears in the film for a few minutes yet you can't help but feel nostalgic seeing the legend still rocking the big screen. It was a phenomenal film and a great thrill ride, you will hold your breath until your lungs beg for a bit of oxygen.

So what's new? Movies have shown that for years. What does Russell do that makes this feel so different? Well, let's start with his opening credit: ""Some of this actually happened."" Right away we begin watching for the ""real moments"", right away we are on the edge of our seats. In one interview, Bale talks about Russell telling the cast to use the script as a ""guide"" - so often times they are totally off script. Many of the best scenes in the movie are actually improvised. I think this is what makes it so brilliant - it is just so real.<br/><br/>The wardrobe and hairstyles are outstanding! The early scene in which Bale's character tends to his comb-over is as heartbreaking as it is disgusting. And don't worry, the soundtrack is just as sleazy.<br/><br/>Christian Bale is AMAZING.

","Ah David O'Russell, you continue to impress me.<br/><br/>American Hustle stars Christian Bale, Bradley Cooper, Amy Adams, Jeremey Renner and Jennifer Lawrence. Besides Renner, each of these actors/actresses have worked with O Russell before, and oh god does this man know who to work with.<br/><br/>Last year the director brought us Silver Linings playbook, a fresh burst of energy and entertainment which most audiences loved, Jennifer Lawrence even won an academy award for her role in the film. Oh and lets not forget 'The Fighter' the first David O Russell flick I saw in which American Hustle's lead Christian Bale snatched up an academy award. When I left the screening of this movie I couldn't help to think to myself 'who's next?' for the Oscar, its safe to say the performances in this film are definitely worthy.<br/><br/>Christian Bale, the master of method acting, is incredible as sleazy con-man Irving Rosenfeld, the films protagonist. 'He wasn't necessarily in good shape' Amy Adams states early in the film referring to Bale who gained over 40 pounds to play Irving, you may be thinking its ridiculous how Bale can transform his body for a certain role, however don't be conned into believing its more ridiculous than Irving's highly laughable comb over, which may be more out of shape than the character himself.<br/><br/>Irving and his seductive lover Sydney are forced into working for FBI agent Richie Dimaso, played dynamically by a curly haired Bradley Cooper, who is astounding in this film. I previously mentioned how impressive Christian Bale's performance was, but Cooper's on screen chemistry with Amy Adams was one of American Hustle's triumphs, the actors seem to bounce off each other, leading me to believe that the film benefited from the often improvised scenes. Smart, snappy and sexy, Amy Adams delivers a passionate performance as Sydney proves how versatile of an actress she is; hats off to Adams, who deserves an Oscar nomination for her role.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence, who plays Irving's unpredictable, beautiful 'trophy' wife Rosalyn, is great here, the 'live and let die' scene was crafted spectacularly, a personal favourite out of so many enjoyable scenes, Once again Jennifer Lawrence proves that she is one of the finest, most likable actresses working in Hollywood today. Jeremy Renner, the newcomer, stars as Carmine Polito, a New Jersey politician who seems to be in the wrong place at the wrong time during the latter period of the film. Renner shines and is at his very best here, and even though the film's pacing is often dragged out from time to time, and it may be a little too long, all of these characters are so interesting to watch, whether we pity them, show empathy for them or want to scream at them, they are so damn enjoyable and interesting to watch; David O Russell could not have chose a better cast.<br/><br/>It's not just the cast that really sells American Hustle to its audience, its how energetic and smooth David O Russell's directing is. The film is packed with a nostalgic 70's soundtrack and Scorsese influenced set pieces that go hand in hand with the rich, elaborate cinematography and often exaggerated, emphasised costume designs, David O Russell sells his audience a film that seems to come natural to him. People have already started to criticise that American Hustle is often too reminiscent of Scorsese films such as 'Casino' but the scenes are so well directed that certain nods to Scorsese become merely a gesture from O Russell to show that he has leaned from the best.<br/><br/>The script, originally titled 'American Bullshit' is superb, often heavily dialogue driven, as viewers we don't get bored of the quirky, peculiar conversations these characters have, in fact, we anticipate more of it. The film is completely unpredictable, who would have thought a story about ice fishing would have been so funny? And who would of thought Robert De-Niro's Miami mobster could speak Arabian? Nobody, not even the characters themselves, who are so convincing. If you get the chance, go and see American Hustle, I promise you, it isn't a con to try and take your money, however, you will be conned into realising that David O Russell as a filmmaker just keeps getting better, and better."

","""American Hustle"" is a laugh-out-loud funny, very clever, well-produced, well-acted movie about conmen, crooked politicians, and an FBI sting operation. I enjoyed it while I was watching it but it left me empty. I didn't care about any of the characters or the plot points. I wasn't rooting for anybody and I wasn't involved in anything. Ultimately ""American Hustle"" felt been-there-done-that to me, and gimmicky and shallow. It reminded me of a lot of previous films about lovable gangsters and conmen, like ""Goodfellas,"" ""The Sting,"" and ""Guys and Dolls."" Christian Bale as petty conman Irving Rosenfeld reminded me of Frank Sinatra as Nathan Detroit. <br/><br/>The gimmicks begin as the movie opens. It opens on a shot of Christian Bale's fat and bloated stomach. Bale is famous for losing weight for his role in ""The Machinist."" Then he became buff and muscular for ""Batman."" For ""American Hustle"" Christian Bale gave himself a fat gut. His fat gut takes up about thirty seconds of screen time and Bale could have played the role without it. His gut took me out of the movie. I started thinking, not about the character or the plot, but about Bale's tendency to gain or lose weight for roles. I assume he's pushing for an Oscar. I felt manipulated. <br/><br/>The plot is pretty pointless. A small time conman, Irving (Christian Bale) and his conwoman girlfriend Sydney / Edith (Amy Adams) are recruited by FBI agent Richie (Bradley Cooper) to snag crooked politicians, including the mayor of Camden Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner). Irving's wife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence) gets in the way and causes some comic mayhem. Robert DeNiro shows up as a dangerous Mafioso. <br/><br/>The production values are very high. The costumes are outrageous: velvet tuxedos and open shirts revealing hairy chests and gold chains. Amy Adams and Jennifer Lawrence are all decked out and paraded like models. In ""Night at the Museum 2"" Amy Adams wore tight, flesh-colored jodhpurs. Everyone talks about her butt in that movie. In ""American Hustle"" she wears plunging necklines and slit skirts. Everyone will be talking about her breasts and legs. <br/><br/>The direction is fluid and musical – you feel like you're on an amusing ride. 1970s pop hits make up the soundtrack and action is choreographed to fit the music. <br/><br/>The movie is laugh-out-loud funny, funnier than some films billed as comedies. It's hard to tell what genre the film is meant to be, because there are scenes where characters are obviously in pain. <br/><br/>The audience is conned as well as the characters on screen. There is a surprise. The surprise felt pretty cheap to me. The surprise was executed not by cleverness, but simply by hiding information from the audience. <br/><br/>The performances are all fun to watch and very strong. Problem for me was that each performance seemed to exist in its own world. Christian Bale is doing comedy and parody. He is mocking the character he plays, and low class conmen in general. Jennifer Lawrence is weak. She is pretty, pouty, and young, but I didn't catch any acting talent. Bradley Cooper, as the FBI agent, is intense and grating in his hyper ambition and lack of smarts and caution. His character never came together for me, never achieved any coherence. <br/><br/>Amy Adams is the heart of the movie. She is fiercely intelligent, deadly, really, in her amorality and her love for her man. The real standout is Jeremy Renner as Camden, NJ, mayor Carmine Polito. Renner is from a completely straight, serious movie. He comes across not as an actor playing a role, but as the ""real"" Carmine Polito, though Polito is a fictional character based on former Camden mayor Angelo Errichetti.<br/><br/>""American Hustle"" depicts conflict between straight, square people who tell the truth and con artists who lie, cheat and steal. As is often the case in Hollywood films, ""American Hustle"" comes down firmly on the side of con artists. ""Everybody's a con artist!"" the film wants you to believe. ""Everybody lies, cheats, and steals!"" Hollywood would take this stance because Hollywood manufactures illusions. <br/><br/>""American Hustle"" alters history to make this position believable. ""American Hustle"" becomes heavy-handed in its insistence on manipulating its audience into liking two characters and disliking a third. Camden's mayor was not the saint the film wants you to think he was, and the real Irving didn't do the kindly things the film depicts him as doing. Camden, NJ, is a horrible place to live. Its population is shrinking. It ranks first in violent crime. Political corruption is rampant. In making a saint out of the mayor of Camden, David O. Russell sticks his Hollywood finger in the eye of New Jersey's poor and crime victims."

","I'm one of the minority who didn't really enjoy this movie all that much. The laughter and clapping at the viewing I went to (in Florida) surprised me. I actually fell asleep for about 15 minutes during the first half.<br/><br/>This is a movie that hinges on dialogue, character development, writing and setting. There were some amazing character-driven scenes in this movie. It's very strong on these points.<br/><br/>As everyone has noted, the acting was astonishing. I enjoyed these performances, just as I enjoyed the 70s music. I'm glad I've seen Jennifer Lawrence's unforgettable performance as Rosalyn Rosenfeld. However, I'm wondering about the casting of Bale and Renner. They both did excellent jobs, but what is the point of taking actors to these strange places? <br/><br/>I suppose part of my problem with this movie was that I simply didn't like these characters. All this talent and effort, just to show us the world of these unlikeable, pathetic people.<br/><br/>Also, this movie had themes I have little interest in. Small-time hustling, sting operations, New Jersey, political corruption, the mob. If I had known beforehand that these were the themes, I wouldn't have gone.<br/><br/>Despite the movie's strong points, especially the acting performances, I was never really engaged or moved by this movie. I can't rate it highly."

","While 'American Hustle' begins with a disclaimer that 'some of this story is true' the viewer is more importantly left with a taste of how easily drawn into hustles all of us are, no matter the situation legal, above the law, or lost in deception.<br/><br/>Each character in this movie has a desire for power, success, validation - no matter the concept they are each one lost in their own need to define themselves in whatever capacity they choose. Though the story line takes awhile to get rolling, once it does, the audience is drawn into each character's psyche, and right through to the finale wondering how this might turn out. When the outcome seemed predictable, something else came into play to draw you further. <br/><br/>This movie contained a number of characters that you were clearly designed to dislike. In fact, I don't think I liked a single one, except perhaps the innocent bystander - figure of speech. The intrigue of this movie is the ability to have the audience wondering how they might react to a situation, and also, how easily they could relate to the drive of each character's actions. Where one wanted to succeed a scam, another wanted identity, while another simply wanted their life to be more purposeful than they ever believed it had been, and when things began to unravel it seemed clear that in the end everyone would probably die a brutal and cinematic death. That's not a spoiler, I assure you.<br/><br/>The acting was solid to the purposeful drive of the premise. The display of the human condition in its most ill spoken and vulnerable state though, was the driving force of the movie. The outcome, while testing your own preconceived notions of how generally, a con turns out badly, in some respects, helps define how the very fallibility of our human nature is an albatross we all carry around with ourselves in our search for definitive identities in our respective societies.<br/><br/>Thom Amundsen http://www.thinkingoutloudagain.wordpress.com"

","Pros: Tremendous acting, wonderfully directed scenes, great music, awesome costumes. In particular, Christian Bale and Amy Adams give superlative performances. J Law's scene in the restaurant where she says she doesn't like change was some amazing acting. Renner was solid. I really liked the fact that this film didn't have nonstop action and rather focused on character development. Every character in this movie was interesting and very well developed.<br/><br/>Cons: Dragged a bit at over 2 hours, payoff in the end was weak. The improvised dialogue was bad at times.

"charlotte_mosher","8","0","4","2 January 2014"," Another great movie from Russell.
","American Hustle (2013) is the latest work from David O. Russell, the man who brought us Silver Linings Playbook (2012), and The Fighter (2010). Hustle is about a con man, Irving Rosenfeld, (Bale) and his partner in crime, Sydney Prosser (Adams). Together, Rosenfeld and Prosser get into the business of conning people, making a living telling lies, until they're entrapped by Richie DiMaso (Cooper). DiMaso enlists them to help him capture four other con-men, bigger fish, in exchange for their freedom. The movie comes in at 138 minutes but each minute is captivating, and the pacing feels neither rushed or staggered as DiMaso struggles to keep his operation from falling apart. <br/><br/>The thing about this movie that stands out above all else is the character types and the motivations behind them. While the plot is always moving, and each action spurns it forward, one can find themselves more focused on the characters and their relationships. Russell focuses on characters, much like he did in his previous works, and the characters are what draws the audience in. Rosenfeld is a conman, someone who has built his life around lies and deception, yet by the end of the film you find yourself rooting for his success. Bale has constructed a character that is likable, despite the fact that he should, by all intents and purposes, be antagonistic. <br/><br/>Amy Adams has never been a favourite of mine, but she really stood out as Sydney Prosser. She captivated the attention of the audience in her scenes and while her sex appeal may have been overstated, the emotion and the motivations behind her characterizations kept you guessing from start to finish. Sydney's true motivations, the true plan, were held so close to the chest that it almost felt as if Adams had conned along with DiMaso. If anyone deserves an Oscar nomination, of the ensemble, it's Adams. <br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence, cast as Rosalyn Rosenfold, the eccentric wife of Irvine, was equal parts hilarious and heartbreaking. She depicted the role of a wife left to her own devices, trapped in a marriage of convenience due to her inability to accept change, and her struggle to communicate with a man who was distant, yet ever present. Her acting was fantastic, much like it was in Silver Linings Playbook, and I would not be surprised if she got an Oscar nod for her performance. She stole the show in the scenes that she was in, most notably the fight scene with Bale. Amazing acting, and I look forward to seeing what roles she takes in the future, and where her career goes.<br/><br/>Cooper was very good at playing the high-strung, success hungry, DiMaso. Much like in Silver Linings, he played eccentric and over the top very well, and has proved that he has come a long way from his Hangover days. If Cooper were smart, he'd stay on the path he's on, because with the roles he's been taking, and the performances, it wouldn't be a stretch to surmise that he could be accepting his first Oscar within the next 5 years.<br/><br/>That being said, Renner truly stole the show for me. He had a smaller role, but was pivotal to the story and to the unfolding of the larger plot. You truly believed that Carmine was making the right choices, that he believed in a greater good, and that came off very strongly through his character. Renner may have only just blipped up on the radar, but I expect to see him sticking around for quite some time. <br/><br/>All in all, the movie was paced well, the acting was superb, and the plot moved continuously throughout. The draw of this movie, more-so than the plot, is the characters. Each one felt very developed, and very compelling, and it was that element of the film that made it interesting. Reviews for the movie seemed torn, and I almost decided against seeing it, but I am glad that I did. The performances from Bale, Adams, and Renner were fantastic, and made the movie a must-see."

Set in the late 70s it gives this film a great feel, with cool character portrayals which are great to watch. The look of the film set must of given the crew a good challenge.

","This film tells the story of an FBI agent who works with two swindlers to bring down a large and powerful corruption gang in the government.<br/><br/>""American Hustle"" is very hyped as one of the best film of the year. With David O. Russell hot on the heels of his Oscar winner ""Silver Linings Playbook"", and the super stellar cast involved, one rightly has high expectations on it. The actors are charming in their roles, especially Amy Adams whose character is a smart woman who plays both sides of the game. Bradley Cooper's character is energetic and wild, and he is also an interesting character in the film. However, I find the plot rather uninteresting. It drags on too long, and there the events are not portrayed intense enough. And I was annoyed by Christian Bale's character's hair.<br/><br/>Maybe my expectations are too high, but I thought ""American Hustle"" was just an alright film, and certainly over-hyped."
"mayel714","7","0","3","30 December 2013"," Bring a pillow for the first 30 minutes
","Good Performance by the Batman although not the best of his career, he did just as good if not better in Out of the Furnace. Renner's hair looks too fake for not being your typically old mayor. He could have appeared with a more natural look. He looks like he just dyed his hair but was not necessary because he is not old in the movie where you can justify that he probably was getting rid of the gray. What was up with Amy Adams British accent? Way overdone on the accent and unnecessary. Great performance by Jennifer Lawrence. The DeNiro cameo by far the best part of the movie. If I have to associate this movie with Oscar in the same sentence it would have to include Jennifer Lawrence she was amazing and finally a woman. The rest of the movie was overall pretty good but not great. Great job on the trailers as it pumped me up to go see it but was not as good as I expected."
"Barky44","7","0","3","28 December 2013"," American Ham
","American Hustle is a fine movie, I suppose. I'm not really sure, to be honest. The problem is it's such a hamfest of a movie, it's hard to focus to know for sure.<br/><br/>This film has a lot going on beyond the characters and the story. It's set in the 70's, and such a horrendously clichéd version of the 70's it distracts you from those characters & story. You've got the red velvet leisure suits; the badly-fitting toupees; the ridiculously over-sized automobiles; the tight-curl perms; the bra-less, droopy dresses (OK, some distractions are worth it). Folks use ""ham"" to describe over-the-top acting, but here we have undeniably ""hammy"" use of sets, costumes, props, and locations. It's as if someone said ""find me everything 70's and dump it in this movie!"".<br/><br/>The problem is they don't just use these clichés for setting and atmosphere (like ""The Ice Storm"", for example), they just pile them up throughout the movie, right down to hackneyed scenes involving 70's-era mobsters late in the film. It's a cliché fest, and that distracts from the rest of the story. It's hard to take the main protagonist seriously under those ridiculous glasses.<br/><br/>Then again, it is a fairly shallow plot, with a somewhat weak ""surprise ending"", wrapping up the con inside a con inside a con. You've seen it all before, in movies of the ""con man"" genre over the decades. I'm guessing the writers wanted to dump all the 70's clichés into one film and wrote tossed together a con-man script to tie them together; OR they had a fairly weak script and felt they needed to dress it up with 70's nostalgia to generate interest.<br/><br/>The movie is OK. It has some funny moments. But it's not worth a full-price movie ticket, and is definitely not worth an Oscar nod."

But (well, there's always a ""but"" in all my reviews), the main leads are so good and strong in their characters that they made the fictional characters alive.<br/><br/>American Hustle has a simple plot with many complicated characters. Each characters are so different (no worries about confusing them with one another) that it was hilarious having them together. I love the film for the characters, but not the plot. The characters' late 70s dress style (or should I say hair style?) was amazing. Be it Irving's (Christian Bale) bald head combed to make the hair fuller, Rosalyn's upswept hair (Jennifer Lawrence), Richie's (Bradley Cooper) fake curls or Carmine's (Jeremy Renner) Elvis Presley hairdo, they are all screaming seventies. There's plenty of style, but little substance.<br/><br/>The terrific characters played by the wonderful actors earned four out of five stars from me.

"shawneofthedead","7","0","5","24 December 2013"," The film's greatest hustle is making you think it's better than it is. The performances are enormously enjoyable though.
","There are cons, hustles, lies, tricks and conspiracies aplenty in writer-director David O. Russell's Oscar-baiting American Hustle. It comes with the territory, of course, in this ostensibly based-on-a-true-story film about con artists working with the FBI to take down corrupt government officials. But one of the biggest hustles Russell pulls off is, quite simply, convincing audiences that they've just watched a great movie. There's no denying that American Hustle is filled with sizzling performances and some of the year's best scenes. But it's also a bit of a hollow, sprawling mess, strung together with great moments that don't really add up to a coherent whole.<br/><br/>Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale) is a small-time con artist who's figured out how to swindle his way to moderate success. Unexpectedly, he finds a soulmate in Sydney (Amy Adams), who's equally adept at lying to people and winning their trust and life savings. Rumbled by FBI agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper), Irving and Sydney - the latter in the guise of her British alter ego, Lady Edith Greensly - agree to help the FBI catch government officials in the act of taking bribes. Around the hapless form of genuine good guy Mayor Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner) evolves a crazy scheme comprising a made-up Arab sheikh, greedy mobsters, opportunistic politicians, real and fake money, hidden cameras... and the potentially disrupting influence of Irving's slightly unhinged wife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence).<br/><br/>At its best, there's a loose, loopy charm to American Hustle. It's a story of bad comb-overs and even worse decisions that starts out strongly, as Irving and Sydney take turns narrating their unconventional love story. Several scenes are so outlandishly silly - pretty much any involving the cooked-up Arab sheikh, Rosalyn and Richie's beleaguered boss Stoddard (Louis C.K., hilarious) - that it's impossible not to be swept up in the giddy swirl of confusion and double-crossing in which Russell's characters have wilfully trapped themselves. In those moments when the black comedy peeks through the pretense of its plot, American Hustle approaches the sublime.<br/><br/>But Russell's film - which he's revealed is about one-third improvised - is almost too loose and it's certainly too long. The moments that everyone will remember are padded out with narrative convolutions that don't add all that much to proceedings. Most of the scenes drag on a little longer than they presumably would have if the actors had stuck to a script. It's exactly as if Russell let his actors off a leash, and couldn't bear to excise some of their more free-styling moments - even if it would contribute to a smarter, tighter final cut of the film. As a result, the considerable zip, charm and joy of American Hustle's best sequences dissipate from moment to moment, making for a curiously deflating viewing experience.<br/><br/>There's no denying, however, that Russell has amassed a clutch of impressive performances from the combined casts of his last two films (The Fighter and Silver Linings Playbook). Bale anchors the entire enterprise with a knowing, vanity-free turn as a follicly-challenged hustler with a hidden heart of gold. His silent reactions to the insanity going on around him - whether it's Richie's ego bursting through the ceiling or Rosalyn arguing him into submission - are pitch-perfect. Cooper, too, continues to prove he can actually act under Russell's direction. He has a fine handle on Richie's enormous ego and burgeoning delusions of power and control, delighting in the sheer absurdity of this lawman who gets drunk with delight when he takes a walk on the unlawful side of the street.<br/><br/>Awards buzz has been heaped upon Russell's leading ladies as well, and for good reason. Adams spends rather too much of the film off-screen (especially in its second half), but she's so raw, brave, vulnerable and brassy - often in the same scene - that she provides the film with an unexpectedly truthful emotional core. In Adams' hands, Sydney is a rounded, sympathetic creation: one who loses and finds herself again amidst all the lies and deception.<br/><br/>Lawrence is a hoot as the mouthy, delusional Rosalyn, tottering through the entire film like a bleached-blonde time-bomb that could explode at any second. She's scintillating, maddening and frequently hilarious, even if it's hard to shake the feeling that she's just not right for the part. Lawrence is talented, no doubt about it - so talented that she almost makes the role work - but she just can't help coming off as precisely what she is: a young girl playing dress-up. Imagine an older actress - say, Julianne Moore, Naomi Watts or heck, even Amy Adams - playing the same role; she would lend the sad, dark weight of age and experience to Rosalyn's kookiness, something the sadly miscast Lawrence can't quite muster (through no fault of her own!) at the tender age of twenty-two.<br/><br/>Watch American Hustle for its plot - or a faithful re-enactment of the FBI's Abscam operation in the late 1970s - and you'll be sorely disappointed. Its story is a jumbled mess that isn't half as clever or complicated as it thinks it is. But Russell's cast shine brightly nonetheless. Their bold performances - and gleefully terrible hairdos - are the real strength and energy of Russell's film. For many moments, they make it easy to believe that American Hustle is the real thing. But take a closer look and it becomes clear that this diamond was really just cubic zirconia all along."
"mistarkus","6","0","5","23 December 2013"," fun plastic world
","In this exaggerated, over the top world the human drive is to get one over and out hustle the fellow man. The hustle is the theme of life in this 1970s New York City world. The convoluted plot was fun to follow, seeing where it meanders with tensions intensifying ultimately crescendo-ing into chaotic surprises. The chaos of the film may reflect the chaos the characters are feeling as the ""hustle"" ignites and explodes into danger. <br/><br/>A boring beginning with not the most thrilling characters ever created evolves into a more fun tricky plot. In order to preserve the mystery of the hustle we must be kept at a distance from some of the characters. We are never quite able to enter some of their heads until the very end, so throughout the movie the characters are vague and lack substance in our eyes. This distancing makes connecting with them difficult. So you ultimately don't really care too much about these characters.<br/><br/>American Hustle glorifies its actors and actresses. The overly exalted Amy Adams and Jennifer Lawrence are showcased in many scenes strutting their stuff with haughty confidence and moxy in slow motion. These are all good actors and I'd like to see them brought into more of a reality instead of put on pedestals and thrust down our throats. Overall each of the actors had their moments and at other times they were over the top. <br/><br/>American Hustle can be watched for a fun plot that makes you think during the viewing about the motivations of the characters and who is trying to hustle who. And afterwards the thinking continues as you digest and connect the dots to the puzzle that was just witnessed."

A smörgåsbord of pure acting ability, interesting characters, effective twists, brilliant dialogue that recalls Tarantino, and plenty of tense, heated exchanges and character interactions that test the limits of each actor's ability. A bit on the long side, and not always easy to follow, but darkly humorous and always engaging, though the plot caves in at the end and seems much too formulaic for a film that is anything but conventional. It's difficult to identify a true standout because every actor (Bale, Cooper, Adams, Renner, Lawrence, et al) is sensational across the board. One of director Russell's most memorable films to date, who shoehorns in major actors from two of his previous works, and yet still somehow finds a way for all of them to shine. ***"
