"NCSAFilmGuy","10","897","1197","10 August 2004"," A Film that Defines a Generation
","Zach Braff's ""Garden State"" manages to accomplish something that very few films have been able to do throughout the history of cinema. It is a film that speaks to an entire generation. 1947's ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" spoke to our grandparents. ""The Graduate"" spoke to our parents. ""Fight Club"" spoke to our older brothers working dead-end jobs in the 90's. But it is with the arrival of ""Garden State"" that our generation is spoken to, those of us born in the early-mid 80's who are in our late teens and early twenties trying to make it by in a environment that seems all at once to strange and yet so familiar.<br/><br/>Homecoming is the theme of Garden State. Andrew Largeman (Zach Braff)) has been away from his hometown of New Jersey for the past nine years and returns to attend the funeral for his mother. While having been gone, Andrew has been on lithium and other forms of anti-depressant medication all prescribed to him by his psychiatrist father Gideon (Ian Holm). Upon his homecoming Andrew has decided to take a vacation from his medication and take some time to re-connect with himself. From there the plot grows as he connects with old friends and makes new ones and discovers the joys of life and love mostly thanks to the arrival of free-spirited Sam (Natalie Portman). <br/><br/>Braff has written and directed scenes that qualify to go down in the movie history books along such moments as Pulp Fiction's dance sequence, and The Deer Hunter's Russian roulette scenes. Two of said scenes that come to mind are when Sam takes Andrew up to her room for the first time and does something ""totally original that has never been done before in this location and will never be copied again throughout the rest of human existence,"" in order to ease the pain of an awkward situation. Another scene occurs late in the film when the three principals stand at the edge of a seemingly endless abyss and scream at the tops of their lungs into the gorge. It is this moment that defines, with one pure act, the epitome of what it feels to be in your late teens, early 20's looking out at life. Standing at the edge of life and screaming. <br/><br/>While all the acting is noteworthy, including a hilarious cameo by Method Man (yes, that's right Method Man), it is Natalie Portman who steals the show. Sam is in essence the adult version of her character from Beautiful Girls. She's 26, but an old soul. It his in her that the movie comes out the realm of quirky off-kilter comedy and gains heart, soul, and intimacy all to rare to achieve in films these days. Bravo Ms. Portman. In addition, Peter Sarsgaard is becoming one of my new favorite actors, after having seen him in this film, Shattared Glass, and Boys Don't Cry within a matter of approximately three weeks. <br/><br/>I will go on record an call Garden State a masterpiece. It does exactly what films are supposed to do, take from all areas of art and incorporate them into one. It is a passionate mixture of visual flare, tremendous dialogue, hip music, and heart-warming pathos. I encourage anyone who is young to see this film. See it with the people you care about, this is your film, this is OUR film, and it couldn't be better."

","First off, for anyone thinking about seeing this movie, go do it!! No matter what anyone has told you already about the film. I notice a lot of people writing that they didn't like Garden State and that's fine, I personally thought it was excellent. To me it was real life on film, and within that real life there are very different people. Unfortunately not everyone wants to see movies that remind them of reality, and I guess not everybodies reality is the same as mine. Even so Garden State is well worth the watching, if only to remind us that the comatose state most of us live in is only temporary, and the joy of a life well lived is forever."

","'Garden State' came out in the Uk on December 10th. I had heard wonderful things about it from friends and relatives in the US - I wasn't disappointed...<br/><br/>From start to finish, the film made me laugh and cry. I thought the opening in which we met Braff lying emotionless in bed. Listening to the answer machine message from his dad about his mother's death was disturbing and really drew me in.<br/><br/>So many memorable moments: The funeral, touching and funny, the party scenes, the scan scene...And as for the dialogue - well, sharp and witty. I don't think I will ever forget Natalie Portman's dancing in her bedroom - just to be 'unique' or Zach Braff's touching comments about what makes a 'home' in the swimming pool.<br/><br/>Even those touching moments were funny; the fact that he couldn't swim!<br/><br/>As a mid twenty-something, This film really spoke to me. It's that question we all dread. We've graduated university, got jobs....then what?<br/><br/>Fantastic...just a shame it is not on wide release here...<br/><br/>One of the best films I have seen in ages!<br/><br/>9/10"
"sunkilmoontipton","10","151","209","23 January 2005"," In Garden State, a young man (Zach Braff) returns to his hometown for his mother's funeral and finds love.
","Garden grew on me. It kept replaying in my mind. It reminded me of the movie The Graduate (no slight praise) for many reasons, not the least of which was the soundtrack which included a song by Simon and Garfunkel. I mean, why include an old song by S&G in the middle of a host of contemporary artists - it must have been done on purpose - right? And the pool scene, although different than Hoffman's, still serves to illustrate Andrew Largeman's alienation.<br/><br/>Much like the Graduate, it was the little things that got to me. The escalators heading in two directions at the end, the making of a completely original dance, the touching of the father, the arc on the edge of the abyss, the silent Velcro...I could go on.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman got to me too. Playing the role of a goofy, epileptic but cute, hometown girl, she steals the show. She hits all the right notes. She is responsible for the death by tread-wheel of a loved one, she habitually lies, and she's slightly crazy, but Andrew and we can't help falling in love with her.<br/><br/>Movies like this are rare. Lots worth looking at, lots worth listening to, lots to think about, lots to feel good about. I hope Braff (star, writer, director) has a few more like this in him."
"JoshRoessler","10","124","173","24 February 2004"," Wonderful Effort From First Time Writer/Director Zack Braff
","I really loved this movie.  I mean, really.  So it surprised me to come here and find it rated so low.<br/><br/>By no means is this a perfect movie.  It can be slow or awkward from time to time and there are one or two moments that just don't work.  But.  By and large I was really impressed.<br/><br/>It's a great little story with just the right balance of comedy and drama, full of quirky characters and interesting performances.  Ian Holm demands attention, as always, and Natalie Portman's Sam, while offputting at first, definitely grew on me as she grew into a real character.<br/><br/>
But the real story here is Zack Braff.  It should surprise no one who has ever watched Scrubs that his performance keeps the movie together; or that he is able to create a jokey, distant, somewhat sarcastic character who also elicits real empathy from the audience and manages to emanate deep wounds. What amazes me is the work he has done here as a first time writer/director.<br/><br/>
First off, there is an actual narrative here with meaning and relevance. Too often, the big Hollywood movies will have a plot that resolves itself, but means nothing; on the flip side, independent movies almost seem to disdain plot for mood and thematic concerns.  Braff is able to weave both together--a difficult task for a young writer.  The dialogue is witty, plot situations intelligent and creative, and overall the writing is just--good.<br/><br/>As for his directing, there are a few odd choices.  I'm still not sure I like one scene the main characters are screaming into a deep ravine and the camera sweeps away into said ravine.  It just tossed me out of the movie a bit.  I'm also not completely sure what to make of the movie's ending, which I won't go into further except to say that I felt it almost changed the focus of the movie up to that point and made it about something else. However, there are moments of absolutely beauty as well, here.  The entire scene where Sam and Andrew talk in his friend's pool has some great shots, and Braff's comedic flair and timing are evident in his directing style, which still manages to pull back for the more dramatic and poignant moments.<br/><br/>I urge you to see this movie.  It's not a ""big"" movie.  It was never meant to be.  But I have little doubt that, once it finds an audience, it will be remembered for years to come.  Sort of a modern day Graduate with a more hopeful outlook on life."
"stensson","8","180","270","23 January 2005"," Garden flower
","Zach Braff has made it. Both script, directing and main acting, and everything is more than all right. This is a film without violence about people living ordinary extra-ordinary lives and it's much more interesting than extra-ordinary murders, which very, very few, even in the USA, encounter.<br/><br/>The ""hero"" has been going on tranquilizers for all his grown up-life and even before that. He's got no feelings left, not even for the death of his mother. Then he meets a girl, well acted indeed by Natalie Portman, who unlocks him slowly, saying the right things all the time without knowing it.<br/><br/>Hours after you've seen this, you realize that here was a crucial moment, this was a turning point and so on. The love story gets a little sentimental at the end, but still this is a film that lives long after you've seen it through."
"serenity-12","10","473","735","10 December 2004"," I really got it
","Movies with guns, explosions, Barbie/ken romance... You know the drill. They can be good films, but it's rare I ever relate to those movies.<br/><br/>I *really* related to this movie - both the main character played by Zach, and the pure concept and analogy on display here. This film earns itself a place in my DVD collection upon release for the sheer fact it matches my 20-something experience to a huge degree, and all the feelings along the way.<br/><br/>Normally films such as this tend to end up becoming ""coming of age"" stories - this isn't. It's simply about living life, but not knowing why you are living it.<br/><br/>An excellent film on many levels - 10/10."
"britni44","9","184","311","18 December 2004"," Very impressed
","I would give Garden State a 9 out of 10. The only reason I'm not giving it a perfect 10 is b/c it had a slow start. Besides that this movie overwhelmingly surprised me with its directing and acting. Natatlie Portman did an amazing job playing Sam. She really worked the part. Zach Braff's directing debut is stunning. I had never heard of Braff except for his character on the TV show Scrubs. He also did an excellent job acting. There were so many surprising elements thrown out during the movie. Braff just kept piling one thing on top of the next to make the story more interesting as it rolled on. I was very pleased with Garden State!!!!!!!!!11"
"daveisit","8","62","99","29 December 2004"," We all have dreams, I know I do
","This was almost the perfect movie. The acting was great, the direction was great, the script was brilliant, and the location shoots were perfect. Probably the most amazing thing about this movie was the screen stealing show stopping performance of Natalie Portman. She showed this brilliance in ""Leon"" aka ""The Professional"", and once again amazed with her talent. It contains different humour to your usual American movie and was a needed hit in the movie circles of 2004.<br/><br/>My only problem was a little part of the story that seemed out of place and not needed. This is not a spoiler, it is his friends wealth and invention. They just seemed unnecessary to me. This is a minor complaint and I eagerly anticipate Zach's next work. He could quite possibly end out being more famous behind the camera than in front of it."
"daobankechi","10","155","271","21 September 2004"," Great little movie, great acting by Natalie and Peter
","A very promising film debut by Zach Braff. <br/><br/>The plot isn't all that original, the movie isn't all that flawless, but ""Garden State"" has a unique and sincere quality which make it totally differ from other flicks. In short, this movie is ""real"" and sensational.<br/><br/>Let's not forget about the acting. Zach was lucky enough to have two of the very best young actors starring in his movie: Natalie Portman and Peter Sarsgaard. Especially Nat Portman, her Sam is so lovable that I just want to give her a big huge. Her smile lights up the screen. NP's character and acting are definitely the highlights of ""Garden State"".<br/><br/>8 out of 10. Very touching."
"robototron","1","189","342","26 March 2005"," Perhaps the most cliché/melodramatic/contrived/trite/you get the idea movie
","I have no qualms with how the movie does NOT capture New Jersey (like Zach, I'm from there). Fine. Whatever. I lived there WAY long enough. I don't need to see a movie that captures the Garden State.<br/><br/>What I do have qualms with is how bad this movie is. Let's make it easy on you. We'll use some bullet-points. There are probably some spoilers that follow. (Not that you wouldn't be able to predict the movie ANYWAY): <br/><br/>-The music placement was maddeningly forced and patronizing. Example: Large: ""What are you listening to?"" Sam: ""The Shins. Ever heard of 'em?"" ""No."" ""Listen to this song - it will change your life!"" And then they proceed to play that Shins song that was in a McDonalds commercial. (Don't you love when the characters in a movie blatantly tell you - the viewer - how to react to something? I love that! Hey, they should have put subtitles during various scenes instructing us to ""chuckle,"" ""Say 'aaaaaw'"" ""cry"" ""feel inspired"" etc.) <br/><br/>-The scenes were SO BAD. SO Cliché. SO MELODRAMATIC. Example: The entire movie. But no, really, example: They're in the rainy quarry by the ark. Large runs up - in the pouring rain (oh he's SO TORMENTED!) - on top of a piece of heavy machinery and SCREAMS! Oh how moving! But wait! Here comes Sam and his buddy (the annoying drug addict), and they ALL SCREAM!!!! BUT WAIT!!!! OH MY GOD!!!! Here it comes! THEY KISS!!! LONG, DEEP!!!! IN THE RAIN!!!!!!!! <br/><br/>-The dialogue was SO BAD. SO Cliché. SO MELODRAMATIC. Example. They're leaving the ark and Sam says something like, ""Hey. Good luck exploring the infinite abyss."" And the guy says back, ""You, too."" Oh...Oh my! I never realized...could it be? Oh my God it is! Large's life is like...ohmigod...AN INFINITE ABYSS!!!! Another example: Large and Sam in the airport. Sam says something like, ""Is this goodbye?"" Not enough for ya? OK, Largeman says something like, ""This isn't a period at the end of the sentence... it's an ellipses."" And guess what happens when he tries to walk down the jetway and go back to his life in LA. You know, what? Don't guess. It's a waste of your time.<br/><br/>-It's a Grade Z Wes Anderson rip-off movie. When not busy being melodramatic and cliché, the movie spends lots of times with crazy-kooky-off-kilter characters. Hey, Sam's brother... thank you Zach Braff for including him, because it really made the movie so much more textured. Also ripping off Anderson: the dialogue. Scene: Sam and Largeman are in a bar. In walks friends, ""Vagina!"" says one of them. Then they see him sitting with Sam, so one of the friends says, ""Sorry I said vagina."" And Sam says, ""It's OK."" <br/><br/>-Inventive cinematography that's not inventive but pointless and annoying. Give me a break with the speed-up/slow down of film. Again, Wes Anderson does it effectively in his movies. And it was done well in ""Donnie Darko."" But, really, it was pointless. Wow. A crazy party where people are taking X and snorting coke. Better roll out all the tricks! <br/><br/>-You can count the good moments on one hand (even if you're missing fingers). That's what makes it even WORSE. The retarded quarterback thing...well, that was good! The little thing he (largeman) says as they're about to enter the quarry (something about huffing turpentine)...that was good! Oh, wait, that's about it.<br/><br/>You know, Zach Braff is, I think, always a little too cute. But, he's likable. But, man, this is forced, pretentious, melodramatic (have you gotten that yet?), overly cute, overly everything. This movie is terrible. Apparently, I'm outnumbered, as this waste of time is currently rated an 8.0.<br/><br/>Please, though, if you're looking for something truly poignant and subtle and unique DO. NOT. RENT. THIS. MOVIE."
"Ashes20","1","108","193","1 July 2005"," Over-rated and under-written: Zach Braff's ego trip
","Garden State must rate amongst the most contrived and pretentious films of all time. The plot is a simple one, involving a young man returning home after his mother's death and discovering love. But really, the plot isn't important. What is important to Zach Braff - writer, director, and star  is that he is able to hang from the plot all the necessary accoutrements of an 'indie' or 'arty' film. We therefore are presented with endless cute and quirky characters and scenes that don't exist for reasons of plot or character development, but simply to give some artistic credibility to the film (à la Wes Anderson - or so Braff hopes). Unfortunately and somewhat astonishingly, Braff has not only fooled many on IMDb, but also some critics who really ought to have known better.<br/><br/>Of course, Braff's gratuitous use of the quirky alone does not make Garden State a bad film. What really makes Garden State a stinker is Braff's script. He simply does not have the writing skills to carry this film off, and the dialogue and characterisation are abysmal. Braff often has to resort to blunt devises and symbolism to achieve what he can't achieve through the writing. For example, the numbness of the Braff character is shown to us by his indifference to an impending plane crash (this can't be worked into the plot, and so has to take place in a dream!), later he is shown fighting back against his circumstances by screaming into a bottomless abyss (life = a bottomless abyss, very clever Mr Braff). Those two scenes must rank amongst the most ludicrous and contrived ever seen on a cinema screen.<br/><br/>On the plus side, the acting is passable despite the lack of material for the cast to work with (by which I mean a script), and I do admire Natalie Portman for her efforts as the love interest - a character so badly written and implausible that she is little more than a mindless doll that Braff moulds into his fantasy woman.<br/><br/>It apparently took Braff 3 years to write the script for Garden State (3 years to write a script this bad - he really is inept!). Hopefully therefore it will be some time before he makes another film."
"rulistening521","1","66","121","19 September 2005"," Don't Bother
","Garden State was a mediocre film at best. The film seems more like a compilation of thoughts that the writer (Zach Braff) had, rather than a cohesive story. The disjointed plot may have been more engaging if it weren't interspersed with pointless scenes that were nothing more than ""quirky."" Coincidentally these scenes are often the ones that are relayed in conversation (Zack walking past faucets that turn on as he passes, crazy under-cranked party scene, shouting over a gorge, the list goes on).<br/><br/>The main character is flat, disengaging, and ultimately unlikable, which is exhibited most in the scene where he talks to his father, selfishly ignoring his fathers problems, including a recently deceased wife, and droning on about his own ""What am I to do with my life?"" problem.<br/><br/>The film ends when Andrew (Zach Braff) decides not to go back to LA because he cannot tear himself from the love of his life, Sam (Natalie Portman) whom he has known for 2 days. Which can only lead me to the conclusion that the message of the film is that love at first sight cures occupational dilemmas... Sure you could interpret it as a misappropriation of priorities, but if that is the case it could have been done better. Much better.<br/><br/>This film does not know what it wants to be. A drama, a comedy, a teenage-wasteland film, or a gamut of other things. I say this not as a single-genre oriented person, but as a person who loves multi-genre pieces such as those mastered by Stanley Kubrick. The reason I feel it does not work for Garden State is because rather than blending the genres together, it jumps around; one scene is one genre, the next another, and back again, so on.<br/><br/>I have heard many people tell me to cut Zach Braff some slack, after all it was his first feature film and he debuted as Director, Writer, and lead actor. Impressive as it was a first film, I should think that with as much money as he has, he could do better. There have been much better first-time feature film directors (Michel Gondry ""Human Nature"", David Gordon Green ""George Washington""). Maybe if he stuck to writing OR directing OR acting it would have been better. Zach Braff is a talented performer, maybe his second attempt won't be so tedious and disjointed."
"Agent10","1","82","158","27 August 2004"," Vastly overrated
","For those that might send me nasty e-mails, shove it. There is a trend in Hollywood where those that create overly-quirky movies are instantly impervious to criticism. Garden State tends to be one of those movies. <br/><br/>Sure, Zach Braff, star of a rather overrated sitcom, surprises people with some talent behind the camera, but that doesn't warrant the kind of praise that a film like this has been receiving. The story is often times too thin and shallow to provide any real insight. People have compared this film to The Graduate, but those type of people are the types that try to oversell independent cinema. Indie films are subject to the same hit and miss mentality that typically hits the studio films, but people seemed to have forgotten that there are far more bad indie films than good ones. Garden State isn't atrocious, but its isn't great.<br/><br/>First off, the film is too quick, resulting in a rather fast reemergence of Large into his former life. After ten years, people tend to act like he never left. Where's the awkwardness? Of course, the situation is always solved by a quick drug tasting scene (which I will say was portrayed rather accurately). The film seem to present a lot of emotional inequities, giving us the idea that the emotion will come up later in a more deeper and more well thought out way. However, it fails to deliver on those fronts, leaving us wondering why the journey to some of his decisions and moments were quickly resolved (like Peter Saarsgard's grave robbing tendencies). It wasn't completely abysmal, but maybe we should stop praising the film as something it isn't."
"spiro_sea","5","40","72","13 June 2005"," Whats the big Idea?
","I'm 25 years old. Let me start my review by saying that. So this movie is supposed to be the movie for ""my generation"" I don't think so somehow For me this was one of the most overrated movies ever made. Self indulgent and totally unaffecting, only once was I moved by something that happened on screen. Whilst the acting was good and the soundtrack was very hip, the script was full of self important lines and the whole movie left me wondering why they had bothered.<br/><br/>Don't get me wroung, I see this is a movie with some merit and I also see that for many, this movie has been as affecting as say ""Donnie Darko"" was to me, but I don't see why. There is nothing behind that awkward smile that Braff wears throughout, the movie has no soul.<br/><br/>Having said that, I realise this is not a popular opinion, but I stand by it that I have seldom heard a movie talked up more and lack this much depth before.<br/><br/>However the scene where Braff talks about his departed mother, about how pure a mothers love can be, was pretty good. But the rest of it, just fell totally flat Biggest letdown since ""Cold Mountain"""

","Wave after wave of directionless nausea - this film wants and at first promises to be quirky and original but is in fact obvious, solipsistic and mired in cliché-driven dialogue which builds to a crecendo of awfulness and cheese by the end. Throughout the film we meet supposedly off the wall characters, who are actually very dull, and just don't quite work and who clunk through the horrific screenplay like men in armour suits, driving jeeps through mansion houses and spouting preppy existential obviousness accompanied by the whinings of Coldplay. The film has occasional funny episodes, often no funnier than a dog playing with its genitals, which happened twice (an index of the slapstick, rudimentary humour of the film in general) but by the end, the film falls into an 'infinite abyss' of complete detritus and the director's egocentric ramblings which made me want to gouge my eyes out.

","""Garden State"" takes bandwagon to a whole another level. This movie is the biggest disappointment of the year. 'Garden State"" is crappy in so many ways that I don't even know where to start. The trailer I saw in March was ten thousand times better than this pathetic dribble pawned off as a movie. Like, seriously, do you think Braff had enough clichéd characters? Oh, and not to mention the in your face symbolism...how dumb did he expect his audience to be? I got it during the ""we get high together"" mother/son scene, Andrew craved a loving family...the Noah's Ark family was so not needed.<br/><br/>The writing reeked, I felt like I was in my Fiction Writing 101 class. Braff forces the story along; there was nothing natural about it, especially, the ""pause"" dramatic moments. Sam was annoying as hell, with the ""I'm going to be cute until you smile"" shtick. And the supposed romantic connection between Andrew and Sam was as sparkly as a flat line. ""Garden State"" was all over the place, by the end of the movie, I felt like I was doped up on lithium all my life. This is the only explanation I can think of for wasting over an hour of my precious life."
"mzazaian","6","15","25","28 August 2004"," An Unpolished Movie With Blatant First-Timer Mistakes
","Perhaps the most notable and visible issue with this film is the narrative structure. The writing is done in a sort of encounter-to-encounter style, like a layman's Odyssey. I feel though that this is not a result of a specific film styling but rather poor writing on the part of Zach Braff, who, mind you, is not the Epstein brothers (of Casablanca fame) but rather a TV actor who is breaking into the big screen for the first time. As a result, plot weaving becomes non-existent, and character development, even in the case of Large (the main character) is shallow and doesn't really show much change, or rather, the script doesn't provide an opportunity for change. When he then has an epiphany at the end of the film, a terribly contrived moment, he praddles off everything that he already knew as if it were terribly profound, and the moment entirely misses.<br/><br/>Also, characters, specifically Large, seem to go off on philosophical tangents which are neither profound nor insightful, but seem to be what he really wants the audience to derive from his movie. In this classic case of ""Telling"" instead of ""showing,"" I personally was annoyed as I felt that as an intelligent viewer I didn't need to be spoon-fed these ideas but rather, as in any well-written movie or literary piece, could have derived them from the work itself without them being thrown into my face.<br/><br/>Please keep in mind that this was something of a Devil's advocate opinion as I did enjoy parts of the film, and certainly recommend it above most of the other films in theaters now."
"hall10000","10","57","115","19 December 2004"," Garden State of mind.
","GARDEN STATE a film by Zach Braff.<br/><br/>What ever happened to the BREAKFAST CLUB kids? well they headed down to middle suburbia in the garden state where angst has turned into an utterly depressing feeling and reality is not a place where you wanna spend 24 hours a day. Andrew (BRAFF) is a failed actor trying to make it in LA, when his mother dies he is forced to go back to his town in New Jersey for a couple of days where he reencounters his past. This might sound familiar till you met the Klingon medieval knight, the man who reinvented the wheel with a twist and the misfits version of Noe's biblical apocalypse, to top that Andrew's family is the mount Himalayas of dysfunctional families facing a Murphy's law gone mad kind of scenario. He put his mother on a wheel chair when he was nine and has his own father giving psychiatric advice and a lot of pills. The last thing I would expect from the funny doctor of SCRUBS is to write, direct and act in what is hands down the best story of the year. Already comparisons with ALLEN let me tell you that for a debut feature he has managed to trash the early years and move straight to the best subtle blend of comedy and drama that are MANHATTAN and ANNIE HALL. There is nothing classic about the structure that works as a relentless succession of magic moments chain together with great gags. Something that opens musically with COLDPLAY can not possibly go wrong and it doesn't, gets even better when we are introduced to the song ""that will change your life, I promise"" or so says Sam (NATALIE PORTMAN), I'm not sure if somethings can be change that easy but certainly will have you running to buy the soundtrack when the credits roll, the song NEW SLANG... the band THE SHINS. BRAFF acts his way out even when he struggles with the more dramatic bits thanks to his companions. I have never understood all the buzz with PORTMAN so he played an OK role in LEON and moved on to the galaxy far away... so what? I really think this is the turning point for her, at least she has been given the chance to chew a very challenging persona and delivers an honest performance and then we get PETER SARSGARD who is mastering the art of getting great chunks of acting from the STAR WARS puppets as he did with VADER in SHATTERED GLASS. He is the most talented actor of this crew following GABRIEL BYRNE advice that in acting the most important things are looks, movements and silences. In the best year for both music and films since the Tarantino revolution I dare to say, if you only watch one film this year make it to GARDEN STATE and you better make it quick because HOUSE OF FLYING DAGGERS may have that edge. Like the SHINS would say ""it's a luscious mix of words and tricks"", watch it. *****"

The hero climaxes three times - pun intended. First he tells off his father - but the set up is contrived. His father is conveniently the fall guy for the hero's own nothing life. Then he cruelly leaves the adorable girl for his nothing life in CA. Then he returns to the adorable girl. Duh, he is nothing without her. Sorry for the hackneyed phase, 'nohing without her' but his life up to that point has been a zero."

","GARDEN STATE has an unsettling opening scene. Passengers aboard a flight that is going terrifically wrong -- bound to crash as a matter of fact -- screaming, crying, the flight attendant desperate to regain control even when it's clear she might fail, oxygen masks dropping like ripe fruit asking to be picked. A young woman clutches a baby to our left of the screen, and an older woman seen to our right is also in those horrific moments of hysteria. A young man, though, smack in the middle, does nothing, says nothing, but looks straight ahead, eyes a blank.<br/><br/>Of course, this is a dream. No such thing is occurring, and even when it could signify the terror aboard a doomed flight in the wake of 9-11 sensibilities and the current release of UNITED 93 at the Tribeca Film Festival. But the young man seen in this dream sequence awakens to an empty room, lying in bed in a stupor, ignoring his father's message (not for the first time). His mother has died, the message says. There must be some action to be taken.<br/><br/>Andrew Largeman, the man in the dream, the man in his own dream, caught in his own world and unable to be quite there for the people around him. Much of the movie debates on where he as a man in his late twenties is going: true, he's becoming a rising success in the acting world, but as a person, he's incomplete. Zach Braff, who plays a hilarious clown on TV's ""Scrubs"" which has been on the air for five years, does a muted interpretation of Largeman. He makes Largeman a shy, soft-spoken guy whom you would probably pass by the street and not notice his presence. Although, thankfully for him, someone does: a young girl who lives in her own awkward sense of freedom named Sam.<br/><br/>Here is where the movie goes into self-conscious cuteness and throws a cursory nod to films like THE GRADUATE. While there are no Mrs. Robinsons to be found here (except in the role Jean Smart plays, but she's only in the movie for about five minutes of screen time and is never to be seen again), Sam has a lot of Elaine in her, but with an MTV feel. She's a free spirit, she loves a group called The Shin, she expresses herself as if she were from her own world, and sure enough -- she also brings life into the lifeless personality of Largeman. Natalie Portman makes this a unique role, though: there is a quirkiness about her that belies a tremendous sensibility which works for the role even when the role, somehow similar to the one Kirsten Dunst played in ELIZABETHTOWN, can be annoying.<br/><br/>GARDEN STATE is also given a look that feels smarter than it is, but this is clever directing, camera angles, style over substance, and honest acting from even the actors in small roles. I have a sneaking feeling this got better reviews than it should have, more so because it's Zach Braff's debut film and while its pacing is a little choppy and there are one too many scenes of overall ""cleverness"", and completely cops out at the end without a moment's transition, it's a good watch, entertaining, sensitive, and I hope there will be more to come from Braff."
"TheNorthernMonkee","10","32","65","13 December 2004"," fine first step up the ladder for Braff
","SPOILERS Every once in a while comes another film which claims it understands that lost era of life called the twenties. Attempting to show how for a decade a whole generation can feel lost, these films are often over-hyped and inaccurate. In his debut feature however, Zach Braff is able to fix this with a superb film about that era of our lives when we never really know where we're going.<br/><br/>At the age of 29, Braff, best known for his role as J.D. in ""Scrubs"" is well aware of how we can get lost in an age where we continue to put off our futures whilst we spend our times on different types of drug. Speaking in a recent interview for UGC Unlimited Magazine (Dec - Jan issue), Braff said: ""I think your teen years are your body's puberty and your twenties are your mind's puberty."" Whether Braff is right in his views or not, in his written and directorial debut, all his characters find themselves going nowhere in life.<br/><br/>Braff plays Andrew Largeman, an actor in Los Angeles. On medication since the age of ten, ""Large"" has been numb for as long as he can remember. Therefore when his estranged father (Ian Holm) rings with the news of his mothers death, the original reaction is far from reactive. Returning home for the first time in almost a decade however, he decides to skip his medication for once and go on a holiday from himself. As his body detoxifies, ""Large"" encounters his old school friends and the bouncy Sam (Natalie Portman) and begins to question whether the prescribed drugs were actually good for him or not.<br/><br/>""Garden State"" is a brilliant first step for Braff. With characters who all suffer and to a degree feel lost, the characterisation is wonderful and the bond which the audience develops is huge. We all care for Braff's main character as he begins to finally experience life, and we all associate with Sam and Large's best friend Mark (Peter Sarsgaard). All three characters have to one degree or another suffered as a result of their parents, and we can all sympathies with that combination of embarrassment and love.<br/><br/>The plot as well is superb in it's detail. Starting with some good laughs at the start which do dwindle in number towards the end, the story keeps us gripped and involved. Whilst it does collapse towards the end as Braff writes a conclusion containing a few too many conventions, the script never relents from keeping us in touch with the characters.<br/><br/>Perhaps one of the finest things about this film is it's soundtrack. Created by Braff as well, this soundtrack has been nominated for awards and was at least partly responsible for convincing Natalie Portman to take the role of Sam. With the right sort of beat at the right moments, Braff's soundtrack adds to the joy of the film and makes it even more something for him to be proud of.<br/><br/>""Garden State"" is a VERY good first step up the ladder for Zach Braff. Capturing the twenties with ease, Braff tells an engaging story which keeps the audience hooked from start to finish. With a stunning soundtrack and amazing characterisation, Braff makes us think and feel as his character of ""Large"" rediscovers himself. Admittedly Braff's one flaw is the slightly too ""play it by numbers"" finale which rounds itself off too nicely, but even then, we never loose interest. A wonderful first feature for Braff and a positive sign for the future."

","I watched this movie with my sister and her husband. My sister fell asleep 30 mins into the movie.<br/><br/>This is the main problem with this movie. It's very slow. I understand the introspective, somewhat disoriented slant on life Braff's character has, but I found myself unable to connect with his character. So after the fact, I realize that this movie is hit or miss and unfortunately it was way off the mark with me.<br/><br/>Besides the already noted, telling instead of showing tactics used to try to explain things, my problem was even WITH the forced expository, I was very confused. Moments that were meant to serve as climatic revelations in his life had no build up and felt forced. These moments were for me as the audience supposed to make me feel something, yet only left me confused and actual angry that those moments were not well executed.<br/><br/>There are a couple of bright moments like the scene of the shirt at the funeral and the Portman and Braff's scenes towards the end, but in the end I just didn't care.<br/><br/>By the way, Portman was amazing as always and her charisma and originality she brought to a role that could be easily played with stereotypes was excellent. Check her out in Closer."

The acting by that girl was annoying to the extreme. She is a pretty poor actress anyway, but to be fair, the script was so bad to start with.<br/><br/>I hate films that try to be ""deep"" but actually have no soul. If you fell for it you are a sucker I'm afraid as it is an ""intelligent"" film for stupid people.<br/><br/>I admit though i had to switch it off at the bit when he finally revealed his big trauma, that he accidentally pushed his mother or whatever it was. Come on! As if theyd put a kid on Lithium for the rest of his life for pushing an adult one time. Please. Its absolutely ridiculous. And if my ""friend"" led me on a merry dance all over town when I could be getting jiggy with my new girlfriend on my last day, only to give me the necklace he stole from my mothers grave, I think Id batter him, not get all sentimental with him.<br/><br/>Also how come all the people in his home town recognised him instantly even though they last saw him when he was ten? And why were they so buddy with him? The whole thing is rubbish- I know at least two people who agree with me...surely there must be more out there?"

","The fact that the movie made only 26 mil in 26 weeks clearly shows how poorly it was written. This, of course, is a common problem with actor ego projects. The story has many unnecessary scenes that don't connect or contribute at all to the story or characters but are thrown in for the sake of getting a cheap laugh - like the knight in the kitchen and the fast motion party scenes. The entire film is full of extra meaningless shots and scenes that could easily be and should have been cut. Why should we care about this character? The film contains virtually no conflict or drama, or emotion, or humor, or cleverness or originality. We have no reason to care one way or the other about Graff. Other than the girlfriend, who is well written, everyone else is straight out of a bad college student film, as are most of the scenes and the story in general. The movie was so concerned with trying to be anti-Hollywood that it failed to be anything else but that. There is virtually no story here, just style in place of substance, and the style isn't even new or different - rather straight from the 70s. So if you're a college student longing for the old days of the 60s & 70s, you'll really enjoy this film. For the rest of the world - well, Nepolion Dynamite made almost double the box office and that wasn't so great either, but at least it was original."

","This movie made me want to hit myself in the face. My fiancée and I watched it together and though I was itching to turn it off, he chose to watch through to the end so that we could see if the protagonist died in a fiery plane crash, not that that would have been all that satisfying because it would have just been another stereotypical ending, though not as stereotypical as the one he chose. The movie is slow, boring, trite, and irritating as all-get-out. I don't know why everyone is comparing it to the Graduate except that it copies some of its scenes such as the escalator and the funeral. The best part of the movie, and one of the infinitesimally few funny parts, was his shirt blending into the wall, and that lasted all of a few seconds and was included in the commercial. People are making a big deal about Natalie Portman being charismatic in this movie--she isn't. Her character is one of the dumbest, least desirable and most obnoxious I've seen. Watching her was like listening to a tape of children's programming, without as much coherence or originality. I hated her character way more than Braff's but hated Braff for creating her in the first place. Basically, both I and my fiancée felt that this was an extremely highschoolesque production, created by an immature mind eager to show the world that he went to film school and remembers the common devices. If Zach Braff had not become popular through Scrubs, I doubt this movie would ever have been made, nor should it have been. I rented this with a coupon for a mere 99 cents, and I want my dollar and my two hours back."
"rcraig62","2","22","44","20 January 2005"," Nice debut performance, but a recycled script
","""Garden State"" is another of these ""indie""-type pictures that supposedly skimp on production values for the sake of giving the audience some real true-to-life human drama. Oddly enough, the production is very good, so are the performances (by some fairly big-name actors as well). Where the picture is lacking is in Zach Braff's script, which seems mostly culled from situations taken from other movies.<br/><br/>When you're as young as Braff is, you haven't really lived enough to use the experience as film fodder. Braff's experience looks to be from watching movies, then repeating the same trite clichés in his own movie. In Garden State, he plays Andrew Largeman, a semi-successful Hollywood actor who returns to his hometown in New Jersey to bury his mother, who took her own life after suffering in a wheelchair for many years. He appears to have no feeling about any of this; he has no relationship with his father, who blames him for causing his mother's paralysis in a freak accident as a six-year-old, and has no particular despondency over losing his mother (in fact, he attends a party right after the burial to which he was invited by a friend of his, who works as a cemetery grave-digger). It all smacks heavily of ""Beautiful Girls"", also about a guy who returns to his hometown to ""find himself"" and hang with his old friends, with a little ""Ordinary People"" thrown in on the side. <br/><br/>It's really a miracle Braff could accomplish anything at all in his life, given his father and his useless friends (I'm surprised he didn't kill himself), who are still living their ""lives"" as though they're still in high school, partying with dumb bimbos, drinking and drugging, etc. None of them even recognize him from his TV role as the ""retarded quarterback"" (Natalie Portman's character, the most aware person in the movie, does), and say things, like ""Hey, I remember you from Junior year"". These guys are such losers, for them, watching television would be a cultural leap forward. Even one friend, who made millions inventing a silent Velcro, has no real reason to live, because his whole frame of reference is high school and partying. And you don't need big money to party like a high school sophomore.<br/><br/>Braff, it is revealed, is heavily medicated, which keeps from ""feeling"" and dealing with anything, really, like an adult would. Then he meets Sam (Natalie Portman) a sort-of lost girl, who gives pet funerals and lives with her mother like a 10-year-old in a bedroom that looks like a pink doll house blown up to life size. Anyway, they fall in love, and Braff learns to ""feel"" again. The clichés come fast and furious. Braff has a long delayed heart-to-heart talk with his cold, distancing father and tells him What It Is and The Name Of The Game. In one scene, Braff and Portman are in the millionaire kid's house, playing touchy-feely is front of a giant fireplace, and the bit is so routine, so standard movie-schtick, I swear, I half-expected somebody to walk up and throw a sled into the fire. In another, Braff visits a doctor (Ron Liebman) to get his junk refilled, and Liebman tells him (in easily the worst line in the movie) ""The body can play tricks on you. I once found my ex-best-friend's cufflinks in my wife's purse, and I didn't have an erection for a year and a half."" Obviously, no licensed physician would ever say that, but it's dirtbag poetry, a nod from Braff to, I guess, his loser friends to let them know he's still thinking of them, just as the ""37"" joke in ""Clerks"", was Kevin Smith's nod to his dirtbag buddies. <br/><br/>Anyway, Braff finds true happiness and gets off the dope; the story plays itself out predictably. But if you're going to have a movie that's wall-to-wall clichés, at least give it some charming performances to breathe some life into it. And Braff does. He has the right sort of vacancy, of casual acceptance to make his role as the zonked-out Andrew both real and poignant, and Natalie Portman (also of Beautiful Girls) gives the movie a big lift. With her tiny features and flickering expressions of mood, she just about steals the picture as his traveling companion. Jean Smart is surprisingly good as Portman's mother, and Peter Saarsgard (though much better in ""Shattered Glass"") is notable as the gravedigger friend. I would recommend ""Garden State"" if you can't get enough storybook romance out of movies, but when people start hailing it as a masterpiece, they're just clueless. Braff thinks you can take the same old tired plot, write in a few ""f**ks"" and ""awesomes"" and slap on an acoustic rock soundtrack and that contemporizes the material. It doesn't."

","Possible spoiler below. Is it possible to give this film a zero rating--or, better yet, to give it a minus 10? This is one of the worst film that I have ever seen. It seems to have been made for mental midgets in the 8th grade. It doesn't miss a cliché that will impress them as being original and comic: ""I'm responsible for mommy."" ""We two kookie people are really the best people in the world and have found true love."" ""Ain't life grand? We can't wait to get a dog and spend the evenings watching it masturbate or hump our legs because we think this is soooo funny."" I took the film to be a satire of ALL of the characters, including Andrew Largeman. (Now, puzzle over that last name, 8th graders; I bet it means something.) I saw this film because it was mistakenly booked into a local art house, and I stayed until the end only because I was hoping Andrew's father, Gideon (Duh! Does that name signify somethin'?) would chloroform Andrew and bury him in the hamster graveyard while ""Sam"" cried on. Alas, that didn't happen. I understand from other comments here that some viewers have taken Andrew and ""Sam"" seriously. Ah, well.

It actually is, in fact, quite a simple plot, but the way it is shown is truly remarkable. It sets of on a depressed mood, and gradually reaches a beautiful climax of a really positive epiphany at the end. This life defining atmosphere goes really well with every other aspect the movie uses, like philosophical dialogs between characters, family relationships, the main character's drama, etc. The performances of all the actors are, without a doubt, amazing. Zach Braff, who plays the main character, gives a terrific performance portraying a disturbed, puzzled young man, who is searching for something in life. Such a character is probably the embodiment of a massive number of teenagers and other young people in the world, who are searching for a purpose in life. Therefore, I think that any disturbed young soul, who watches this film, will feel a deep connection between himself and this character. Natalie Portman also gives an equally, if not an even better, appearance on screen. Her acting is truly flawless in this movie, and for that matter probably every other movie she has appeared in. And another appealing thing, worth mentioning, is the absolutely outstanding soundtracks of this movie. It is amazing how well the music matches the atmosphere. Seeing some of the dramatic scenes along with this astonishing music will touch you emotionally. <br/><br/>So, all in all, Amazing story about life, followed by terrific performance and outstanding atmosphere.

","Apart from the cloying pretension of the entire script, the hamfisted metaphors, the often frighteningly amateurish acting, and the fact that Zach Braff apparently thinks gazing emptily into the camera communicates some soul-stirring information on the nature of the character he plays, this film is very poorly done even on the most basic levels of film-making. Witness the repeatedly blown eyelines (for example, where the hell is he looking when the cop pulls him over on the motorcycle?), horrid and cliché shot selection, and abysmal characterisations... Some people have been giving this film a pass, saying ""not bad for a firt effort,"" or even claiming ""Braff really knows what he's doing behind the camera."" Well, as someone who's gone through a graduate film program, I can tell you, this IS bad for a first-time effort; Braff does not seem to know much about what he's doing behind the camera; and many of the blunders in this film would not be acceptable in a student film, much less a feature. <br/><br/>2 things really bugged me. One, how the hell did he get Ian Holm to show up? Does he have pictures of him naked with a sheep or something? Two, and this is them kind of precious garbage that enrages me in films like this, good thing there's a vintage WWII era motorcycle lying around in the garage, complete with sidecar, because, y'know, it looks really neato. While saying nothing at all about character or story.<br/><br/>I don't know Mr. Braff, but he seems to havepoured rather too much of himself into this flick, and convinced himself that virtually every cliché of 20-something ennui constitutes blinding, revelatory insight. I am at an utter loss to explain this film's 8 out of 10 IMDb rating, except to posit that those raving over how deep this film is are the same sort of self-involved, self-pitying spoiled rich white kids from Jersey, or similar environs, who seem to share Mr. Braff's conceit that their commonplace and often trivial hardships constitute the stuff of tragic melodrama.

","It can be seen from the trailer that this movie is going to be different from all the other movies in its style. Being Zach Braff's debut movie, the film does share some comedic style as Scrubs, but slightly more subtle. The main characters, especially Sam played by Portman, are very well developed. Portman's performance is superb and brings the character to life. The soundtrack of the movie is not only appropriate, but almost defines moments of the movie. Some scenes would just not be the same without the music.<br/><br/>Overall, Zach Braff does a great job in delivering the message of ""living"" through this movie in an entertaining way."

This movie also has a phenomenal soundtrack featuring some of the best indie artists of today. Each character is special and unique in several ways and yet they flow together perfectly. After watching it, you may find yourself hoping that Braff writes/directs another film. Worthy of an Oscar nomination, Natalie Portman has never been better.

But if you want to see a movie that can possibly change your life, then see it. The Main Reasons I liked it were:<br/><br/>1. The screenplay, the writing in here is brilliant. Everything is memorable. <br/><br/>2. The acting. Especially Natalie Portman. She took my breath away. I have to say she is the next talent to look for, with this movie and CLoser she is sure to be an A list star. And if it wasn't for Closer this performance would give her a supporting actress Oscar. <br/><br/>3. The memorable scenes. I have to put this because there are many that i walk out and will remember again. This is a great romance. From the beginning Dog Licking-Doctor's Office scene to the Most uniquely original thing in this one spot, to the yelling into the open canyon, and then the very end. That is the most memorable romantic scene all year. <br/><br/>4. The Soundtrack. The soundtrack almost made the movie what it is. It brought it from great to greater. Especially the songs they play during Natalie's screen time. <br/><br/>This movie is by far the best of the year, and it teaches you about life, and love, and when to take risks. So to sum this up in about 2 words SEE IT. It will change your life.

","This is a really watchable film from a great new young director. Zach Braff, you may well know from the brilliant scrubs, writes and directs this very competent film. Basically it is a simple plot about a few days in the life of a man coming back to his home town for his mums funeral. Anyway what is really interesting in this film is the relationships between characters especially Zach's character and his dad and between Zach and Natalie Portman's character. There is a lot of quirky humour and surreal daydreams that can be seen as a direct influence from scrubs. If you liked Donnie Darko you should enjoy this, yet if also if you thought Donnie Darko was a pile of sentimental, surreal dross you should find that this is a much better and more 'real' film. <br/><br/>This is a film well worth watching"

","I'm 43 years old. ""Garden State"" was excruciating for me to watch. I found the thing narcissistic, overbearingly precious, stilted, pretentious, unrealistic, and worst of all--dull. But I will concede that I would probably have viewed this ""Graduate"" rip off a bit more favorably back when I was in my twenties. That was back when I was a dumbass who thought the world revolved around me (and also back when ""screaming into the abyss"" would have seemed ""cool"" instead of just a sophomorically obvious attempt at metaphor). Writer/Director Zach Braff might--just ""might""--have been able to pull off something less cloying, obvious, immature, and vomitously faux intellectual if he had turned the directorial reigns over to someone else. The script has some good moments, but they are far outweighed by the monstrous love Braff's camera has for his own blank face and the equally blind love he has for his own often-stilted and pretentious dialogue. An experience filmmaker would have known how to trim away the self-love and nonsense and made a real movie out of this mess."

Step by step we learn to know him and his past. He may first seem a little weird, but slowly you will realize he's just an ordinary guy like you and me (I'm 20) who has been through a lot and who just tries to find some happiness, tries to find his place in the world without getting just another face in the crowd.<br/><br/>This movie is full of characters that are just so beautiful and so vulnerable it (almost) makes you cry. Nathalie Portman is outstanding. She's so sad and wonderful at the same time. ""We may not always be as happy as you always dreamed we'd be, but for once, let's just allow ourselves to be whatever it is we are."" This is just one of the many beautiful and heartbreaking quotes the movie contains.<br/><br/>It's unbelievable how a young man like Zach Braff can write, direct and take the leading role all by himself. Congratulations, you made a unique film which really made me thinking. I will never forget this oneI can hardly wait to see some more of your work."

","A lot of people laud movies like this one for not containing tons of explosions, meaningless sex, and kindergarten-level plotting. But let's face it; if you have trouble finding intelligent, stimulating movies you're just not looking hard enough. ""Garden State"" was not good enough to justify all the praise that was heaped upon it - nor was it good enough to really keep me interested.<br/><br/>That's not to say I thought the movie was a total bust: Some scenes were handled perfectly. Examples: Zach Braff wakes up after a night of partying to find a man in a suit of armor staring at him; that's kind of what I expect to happen when I wake up confused and exhausted after a long night. Zach Braff's oddball millionaire friend playing ""Dodge the flaming arrow,"" or driving around his mansion in a golf cart. The focus in the beginning on the New Jersey DeNiro thing. Those were all good - very good. They just weren't in a very good movie.<br/><br/>A few things just worked against it: The meandering, non-pace of the movie's beginning really faltered once Natalie Portman showed up. It suddenly seemed like this oddball dramedy about a guy trying to get back in touch with a world he'd left behind was being shoehorned into a fairly run-of-the-mill ""Quiet loner meets outgoing girl"" love story. I really didn't feel like Zach Braff had earned the right to have his character say, ""You changed my life,"" to Natalie Portman at the end of the film. Also, absolutely too many scenes were dominated by fast-motion camera effects and super-hip indie music.<br/><br/>If Zach Braff makes another movie - either a more focused love story or a less focused, existentialist-about-town story - he could hit gold. He's an assured director and a talented writer. The problem is that, contrary to popular opinion, he made this movie a little too in line with the mainstream - there's nothing revolutionary about a lukewarm relationship between two odd characters set to hip, contemporary music."
"mstomaso","7","3","4","16 June 2008"," Growing Up and Loving
","Zach Braff's Garden state is a successful coming-of-age story focusing on a standard personality type in early 20th century suburban America - the over-medicated dysfunctional male whose moorings are so tenuous that he appears to have no personality whatsoever. Braff depicts this creature o well that it is tempting to wonder whether or not he was acting. And Natalie Portman, his habitually lying love interest, is a perfect compliment.<br/><br/>Most of the plot set-up is implied, rather than explicated, and the film is just expository enough to make it all clear. Andrew Largeman (Braff) is detached from essentially everything - starting with his family and even including his own life. His mother dies, and he must return home after a very lengthy period of removal. What he finds there is a bit surprising.<br/><br/>Unlike most romantic films, Garden State is intelligent, unpredictable and more disturbing and ironic than it is actually funny. Although it is not a depressing film, it is neither 'feel-good' junk food.<br/><br/>The acting is excellent. The script and directing are a little pretentious at times, but this is hardly noticeable. The cinematography is unusually good for this genre.<br/><br/>Recommended."
"sgtmahoney","1","16","36","26 August 2004"," Uneven, Inactive, Dishonest, and Disingenuous
","I'll throw in this disclaimer up front, so it's out of the way; I found Garden State so boring that I walked out on it after about an hour. That said, I haven't seen the ending so I can't comment on the film in its entirety. <br/><br/>I would ask how it ended, but I don't really know when it began. I have never found a film and its characters to be so inactive and uninteresting. All they did was talk. Talk talk talk. I knew it wasn't going anywhere when a scene between Braff and his father that starts with the elder Largeman appearing behind the fridge door, showed the two characters talking about having yet another talk later on in the film. Since I haven't seen the end, I wonder if anyone ever does anything? Actually, I don't wonder because I was never given any reason to care.<br/><br/>I found Braff's script completely uneven. He is constantly trying to quirk out a serious film by throwing extremely farcical and lame sight gags on the screen; the seeing-eye dog humping leg scene for example, being of the lamest. Equally as cringe-worthy was the Clapper bit, as Sam's ""racially-mixed for comedy's sake"" family applauds her figure skating video.<br/><br/>What year is it? 2004? The Clapper's been out for so long now that just about every hack stand-up comic across the country has made a joke about it.<br/><br/>Sorry Zach, gotta update the material a bit. What's next, an Edsel reference?<br/><br/>I also thought it was incredibly dishonest. I grew up in Jersey, and know no part of Jersey where there isn't a hint of a Jersey accent. You can't throw a few gaudy gold chains, Production Designer, on Peter Sarsgaard and convince me he's from North Jersey. He felt completely out of place. For an accurate portrayal of Jersey, watch the Sopranos. That's what Jersey looks like. And grave-robbing in broad daylight, taking your sweet-ass time with it? ""Look at me- I'm in a movie!""<br/><br/>It's clear that Harold and Maude was an influence here. Unfortunately, instead of reinventing a cult classic, Braff merely regurgitates, horribly, its quirk and tone. Had he had the courage to cast someone else in the lead role, he might have had time direct his actors so that they could have had some struggles to portray instead of just lines to memorize.<br/><br/>This was no Lost in Translation, as it's been compared to, and it is certainly no Harold and Maude."
"bob the moo","Null","11","23","21 December 2004"," Too knowingly quirky and a bit up itself but still entertaining with a heart visible under the ""kookiness""
","Andrew Largeman is an ""actor"" in Hollywood, meaning that he has had a small part in a TV show and is currently a waiter. When his mother dies, he is forced to return home and see the father that has kept him medicated since he was aged 10. His return home causes him to examine his life even though he still cannot really feel anything; it also allows him to hook up with old friends as well as meeting new ones  namely the beautiful but strange Sam.<br/><br/>It is perhaps ironic that the same qualities that attracted me to this film were the same qualities that I felt weakened it as a total film: these qualities were that it appeared a bit kooky and introspective. With several films of 2004 having mined this seam to great success, Garden State could be accused of being just an attempt to clone that by convey the malaise of twenty-somethings and, in fairness, it doesn't really help itself in the way it tends to overdo the aforementioned qualities. I do like films that are touching and introspective but they are best where they involve very real characters (or emotions); here the malaise is drug-induced and the situations all feel overdone and exaggerated. This is mirrored in the way the film knowingly does everything in a quirky manner and never misses a chance to make things more ""off-kilter""; for example our character drives an unusual vehicle, Sam has an African brother, there is a bottomless pit in Newark and so on. There is nothing terribly wrong with this but at times I did wish that it would tone down the ""kookiness"" and just get down to looking at the characters.<br/><br/>It still manages to do this but it does it despite the kookiness and not as a result of it. The characters are still well enough written that you do recognise them at least in small part and should be able to find part of their feelings that you can relate to or at least empathise with. When it works it works very well and I can understand so many moody youths have taken this film to their hearts; however at other times it doesn't manage to bring out characters or develop the story in a manner that will be as touching as it could have been if it had set itself in a much less kooky world. As writer and director, Braff must bare responsibility for these faults but then he deserves much more in the way of praise for all the things he does well  his direction is assured and has plenty of style, his choice of soundtrack is hardly earth shattering but suits his material and, despite the flaws, his writing is still an impressive debut. As actor though he is only so-so; it may be realistic for his character but am I the only person who dislikes raised inflections. He downplays his stuff and he does well, letting the rest of the cast shine.<br/><br/>In particular Natalie Portman digs her way deeper into my heart with a great performance. At times she comes close to failing but mostly she even manages to keep her character really likable and not get buried beneath the quirks. Not only is she beautiful but her vulnerability is well delivered as well as her sense of humour and fun; when she is on screen it is hard to not focus on her. Sarsgaard is a great young actor who is building up a collection of good performances. This film gives him less to do than it really should have done but he is still watchable and does well with what he has been given. Support is good from Holm, Dowd and Method Man (yes, you heard me right) but really the film is Portman's and she takes to it with a light, natural air that made me forget that I'll probably have to cope with another wooden performance from her in Star Wars 3 in a few months.<br/><br/>Overall this is a good film but not as great as people seem to think. The story is good and the characters are, in essence, well written, but it just feels like it was really pushing for the ""kooky"" niche that had been hit by Lost in Translation and The Station Agent. At times it could have scaled back the quirks and concentrated on the characters to produce a better film but even with this flaw it still works well and will be enjoyed by fans of the aforementioned films and introspective young people."

Sad to say this isn't even half way there.<br/><br/>Although in the guise of an offbeat indie film, this never feels authentic, and can be grouped alongside those other contrived pass-offs - The Secretary or Chocolat. This isn't in the same league as Donnie Darko or Happiness.<br/><br/>It all seems a little too by the numbers, lacking any real insight, as it desperately tries to wear its kooky credentials on its sleeve. Natalie Portman's excruciatingly overwrought turn JUST HAD to be pushed way beyond the realm of credibility with the liar's tick or the hamster run in the house. Zack JUST HAD to get around via an old army bike and sidecar combo. His friends JUST HAD to include a wacked out grave-digger, a feckless millionaire and a charmless pyramid scammer.<br/><br/>Now I have nothing against gentle whimsy, but it upsets me when there were glimpses of a much better film here. A nice opening half hour with good visual riffs on lack of communication and stifling conformity. But when the lead actor / writer / director falls for the perky, Portman pixie the whole things descends into idle wish fulfilment.<br/><br/>Rather give me the Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind to see two properly fleshed out characters written and performed with acres more indie credibility."
"tvalstar99","6","9","18","13 January 2005"," This film is given too much praise
","To me The Garden State is a film which tries too much to be artistic. Some scenes with some coldplay/Keane music in the background don't make a movie artistic.<br/><br/>I have the feeling that I know what director and writer Zach Braff wanted to do, but he failed by wanting it too much. This movie looks likes a nice, artistic, honest movie about a young man who returns to his home after nine years and discovers himself. The strange characters, his old friends, put in the humour. But the story is too cliché. As are the dialog. The dialog aren't good enough to keep my attention. The dialog want to learn us about live or should be romantic, but they aren't. Come on, I've seen this in other movies a hundred times.<br/><br/>I will try to explain it:When I watched this movie I had the feeling I had seen it all before, but then slightly different. Of course almost every movie has this, but in this movie I couldn't get rid of this feeling. I also had the feeling that the scenes with the music and the shots of Jersey were too much planned. It didn't really add much to the story. It is a movie that is written to be special instead of just being special. And not only that, the story isn't good enough to get away with the things I said above. That is why it has failed in my opinion. I don't understand why it has such a high rating here on IMDb.<br/><br/>It is not a bad movie, but it is not as good as the voters on IMDb say."

","The desire to be pretentious and different has hit young people like a plague, and Garden State is merely the newest strain. The film can easily be broken down into two categories, one being Natalie Portman and the other being Everything Else.<br/><br/>As a whole it is a sadly embarrassing film that seems to somehow justify the angst that is common to most everyone's teenage years, years that most also grow out of. Were I given the ability to write, direct, and star in a film at the age of fourteen, it probably would have turned out quite the carbon copy of Garden State.<br/><br/>Ian Holm is forced into a role that is so shallow and static that it could have been performed by any older male with ability to frown. Of course, the older male would have not even needed to frown if he simply wore a sandwich board sign declaring ""I'm the dad. I'm emotionally distant. I'm the bad buy.""<br/><br/>Braff, being a bit older than fourteen, realizes he has to contrive a need to justify this angst. Improper medicating. This would have been acceptable if the film made it out to be more than a shoe-horned plot device. However, it resurfaces seemingly at random, and the emphasis isn't on WHY someone would do this to their son, but that fact that the son can now LEGITIMATELY be angst-ridden.<br/><br/>Which sets the stage for the rest of the movie's downfalls. Scenes seem to be forced along, painfully at times, to simply deliver lines of dialogue so awkward that the desire to look away and blush is almost overwhelming. The rhyme and reason of the film is simply ""That happened so that this could happen."" It is not the fulfilling flow ""This happened BECAUSE of these stimuli."" Poor writing.<br/><br/>The saving grace? Natalie Portman. She's winning and likable, quirky but not alienatingly so. You WANT to love her, which judging by the rest of the characters, is directly her fault and not that of the writer/director.<br/><br/>With the trite teen comedy/romance ending, this film rapes any further indie dignity it seems to carry, but if you were a discerning viewer it came as no surprise. Yet sadly, it's hailed as genius, and delightfully outside the mainstreem.<br/><br/>It's a sad state of affairs when this could somehow, at this moment, be in the top 250 movies of all time. <br/><br/>There are better movies out that are pretty easy to get at your rental place. If you're looking for legitimate characters that are engaging yet quirky, proceed directly to Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. If you're looking for an engaging romance/comedy flick, go straight to Lost in Translation.<br/><br/>But please, don't stop in Garden State."

","Garden State is an entertaining and downright visually stunning piece of film-making by Zach Braff. It is both painfully sad and hysterical, and overly melodramatic cheesiness is always interrupted at the perfect time by comic relief, usually delivered by Natalie Portman's character. And, as other users have noted, it does speak to my generation; as a 24-year-old I am at that stage where home is no longer the same, and there's an abyss in front of me that I'm terrified to face since I have no idea what's in it.<br/><br/>With that said, Garden State's screenplay is flawed to the point of being patronizing. The movie succeeds and has been so well-received because it plays off the emotions and experiences of all 20-somethings, but it does so with a great deal of half-hearted philosophizing that tries way too hard to make a point about life that just isn't insightful. Yeah, life is hard, but you're off your drugs, you're in love, and, aside from your mother dying, you really don't have any problems. You're in your 20's, and there's lots to figure out but it will happen in time, so stop obsessing over it! And the end, my God, the end! Without giving anything away, the ending of this movie is the worst kind of forced dramatic tension and predictably melodramatic resolution when there is just no dramatic tension coming from the story itself. We know that Andrew Largeman has a flight back to LA that he has to get on, but why is it such a big deal for him to go back to LA? Is his life there really so important that he can't stay in NJ with Sam? There is just no dramatic energy to create the tension that the character seems to be facing; it just comes out of nowhere as a vehicle for Largeman to spout off some final words of quasi-philosophical self-evident baloney. His life is not that bad, and the decision is not as hard as Braff wants it to be.<br/><br/>So, this movie gets a 5 from me. It is beautiful, the acting is superb, and it does speak to me. But it tries way too hard and the plot and drama ultimately fail to deliver."

","There's nothing wrong with Garden State. It's a competent film that delivers a gentle, if somewhat awkwardly laid-out plot. There are times when you'll be wondering what the relevance of several scenes are, and other times when your attention will wander.<br/><br/>But mostly it rewards the perseverance of its viewers with its ending which, although horribly predictable and Hollywoodey, still manages to raise a smile.<br/><br/>But Garden State does suffer from hype. A full half of all IMDb votes rate this a 10. Maybe I saw a different version of the film, but I doubt it. There's a growing trend of ""following the loudest voice"" when it comes to rating movies (and I don't mean just on IMDb, but generally in all reviews). People will read a review and think that the film must be good simply because someone else said so, and rate the movie accordingly, even though they privately might not have rated it that highly. Oh well, I guess that's how the Academy Awards work anyhow.<br/><br/>I won't say Garden State is entirely a feel-good movie either. At times it's a feel-bored movie, but not that often. Neither is it a comedy. It has it's moments, but they are not laugh-out-loud moments so much as snigger-and-chuckle moments.<br/><br/>In short, it's a movie that isn't certain what it wants to be. A mixed bag that does none of its elements proper justice. A Jack-of-all-Trades movies that, ultimately, doesn't satisfy as well as it could have.<br/><br/>But, that said, its a very good first effort from Zach Braff and miles better than ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind"" - Clooneys first effort. So not all first efforts suck. And Braff is heading towards superstardom, whether he wants (or knows) it, or not."

","I am getting tired of faux-indie films. Films that pretend to be 'hip' and 'indie' but are, in fact, following Hollywood formula and wearing their hipness like a badge. Garden State is a perfect example of this tendency. The characters are all overtly emotional, dry characters who are just trying to understand how to fit into this cruel world. They all have unsubstantial, forgettable conversations about family and friendship and the past and growing up. And while I appreciate films that have plenty of dialogue, like some of Woody Allen's flicks, the dialogue really needs to be strong, powerful and hard-hitting. This film feels soft and tired and forgettable.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman's character seems to be created to be the quintessential 'quirky, alternative girl', kind of like the kids who litter films like 'Empire Records', except more self-consciously 'quirky'. She is quirkier than a three dollar bill, does things that are unpredictable and cries for no reason. It is hard to see why Braff's character falls for her at all, and there seems to be zero chemistry.<br/><br/>It all feels so contrived, and the movie itself plummets deeper and deeper into this false, smug, faux-indie, supposedly earnest dialogue and forced sentiment until the final, over-the-top, very very familiar father and son talk scene, which really takes the cake. It caps off this messy, wanna-be-alternative flick with such forced, banal sentiments...<br/><br/>Not to mention there is no real conflict and the characters are all so sweet with each other and just a bunch of oppressed twentysomethings trying to get along and understand life. It is very very familiar and was done much much better with Reality Bites. Although RB also felt, at times, a little over the top, it seemed much more sincere and had some brilliant dialogue and brilliant scenes... it also had the romantic 'subplot' which serves the 'love conquers all' theme, but at least the film as a whole was much more believable and well-written."

From the opening scene of him stiff in bed and his medicine cabinet of prescription mood-improvers the audience is left gagging. Likewise the restaurant scene at the opening of the movie is a cowardly and careless satire of the LA clientele- is it so unusual for a patron to ask for bread? Does braff know that bread actually exists in Vietnam and is common there? or does he want to show off that he is culturally sensitive (cf. zack's cheeky sobriquet ""tim"" for the African brother of sam)? poor little larch, like the real like braff, is an actor who can't fit in with normal folks- what a trial!<br/><br/>hold onto anything delicate because braff's clumsy exposition will shatter all in its path, including the gravity he so desperately injects into the film. has there ever been a more obvious and lazy introduction of a song than portman's dumping of her headphones onto larch's noggin at the hospital? <br/><br/>the most disappointing thing about garden state is how many saps were taken in by its fake pathos. lost in translation kicks its ass into the stratosphere"

","My first exposure to Garden State occurred six years before I would actually see the film. My older sister had just bought the soundtrack and was in love with it. Already a huge movie fan, I was interested immediately in seeing it. However, I wouldn't end up seeing Garden State until the first few days of 2011. After waiting all that time, my expectations were quite high and I almost feared that it would not live up to my hopes. I had nothing to fear. The Zach Braff that I knew from Scrubs was gone. Sure, he was still very funny. In this film, though, he was different. Braff's writing and direction demonstrate a high maturity and understanding of what we all go through that I would never have guessed he had in him. Natalie Portman embodies the role of Sam so well that I think I might be in love. Yeah, she was good in Black Swan. She was BETTER in this. When half of the films out of Hollywood lead us to believe that one can only achieve happiness through epic quests and magic, subtle works of art like Garden State exist to remind us that life is in fact wonderful. Thank you, Mr. Braff."

","A meandering movie that is excels as a vehicle for Zach Braff to expand his cinematic career, _Garden State_, I would highly recommend against seeing this movie - unless you want to laugh at non-sequitor sight gags but pretend to be watching a serious movie. A 2 - especially compared to Eternal Sunshine.<br/><br/>--POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT-- (not really though - just to be on the safe side)<br/><br/>Humping dogs, shirts that match the background, random stuff on ceilings, drugs, alcohol, odd noises with random gestures, a mother dating someone her son's age, a knight serving fast food.

"FilmSnobby","1","10","23","15 September 2004"," Or, The All-Consuming Importance of Zach Braff.
","Even though TV actor Zach Braff writes, directs, and stars in *Garden State*, I suppose we really ought to blame Dustin Hoffman for it, for *The Graduate* hangs heavily over this movie, like a self-obsessed pall. Zach Braff's Andrew Largeman is yet another representation of the gradual declension of the American male in popular culture, starting with Hoffman's morose little Benjamin back in the Sixties. 40 years after *The Graduate*, who are the hot male stars? Effeminate wisps like Leonardo DiCaprio, puny aesthetes like Tobey Maguire, zonked mumblers like Jake Gyllenhaal -- these, and all the others like them, trace their ancestry directly back to Benjamin. Triumph of the Nerds. Post-macho, post-masculine, hell, even post-penile. Lee Marvin and John Wayne and Humphrey Bogart and Clark Gable spin in their graves.<br/><br/>An apt segue: *Garden State* concerns itself with graves. In one scene we watch, unconvinced, while one of Andrew's old high school buddies -- a gravedigger -- removes a trinket from a freshly dug grave. What are supposed to do with this information? What purpose does it serve, other than making us question why Andrew would be on friendly terms with such a ghoul? The fact is, it's merely one sequence in a dozen in which Braff begs for our attention by throwing up meaningless quirkiness on the screen. A dog humps Andrew's leg in a doctor's waiting room. A guy in full knight's armor -- including beaver and helmet -- eats a bowl of cereal. Indeed, these irritating mannerisms are inaugurated from the opening frames: in a dream sequence, Andrew sits emotionless while his airplane is in the process of crashing. While his fellow passengers panic, he calmly adjusts the overhead air conditioning. Then he wakes up to a sterile, blinding white bedroom, lying half-awake on white bedsheets, listening to his father on the answering machine inform him that his mother has just drowned in the bathtub. Our hero closes his eyes.<br/><br/>Essentially, what Braff is doing is attempting to obfuscate the adolescent nature of his material with postmodern distractions. Boil this baby down, and you get your basic Guy-Comes-To-Terms-With-His-Parents-And-Gets-A-Pretty-Girlfriend-At-The-End story. Most of us tried to write this novel when we were in our late teens or early twenties; fortunately, most of us gave up when the unoriginality of it occurred to us in an embarrassing flash. Braff, however, is not cursed with such self-awareness. He apparently believes that if he out-Andersons Wes Anderson, presents an unwavering moody mien, and keeps the background noisy with the guitar strumming of maudlin pop groups like Coldplay, he'll achieve instant credibility as an ""artist"". Unfortunately, he has succeeded in this, as the reviews from the kids here at IMDb attest.<br/><br/>Even worse, a fair amount of professional film critics have also taken him seriously, perhaps because he refrains from resorting to flatulence jokes during the film. Boy, we really have learned to settle for less, haven't we? For some of us, however, fraudulence is not necessarily an improvement on flatulence. Some of us also dare to assert that ONE Wes Anderson is more than enough. But Braff is not even honest with his indie-film borrowings: the sappy, trite ending, which I won't spoil, reveals his squishy Hollywood center, his desire for wide multiplex release, his quest for mainstream success. The big-name casting also gives the game away: many of the faces are familiar, with two heavy-hitters -- Ian Holm and Natalie Portman (the latter slumming here for indie cred) -- in prominent roles. My growing dislike of *Garden State* turned to sharp disgust when I witnessed Zach Braff, as Holm's son, lecture Holm -- who is supposed to be a psychiatrist (!) -- about the importance of communication in their relationship. Wisdom from the mouths of babes, I guess. Or perhaps arrogance from the mouths of self-centered twits who can't relinquish even one good line of dialog to one of the century's great actors. Understandably, Holm looks rather insulted throughout the proceedings.<br/><br/>An unforgiving 1 star out of 10. Avoid."

Yippee. To get to the meat of it all Garden State is full of a lot of bad things bad writing, bad acting, bad directing, and bad music (no the shins will not change your life). <br/><br/>I guess what really bothered me was the shallow, single brush stroke, clichéd characters that rounded out a boring cast in an equally uninspired script. I read this is supposed to be my generation, but I most certainly hope not. <br/><br/>To sum it up simply life is hard, for everyone.

","This movie has a great soundtrack if you're indie. I'm not really, my ex was. Garden State is excessively melodramatic and tries to hard to be deep. Other reviewers correctly pointed out that it is a Wes Anderson rip-off, that Natalie Portman's character is a copy of Alyssa Jones from the much better Chasing Amy, that the scream scene is suppose to mean that Largeman's life is an infinite abyss. All I can say is that excessive existentialism will kill any movie. The initial scenes of Zach Braff's lost stare can get on anyone's nerve. Honestly, if it weren't for Natalie Portman's character (who in reality would be too fun and lively too find anything interesting in the dull and boring Largeman), I would have turned off this movie after 30 minutes. And I'm tired of stupid reviewers saying this movie is emblematic of young twentysomethings. They're basically saying that my generation is nihilistic, only cares about getting wasted and laid, is self-centered and loves to whine over everything.....Oh well."

","'Garden State' is a triple achievement for Braff. As writer, director and actor he is nothing short of superb. This is one movie that speaks to and of people of my generation. The film has a heart, the characters are very relatable and it boasts of so many memorable moments such as Sam taking Andrew to her room and telling him to do something unique, Sam doing a tap dance and the three standing at the edge of an abyss and screaming (note the brilliant cinematography in this one scene). It's these little moments that beautifully stand out. 'Garden State' tells a simple story and it is Braff's wonderful storytelling that keeps the viewer involved. The dialogues are funny and the characters already say a lot with less words. Performances are solid. Braff is totally different from 'Scrubs's Dorian. Acting and directing couldn't have been easy but he makes it seem otherwise. Peter Sarsgaard proves to be a chameleon actor and does a great job. I have never been a fan of Natalie Portman and I haven't liked her in any of her films (that I'd seen) with the exception of 'Cold Mountain' but here she took me by surprise as she's excellent as the vivacious Sam. I hope she does more such good work as she has shown that she can indeed act. The rest of the actors all look comfortable in their parts and do well. Soundtrack deserves a mention as we are presented with some moving songs by various artists. In a nutshell, 'Garden State' is a small movie with a big heart. It is uplifting and brings a smile with its subtlety (even the serious moments are toned with humour)."

","Half depressed and reluctant to face his traumatizing past for the first time in nearly 10 years, Andrew Largeman returns to the New Jersey region where he grew up, and this to be present at his mother's funeral. It's destined to be a short trip, since there's absolutely nothing there for Andrew. He's still estranged from his father, his old friends assume he has a successful acting career going on and  worst of all  the parental house reminds him of the accident that crippled his mother. But, shortly after his arrival, he meets Samantha and her spirited persona finally brings some joy and hope in Andrew's lonely existence. For the first time ever, Andrew actually has a reason to return home permanently...but then he has to find total peace with himself, first. A simple movie about simple characters with simple values in their lives...we don't get to see many of these and even when there occasionally is an enthusiast director who's attempts to make a clever little movie like this, they're straightly condemned to video-hell because nowadays movie-goers exclusively pay to see wild car chases and giant explosions. Even though Zach Braff was one of the few debuting young directors who DID receive some recognition and praising reviews for his ""Garden State"", a large majority of film fanatics still hasn't discovered it. And they all should, since it's heart-warming and identifiable tale, written and directed by someone who clearly loves and respects real cinema. It's highly praiseworthy how Braff finds an almost perfect balance between bittersweet melodrama and gallows humor! ""Garden State"" is a drama with a rather serious substance and yet it never becomes feeble or pitiful. On the contrary, the script's subtle sense of humor and the beautiful characterizations resuscitates hope and happiness!<br/><br/>Yes, ""Garden State"" is a very good film and Zach Braff surely knows which way he's going in the movie business. But still we shouldn't acclaim him as a new and long-awaited prodigy just yet! Although very admirable, his film isn't entirely flawless and definitely not groundbreaking. The story lacks some truly brilliant elements (ingenious ideas  if only just two or three  is what really makes films like this terrific) and it's a shame that too much of the characters' troubles are blamed on drugs. To focus more on the genius aspects again: the soundtrack is excellent (containing a great Coldplay-song and a downright mesmerizing track by Simon and Garfunkel) and the acting of an entirely talented cast simple couldn't be better. Nathalie Portman is particularly impressive in portraying the sweetest female character ever shot on film. Zach Braff already damn well knows how create moody atmospheres and how to write solid dialogues! If he'll now just find a truly innovating premise, his next project will be a masterpiece without peer! <br/><br/>*Note: This user comment is dedicated to the sweetest girl in the world; Cazzie.

Zach Braff captured the confusion and just plain craziness of life for us kids born in the early to mid-eighties in such a poignant (and comical) fashion that it made the movie so full of heart. When watching the movie, I could tell that Braff worked extremely hard on the screenplay. Plus, how can you not love his gigantic smile?<br/><br/>Also notable are the performances of Braff, Natalie Portman, Peter Sarsgaard, Ian Holm and the entire cast...they are all to be commended.

OK, the acting work is adequate, the script contains some good lines and ideas (I liked the miniature pet cemetery and the scene in the boat) and the music is not as bad as one would expect. And I assume that younger people will recognize more of their own life and attitude in it than I do. <br/><br/>But when I read that people liken this movie to a classic like ""The Graduate"", I wonder how they even can start to compare. I have nothing against Zach Braff, but he's definitely no Dustin Hoffmann (yet?) and even less a Mike Nichols. The romance between Large and Sam is quite nice, but it contains far too much saccharine. The ending of the movie is so disgustingly syrupy my teeth started to ache. Compare that to Benjamin and Elaine driving away in the bus without looking to each other: now that's an image one never forgets and what makes ""The Graduate"" a classic. Two minutes after the end I had completely forgotten what music what music was used in ""Garden State""; I just remembered it hadn't disturbed me much. Forgetting ""The Sound of Silence"" or ""Mrs. Robinson"" is nearly impossible, because it's really music that can change your life. <br/><br/>I found ""Garden State"" sometimes boring, sometimes funny, and it's probably worthwhile watching it on TV while socializing with friends. But I wouldn't advise anybody to watch it in the theater or buy the DVD. Personally I would prefer to have my money back and not have seen this movie.

When the film begins, you really have no idea of the wild places it will take you. <br/><br/>The chemistry between Zach Braff (who I loved from Scrubs) and Natalie Portman is fun to watch. Natalie is charismatic, bubbling with energy, definitely a young star. Their budding relationship in the film is treated quite realistically, as more and more revelations about their pasts pop up as the film progresses. I had difficultly believing the end of the film, when his feelings for her are so strong that he gets off his plane to stay with her, but in a way I wanted to believe it. <br/><br/>There are two aspects to this film that elevate it from being a fairly good romantic comedy to being one of the best movies of the year, in my opinion. First of all, the soundtrack. Many of these songs were new to me when the movie came out, but hearing any one of them now conjures up all of the emotions I felt while I was watching it. Secondly, the creative ways they use the camera. Especially in the first part of the film, the interesting and surprising camera angles take you into a bit of a fairy tale world. <br/><br/>Besides the ending at the airport, the one scene that kind of annoyed me was when they went to the hotel and the bellhop character was peeping on some guests and you see a gratuitous, almost X-rated sex scene. Why is that in there? It seemed out of place and annoyed me but not so much as to ruin the film."

She listens some '70s band named The Shins and gives...what? they're from this damn decade?? Then why do they sound like that?? Oh, they have no personality, OK.....so she hands her CD player to John Garden State and he looks at her with a dumb face(you know, love). As the song played on, i heard its lyrics saying ""you will love this soundtrack, it is so alternative and cool, you will love this movie, it will define you and your generation even if it is a ideological photocopy of The Breakfast Club, Ghost World and every other smart teen movie from the last 20 years, you will drink coffee and read books you don't understand""...<br/><br/>By now, really unoriginal sh!t starts to happen....he doesn't care if he dies in a airplane crash (because he is already dead....and he feels nothing) and he lets us know in a scene idea taken straight out of an unknown movie called FIGHT CLUB!!!, it is a cool scene but, oh, did I mentioned it appeared in the trailer?.......then in some party, and just when you think this guy is really deep and asexual he makes out with a bimbo....so oh, he's not such a emotional zombie after all....clever character development or just a sh!tty movie?......well, lets analyze that scene, it features him sitting motionless in a couch with everyone else moving in really fast speed......scene idea taken straight out of an unknown movie called REQUIEM FROM A DREAM!......so just a sh!tty, sh!tty movie...<br/><br/>Then they meet more eccentric (cliché, actually) characters, and finally, one that lives next to a big hole in the ground.

","Garden State The title is, of course, ironic. The central character is a bit actor living in California (his big claim to fame is having played a ""retarded football player"", so lets just call him ""retardoactor""), who earns his living as a fake Vietnamese waiter in an oriental restaurant. He hears a message from his father via his answering machine, who obviously cannot get his son to even talk to him, that his mother has died. The most amazing thing in the whole movie is that he actually goes home to New Jersey for the burial - why bother, he's had no or essentially no contact with his family for ten years? At the burial, he meets up with a couple of old school chums, the backhoe operators burying bodies at the cemetery. His ""best friend"" is a pot and meth or crack smoking fellow who we find out earns money for his drugs from shoplifting and stealing the jewelry from the corpses of the people he buries. We could call him ""graverobber"", but I prefer ""methead"". He roundly castigates retardoactor for not bringing home all the drugs he had obtained in California. We meet a couple more of his friends. The one person in his circle of buddies who apparently had some brains is a nerd who developed a revolutionary fabric closure substance, ""silent velcro"". He is paid off handsomely to keep the stuff from coming to market, and now lives in an empty mansion. Lets call him tycoonboy. His life has dissolved into a boring fog of drunken drug/rape/sex orgies, fed by underage cokewhores who threaten blackmail with less passion and reluctance than I show ordering an ice cream cone. His is the success story in the movie. After retardoactor goes to tycoonboy's house for an orgy, where he smokes dope and drops (apparently) acid, he comes down from his trip at methead's house-in every way quite representative of a speed freak's domicile-torn curtains, mismatched broken furniture and dirty squalor. Retardoactor meets up with a pathological liar, with at least one other mental disorder, while being dry humped by a lady's seeing eye dog in a doctor's office where they are both being treated. During his catscan, he finds out that methead's mother has covered his body with obscenities in waterproof ink, including comments about the size of his penis. Apparently, she had a good time with him, too, although he was too stoned to know it. After their respective exams, retardoactor and patholiar find they are attracted to each other,so they begin a relationship immediately. Patholiar's most salient advice to him in the entire movie is to kick male animals in the balls, repeated several times. We meet more of his old buddies, and the real losers are the ones who are maintaining steady jobs. The one who is advancing at a chain restaurant, the one who is working as a clerk ""for awhile"" and the nerdboy at a thinly disguised Home Depot clone where methead is shoplifting-nerdboy might as well be wearing a big rubber nose and plastic glasses. At patholiar's home (she actually seems to have a fairly nice, if fruity, mother) they talk to each other about their lives. She still has a Christmas tree up, and she accuses him of being Jewish, but he assures her that he isn't really Jewish and doesn't even KNOW any Jews who go to a Temple (the type of congregation in the most liberal branch of Judaism) more than one day a year. We find out that retardoactor was sent away to boarding school because his parents felt he was a threat to their well being after he crippled his mother for life (paraplegia) by attacking her because she was insufficiently pleasant for his tastes. He has a confrontation with his father, where his father advises him to forgive himself (anyway-his father obviously has), and that all he had ever wanted was for them all to be happy. Retardactor advises him that he was NEVER happy, and that he would (graciously} forgive his father for trying to make him happy. Retardoactor and methead and patholiar all go on a quest to a fencing operation (the fence and his family was by far the most sympathetic and normal family group in the movie) where methead obtains the locket he had stolen off of the dead body of retardoactor's mother. Retardoactor decides that he has to go figure everything out in California, or some such thing, and patholiar accompanies him to the airport, where they say their tearful farewells. The denouement is when he gets off the plane and returns to her. He's decided that there is nothing to reach for, and that he is going nowhere, in an ending of emptiness which makes the bus ride in ""The Graduate"" look like a romantic, committed, heroic quest. Not recommended."

","It isn't funny, it isn't clever, it isn't even that unique - so I have to wonder why such the high rating on IMDb?

Yes, that is what this is, an ART HOUSE FILM.<br/><br/>In parts the directing is good, the acting is superb, but the end product is tiresome. In all, a good one for the CV for all those involved in the project, not good for anyone else.<br/><br/>Perhaps the film would have worked simply not centering completely around Zach's character.

","GARDEN STATE (d. Zach Braff, 2003, USA)<br/><br/>If Zack Braff's directorial debut is to be believed many of America's twenty- somethings are aimlessly dragging their heels from adolescence to the grave - and can only manage to do so with a strong dose of pharmaceuticals, either officially prescribed or illicitly obtained (and a cool soundtrack).<br/><br/>Not that this is the message the uplifting trailer for Garden State sells us.<br/><br/>After a much lauded reception at last year's Sundance the now expected indie hype has been used to usher audiences to Garden State clearly positioning it as the latest generation's take on early-life crisis. <br/><br/>Braff himself plays 26-year old Andrew 'Large' Largeman, a man kept in the state of a spaced out kid via heavy doses of lithium prescribed by his psychiatrist father.<br/><br/>A trip back home, to New Jersey - America's Garden State, from LA for his mother's funeral serves as an excuse to leave the pills at home, while hooking up, somewhat non-committally, with old college mates starts off as a route to pills of another sort.<br/><br/>But the 'slacker-may-care' attitude of drugs, driving and doggy-paddle can't quite ring true when presumably in a state of lithium withdrawal Large makes his declaration of love to the compulsive liar, epileptic Sam (Natalie Portman in her first real post-puberty role).<br/><br/>Something seems to have been lost in the transatlantic translation process, as far from being a 2004 take on the Dazed and Confused mindset what comes over clearest is a set of well crafted cinematic images inside a cobweb of a plot following an indie cool agenda to tackle love, hate, relationships, ambition and the difficulty of actually feeling the events that life throws at us all.<br/><br/>While Large's dependence on anti-depressants, his best friend's decision to take the cocaine option to small town living and the new love of his life's epilepsy, to reduce Garden State to a picture purely about managing life via drugs is admittedly a little harsh.<br/><br/>What Braff's brave writer/director/star showpiece loses in a weak storyline he more than makes up with a keen eye for what images shine on the screen. The much reproduced picture of him wearing a shirt stood in front of matching wallpaper is just one (all too briefly mind) example. But a crane shot of a swimming pool, a swooping shot of a possibly bottomless ravine and a blazing open fire in an unfurnished ballroom give strong hope for what Braff might deliver if given the right material, and possibly if he were to drop some responsibility and take a step behind the camera.<br/><br/>To say that the journey of Garden State's 26-year old 'hero' offers a radically different set of footsteps to another young man who's life is also playing out in cinemas at the moment (Howard Hughes in Martin Scorsese's The Aviator) would be to kick at a dangerous wasps nest of the differences between the aspirations of two very different eras. So it will go unsaid<br/><br/>What seems sure though is that we do have another young talent to watch - and another debut star who may rise, or collapse, under the pressure to deliver a snazzy second feature."

While I do know many people in their 20s who have no focus, no ambition and no hope in their lives, I also know many others who do. During the scene where Sam and Andrew bury Jelly in Sam's backyard, I thought ""Oh no, another movie that tries to 'depict' suburban white kids as living a meaningless existence. Is this supposed to be 'brilliant'?"" I admire Braff's writing ability for being accurate in the dialogue with Large and his father where Large tells him that they need to be okay with not being as happy as his father always dreamed. But it bothers me that a movie about how depressed people of my generation are is a movie that would define us! This movie certainly does not define any of my friends. There is more to life than getting high, casual sex and wandering through life with no hope."

","this film takes all sort of clichés from indie film from the 80s/90s and exploits them to manipulate the sentimentality of the audience. garden state is not a true ""indie"" film-- it's just a Hollywood film with a small budget. it operates by borrowing certain indie mannerisms to appear ""original"" when in reality it's just a(nother) sappy and contrived romantic comedy. unfortunately, that's the state of independent film these days-- almost completely overtaken and pushed towards the mainstream by Hollywood hacks.<br/><br/>the cinematography was so-so (others here have commented on it already), but i also think the editing was spotty, because i found myself bothered by it several times-- unnecessary cuts, shots that break the narrative, etc. the dialogue was, at times, truly atrocious, lines so bad that i cringed and my brain refuses to recall them.<br/><br/>i have to add also that i did NOT like natalie portman for the role-- her voice was just annoying, and her performance didn't match her character-- i couldn't keep from feeling she was self-consciously reading her lines, especially in the early part of the movie. what a difference from, say, kate winslett in ""eternal sunshine of the spotless mind"", where the eccentric girl is truly believable, not just easy on the eyes (and is sam really that ""eccentric""? not really... if anything, more of a woman-child. but i digress...)<br/><br/>zach braff on the other hand was pretty good on his role, but then again he wrote the script himself (and directed it), so he had to fit... but that's not enough to carry a whole movie, is it? so maybe he spread himself too thin, or maybe this is the result of narcissism, or lack of perspective... <br/><br/>i think the film fails to deliver what it sets out to do. the premise had potential, and there were interesting characters and situations presented, but the script went nowhere with them. <br/><br/>the lesson i hope the director learns: some times you need to delegate to experts (or people with more talent). just because you have a good idea for a story, it doesn't mean that you can weave a good plot or write good dialogue. hire a good script doctor next time? and best of luck--<br/><br/>now this movie is not THAT awful. i would give it a 5? but i gave it a 1 to counterbalance the mass overrating and the hype-- this movie in no way belongs among the 250 best films in history. how did it get there? mass ignorance? an absurd situation..."
"dxia","1","7","17","24 October 2004"," What on earth is wrong with these reviewers?
","There is a very strange fascination with this movie that I really don't understand, and in fact, I cannot even comprehend it so I won't even try. But somehow, the general consensus on this movie has been positive, which is bewildering to me because I don't think I've ever seen such a pretentious, worthless, work of a wannabe auteur gain such praise. <br/><br/>Zach Braff is a bad student moviemaker. It is a fact because he shares the exact same characteristics as other bad student moviemakers. So much so that I expected him to possess one of the NYU film school's certifications to make music videos. He aimed ""Garden State"" at people my age and believed that he could explain our twenty-something angst with his laundry list of blatant hypocrisies.<br/><br/>He blames prescription drugs, he blames his parents, he blames the broken latch on a dishwasher. Braff spends so much time analyzing what's wrong with life and family that he doesn't recognize that he depends on those same things to survive. The fact is, there isn't anything really wrong with his life. He's only trying to make us feel like there's something wrong with our lives, that maybe we're the ones that have spent most of our years in a drug-induced haze. Braff is wrong, and it demonstrates how bad moviemakers are the ones preaching an agenda rather than portraying honest characters.<br/><br/>And that's not to say his preaching is any good either. His scenes of calmly experiencing a plane crash, the sterile bedroom, and blending in against a wall pattern are obvious suggestions of his mental state, and so obvious that it takes away from the narrative of the movie. He spends all his time feeling sorry for himself and hanging-out with his shadow puppet friends, who seem so incapable of expressing any realistic emotions that they have to exhibit an array of absurdities in order to pretend to be plausible human beings.<br/><br/>""Garden State"" is a demonstration of a young moviemaker trying to make an important statement by contriving meaning out of something that was a bad idea to begin with. Ian Holm plays an emotionless father in this movie, and I somehow believe that he was not acting in his role. I believe he was so bored by the quack pseudo-intelligence behind the script that he felt it unnecessary to put a mature adult in his scenes. <br/><br/>After all, does anyone on this planet know what the ""infinite abyss"" is? Does even Zach Braff know what the ""infinite abyss"" is, or is it just another spit bubble that looks like something that has substance but is really just the foaming hot air coming out of his mouth? One thing I do admire about Braff. He was able to convince so many people that he actually knows what he's talking about.<br/><br/>Out of the 1200 movies I've seen, this is one of the truly awful ones that scrapes the bottom with ""Autumn in New York,"" ""40 Days and 40 Nights,"" and Demi Moore's ""The Scarlet Letter."" This is one of those movies that I paid to see and felt so cheated by the end, that I snuck into another movie. Happily, that movie was ""Napoleon Dynamite,"" which was like a pleasant breeze that cleared the stink that ""Garden State"" left in its wake.<br/><br/>People who like this movie need to grow up."
"FilmOtaku","7","4","8","20 September 2004"," Not a bad first effort
","Zach Braff's directorial debut, 'Garden State' gives us the story of Andrew Largeman, a thinly employed L.A. actor whose mother dies, leading him to visit his home state of New Jersey to attend her funeral. Soon after he arrives, he falls back into his friendships with people he went to high school with, most notably Mark, played by Peter Sarsgaard and continues in the barely-there and shallow relationship he shares with his father. (Ian Holm) From there he encounters Sam (Natalie Portman) a girl who is off the scale in terms of quirkiness. He spends several days hanging out with his friends and avoiding his father, all in search for deeper meaning in his life.<br/><br/>For a first time directing effort, Braff did a pretty good job with 'Garden State'. Two things were glaringly obvious to me from the onset; most striking was that he has obviously been heavily influenced by the music video age. The use of slow-motion for dramatic effect, various film speeds, etc. all show direct influence. The other thing is that he is not afraid to let the camera focus on his face  he was very comfortable to give the camera many long, languid looks; so many that the thought popped into my head that he probably practiced these looks in his bathroom mirror or something. Certainly both of these points did not take anything away from the film, indeed the dynamic cinematography was an asset. Unfortunately, the film was higher on style, but the story lacked real meat. There were several times where I found myself looking forward to some plot points (particularly the one involving Andrew's father) being expounded upon, but they just kind of fizzled with a little metaphorical sigh. Having said that, there were several plot elements that didn't pan out in the manner in which we've become accustomed to with Hollywood films, so that was certainly refreshing, and stood out as a definite positive. Also, I appreciated the 'real life  real speak' aspects of the film. It's obvious that the film was written by a Generation X-er, inspired by pop culture, because there were many times during the film where I would chuckle to myself because I'd had an almost identical conversation with someone in my life at one time or another.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the biggest negative in the film was probably the biggest name of the film- Natalie Portman. Her character, Sam, is quirkiness personified. She says pretty much anything she possibly can, and contorts her body into goofy positions to scream 'I'm different and perky!' as loud as possible. Whereas I found Kate Winslet's 'quirky girl' character endearing in another independent film from earlier this year, 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind', Portman simply grated on me more and more throughout the film. Rather than thinking she was special, unusual and deep I found her to be a negative component of the film. Conversely, Peter Sarsgaard, who has been REALLY good in the few films I've seen him in, kept it up in 'Garden State'. His obviously intelligent and well-spoken Mark is a solid, believable and complex character and Sarsgaard embodies this character brilliantly.<br/><br/>I've never seen the show that made Braff 'famous', 'Scrubs', so this was my exposure to him and his talents. 'Garden State' is certainly flawed, but it is quite good for his first work and I'm looking forward to his future writing and directorial career. I enjoyed 'Garden State' on a basic level enough where I would recommend it to anyone who appreciates independent cinema, but I didn't get the emotional, intellectual or spiritual impact I was led to believe would occur based on word of mouth. Braff is a long way from Hal Ashby-caliber writing and directing, but this is a decent start. Still a good film nonetheless, 'Garden State' is definitely worth a look.<br/><br/>--Shelly"

The father's role is much too brief. The superb acting is wasted.

","Garden State is by far, one of the most longest, most boring movies ever. It tries to copy life-genre films like American Beauty and tries to be weird, messed up and independent, but it just doesn't work. The characters were such cliché's of already existing character types from other drama films, and Natalie Portman's character is just so outrageous and weird that she doesn't seem real at all. Also, what was with the beginning? Seriously, it did not make any sense at all. Also, the humor was poor and not good, only getting a few chuckles out of me. This film was so long and dull, where there's only talking and talking and talking. What makes drama films like The Station Agent and American Beauty so great is that characters and the plot keep changing, and it's intense, real, different, and original-there's a sense of sincerity to the story and to the characters. But with this film, everything feels like the director was just imitating and trying to copy other drama films, and if you try to make something seem deep and dramatic, chances are it's going to turn out to be cheesy. The main character's problems are only briefly revealed, not clearly stating the reason as to why he's so messsed up in the film. And another thing, compared to a lot of my friends, the main character is not at all messed up and he just seems like a total wimp to me. So, out of ten, I give this film a 0 just because I was led on to believe it was good, and it ended up to be a total bore fest."

","The first half hour of Zack Braff's debut as a writer and director establishes him as a filmmaker of immense talent, and I hope he'll get to make more films soon. It's opening act high captures a youthful sense of upper-middle class depression, alienation and ennui as well as I've seen, with comedy that makes you hurt inside, and inventive visual story telling. <br/><br/>After that the film comes down to earth somewhat, but it's still full of goodies. Peter Saarsgaurd in particular creates an unforgettable supporting character while being complexly understated. <br/><br/>This story of an depressed actor in his late 20s returning home after 9 years has a lovely mix of quirky humor, and well-earned sadness. Braff satirizes small town America without putting it down, and pokes fun at depression and family tragedy without it feeling shallow - neither very easy feats. Great use of music as well. <br/><br/>Where the film falters for me is in the love story, which feels bizarrely familiar and unimaginative compared to the storytelling all around it. Also, while both fine actors, I never really felt any great chemistry between Braff and Natalie Portman. In some ways Braff's relationship with Saarsguard feels more nuanced. Last, Portman's character feels so young, so unformed next to Braff that it's hard to believe she's ready for a serious relationship. <br/><br/>The very end has received some justifiable carping from critics as a bit of a cop out, but it didn't bother me nearly as much as such things usually do. <br/><br/>But all that said, this is a terrific debut film, and a terrific film about being young and lost."

This movie is just simple and beautiful, I completely recommend every person to take a trip to Jersey just so that you can truly understand what life is like in Jersey."

","After having sat through the most painful hour and whatever of my life I searched for the film on the inter-web in an effort to find out how panned it got by critics only to find, much to my dismay, that it was universally adored! Every single review was positively glowing with the odd random bemused review, from a disgruntled observer (from those people who watched the film with their eyes and ears open perhaps?) I really hope that I'm not alone in thinking that this movie was the most over-rated piece of cinema ever made and surely purely for Braff's own self anointment?! I feel so strongly about this film that I may no longer be able to watch scrubs for an overwhelming urge to smash JD's face. I really hope that this is all a big joke by Braff and that he secretly laughs to himself every time the film is given praise! In an effort to offer a fair and balanced review it is necessary to highlight the film's good points...a tough one..I suppose the shins aren't that bad...and Portman is hot...thats it though."

","I didn't like this movie because it was way too slick. I wasn't able to get into it because I felt like I was watching a manufactured movie that was trying to pass itself off as an Independent film. The line between an Independent and Manufactured/Hollywood film is pretty wide, but this movie made it seem narrow and broken. It crossed over that line too many times in some of its gags (which were way too cliché), it's moments of pseudo 'profundity' (I know, profound is a pretty subjective concept, perhaps I am past what this movie preaches, or maybe I am just cynical and haven't reached it), and its characters (the friends of the main character seemed to be all shallow jerks, the kind you'd find on some reality based TV show or girls gone wild). Lastly, to say that the medication issue was oversimplified would be an understatement. I don't believe the writer had much familiarity surrounding the issue of medication."

","I recently watched Garden State and granted I'm not a professional critic, I think it is one of the best made movies I have seen in a while. The plot is simple enough to follow that it makes the story enjoyable since you aren't left struggling to construct events. By the end of the movie, you find yourself so engrossed in their lives that you feel as if you have grown up with all the characters and have known them for life. At then end, you will be begging for more. Sam (Portman) is such a wonderfully innocent pathological liar that you can't help but love her. I give Garden State 2 thumbs way up. Go out and rent it today!"

","Hey guys, I'd just like to say that I just finished watching this movie. Like the title of this topic says, it was just perfect. Braff was perfect, Portman was perfect, the music was perfect, the images were perfect, the story was very original. I loved it. I am a movie person, i have seen hundreds of movies (like most of us all in IMDb), and I have never picked a ""favorite movie"", up until today. This is by far my favorite movie. This calm, yet ""non-boring"" film was amazing. Every second in this movie caught my attention. Portman's acting was great, but I think the real genius here is Braff. Written, directed and stared? How many big actors out there wish they could do this? Like I stated before, PERFECT. I highly recommend this movie. HIGHLY."

Zach Braff is an awesome actor and I was glad to see him get away from Scrubs and show that. I will be buying this tomorrow for sure. I liked the lil cameo by Method Man though.. <br/><br/>Definitely a nice lil break from the seriousness of the movie at the time. 10 Stars is definitely a must with this movie. How can you not like it? Natalie Portman portrayed her character perfect, seeing as how the role was made for her anyway. I hope to see more movies like this in the future."

","Aspiring actor Andrew 'Large' Largeman hasn't been home in nine years but he returns for his mother's funeral. Here he sees his father, who is also his psychiatrist, and it is clear their relationship is frosty. He also meets up with old friends and makes one new friend, Sam. Sam is a girl he got chatting to in a doctor's waiting room. Having left his medication at home he decides not to get more and starts feeling emotions that had been numbed for some time.<br/><br/>This isn't the easiest film to categorise; it has plenty of funny moments without forced gags; it has emotional moments and it has romance, even that doesn't develop too quickly. Instead it looks like a glimpse into Andrew's life at a point where things are likely to change. The main characters are interesting without feeling exaggerated. The cast is impressive; Zach Braff, who also wrote and directed, does a fine job as Andrew and Natalie Portman is very likeable as Sam. Overall I'd recommend this to people not requiring action and obvious gags but wanting a gentler, 'real' film."

"rooprect","Null","1","1","30 March 2018"," ""True Stories from Suburbia""
","""Garden State"" has a very specific brand of humor that not everyone is going to get immediately. But as writer/director/star Zach Braff says in the bonus interview, ""Is it funny? {Interviewer says yeah} Good. I never know if anyone else is going to find them funny. If nothing else, I'm making a movie that I'll enjoy.""<br/><br/>And that's why this movie works. In comedy, the worst thing you can do is try too hard to be funny. ""Garden State"" falls squarely in subtle, almost deadpan territory... meaning there aren't any big sight gags, slapstick or knockout punchlines. <br/><br/>In that respect I'd put it in the genre of ""movies like Bill Murray would act in"" except there's no Bill Murray. I'm referring to flicks like Coffee & Cigarettes, Rushmore, Royal Tenenbaums, Life Aquatic, which is essentially saying it's like a Wes Anderson film, or maybe Terry Zwigoff (Ghost World, Art School Confidential). There's a lot of visual storytelling, as in quirky symmetrical shots, stationary cameras on meticulously arranged sets, or a surreal vibe punctated by the camera slowly rising into the sky.<br/><br/>The story is something like famed French existentialist Albert Camus would write if he did comedy. A late-20s, emotionless, estranged son (Zach Braff) returns to his hometown to bury his mother. He seems devoid of all sentimentality as he wanders around meeting all sorts of crazy (and I mean crazy) characters from his past. Whether he's being nearly shot to death by an overenthusiastic cop, or molested by a hot blonde at a party, his range of emotion barely budges between bored and slightly perplexed. Then he meets his antithesis, a 20-something girl (Natalie Portman) whose range of emotion is somewhere between very amused and insanely happy.<br/><br/>It's the delightful contrast between these 2 characters, and their great on-screen chemistry, that turns an otherwise brooding sarcastic comedy into a really entertaining treat.<br/><br/>Another thing that really defines this film is the way every character, even the minor ones who only have 1 scene, are so bizarre and interesting that you feel like an entire movie spinoff could be made of each one. These characters include: 1) the grave digger who makes his real living by doing questionable things at the hardware store; 2) the grave digger's hot mom who is sleeping with her son's sworn enemy from high school; 3) the kid who got rich from inventing ""silent velcro"" and who now spends his time doing absolutely nothing; 4) the West African immigrant who is studying criminal justice and is obsessed with figuring out which dog is pissing on his phone; 5) the strange ""Guardian of the Abyss"" whom I won't spoil for you; and the list goes on.<br/><br/>The second half of the story focuses on a bizarre suburban quest the 3 main characters undertake, almost like in ""Stand by Me"" but with grownups and maybe a pornographic peepshow or two (btw the location of the climactic scene, ""Kiernan's Quarry"", is a real place--or at least it was until it got filled in & converted to condos a few years ago).<br/><br/>But as strange and nonsensical as it sounds, these are in fact ""true stories from suburbia"" as Zach Braff says. The entire film is a compilation of stories that happened to him and others in his small Jersey town growing up. ""Garden State"" has a magical way of bringing these seemingly random vignettes to our attention, making us understand the epic nature of obscurity.<br/><br/>So no, there may not be crazy car chases, bank heists or wacky jewel capers (...oh wait, actually there sorta is 1 wacky jewel caper), this film delivers a really entertaining ride from start to finish."
"AliceofX","6","1","1","2 March 2016"," Feels Empty
","I wasn't even sure if I should write this review as I struggled to come up with words to describe it. On the one hand there are some good things about it, quality moments where you really empathise with Zach Braff's character and his feelings. The movie really well captures the numbness of depression. And on the opposite spectrum I really liked Natalie Portman's character as she brought a lot of energy to it. There are some funny scenes and interesting characters but after a while the quirkiness becomes old and stale. Just being random doesn't make it funny.<br/><br/>But there is a profound emptiness that comes upon me when I think about the Garden State. It left me feeling nothing, as if I had forgotten half the film and now struggled to remember what was good about it. The film's better moments don't come together to a satisfying whole and the plot just feels unfinished.<br/><br/>Overall this is by no means a bad film. But it's one of those movies that you watch when there is nothing better on. It's satisfying as long as you don't expect too much."
"jorn-truyen","5","1","1","22 July 2014"," Mixed feelings, with the balance tipping towards clichÃ©
","Zach Braff's light-hearted directorial debut 'Garden State' was one of mixed feelings. Although the low budget comedy-drama may be the starting shot of a successful career, 'Garden State' left me feeling slightly disappointed, when I think about the movie that could have been.<br/><br/>Andrew Largeman (Zach Braff) is a young man with a scarred past, who has numbed his problems with an always full medicine cabinet. As a kid, he paralysed his mother by pushing her over a dish washer. His father has always blamed Andrew, while he himself claims it was just due to the broken latch. He now returns to New Jersey for his mother's funeral. During his return, he develops a relationship with the spontaneous, talkative Sam (Natalie Portman).<br/><br/>Sam is the most interesting character in the film, wherein Portman shows she is more than just a pretty face. She creates a layered character with a complicated but likable personality, whereas to my mind Braff's numbness and quirkiness is more difficult to like. Braff's directorial choices are certainly not bad for a first-timer. His style is effective in portraying the character quirks of Andrew. While a director like Kar Wai Wong often uses slow-motion shots, Braff sometimes focuses on Andrews character and speeds up everything around him. As to the film's script, there are bright moments, but unfortunately, sometimes it lapses into force-fed Hollywood romanticism.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, I can appreciate the light-heartedness of the film and the ""Graduatesque"" relationship is interesting to an extent. However, the word 'forced' lingered in my head throughout the film. Granted, it is a good soundtrack, but the emotionality of the movie seems to force itself upon us by the use and timing of the songs."
"ThomasDrufke","7","1","1","3 July 2014"," Solid Film About Self Discovery
","When I think of coming of age movies of the last decade, there are several movies that come to mind, and quite possibly Garden State will be in that list. The film does a good job at capturing the time in your life when you are in between school and the real life and still trying to figure out your priorities in life. I really like how Zach Braff directed and wrote this movie. Even though it feels like a lot of other self discovery films, he brought something new to the table.<br/><br/>Having Natalie Portman as the lead female is also never a bad choice. Portman is one of the few actresses that bring a tremendous amount of realism to her characters. And she may very well have the best crying face in Hollywood. Her quirky Sam character perfectly complimented Braff's Andrew. Their chemistry is apparent right from the first scene together all the way to the last airport scene. Although I think the ending was one of the few major weak points the movie had. I was also a bit confused on the whole day-dreaming sequence up until the final scene when it started to come together.<br/><br/>Peter Sarsgaard was also a good fit with the cast. I'm glad that he didn't turn into just another druggie, and actually had depth to his character. The father felt rather flat to me, and even in the bedroom scene, I didn't feel much compassion for the man. But the real gems are the scenes just between Sam and Andrew. I think for that reason alone is why this film is constantly on top movies of the 2000's lists. What I really enjoyed about this movie, is that it's basically genre-less. It's not a true romance, comedy, drama or adventure. It's simply a pretty good movie about life.<br/><br/>+Chemistry between Braff & Portman <br/><br/>+No genre +Relatable life situations<br/><br/>-Ending falls flat <br/><br/>-One note dad character <br/><br/>7.7/10"

","....is painful and almost not worth the effort of sitting through approximately two hours worth of utter dribble to get to. It was when Andrew had that talk with Sam about not feeling like he belonged to the hometown anymore ever since he moved out.<br/><br/>If only the whole film worked on the tone of that lost-ness instead of focusing on how stoned out his childhood friends were. I understand the stoned out friends are there to establish how much Andrew has moved on from that place but it took up what felt like 2/3rd of the film which was precisely 2/3rd too much.<br/><br/>Braff tried too hard to be quirky and hip. This was evident in making one of the most likable actresses (in my book anyway) into such an insufferable character. Ooohey lookit she's in to see the shrink coz she's so darn quirky too (ok she has epilepsy or something of the sort. My apologies for not paying better attention. I was too distracted by how bad Saarsgard was at this point and I have liked everything else I've seen him in).<br/><br/>Ooohey lookit she's forcing Andrew to create such a different, special memory in her room. Oh wow she ice skates in an alligator costume. Tres original!! My apologies again for being such a positive polly. I suspect my expectations got the better of me (only because the three leads could have delivered so much more).<br/><br/>This film is best watched either right after high school or college graduation. That **cked up period in most of our lives where we felt so lost and un-belong. I'm 26 and yet to hold a steady job after my degree and this film annoyed the crap out of me.<br/><br/>I suggest The Graduate and Beautiful Girls or even Home For The Holidays if you're looking for similar films. Much more enjoyable and less forced than this one, cheers = )"

He no longer wants to travel through life numb with medication. <br/><br/>I follow the basis, but ... it just seems like a super long movie for such a simple point that you don't even realize they are making until the very end.

She is of course beautiful and brilliant as everybody knows, but here she tries something different. She strives to be ordinary and slight but with great emotive power. Nice performance.<br/><br/>The sound track which reminded this old guy of something from Simon and Garfunkel, and in fact there is a Simon and Garfunkel tune on it, was the sort of sweet, nostalgia-producing, alternative rock kind of sweet angst sound that lets you know that this is what youth is all about.<br/><br/>Largeman, wanna-be and somewhat successful/somewhat failed actor out on loan, comes home from the big city to rural New Jersey because his mother has died, unaccountable in a bathtub--which can happen if you are a paraplegic.

Largeman unveils his sidecar mobile--the only thing willed from his grandfather's estate--with its white star on combat green, and tools around town, parties a little and meets quirky Samantha who likes to tell lies as a kind of way to deal with the world. I knew a girl like that, only she only knew when she was lying--if somebody caught her.

","I personally liked the movie Garden State. The movie presents the lives of many people living in this world today. Andrew Largeman, the hero of Garden State is almost catatonic when first we see him (Roger Ebert); the movie starts with a twenty six year old man lying down on his empty room when he hears from his father that his mother has passed away after drowning in the bathtub. After this incident, Andrew Largeman (Zach Braff) goes to his mother's funeral and the next day meets a really nice girl named Sam (Natalie Portman) which he falls in love with.<br/><br/>I am not a fanatic of movies, but this movie presents a story that could be happening right now to many other people. What I like about this movie is that it has both, its comic parts and its dramatic parts. This is a nice story that many people would want to be living after this same incident, having a mother die. After the mothers death, none of Andrews friends mind on how he feels, they just tell him that they should go partying. The movie presents the girl as the hero of Andrew. When Andrew meets Natalie Portman the day after the funeral, she is the only person who treats him with any curiosity, though because of his passivity, still does a lot of hilarious projecting based on her own insecurities. (Adam Lippe) The father is really upset at Andrew for leaving his mother paralyzed from the waist down after pushing her and making her fall on the door of the dish washer. At first Andrew is presented as a kind of drug addict and lonely man. After meeting Sam, Andrew starts to change, he seems to be happier and for the first time he starts to fall in love with a girl.<br/><br/>The thing I least liked about this movie is that it is always the same story, a guy finds a girl, the girl changes his life and they end up being falling in love. Even though the story makes it a good movie, the story was predictable. As soon as I saw Andrew and Sam meeting in the hospital, I knew she would help him overcome the tragedy and they would both end up falling in love. The ending was very predictable because as soon as we see that Andrew just gives the girl a kiss and leaves, this makes us predict that he will come back. This makes the movie a little bit imperfect because a movie is supposed to keep you thinking on what the end is going to be, this forces to keep watching the movie until you get to the end.<br/><br/>Mark (Peter Sasgaard) is a high school buddy of Andrew, who works on burying dead people. At Andrews's mom funeral, he finds his friend Mark and they started chatting, at the end of the day they go to a party and start doing drugs and playing spin the bottle. The last day Andrew is supposed to be in town is very significant. At first, all the wondering around in the store with Mark and Sam, going to the couple that lived in a boat and the kiss on top of the machine has no sense. This makes no connection to the story at first, but ends up being very significant to Andrew after his friend Mark gives him his mom's favorite necklace.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie had its ups and downs. The movie portrays a really nice story that many people would want to be living after having a family member pass away. Having the ending almost predicted could be named as one negative thing for this movie, but in the overall it is good entertaining movie."

","Zach Braff directs and stars in the 2004 dramedy ""Garden State"". The movie follows the story of a a 26-year-old actor/waiter (Braff) who returns to his hometown in New Jersey after his mother dies. First off, for a first-time attempt at directing a film, Zach Braff does an incredible job. I found the majority of this film to be entertaining. One of the best aspects of the film, is its really clever screenplay written, of course, by Braff. It features a lot of real witty and endearing dialogue between characters. Which brings me to another great aspect of the film - the performances. I found pretty much every performance in the film to be very very well done. Braff does a really great job of depicting what a person would be like if they've been taking lithium carbonate for most of their life. I also found Natalie Portman's portrayal of Sam to be adorable. Whenever her and Braff are interacting on screen their chemistry is just palpable. The film also features a very great licensed soundtrack. In the end, I found Zach Braff's ""Garden State"" to be a very intelligent romantic comedy that doubles as a very effective mood piece."

Medicated into numbness, he soon meets the carefree Sam (Natalie Portman) who causes him to re-examine his life.<br/><br/>Granted, the premise is pretty simplistic and the supposed profundity is somewhat tiring but Braff somehow manages to make the film palatable. Despite very little happening plotwise, the script draws us in with deft characterization.<br/><br/>Bringing those characters to life are a cast of capable actors. Braff does a good job, as does Portman, and their chemistry together is considerable. Peter Sarsgaard stands out in support while the rest of the cast is up to snuff as well.<br/><br/>Braff's first-time direction is impressive and features a plethora of attractive visuals. His soundtrack selections drew high praise as well, and rightly so. While one could argue that the selections reek of hipness they nevertheless attest to a discerning ear.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I found ""Garden State"" to be a little insubstantial but I guess it's really a mood piece that harks back to character-driven films of the seventies like ""Five Easy Pieces"". It's entertaining in it's own way but certainly not as profound as Braff intended."
"hall895","8","1","1","11 December 2010"," You can go home again. Can't you?
","Garden State is about Andrew Largeman, a young man who after many years away returns home to rediscover himself. Or maybe discover himself for the first time. On an abundance of psychiatric drugs since childhood Andrew goes through life in an almost catatonic state. He feels nothing. And his life is going nowhere. He lives in California, an actor without much work who makes ends meet by waiting tables. When his mother dies he heads back to New Jersey for her funeral. In Andrew's case home is definitely not where the heart is. We will soon see that there are very good reasons he has cut himself off from his home life, from the world he once knew and has no desire to return to. But a funny thing happens. Off his meds for the first time in ages Andrew's world begins to open up. He's feeling things again. Home begins to feel like home, but not because of his family or friends. It is a girl he has just met who changes everything, who opens Andrew up to the possibilities of finally finding out who he really is and living a life all his own.<br/><br/>This is a coming of age story with great charm and the most credit for that of course goes to Zach Braff. This movie is his baby, he's the writer, the director, the star. As a writer he plotted out a great story. As a director he framed that story beautifully. And as a star he brings to life an incredibly compelling character. Andrew Largeman has never really had a life to speak of but when he returns home everything changes in a matter of days. And Braff wonderfully captures the feeling as Andrew takes his tentative first steps out into the world. Braff is certainly helped by the fact he has a wonderful performer to play off of in Natalie Portman. She plays Sam, the quirky girl who changes Andrew's life. Andrew falls for her immediately and why wouldn't he? She's the type of girl who once you get a hold of you never want to let her go. But will Andrew allow himself to embrace the possibilities presented by this new relationship? Or has he been scarred too much to ever really love at all?<br/><br/>All in all Garden State is a thoroughly enjoyable movie. It's fascinating to watch Andrew try to finally construct a little life for himself. It's emotional as you watch him try to come to grips with his past. And it's heartwarming as you watch him begin to love this young woman who comes out of nowhere to change his life. Braff is very good in playing Andrew but it's Portman who is really the scene-stealer. Sam is a strange young girl, a compulsive liar who somehow is still relentlessly charming. And at least she admits she's a liar and apologizes for it. Sam is vulnerable, she just chooses to protect herself in a different way than others might. Portman captures all this girl's myriad quirks beautifully and creates a truly memorable character. Braff plays off of her and the chemistry between the pair is probably more than anything else what really makes the movie work. At its heart the movie has that great coming of age story. And Braff shoots the film beautifully, a visual love letter to his home state. The collection of songs Braff chose to use in the film fit so well, the soundtrack ultimately picking up a Grammy Award and serving as the final perfectly fitted piece to a very well-constructed film. In the end Garden State is a charming, entertaining and thoroughly satisfying film."

When I looked up this movie and saw that Mr. Braff not only starred in the picture, but also wrote and directed it, lets just say I had doubts about whether I would go see it or not. I went anyway. Not only did I thoroughly enjoy the story, but I was extremely moved by Mr. Braff and Ms. Portman's performances.<br/><br/>I strongly recommend this movie to anyone who only has one foot in the large pool of indie films and can't decide to jump in or not.This film will make you want to swan dive in with a splash!"

","This is probably the best movie I have seen in the last 2-3 years and I see almost a movie a week. Zach Braff has an amazing directorial eye and his story telling ability is fantastic. This movie has only been shown in art house theaters here and I think that it really should open wide. The scene where Largeman and Sam are in the bathtub is one of the most moving scenes I have ever witnessed. The soundtrack is superb and fits perfectly with the movie ... there is not one thing I did not like about this movie. It is definitely a must see. Go to it NOW. Are you still reading this? Get in your car NOW and get to a theatre! It really is that good. <br/><br/>By the way ... why is Natalie Portman's character Sam so low on the credit of this movie on IMDb? She should be second on the bill ..."

","First, this film is the second film that really reminds me of my girlfriend Annie. Annie can you guess the other movie? Inside jokes aside.. Very few films really surprise me anymore. This film was the second film in the last few years that really got me thinking about all I have to be thankful for and all that I have to lose, if I don't recognize these people's importantance in my life and tell them what they mean to me then I could see a chance to create a lasting and meaningful relationship.<br/><br/>I know what you guys are thinking, ""Dude its just a movie.."" but great films have the power to open your eyes to what you have, what have to lose, and these great films tell you to value everyday and your lovedones. In case anyone is wondering the other film to blow my mind in the last couple of years was the critically mixed viewed Cameron Crowe masterpiece ""Vanilla Sky"". Braff has definite talent. This film should the Oscar attention that monster got. I am calling for another rise of the independent film at the Oscars; the likes of which the film-going public hasn't seen since ""Boys Don't Cry""! Again Braff has talent that should not be over looked."

","This movie could give you a new attitude. It's immaculate. Beautifully written and shot, with one of if not the best soundtracks I myself has heard in a long, long time. You feel you can relate to the situations in the film, but at the same time it still has that magical, fantasy element that you just can't put your finger on. It feels real but at the same time, it doesn't. And i challenge any girl watching not to fall head over heels for Zach Braff, and I challenge any guy to say they wouldn't die for Natalie Portman. The talent in this movie is absolutely staggering, it's just mind blowing. All in all, on a scale from 1-10 it gets an 11. To me, it's perfect."

","This movie touched my heart. I fell in love with it within the first 15 minutes. Zach Braff did an amazing job writing it. Natalie Portman was great. The plot was brilliantly hilarious. The hidden philosophies Braff slipped into the script were brilliantly placed. I just can't express in words how much I love this movie. If you love artistic movies that make you think, you'll enjoy Garden State. Much like a musical artist gets a standing ovation after putting on a great performance, so did this movie. I think a majority of movies out there today are pure crap anyway, but seriously Garden State was a nice change. 10 out of 10!"

","Hahaha... Oh dear... Sorry, but ever since I had seen Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind in theaters and saw the previews for Garden State, I had been waiting anxiously to see it. Zack Braff= young, realistic, artistic, intelligent. Natalie Portman did an awesome job capturing this character and bringing her to life. She was very convincing; Why? Well, for starters, my boyfriend claims I remind him of her. So it's not like this character wasn't life-like. Not every character in a film has to be exactly what you look for in a friend, wife, mother, whatever. Not everyone appeals to everyone (thank god). The whole movie was based on personal situations lived by ordinary people who have strangely fascinating traits that are sadly becoming more rare everyday. And what's even more sad about it, there are critics who looked down upon this. Closed-minded people suck. :) We have a man who ran away from his difficult past, returning home for his mother's funeral, and a passionate, young woman with problems of her own. They help each other out (whether they realized it or not) throughout the entire film. I thought it was genius---the whole process. You were convinced by the end of the film that these two young adults found what they'de been secretly searching for their entire lives-a feeling of love and completion. If you have found your true soul-mate, and you both share odd (yet awesome) experiences, this movie seemed to speak directly to you. It was a very touching movie, and anyone that disagrees, is obviously lacking that feeling you get when you share those similar experiences with a person who still gives you butterflies when you kiss. A beautiful film-- all the random scenes and very real characters made me realize people such as Zach Braff still possess artistic minds that we hardly see anymore--especially with movies in which the characters and audience are among the young adult crowd. It's so refreshing to get a break from movies like ""You Got Served"" and ""Scary Movie"". I loved this film, and so did everyone else I've talked to about it."

","Garden State is an intimate commentary on life that will reach deep into your emotions. The film is honest and real, answering questions we all ponder. Zach Braff places amid a bizarre world the most universal of themes. With stunning performances, including surprising strength from Natalie Portman, Garden State is the best movie this year.<br/><br/>First appearances can be deceiving as the movie takes some time to gather momentum. Yet in full force you can't help but be grabbed by the unconventional and artistic style of film-making.

Sam (Natalie Portman) is<br/><br/>perfectly dazzling, reminiscent of the free-spirited yet fragile, naive<br/><br/>girl everyone knows.

","Zach Braff is one talented dude. This little film is a tour de force in the independent film industry, and rightfully so. The characters, the story, and the directing style of Zach Braff make this motion picture a gem to watch. The perfect blend of drama and comedy really is the secret to the success of this film, in addition to the brilliant performance by Natalie Portman, Zach Braff, and Peter Sarsgaard. Jean Smart as earns an honorable mention for making me laugh uncontrollably with her wit and dedication to her part. Being a native New Jersian, I loved the film and am proud that it is named after my home state.

However I can honestly say this was the best movie I have seen in a long long time. The camera work is flawless, the music choice amazing, and the acting took my breath away. How someone could actually criticize this movie is beyond me. I found Braffs directing brilliant and the way he interacted with Portman seemed so natural like they could be a real couple. This movie was heartfelt I have seen it twice and cried both times. Peter Sarsgaard's acting was pleasantly surprising and I cannot wait until he appears in more movies. I now see Zach Braff in a totally different view, with much more respect, and I have always loved him in Scrubs, but in a totally different way.

","After months of watching summer drivel, ""Garden State"" finally offered a reason to shamble off to the movies again.<br/><br/>This is a great little film. Don't let the curmudgeons convince you otherwise. It might remind moviegoers of Lost in Translation, but that's a second rate<br/><br/>compliment. The shots of characters who aren't doing anything dynamic is<br/><br/>reminiscent of Sofia Coppola's affinity for showing characters being, well,<br/><br/>human, not talking incessently or moving about like wind up toys. Braff makes us look at people long, hard and without blinking. His characters are human and flawed and attractive and ugly all at once. His movie is funny and sad and joyful and depressing by turns. <br/><br/>Like I said, this is a great little movie."

Braff goes back to his HS friends and they're all drowning away their pains with drugs, and then his story of doing legal drugs to numb his personal pain, anyway, the film is about how pain and love are natural and must be felt. <br/><br/>Feeling is the meaning of life."

"nikeswim17","10","1","1","9 September 2004"," Everything I hoped it would be...
","After tuning into the brilliance of NBC's ""Scrubs"" for the past few seasons, I was immediately thrilled to see that ""Scrubs"" frontman, Zach Braff, was writing, directing and starring the movie Garden State.<br/><br/>The movie is based on Andrew Largeman's (Braff) journey from his numbing life as an actor/waiter in Los Angeles to his home in New Jersey for his mother's funeral. Upon arrival, he is thrown into a surreal world full of surreal characters, both those from his childhood and also those he meets for the first time. But it his relationship with Sam (Natalie Portman) that shakes his reality and causes him to question the state of his life.<br/><br/>A quirky mix of drama and comedy, Garden State is an unexpected indie gem of a movie. Everything about this movie--from the performances of Braff and Portman, to the cinematography, story and soundtrack--is presented in a delightfully fresh and edgy way. The meaning is outstandingly subtle, stark, and highlighted by the understated simplicity of human emotion. But perhaps Garden State's best facet is capturing all this (a kind of ""who am I?"" ambiance) without getting caught up in a formulaic plot line. The movie is not without flaws, but I was so happy with the breath of fresh air Garden State provided, in a cinematic world full of grade-C movies, that I hardly noticed.<br/><br/>Zach Braff is truly a new rising star to watch, breaking out into cinema with the grace and talent of a true pro. See this movie with friends, on a date, by yourself, just see it. It may well be in my top ten."
"jd2461a","10","1","1","7 September 2004"," Beautiful, melancholy quarter-life crisis
","Zach Braff. Who knew? He not only wrote and directed this well-crafted picture, but his performance is a layered, nuanced picture of pain, anger, and eventually hope. This movie is marvelous. It perfectly captures the feeling of coming home in your mid-twenties and having it both be home and not home at the same time. The angst of the twenty-something isn't anything new, but where Garden State rises above its peers is in its truthfulness. My friends and I left the theater commenting that we can't remember having seen a movie this ""real"" in quite a while. And that's saying quite a lot for a movie that introduces a character with her waving around a dead hamster. Garden State deftly balances the absurd and the comic with the melancholic and heartbreaking. The cinematography and direction were both excellent and the soundtrack was the perfect accompaniment. And yes, contrary to some opinions, you are supposed to laugh, because sometimes the ridiculousness of life really does catch up to you. No, it doesn't follow a traditional three-act structure, and no, you won't have answers to all your questions, and in the end it adds to the movie's authenticity. In the great disaffected tradition of the Graduate, Harold and Maude, and Lost in Translation, we have a romantic little story about returning home for a weekend that will stay with you long after you see it."
"Havok311","10","1","1","7 September 2004"," A rare triple whammy by Zach Braff
","Very rare do you see a movie written by, directed by, and starring one man, that has any quality at all. However, Garden State is a stunning exception. Braff plays the main character, Andrew who comes back for his mother's funeral. He runs into some people from his past, and meets a most unusual woman, Sam (Portman). This film is full of memorable scenes, and I simply can not do them justice. All I can say is that I registered on IMDb just to praise this movie. It should be seen by everyone at least once, but especially those who are, like me, at the crossroads of life like Andrew (ie people between like 16-25). I give this movie 10 out of 10, because it has comedy, heart, and several very memorable scenes that, in my opinion, are what cinema is all about."

Portman is quirky and sensual in a role that parallels Kate Winslet's character Clementine from Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind minus the whole hair thing. If this movie doesn't leave a lump in your throat then there is something wrong with you. Again i draw the comparison to Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, in the helplessness the characters feel towards their plight. Maybe it was because of the fact that i felt the attachment to Braff's character since i'm leaving for college but this film really moved me. See this movie!"

This movie was incredible it had it all comedy lots of it, romance, and drama. I'm from this little town in New Jersey thats about 1 mile long and I thought nothing could ever happen in it, or it's to boring but what Zach Braff made me realize from this film is that the adventure awaits you, you just have to go out and find it.

It's subtle sarcasm and wit are perfectly placed throughout the film, bringing in many laugh out loud moments.<br/><br/>What it manages to capture though is the true gift: the real life aspects of comedy, disappointment, taking chances, fear, etc., are all so flawlessly blended together that the movie's pace is extremely natural and relaxing. Very rarely can a movie go from making you laugh out loud to feeling the tears come out with the character themselves so smoothly and realistically, but this movie manages to do that. 10/10"

I was surprised to then reflect on the film and find that it really went above my expectations. I really did not expect it to be that funny either. I saw it opening day for us here in Chicago, and then again the next day. It unfortunately started in only 4 theaters here and we had to drive an hour to see it. It ended up being moved from the Art House side of a theater to another larger auditorium. I can tell you from working in a theater that this is because it was selling out, as it did again that Sat. night. <br/><br/>I really love Scrubs. Zach Braff is hilarious, but I did not expect to laugh as much as I did in ""Garden State."" It's touching moments, were also, very captivating. I don't know if I can view Zach the same any more. I imagine watching Scrubs all the same this year, but I respect the man's vision and talent so much more now. Incredible!<br/><br/>I would highly recommend ""Garden State,"" to any one.

If you've ever questioned your life, whether you're in the right place or doing what you're meant to, I think you'll really enjoy this. <br/><br/>Having grown up in jersey I may be biased towards this film, but the strangest thing about the movie is the title.

"james_bond_23602","10","1","1","20 August 2004"," Almost Unbelievable!!!
","The Night I saw this was one of the most bitter sweet of my life.  Two friends and myself decided to head out to the movies to see ""Open Water"" and ""Garden State.""  After sitting through one of the most painful cinematic experiences of my life (Open Water) my night felt a little ruined.  Up next was Garden State, which I still held high hopes for.  And I must say, my night was brought back on track after the first frame of this film. I have been a fan of Zach Braff since season 1 of Scrubs started.  His character was always extremly interesting and well-acted.  The idea of him directing and acting in his own film seemed like too good of a deal to pass up.  While his character is in some ways like J.D. on Scrubs, it was excellent to see him in a role that is not constrained to the limits on television. Alas, he is by no means the only reason to see this film.  In my opinion, this is Natalie Portman's shining moment, and it is here that one can finally realize, despite what the Star Wars films may lead you to believe, she is a spectacular actress. Ian Holm, although in a short role, is as equally brilliant, and just a little heartbreaking as well. The story is superb.  The mixture of heartbreaking drama, and touches of black humor throughout, is enough to make you want to laugh and cry at the same time.  If you put together a cast of infinitely talented actors, a wonderful story, great dialogue, and throw in a stellar soundtrack, you have ""Garden State"", truly one of the most enjoyable movie going experiences of my life."
"jlv0047","10","1","1","23 July 2004"," Fantastic. A great film in a summer of dull.
","I've never done this before, but here it goes.<br/><br/>I saw this film Thursday July 22, 2004 at the Magnolia Theatre in Dallas and it was wonderful. The story was a great envelopment of what it is to really be a 20 something year old when they come home. Braff's humor in the film and yet awkward seriousness makes the film so heart warming that you just have to fall in love with it. The 35 mm film it was shot in makes the world feel large for ""Large"" in the film and really makes you want to be with him for these 4 days the film goes through.<br/><br/>The acting was very good for someone who is directing himself at the same time. Mr. Braff also does a wonderful job on keeping long takes on his actors when they give performances so you know it really is them acting and not the editing room making something for us. Ian holm makes some great use of his short time on screen as does the rest of the cast.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is what really sets this film above the bar. The unknown and known artists on this film are used so well in the film's context that they enhance the film rather than just add names to the movie. This was a most though considering there was next to no budget for the music.<br/><br/>However, when I saw the film there was a Q&A session afterwards with director/writer/actor Zach Braff and it was fantastic to hear his stories on making this film. Should this be read by Mr. Braff, thank you for coming to Texas and showing us your film.<br/><br/>The only other film I've seen this year that I think is great has been Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and I'm glad to see there is at least one other GREAT movie this year."

","This is a must-see for anyone who enjoys thoughtful, touching, funny and uplifting movies. I went to an advanced screening last night and was able to see Zach Braff afterward and listen to him talk about his process with this movie, both creatively and in terms of actually getting it made and in theaters. He is incredibly talented and dedicated to this film. GO SEE THIS MOVIE! You will not regret it. The entire cast--Braff's dream cast come true--is phenomenal. In particular, Natalie Portman is completely charming and natural as Sam. This movie deserves serious award consideration, as well as as many people to see it as possible. It is being released only in certain markets, but you owe it to yourself to find it!"

","For those of you who often ponder life's meaning-and yet still love to have a good laugh-this is a film you'll definitely enjoy. In the business, accurately portraying real human emotions is one of the most difficult obstacles for writers, directors, and actors to overcome, and yet Garden State delivers with a realistic story we can all relate to. For a young writer like Zach Braff with only 2 million on the budget and 25 days to film, this is quite a feat. Additionally, Braff and Natalie Portman's charisma is brilliant on screen, and their relationship is beautiful to watch. Accepting the past, living in the moment, and following your heart-all valuable reminders from a little film with a bright soul."

It's this beautifully written and directed journey of a guy who goes home (to New Jersey) for his mother's funeral and his true awakening to life.<br/><br/>You have got to see this movie - it is supposed to open on 7/30 (against The Village and The Manchurian Candidate, ugh...not cool). The teaser trailer is up on the website and it is well worth a look.<br/><br/>This is the best writing I have seen in a long time and Zach deserves a nod for this in January. Also, the music was poignant and did not interfere with the story telling in the least.

The last time I was even close to being this excited for a movie was Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, which I now can say is one of my favorites, if not my favorite movie. Zach Braff wrote, directed, and starred in this movie and I think it looks as though he did an excellent job for all of the above. Natalie Portman looks as if she plays a good part too, and the general storyline seems amazing. A drama with comedy and a love story on the side.

The characters are real, the story is true and believable, and the acting/casting is incredible.  I have never seen Scrubs, but was very impressed not only with Zach's acting, but obviously with his natural ability to put an idea on paper and follow through until final production of what I consider a masterpiece.<br/><br/>I asked Zach at Sundance about the casting and he told me he always envisioned ""someone like Natalie Portman to play the role of Sam"".  The fact that he managed to get her can be best described as a coup, but more importantly speaks to the heart of the matter, that being that the movie is truly special.

","Obviously inspired by The Graduate, Say Anything, and countless other coming of age films, Garden State is a pretentious and amateurish disappointment.<br/><br/>On the plus side, the soundtrack is perfect, and the cinematography is absolutely lovely. Some of the performances work. Zach Braff is an appealing sort of every guy -- nice, quirky, not too quirky. Peter Sarsgaard is excellent as always, giving depth and meaning to a character even when the script is weak.<br/><br/>On the negative side, the dialog is embarrassingly bad, and some of the scenes (the one involving the hotel comes to mind) seem like they belong in another film. Natalie Portman, whom I usually love, is annoying, although I'm not sure if the script might be more to blame than her. The great Ian Holm is completely wasted."

","I was really looking forward to seeing this film. I had heard great things about it and noticed its good rating of 8/10 here on IMDb. I'm not an avid movie watcher but I enjoy a good film and watching new movies. To be honest I could not get into this film. Maybe I didn't give it a fair shot... I stopped watching after 45 minutes. The opening airplane scene drew me in but after that it just went downhill for me. Like I said, I never finished the movie, so don't take my comment as a guideline that tells you Garden State is awful. All I can say for sure is that it has a slow beginning. I'm normally good with finishing movies I start but sometimes I can just tell that a movie is not my style within the first few minutes. I had that feeling about this film about 5 minutes in, but I wanted to see if it got better, especially after all the praise its received. After half the movie was over though and I still wasn't drawn in, I had to turn it off. I guess I'll never understand why this movie is so generally loved."

Natalie Portman's performance is great (Nobody doubts it), but unfortunately, is not enough to save the ship. As a comedy, you can hardly smile and as a romance or drama; the boring feeling don't let you experience any other kind of feeling. I know weird or rare movies exist, and I don't doubt there is some kind of people that like this kind of movies, but my comment is for all the others that love the movies that make you feel different kind of feelings, from the laughter till the crying experience. Garden State from the beginning till the end is terrible boring, you can hardly follow the sequence with real interest. If you have something else to do besides watching Garden State... Do it!!

","Advice to any one who wants to see it, Don't. Under no circumstances should anyone have to suffer this pathetic excuse for film. See, the director says to himself, ""Instead of doing a good story and having meaningful and well-thought out characters, I'm going to make them all neurotic and QUIRKY!!!!"" It was like watching a sick hybrid of Ben Stiller, Will Ferrell, Dana Carvey and Adam Sandler all rolled together in one disturbing and unfunny hydra of stupidity. The characters ranged from an epileptic Natalie Portman who has a home filled with hamster cages, a relative that makes a shirt out of the same pattern as the wallpaper, people living in an abandoned boat, some young kid with Desert Storm trading cards and bitches about losing his Wolf Blitzer and a fellow who works at a Medieval Times who walks in while the main character/director/writer is recovering from a heavy night of drugs. Also, we can't forget the man who made a fortune by creating silent Velcro. Then there's the ""original"" acts of randomness which means someone flailing around and making animal sounds. Now I understand that many of the critics have been hailing this as an indie masterpiece but if you think about that for a moment. I believe it was Kyle from South Park who said it best in regards to indie films: ""It's just a bunch of gay cowboys eating pudding!!"" Another thing was that the director was attempting to make us feel sorry for these character that are so unrealistic that one probably couldn't even find these nuts in a sanatorium. Especially when Portman carries around a Dixie cup to catch tears that Andrew (Zach Braff, the director) will eventually shed, That's right, she's holding on to that cup so that when Andy cries, she can be there to catch them. I'm off to drown this out. Do you think Strangelove would kill this visual disembowelment?"

""Bruno Getz should be nominated for the academy award!"" screams CSB-TV Chicago on the back cover of the DVD. He should be run over by a herd of rhino. Lacking everything that makes a film good, including story, this film sucks. Showing no emotion at all at his mothers death (he's apparently on lithium, so no need to act 'emotion'), Bruno Getz returns to New Jersey whereupon he happens upon some stoner friends at his mothers funeral and agrees to 'go to a house' and party. With the usual laconic, confused look he has all the way through the movie we see glamourisation of drugs, and still no emotion over his mothers death. Even his dad didn't seem that bothered. His mothers death for Christ's sake! Being on lithium obviously accounted for his sleepwalking performance too. All he was concerned about was his headaches, and the death of his mother is glossed over within minutes. He goes to a doctors waiting room that is empty, and a blind woman's dog tries to ride his leg..how hilarious. So we are introduced to the 'kooky' (irritating beyond belief) Natalie Portman, who of course goes over to him and keeps on bumping into him and blah blah blah I couldn't wait to get this tripe out of my DVD player after 40 minutes.

","Although admirably done on a tiny (these days) budget, writer/producer/star/driver/ coffeeserver Braff tries to jam too much into this story of (eventually) a search for love, and the movie as a whole suffers for it.<br/><br/>Braff complains (commentary from deleted scenes) of having to remove important scenes for time, but the ones he leaves in are pointlessly flakey -- it's as if he couldn't decide if he wanted a quirky movie (and that's all), or a story of love lost and found, and so he got half of each. He also spends far too much time with useless characters, apparently believing that the audience won't sit still without a goofy scene moment every so often -- it's the only reason I can see for any of the scenes in the walmart-clone, for instance.<br/><br/>It's a shame, really. Hidden inside scenes with Largeman's endlessly goofy (to no real purpose) friends is a great story of him, his father, his mother, and Sam. I wish above all that Braff had had enough confidence in that central story to just tell that -- it might be that he didn't think his writing skills were up to the task (because the dialogue is pretty flat), and so put in goofy-character distractions (and occasional unnecessary camera tricks) in hopes that we wouldn't notice. <br/><br/>Braff's got real potential as a storyteller, but this is really a training film. I think his future work will be of great value. . ."
"BobsBrotherFutureman","1","4","9","17 December 2004"," Classy? Subtle? Poignant?
","I credit Natalie Portman for being extremely talented but unfortunately, she has given two good performances this year in uneven movies. <br/><br/>Garden State is not a 'bad' movie, please do not get me wrong. Natalie Portman absolutely shines in it, but it is also an empty, narcassistic film not worthy of comments like ""defines a generation"" and ""beautifully crafted."" It does not fail to entertain and it is nice and fluffy. Although I do not know if that is necessarily complementary.<br/><br/>This movie is a great outlet for Zach Braff to show how much of an ego he has. He is NOT a very good actor nor is he a writer. He borrows a lot from ""The Graduate"" and in return produces a very similar film for the typical ""misunderstood"" indie teen crowd. <br/><br/>The film has been called ""quirky"" far too often. Okay, ill give it that. But a lot of style and no substance do not make a movie. It appears that Braff has taken directing lessons from Wes Anderson, PT Anderson, Alexander Payne and Todd Schlondz but fell asleep during their screen writing seminar. The scene in the end where Largeman gives his speech to his father about ""this being life"" is so badly written and tries so hard to be down to earth that it has the ability to destroy the movie, had it been good up to this point. <br/><br/>There are things about the film I did enjoy. I liked the scene in Sams bedroom where she talks about doing something no one has ever done before. I liked the scene where Peter Sarrsgard takes Sam and Largeman to get his mothers necklace back. If only the entire thing had been that well-written.<br/><br/>So see this movie for good performances from Peter Sarrsgard and Natalie Portman. Don't see it thinking its going to ""define your generation"" or you are ""totally going to relate with it."" And if your looking for quirky film-making, stick with Wes Anderson, someone who actually does have talent."

","Unfortunately I didn't see ""Garden State"" until it was out on DVD and I'd heard how great a movie it was. Perhaps I wouldn't have been as disappointed had I gone into it with few expectations. However, I have never walked away from a movie where I felt that there was more of an illusion of substance compared to what really existed. I felt like I was trying to be manipulated into thinking that I was experiencing something powerful and deep, when in reality there was no substance to the characters or their relationships to each other. Everything seemed way overdone (I just couldn't buy into the drug scenes and ""hopeless lives"" of some of the characters--they just weren't real enough to me), and the circumstances of the main characters' first kiss was simply laughable. The movie left me questioning why I should feel anything for a story and characters that were so shallow (but that the writer, actors, director, producers, and myriad fans thought were really deep). It could have been so much more--some of the ideas that the story tried to flesh out could have added some real meat to the experience (instead I felt like I'd eaten a rice cake). The only aspect (not even a full scene) that was handled well was when the grave-robber handed over the main character's mother's jewelry--there was something more real about that exchange than anything else in the film. It has been over 2 years since I saw the movie, and I do not recall the character's names (and don't have a desire to ever see it again). However, ""Garden State"" was not a complete waste of time for me, as it helped to provide a term for movies that have an illusion of substance--one that I've used to describe other movies that appear to have a depth that isn't really there. Indeed, while ""Garden State"" is not by far the worst movie I've ever seen, it is perhaps the epitome of an ""Empty Calorie"" movie."

He receives a phone call from is dad and his dad tells him his mother has died. So Andrew has to come home back to Jersey for the funeral and decides to take a holiday from the antidepressants to see what his life would be like without them.<br/><br/>This story is genius in my opinion. And what makes film great to watch is the great characters played by Zach Braff (he also wrote and directed it)and Natalie Portman and Peter Sarsgaard and many other great characters who dot have such as big roles.<br/><br/>I do recommend to watch this film especially if you are a fan of Zach Braff because he wrote and directed the film and last but not least starred in it as well."
"maz139","10","3","6","23 January 2006"," Changed my life!
","Before I start to describe why this is now my favorite movie, I would like to say that Zach Braff has created a story nothing short of brilliant. He has been able to create characters that anyone can relate to. There are no flaws! The story starts with a man in his 20's living in LA named Andrew Largeman (Braff) discovering that his paraplegic(in a wheelchair) mother has just drowned in the bathtub of his parent's New Jersey home.<br/><br/>Now, he has flown to New Jersey to attend his funeral only to find himself emotionally numb. After the funeral, he meets his deadbeat high school friend Mark (Peter Sarsgaard) who invites him to a party.<br/><br/>At the party, Andrew finds himself completely surrounded by these drug addict friends he has and feels very lonely and uncomfortable The next day, Andrew wakes up in Mark's home. He has a very awkward breakfast with Mark, his mother, and a man who works as a knight at Medieval Times and dates Mark's Mom. Mark is infuriated and makes the new man leave the house. After the meal, Andrew, Mark, and his mother are sitting in a very sloppy room talking about Mark's lack of applying himself. Mark later tells Andrew about his want to not be rushed by anyone.<br/><br/>Andrew then goes to a doctor to get his 'lightning' headaches checked. This is where he meets Sam(Natalie Portman), a young woman who offers Andrew advice on getting a dog off of his leg. Andrew immediately likes the free-spirited girl. When he finishes his appointment, Sam is waiting outside to ask him for a ride.<br/><br/>When they arrive at Sam's home, she invites him in and tells him of her family and why she feels so comfortable at home. They go into a (rather large) pet cemetery that Sam has and bury her hamster. Andrew tells Sam about his dead mother, leaving Sam sorry for putting him in another funeral.<br/><br/>Now on Sam and Andrew's first date, they go out to a bar and tell each other about their perspective on the pains in life. Mark walks into the bar and invites them to a party at his rich friend's house.<br/><br/>When they are there, Andrew tells Sam about what he believes home really is(a bunch of people who miss the same imaginary place).<br/><br/>Later that night, Andrew reveals that it is his fault for his mother being in the wheelchair. He says that he pushed her because she was never happy and the broken dishwasher latch allowed the door to open and his mom to fall and become paralyzed.<br/><br/>The next morning, Mark takes Andrew and Sam to find Andrew's going-away present. After a trio of odd events, Andrew begins to realize the importance of living life happily.<br/><br/>Now, ready to go back to LA, Andrew goes to the airport with a grieving Sam. When he boards the plain, he,for the first time in his life, does something spontaneous and stays in New Jersey with Sam.<br/><br/>The End Many people think I am to young to respond to this movie at 13, but I think it is only a state of mind you need to take this movie as a life changer.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie is unbelievable. Zach Braff trying drama has succeeded in acting through his transformation. Natalie Portman( in just one more of her unforgettable roles) is amazing at knowing how to handle life, despite its problems. Peter Sarsgaard is great at acting and still shows it by not wanting his life to change and for him just to be able to remain the same. He is very serious about everything involved in his life, but still has a sense of humor about it. And finally I would like to note Ian Holm's stunning performance as Andrew's father just trying to make everyone happy.<br/><br/>I will always remember Zach Braff's witty and amazing writing, direction, and acting in this film. It is perfect.<br/><br/>P.S. Zach Braff also chose all of the songs in the movie and showed that he can pick the perfect tone to use for each scene."

If you're the sort of bookish, sensitive lad who wears goofy looking sweaters and glasses, is petrified of women, and likes to act as if he has very refined, intellectual taste in the arts even though he knows nothing about them, and likes wussy, sensitive-boy music like the Postal Service, Death Cab for Cutie, et al, then this might be the film for you. I'm offended by the fact that as a 20-something male, when I'm presented with this piece of garbage, I'm expected to identify with it and relate to it. It's an insult to my intelligence. And what's up with everyone thinking Natalie Portman is some kind of goddess? Anyway, if you fit the above description, or are the kind of librarianesque girl that guy would end up dating, and you have a really lame sense of humor and like films and books that present themselves as witty and insightful even though they are not, then watch this immediately. If you're anything like me, you'd sooner lick, from top to bottom, a week-old, dried-out, corn-encrusted, foot-long, piece of excrement from the ass of the world's fattest, sweatiest, most repulsive, disgusting man with the hairiest ass in the world than ever even think of watching this film again."
"bastard_wisher","5","3","6","19 December 2004"," Overrated
","Now, i don't think ""Garden State"" is a terrible film. It's actually not bad. But to me it just felt very 'forced' and contrived/convoluted/you get the idea, like the filmmakers were 'trying' way too hard. I mean, on a surface level i liked it, but it felt sort of phony and unnatural. Also, it blows my mind that this film is got such rave reviews and overwhelming fan response, but the very similar (and in my opinion better) film from a few years ago ""All the Real Girls"" got rather lukewarm reviews and no overwhelming word-of-mouth. It's really a crime, because whereas ""Garden State"" felt overreaching and sort of manipulative, ""All the Real Girls"" felt totally natural and organic. To put it bluntly, ""All the Real Girld"" was everything ""Garden State"" wanted to be. Almost to an uneasy extent, i find. Whereas that film was romantic and moving and funny all at the same time, moving effortlessly between moods, i found ""Garden State"" a bit schizophrenic, jerking uneasily between out-of-place and often unfunny humor, and overwrought melodrama. Overall though, i think my biggest problem with it is that to me it felt very calculated. That's the best word i can think of to describe it. Also, it didn't help that the story seemed to lack any true dramatics. The only obstacle getting in the way of the protagonist's unfalteringly upward blissed-out self-discovery trip was his dad, who is easily brushed aside until, towards the end of the film, we're treated to a rather half-assed condemnation. Also, the film had what must be the stupidest, most badly-done drug sequence i think i've ever seen. I know, after all this, that it's hard for someone reading this to believe that i actually enjoyed this film, but i did. In a weird way i did. After leaving the theater i felt good, probably in the same way that a lobotomy feels good. That may sound like an insult, but it's really not. It was as if ""Garden State"" was a film that contained all the right elements, had all the right pieces, but somehow ended up being just a little too perfect, to the point that it felt uncomfortably pre-meditated. Don't get me wrong, if the film had come out five years ago it would have probably been the greatest thing i'd ever seen, but in this post-""American Beauty"", post-""Donnie Darko"" world, i'm just a little bit too familiar with this kind of thing to be able to swallow it all over again in regurgitated form."

","Like many of you, I too disliked this movie. People assure me that it's funny and poignant so I guess there's just something wrong with me. Why don't they make good films anymore? Like Regarding Henry and Diggstown.<br/><br/>Although there have been some okay films over the past 10-15 years I can't remember what it feels like to be completely drawn in to the characters and their world. To care for them. To feel their pain and their joy.<br/><br/>Every so often I film comes along like Garden State and I get my hopes up. I imagine how great it's going to be but all it turns out to be is people talking talking really slowly about stuff that isn't very interesting. I cannot think of one positive thing to say about this movie."

","It's been a long time since I've seriously thought about walking out in the middle of a movie, but with this film I can mighty close. Instead, I dozed off for a while. There is nothing interesting, novel, imaginative or deep about this movie. It tries very, very hard to be lovable, but succeeds only in being annoying. The plot, such as it is, seems like it was made up by a bunch of college kids sitting around stoned, and the dialogue sounds like it was written on the back of an envelope. Zach Braff looks like he's on a heavy dose of Quaaludes for the entire movie, and pretty much everyone else looks like they forgot to take their Prozac. Worst of all, there was nothing funny about this movie--it's mostly sappy and boring. I thought I had seen the worst movie of the year last week when I saw ""Exorcist: The Beginning"" but I found myself longing to be back watching that movie, which at least had some interesting special effects. Miss this movie at all costs."
"WDD","Null","3","6","27 August 2004"," What film was I watching? (Some Spoilers)
","Having been prompted to see this film by the multitude of gushing reviews on this very website by fellow users, I figured I was in for something of a treat. Like most of my twenty and thirty-something peers, I've been typically underwhelmed with this summer's palette of cinematic offerings -mostly monster and lame action flicks -none of which offered up anything remotely interesting, stimulating, or entertaining.<br/><br/>How sad then that ""Garden State' should also fall into this category.<br/><br/>I went to this film expecting a strong independent vision with a fresh perspective and captivating characters and storyline. What I received was the most clichéd of clichéd plot lines (dude's mom dies, has to return home to make good with estranged daddy and meets fab chick along the way), an unintentionally arrogant character stance in Zach (this guy annoyed the heck out of me with his pompous dialogue and solipsistic mannerisms), dialog that sounds like it was lifted from first year philosophy class (and NOT a single line rang true for me, even from my buddies who took philosophy), and the lamest visual sight gags to establish how quirky and unique this film's world is -such as the humping dog, dead hamster, old motorcycle with sidecar, Vietnamese restaurant with face paint, houseboat in a canyon, etc... etc ... etc <br/><br/>What an immense letdown. I couldn't help wondering if it was just me? I mean, this film has received unilateral praise everywhere and I'm a fan of intelligent and captivating cinema. But this film not only left me cold but I actively disliked it. It p***ed me off and frankly, I'd like my money back. Check out Napoleon Dynamite which is a much more entertaining and solidly constructed piece of work than this pretentious piece of wonder fluff.<br/><br/>I don't care what everyone is saying. This movie SUCKED!"
"ArizWldcat","6","3","6","27 August 2004"," Pretty good, with some reservations...
","I wanted to see this at Sundance, but it was hard to get in to see this one. So it's been about 8 months that I've waited to see it...I tried not to have too high expectations, because usually when I really think a movie's going to be great, it ends up letting me down.  I will say that I wasn't let down, and I enjoyed the story and the acting.  It was a little hard to take Zach Braff seriously as I love him in ""Scrubs""...but all I have to do is see his face and we start giggling.  Every once in a while in this film, I saw ""JD"" instead of Large. But he did a great job in this film, as did Natalie Portman. <br/><br/> I don't want to go into too much detail, but I thought the movie was much too long. For example (POSSIBLE SPOILER) the party scene toward the beginning of the movie was a little too long and depressing.  I got RIGHT AWAY that Large (the main character) was detached and not feeling anything. I'm not sure why the extended ""drug use/spin the bottle/wild sex/anything goes"" scene was needed...to me it just dragged.  As the movie progressed, it was interesting to watch Large become more and more aware, to ""wake up,"" so to speak, yet I still found that many scenes were not necessary or could have been edited. (SPOILER AGAIN) Also, did we REALLY need to see the hooker sex scene?  I got the point when they showed the scumbags drooling as they watched through the peep holes. <br/><br/>In all, this is worth seeing, especially if you are a fan of Braff...and Ms Portman. The love story of the movie is rather sweet.  I thought the title was clever, as well. Richard Roeper said that they had edited out about 15-20 minutes since he saw this at Sundance.  I wish they had cut about 20 minutes more...then it would have been great...as it is, it's a good effort."

","While I don't feel as though the $9 to see this film was a complete waste, I was disappointed. Braff was very close to a memorable script but something was lacking. The acting was mediocre at best. The only stand-out performance, in my humble opinion, was Braff's and even that only came close to convincing. I've read IMDb member reviews on Portman's ""amazing"" portrayal of Sam, a free spirited epileptic; not in my opinion. While I loved her in The Professional and Anywhere But Here this was not one of her more memorable roles. The soundtrack was good: Nick Drake, Cold Play and Simon & Garfunkel. If you have time to kill and money to burn, I'd recommend this film ... just don't go expecting anything monumental"

This movie is a pointless romp devoid of any valid plot or conflict and must again reiterate that this is not funny!

"movieguy1021","9","3","6","15 August 2004"," Garden State: 9/10
","I have no idea how to start this review. I already know it's going to be hard to write, because other movies that have affected me in this way are always hard to write. Garden State hit home (not literally, although I do live close by in Philadelphia) in a way that's impossible for words. But, I'll try to say why it's such a great movie, and not exactly this year's Lost in Translation, but pretty close.<br/><br/>Andrew Largeman (Zach Braff) is a mildly successful actor in Hollywood (but not successful enough that he can quit waiting tables) who returns to the title state, his home state, when he finds out that his mom has just died. He returns for the first time in nine years and meets old friends and new ones, including Sam (Natalie Portman). He realizes how weird his family is, as he also goes on a personal journey.<br/><br/>As I was watching Garden State, I was reminded mostly of The Royal Tenenbaums, with not only the odd occurences, but the eclectic soundtrack, which, when paired up the often beautiful images that the film creates, turns into some of the most poignant and spectacular movie scenes of recent memory. One such scene in Garden State is when Andrew, Sam, and Mark (Peter Sarsgaard) are standing the rain, screaming, as Simon and Garfunkel's ""Only Living Boy in New York"" plays. It's a beautiful song, combined with a great image, which makes it all the more memorable. The movie's full of odd moments that hit you at home, with the odd cinematography, the too-real-it-can't-be-scripted dialogue (from Braff, who also directed), and the whole plot. The quirky atmosphere obviously won't appeal to everyone, but it never does.<br/><br/>That's why it's so hard to talk about movies like this. It's quirky but not head-scratching (so it's not something like Eraserhead), and it leaves you feeling both happy and sad, and a feeling of contentment as you connect with the characters and go through what they're going through. That's the only reason Garden State doesn't get a perfect score. As the movie winds down, the quirkiness starts to go away and the movie becomes partially normal-something I normally wouldn't have minded, but since the movie played quirky, the change isn't welcomed. But other than that, this movie excels at being odd, memorable, and touching all at the same time.<br/><br/>Braff is great in his drugged-up role. I've never watched Scrubs, so I can't judge based on his other performances, but he did a great job, nonetheless. Portman also surprised me with her complex character. It's a tough character to accurately portray. Sarsgaard, the only good part of Shattered Glass, doesn't have enough screen time for the character he was supposed to be, but he was good nonetheless.<br/><br/>The symbolism throughout the movie is basic irony, and irony always works for me in films. Such examples are Andrew's mother dying in the bathtub and the aforementioned ""screaming the rain"" scene, and the type of car that Andrew drives and the speed in which he drives it. It's small things like that that make Garden State such a good film, and one that I'm sure will be easily watchable for multiple times.<br/><br/>My rating: 9/10<br/><br/>Rated R for language, drug use and a scene of sexuality."

","The troubled twenty-six years old Andrew Largeman (Zach Braff) returns from Los Angeles, where he works as a waiter in a Korean restaurant after playing a retarded athlete in a TV show, to his hometown in New Jersey for the funeral of his mother. He meets his old friends and a compulsive liar, Samantha (Natalie Portman), for whom he falls in love. Four days later, Andrew heals his wounds with the love and attention of Sam.<br/><br/>With a very simple storyline, but supported by an excellent team of charismatic cast and a great music score, ""Garden State"" is a delightful gem. This feel-good low-budget movie may be overrated in IMDb (top 250: #244); has many reviews written by users with only one comment in total in a very fake promotion, usual in IMDb to promote certain movie (this people will certainly give lots of negative votes to my review, isn't it Alex?). But this little movie really deserves to be watched, and in the end the viewer will certainly like the romance between the weird Zach Braff and the stunning Natalie Portman, certainly one of my favorite actresses of the young generation.

"pcal43","Null","4","10","8 October 2004"," Awful, terrible, earnest
","I saw Garden State at the Bridge last night. Though it steals an entire playbook from Wes Anderson, the first hour is quite watchable and has some genuinely funny scenes. As Zach Braff emerges from a lifelong Prozac- and Zoloft-induced haze, he is surrounded by the same quirky characters and nodding displays of Americana that have delighted knowing hipster kids for more than a decade now.<br/><br/>But Braff's shaking off the drugs turns out to be a metaphor for him shaking off all that hipster irony, for trying to figure out what is really important in life. Unfortunately, this is also where I shook off any interest in the film. As it entered its second, 'earnest' half, I experienced so many ""People don't talk that way""-moments that I wished Braff would get back on the drugs. <br/><br/>You can only pity poor Natalie ""I like sand"" Portman, who gets to add some real gems to her portfolio: <br/><br/>""I know it hurts. But it's life, and it's real. And sometimes it f***ing hurts, but it's life, and it's pretty much all we've got.""<br/><br/>However, my favorite had to be Braff's: <br/><br/>Braff: Have fun searching the infinite abyss. Boat guy: You too. <br/><br/>The accompanying symbolism is just as heavy-handed as the dialog. For example, the film goes way out of it's way to let you know that this infinite abyss is scheduled to be paved over for a shopping mall. See, it's like, he's digging down through the facade of modern suburban life to get at what's really real, you know? That's deep, man. <br/><br/>I know 4 out of 5 twenty-something disaffectoids recommend Garden State to moviegoers tying to wean themselves off irony. But please, this is not The Graduate for a new generation. It's not even as good as Lost in Translation (to which it is inexplicably compared). I'll give it an 'E' for effort, but Garden State simply underscores the fact that the post-irony school is still trying to figure out how to infuse the new earnestness with intelligence and subtlety."

Well, I guess I've walked out of two of my own volition...well, technically speaking, I've walked out of all the movies I've seen in theaters, but I've walked out of three movies in the middle of the film...and not returned. I guess I walk out of movies frequently to relieve myself, but then return to view the remainder of the film.<br/><br/>As I was saying, I've walked out of three movies, two of my own volition. One was Mrs. Doubtfire, and I was forced to leave that film, because I was attending the film with some friends from my Southern Baptist church, and their father. The father took offense to the presence of a homosexual character in the film. He stormed to the ticket counter, demanding a refund, while his sons and I milled around the lobby, embarrassed, looking at our shoes. The other two films were Son of Sam, and Garden State.<br/><br/>I couldn't stomach all the sexuality of Son of Sam - the anal sex, gay prostitution, oral sex after anal sex - it was just too much, so I left. Garden State reduced me to a demographic, and I am not a demographic, I am a bright, shining, unique hipster! It was hipster-sploitation at its grossest and most demeaning.

This is a cliché, self indulgent, angst ridden high school teen movie.<br/><br/>Spoiler: Zach Braff plays a zombie in this movie, ready and willing to suck out any brains he meets. Unfortunately, he runs into Natalie Portman, whose lack of brain induces a negative feedback loop, which in turn sucks all the brains out of the audience. Braff takes every attempt to p*mp (can i say that?) out his soundtrack to the audience, and every time a song plays he just mind numbingly stares at the screen. Meanwhile, everything in the background moves in fast motion during these scenes, to represent the ""futility of a cyclical teen life"" (I just made that up)."

Well I'm sorry kids, but a cool soundtrack does not make up for an utter lack of authentic emotional content or a coherent idea of any kind. This sort of film will appeal to weepy teenagers who spend all their time self-medicating and bemoaning the pain of their privileged suburban existences. Mr. Braff is a poor leading man at best, he reminds me of a young Ray Romano. Natalie Portman is wasted in a role that requires her to look alternately cute or haunted. If you want to see a good film about young people trying to make sense of their lives, try watching almost anything directed by Wes Anderson. The editing in the film is desperate and the whole thing seems to have been structured around it's soundtrack. The film is an empty vessel that you can project whatever you like onto. If this is the beginning of generation y cinema,I weep for the future."
"Daniel Karlsson","2","3","7","1 June 2005"," Another point of view
","I do not agree with the comment that ""movies like this are rare"". When I was in the theater I had the impression of ""I've seen it before - and it disgusts me"". There are plenty of American movie clichés in Garden State. For instance, there is the character played by Natalie ; a pretty girl who in the beginning takes initiative to get closer to a little nerdy guy, who is a stranger to her, and who seemingly is not attracted to her (something which from a simply biological point of view is rather implausible). In addition, there are a lot of, in my point of view, corny, pretentious, predictable and not-at-all-funny jokes and supposed-to-be-romantic moments. Even the camera movements seemed pretentious to me at times. Furthermore, the story just seemed to go nowhere. I was just so disgusted that I couldn't finish it but had to leave the theater in advance. Unfortunately."

"Bo16","10","2","4","11 April 2007"," Let's go home...
","Garden State is an unconventional Romantic/Comedy/Drama that explores the life of Andrew 'Large' Largeman (Zach Braff), a depressed, pill popping one time actor on his return home following his mothers death where he finds old friends, new love and emotion he could barely conceive.<br/><br/>Generally, 90% of comedies all match the same studio requirements (similar to how 99% of statistics are made up on the spot) but Garden State breaks new ground. It's a surreal, yet strangely realistic reminder of how sometimes feeling pain is better than feeling nothing. The surrealism in itself should condemn the film to production Hell, what with drugs, a knight, an argument in Klingon and a leg humping dog. But Braffs script (yep, he wrote and directed it as well) offers such a refreshingly honest view of the awkwardness of relationship that in the end, the entirety of the film feels so very normal. And it's not just the characters who feel awkward around each other.<br/><br/>The first time Large and Sam (Natalie Portman) meet, there is generally much humour in the scene. But then as some tension grows between the characters, it also grows within the audience. Braffs direction and ability to handle these moments work as an incredibly original convention throughout the film, and the feeling does happen repeatedly, never more so when Large reveals a pivotal secret within his life, one that he's held close for most of his life. Without ruining the film, I can't quite stress the importance that the secret is believable. It's nothing like Lost nowadays when secrets are usually remarkably absurd. Fear not the secrets.<br/><br/>One of the more terrific points about the film is the juxtaposition between the two leads. Whereas Large's family and home is cold and distant, Sam's are warm and close. Whereas Large is frequently trying to distance himself from his father and the sad bluntness that is all of which remains of what once may have been a relationship Sam has no trouble talking to her mother and embracing the joyous cosiness that she has grown up with.<br/><br/>The relationship between Large and Sam is a subtle one. It creeps up on you whilst you're captivated by the reactions of different characters to different circumstances. It's not until a specific point in the film that you're likely to think ""Oh, they're getting/have gotten a lot closer!"" and even then you'll be unsure as to what should be expected next. Just as subtle are Larges emotions. Once again, it really is a case of them creeping up on you as the film progresses.<br/><br/>Finally, the film hits a really fantastic final scene. Natalie Portman gets to really show off her flair for acting at the end and is really freaking brilliant at it. One particular clever thing put into the end is the question that has been plaguing the film from the beginning. Large blatantly asks it twice, but thankfully we're never answered, because like in Garden State realism is sometimes surreal, but regardless, not all questions are answered either.<br/><br/>If you're looking for an example of JD for two hours, this might not be the best thing, but if you want a clever, compelling and very funny Rom-Com, then this is probably the best you'll see around."
"Pearlangel2291","10","2","4","14 January 2007"," Probably my favorite movie...
","I didn't see this movie until well after it came out and aired on HBO. All I can say is that this movie is very likely my favorite movie.<br/><br/>Zach Braff, who wrote and directed this movie, did a spectacular job. He developed the characters so well, and you relate to all of them. Although I'm not fond of Natalie Portman, she did an amazing job with this role. Peter Sarsgaard is a great actor who is often overlooked, and he did a fabulous job with his portrayal of Mark.<br/><br/>I myself am from NJ, and there is a lot of New Jersey humor in this movie. The quote (I wasn't sure if this could count as a spoiler, so I put the warning up) where Mark says, ""They love their malls here, man,"" made me laugh so hard. It's very true, because in New Jersey, you can go in any direction and find a mall within 20 minutes to a half an hour. It's crazy.<br/><br/>I'd recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for a heartfelt and realistic portrayal of life, and the obstacles that come with it. The fact that it's independent just made it better (I'm partial to indie films for some reason). ""Garden State,"" as I've said, is probably my favorite movie. It's so difficult to describe why.

I suggest you all to go and see more bad reviews because some are really funny and clever and of course much more inspiring that the film. <br/><br/>This pointless emo crap is embarrassing, i couldn't stand to watch so i played forward only to become close to suicide in the final scenes. The only thing that make me really think in this film was the question about what were Holm and Portman smoking when they did it. <br/><br/>Braff please retire to the wild jungle, find peace with your inner self, go to Tibet, go talk with God, Alá, Buda, whatever, but please save us from your direction skills."

","There's the kernel of a good idea lurking somewhere within Garden State's obnoxious body. There's potential in the story of a young man going back to his hometown to try and redress his strained relationship with his father in the wake of his mother's death. But sadly, instead of using subtlety to deal with the issues at hand, we're bludgeoned with 'whacky' humour, annoying characters and limp-wristed music. The film's a smorgasbord of tricks and conceits, none of which work.<br/><br/>The film begins with quite an interesting image. Braff sits expressionless on a plane as everyone else screams in panic  the plane seems to be crashing. It's nicely shot in slow motion and it tells you a lot about the character. But unfortunately that one shot also tells you all you need to know about him  he's numb to the nosedive his life has taken. So right from the beginning you know everything you need to know about this person. And the details you find out later really add little or nothing to our understanding of him; nothing is explored in any meaningful way (an insightful look into the effects of long-term prescription drug use, it most certainly isn't).<br/><br/>And that shot of Braff sitting expressionless on the plane is an ominous warning as to the quality of Braff's performance. He literally does nothing but look glum. But instead of portraying sadness as it really is  an external stillness with an internal chaos  he merely looks bored. And you never get the feeling that there's anything going on behind Braff's eyes  he's not a good enough actor to project his thoughts to the audience.<br/><br/>The effect all this had on me was that I really couldn't care about his character. His problems seem no different to everyone else's and he never seemed real enough to draw any sympathy. And it's the refusal to deal with reality that frustrated me the most. All the time the film tries to be cute or quirky or whacky when a little realism would have suited the theme of the film much better  a genuine look at disaffection and grief is eschewed in favour of hamster funerals and women reciting Lionel Ritchie lyrics.<br/><br/>But although Braff is a blank faced waste of space, a pouting non-entity who seems to be made out of MDF, it's Natalie Portman who makes this film an ordeal. She plays an epileptic who compulsively lies, who makes annoying sounds in a deluded attempt to be original, who keeps a pet cemetery in her garden and who, most heinously of all, wont shut her goddamned mouth. Seriously, any man who willing listens to her empty-headed twittering deserves depression. She's the kind of woman that would make any right-headed man hack his balls off with a garden trowel if he had to spend more than five minutes with her. I mean, there's a scene where she grabs a cup so she can capture Braff's tears. These aren't the actions of a lovable eccentric, they're the actions of a lunatic.<br/><br/>And then there's the scene where we're introduced to her. She laughs as a dog humps Braff's leg and then she talks and talks and talks and talks. And after she's bored us all to death with her self-important dribble she makes Braff listen to a piece of music. Apparently it's so good it'll change Braff's life. But instead all we hear are The Shins. And the moment with the music is completely pointless. It doesn't add any emotion and it doesn't tells us anything of any interest about the characters. It's only there because Braff loves The Shins and he's going to shoehorn them into his film in any way he can.<br/><br/>But the film's most spectacular failure is its inability to produce any laughs. Every gag in the film is either tired (dog humping someone's leg? I've never seen that before), twee (a dotty old woman gives Braff a shirt that is the same awful design as her wallpaper) or self-conscious (in one scene Braff wakes up to see a knight walking about, a knight who turns out to be a kid who works at one of those medieval themed restaurants. It's a joke that is trying far too hard to be odd. And it defies logic. Wouldn't the kid get dressed at work rather than drive his car while wearing a cumbersome suit? But Braff doesn't want logic to get in the way of his failed attempt to be original). Other self-consciously 'quirky' jokes that don't work include the scene where characters speak Klingon, the scene where we see Portman ice skating as an alligator, the bit in a hotel where we see lots of couples shagging (ooh, how edgy!) and the exchange between Braff and a police officer who likes to swear a lot and who likes to show off his gun.<br/><br/>And this brings me to another problem. The film tries so hard to be hip  the swearing and the sex  but it just doesn't work. And I'm someone who gets a kick out of profanity and sleaze. But here it's just thrown in for no reason. And although I can easily enjoy gratuitous sex and swearing, here it left me completely unmoved.<br/><br/>And for a film that tries so hard to defy conventions it doesn't half end up being conventional. Boy and girl fall in love; boy goes to leave; couple say goodbye at airport; boy gets off plane and surprises girl; couple kiss  the end. This is your standard boring romantic comedy with retard jokes thrown in in a failed attempt to differentiate it from all the other meaningless fluff out there."

","Garden State is one of those rare treats  an independent film that is not immersed in its own ego, and doesn't feel the need to show off some great new artistic effect to show you how clever it is. It is actually a very simple film; nothing complicated, nothing too showy. The reason this film works is the same reason that all films should work  an excellent script and strong performances all round. It needs nothing else, because these two facts alone raise it above most of the independent film scene's best, let alone the limp-by-comparison Hollywood efforts.<br/><br/>The story revolves around Andrew Largeman (Zach Braff of TV's Scrubs fame), an actor from Los Angeles who returns home after nine years to go to his mother's funeral. Andrew has been on medication since he was 10 to numb his emotions, after a childhood accident. As he leaves his medication behind, he finally begins to show some true feeling for life as he revisits old friends and meets Sam (Natalie Portman), a free-spirited woman who leads Andrew to reconsider whether his life is as bad as he thought.<br/><br/>The three main cast members  Braff, Portman, and Peter Sarsgaard (who plays Andrew's friend Mark)  all excel in their roles, without a flaw in sight. The biggest surprise is Natalie Portman who, after her emotionally-dead acting in the Star Wars prequels, shows what a great acting talent she is. All the characters are utterly believable, and this is helped by a script (also written by Braff) that is full of little quirks, yet also heaps on clever observances on real life. It also contains some razor sharp comedy and surrealism (a knight at the breakfast table, for one), that shows Braff as a man of many talents, able to infuse a serious story of rediscovery with quick bursts of humour.<br/><br/>Garden State also looks amazing, with great cinematography which gives the film its atmosphere, mixing colours to portray the blandness of Andrew's LA life with stronger down-to-earth tones which makes Andrew's journey seem that much more realistic to the audience. We cannot help but be carried along with him as we await to see what results will come of him meeting so many people without his medication affecting his emotions. This is coupled with easily the best soundtrack of any film in 2004; it lifts the atmosphere up even higher, as it is not relegated to the background like many scores are, but instead is always present in the audience's mind. It is almost as if the soundtrack is another character in itself.<br/><br/>If there are complaints to be made about the film, it is that towards the end it seems that the moral of the story  that life is what you make of it  is hammered home a little too forcefully. Also Ian Holm, although excellent as Andrew's father, doesn't really have a big enough role, and we are left wanting to see more of Andrew's relationship with him.<br/><br/>But overall, Garden State is a very accomplished debut; a heart-warming drama that captures your attention from the word go.<br/><br/>Rated: 9/10 <br/><br/>More reviews at: http://www.thelazylounge.net"

","It is so hard these days to find a smart, fresh, indi-film like Garden State. The story is quite simple and the relatable characters gives the audience a bit of everything.<br/><br/>The casting of Natalie Portman as Sam is absolute genius, as you just can't help but fall in love with her quirky (realistic) character. Zach Braff is wonderful as actor, writer and director. The supporting cast are also great in their roles.<br/><br/>This low-budget indi-film was probably my favourite movie in 2004, it is smart, it is funny, it is weird, but most of all, it is original!!! I am sick to death of seeing movies with the same premise and the same dull characters over and over again in cinemas, so it is nice to see a fresh and very entertaining film like Garden State."

","This is an amusing film but exceptionally American. When I was 14 I read a book called ""pardon me, you're stepping on my eyeball"" by Paul Zindel and I have to say this film reminded me of it, a lot. I'm British and found that whole American 'needing to find out who I am' and 'deal with personal issues' stuff quite perplexing. The key difference between us and Americans is that Americans just think too much about stuff which we just accept. All that personal self awareness psycho-analysis stuff is beyond me. I mention all this because that's kind of what this film is about. Don't be put off though because it's very amusing. Some moments are laugh out loud good and the acting performances are excellent. If you're not American you may find yourself thinking ""what's the point though"" as it's a 'journey of self discovery'. Personally, my philosophy is I think therefore I am and that's enough for me."
"bugzlayer","10","2","4","23 January 2006"," A refreshing perspective on life
","Zach Braff...<br/><br/>Could the maniacally hilarious doctor from 'Scrubs' in fact be a genius? I reckon so.<br/><br/>In 'Garden State' Zach Braff proves to an entire generation of filmmakers-to-be that there is still hope by writing, directing and starring in nothing less than the pearl of 2004.<br/><br/>He portrays a young man having travelled back to his hometown for his mother's funeral, and catching up with his father and childhood friends. When he meets a girl - Sam - he will become aware of the numbness he has felt during his entire life because of his father, who dealt with his son's distance by prescribing him pills. Could it be a revelation? 'Garden State' offers a refreshing perspective on life, it sends the message that one should enjoy it to the fullest. It's approach is awkward, combining awesome dialogues and one liners (""We're heading up there right after we bury your mom"") with a sensationally original story that reasons through the absurd: every life is unique to history, so why pretend we are what we're not in order to conform to society? From a cinematographic point of view, the film is none other than beautiful. Zach Braff remains down to earth, not too pretentious. During the entire movie, he respects a certain symmetry in the frames, and introduces a charming quirkiness to the events in the story (a dozen children crossing the road in a line rather slowly and holding hands; or everybody jumping into a at the same time pool except for him). Braff adds small hints about his reflexions on life in certain shots (the empty but completely white bedroom at the beginning - symbol of early naiveness or immaturity? Or the shirt against wallpaper sequence - an effort to refrain from society's conformity?) The cinematography conveys what the script is trying to prove: seize the awkwardness of life and learn to enjoy the small things.<br/><br/>I read in an interview that Zach Braff was suggested to write about what he knew. So he wrote about what he knew best, his own life and his own way of thinking. And look what happened. 'Garden State' is close to a masterpiece, and has to be an example for people such as myself, trying to make a career in film.<br/><br/>So if you excuse me, I think I will go find a crevasse to scream into."
"pc95","6","2","4","5 January 2006"," Aloof and Disinsteresting for the most part
","This movie seems to be a lot like the main character - aloof and detached. It fails to really involve emotionally save for the last couple of scenes. I never felt the lead actor really cared for Sam. He seems removed from the part and the movie suffers from it. He spouts out words at the end, but there's little save any emotion. The soundtrack was at times annoying and misplaced with made-for-TV special folksy singing. Ian Holm is virtually a ghost in his role as father and that relationship seems pretty unbelievable. This could be a case where the writer/director might've benefited from not being the lead and instead directing a different actor to allow for him to make better judgments and editing. If the numbing emotions are intended it makes it far too common and rather boring. Overall was lacking in strength and emotional pull."

","I fell in love with Natalie Portman as soon she appeared on screen in this movie. She blew me away. She is great, awesome, amazing, but most of all she's real. She stands out in this movie's exceptional cast.<br/><br/>The movie itself is well paced. It doesn't rush through any of the scenes, and that allows you to take it all in. Zach Braff has made an impressive first feature with Garden State and it will be fun to see what will come next.<br/><br/>The things that stand out in this movie, beside Natalie Portman, are the music and the cinematography. The music is used in all the right places, and the scenes with no music at all gain strength from this. The soundtrack is superior. Other movies/directors have a lot to learn from this. The cinematography is beautiful. Simple and poignant. It adds to the context of the movie. If it's done deliberately or not I can't say, but I do know that shooting a movie with limited funds sometimes forces you to compromise. No matter what, they made it look great.<br/><br/>As a final thought I'd just like to say that Natalie Portman would have given Hilary Swank a run for the money at the Academy Awards if only she'd been nominated. She obviously was overlooked."

"squeezebox","4","2","4","13 September 2005"," Absurdly overrated
","Zach Braff's directorial debut proves one thing: he is just as capable of delivering boring, run-of-the-mill Holyywood tripe as anyone.<br/><br/>GARDEN STATE is not by any means a bad movie. It also isn't a good one. It just sort of sits there. There's plenty of phony emotion and forced ""heartfelt"" exposition, but at the end, there's nothing to it all. Braff appears to have come up with a handful of ideas he thought would make cool scenes in a movie, and then struggled to write a movie around them. There are a few passably interesting moments, but mostly we've seen this movie before. Over and over and over again.<br/><br/>Braff's emotionless performance is mind-numbing. I understand that his character is supposed to have been encouraged to bury his emotions by his equally monotone father (Ian Holm), but he is not a good enough actor to convey the buried emotions lying within. He just acts like an apathetic bore, and his moment of ""epiphany"" toward the end comes out of nowhere, and seems to disappear as quickly as it came. The superb Holm is given a brutally one-note character, and can do nothing to bring any sort of depth to it.<br/><br/>The hit-or-miss Natalie Portman doesn't do either here. Her performance is as uneven as her character. Is she a quirky young woman with more insight than she knows what to do with? Is she an immature kid who is desperately grasping at her disappearing childhood? Or is she just an idiot? Neither she nor Braff can make up their mind, and the movie ends without us having ever figured her character out. That wouldn't be so bad, but we are expected to accept one of the screen's most ridiculously inappropriate audience-pleasing endings. Not since PRETTY WOMAN has a movie been so horrendously derailed by its own final moments. The utter lack of character development (the characters are barely there in the first place) makes the ending all the more insulting to our intelligence. These people would NEVER behave this way.<br/><br/>GARDEN STATE is the kind of movie critics adore. A little semi-obscure sleeper they can pretend they took part in discovering. I find this kind of movie to be offensive. It doesn't play with our emotions, it tries to convince us we SHOULD feel a certain way, by forcing on us the outcome it wants to reach, despite the fact that nothing in the plot has led us to believe it is what would (or SHOULD) HAPPEN.<br/><br/>That's called cheating. And GARDEN STATE is nowhere near good enough to excuse that."
"Quinoa1984","5","2","4","25 August 2005"," a sometimes serious, sometimes silly film about dealing with life
","I heard a lot of hype on Garden State, the film-making debut of actor Zack Braff, the star of the hit or miss TV show Scrubs. Mostly because I am a New Jersey boy, and a good number of my friends who saw the movie loved it. I saw it, and it pretty much met my expectations, nothing exceeding, but nothing to lower them either. Garden State is the story of Andrew Large, who gets off his overload of medication, as he goes back home to New Jersey from his would-be acting life for his Mother's funeral. There he runs into and has a couple of odd adventures with old friends (one being Stellan Sarsgard), a new one (Natalie Portman), and also has to face up to his once-psychiatrist father (Ian Holm). He leaves with a somewhat clean slate after going through some interesting, if a little painful reminders of what he left.<br/><br/>Garden State slightly rises above other indie films in this vein (a young man coming to terms with himself and his demons, and having some eccentricities along the way) because Braff is good at directing actors, and gets out of his co-stars- particularly Portman (who is rather wonderful at times, if cutesy and inexplicable in others) and Holm. And, there are a few laughs thrown in amid Large's encounters with old friends and acquaintances. But it doesn't really rise to the greatness that it could've because Braff, as a first-timer, is one of these directors (at least on a first film) that is so in love with film-making that its over-stylized, at least for me. Maybe I've seen TOO many movies, or maybe I'm not as in tune with the ""MTV generation"" as I could be, but I get tired of things used like slow-motion where the main character(s) are looking straight at the camera (the opening shot is a mixed reaction for me) or in a state of their own (the last shot, and just the last sequence, is tiresome and too deliberate for its own good). There is this romanticism, or maybe pretentious idealizing, and Braff is so infatuated with it it overclouds the better aspects to the film. There is a sense of drama that works, but sometimes its suppressed by the parts that are a little 'showy'.<br/><br/>But these are observations more-so than criticisms; it's obvious that Garden State now has a cult status (especially kids from Jersey, who almost look at this film the same way the young people looked at Godard in the 60's), and I suppose its deserved. I wouldn't be apart of the group that trashes the film to no end, but I'm not calling the film a masterpiece either. At the core its a ""date"" movie, the kind of film that is great for a couple looking for something that will give some good laughs, a little provocative touches, and a sentimental (if totally clichéd) ending. The soundtrack is also interesting, if of course 'soft', but too emo for my taste. In short, this reminds me of seeing a film by one of my fellow film students at school- I see potential, but they still need to put something on the screen that's a little more compelling, and not pandering too much.

"CAM-32","6","2","4","21 June 2005"," Your basic movie trying hard to be original
","This movie is well-intentioned, but it ends up really falling in line with your basic movie... not necessarily a bad thing.<br/><br/>One reason why I say this is that movie stands stalwart behind it's two main characters. During the course of the movie they are inspirational, whimsical and seemingly never wrong, yet somehow they have highly-checkered pasts. They also conveniently don't spend enough time together to get into the guts of what their relationship would be like... a sort of post-Sleepless-in-Seattle phenomenon that this movie does nothing to break away from.<br/><br/>Of course there must be an enemy, in this case it is his father. I don't understand why he is made to play the villain. It is certainly not necessary. The character is designed to have excellent inner-conflict and motivation for his actions, he's also played by a fantastic actor, yet he is made to be a cold, plotting, one-dimensional villain from start to finish. A villain such that the movie can climax with him being put in his place by his son, as any cheap trick movie would.<br/><br/>The movie is nice, but utterly fanciful in the same way as say, The Shawshank Redemption or Forest Gump, where it has a realistic plot, but unrealistic execution. This is not Mean Streets... not that a movie has to play it straight to ring true. An outside-the-box movie can have an unrealistic plot, but realistic execution. Take Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind; the plot is out there, but the movie is genuine. If you've seen both Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and Garden State, think of the weight and depth of the central characters. In Garden State, the characters are fun and neat, but their depth is falsely created in a few sentences of plot-work that doesn't match what's on the screen. What's on the screen is NOT a study of an over-drugged boy (with a severely traumatizing incident) falling in love with a girl who has clinical mental issues. That topic is really left for documentary because how, as sane people, can we begin to structure the feelings behind such a plot? What's on the screen fits a couple normal slackers, there's nothing wrong with simply making them slackers and that's who these characters should be. Slackers can be clever and endearing like these characters, they don't have to be defined as insane and on drugs.<br/><br/>Maybe I was in a grumpy mood... but what was with all those barely funny sight gags? These 2-3 second, no-dialogue shots of stuff like, all of them on the motorcycle, or all of them wearing the plastic bags for the rain etc. It looked like the stuff on sitcoms, I was wondering where the laugh-track was (cue laugh-track)"

","Garden State gets off to a great start, both funny and melancholy, it does live up to the promise of being a 'Graduate' for the new century. Overall the film is finely tuned, nicely observed and well acted but it teeters on the edge of self indulgence. Perhaps if I didn't know that Zach Braff was the director and writer as well as the actor I'd just presume that the director had a bit of a crush on him - unfortunately, that knowledge casts a whole new light on the proceedings and I found myself watching a 'look how talented and lovely I am' show reel. By no means is this a bad film but I found an element of self-consciousness in a number of the scenes and when n it tries to be kooky (stand up Ms Portman) I felt that it needed the touch that Hal Hartley bought to his early films.

Going into the movie, I thought that this was going to be one of those typical chick flicks with tons of cheesy romance and typical clichés. Well, I was wrong. This movie was something that most twenty-something movies strive to be, but never accomplish. It was a movie with characters that most people can relate to, with a plot that is solid as well. The acting was great from both Braff, Portman, and Skarsgard. I have been a fan of Zach Braff since I started watching Scrubs, but to expect such brilliance from such a young actor/director was unexpected. Needless to say, I love this movie and am buying it immediately. I look forward to any upcoming projects from Zach Braff in the future."

After Sam shows Andrew that everything is going to be alright after his mother's death, his attitude and philosophies on what life was for the last 16 years of his existence change into the universal cycle of what growing up is all about. He drops his medication that he'd been on for the last nine years, and he learns what life is like to include pain and sadness into his palette of emotions. He learns to communicate with his father after he is, more or less, kicked out of the house for fears that there is something seriously wrong with Andrew.<br/><br/>Everything collides so beautifully, in fact, that even writing this all down seems like a trite thing to portray this story to others who may read this. The music was absolutely flawless with every scene which the musical director placed it. The great songs were chosen with great emotion in mind and helped the audience to really feel the changes within Andrew. The director did an amazing job with every nuance and shot being like a fresh breath of oxygen for every character. (You even felt the friends of Andrew grow around him and his new persona) Just seeing how much everything is really universal and included in everyone's lives really made this DVD hit home when I saw it; the simplest things are often the most overlooked, and the director (also Zach Braff, ""Andrew"") knows this in every scene.<br/><br/>I gave it a necessary 9/10.

It wasn't as emotional as I kind of expected. <br/><br/>I found the music quite annoying; every two minutes or so a new song swelled on loudly and then lasted for 30 seconds or so. Reminded me of the same technique in Good Will Hunting, although there it was done more modestly and felt as part of the movie.

However, I know I was wrong after seeing whole movie.<br/><br/>I think the most obvious difference between ""Garden State"" and other Hollywood's comedies is that conversations play an important role in this movie. The plot is advanced by a chain of talks instead of a chain of events. Although some conversations are wit and interesting, I feel that this movie is lack of dramatic tension and climax. It is like a diary which records daily life. It is hard for me to connect the flat plot with dramatic opening scene (the scene in a falling airplane.) <br/><br/>By the way, some people on message board say that Natalie Portman ruins this film because of her stiff acting, but I don't think that it is her problem.

Sad to say that the point of the movie never really came through and even now, I'm unsure why Zach bothered to put it on the big screen. I think Zach was trying too hard to recreate the role of Cameron Fry in 'Ferris Buellers Day Off' and there was even a scene of kids walking by holding hands that was straight out of the Ferris Bueller. We all have issues from our pasts that we like to identify characters in movies with, but this was a sad attempt and I can only assume it bombed at the box office.

Like the very best of its genre, it can make you laugh one minute and come close to tears the next. Andrew Largeman (Zach Braff) is very passive and withdrawn, his emotions dulled by years of ingesting Lithium and other psychoactive medications.<br/><br/>Heavily sedated, he cannot even muster an emotional reaction when learning that his wheelchair-confined mother drowned in her bathtub. His psychiatrist father Gideon (Ian Holm) prescribed these to suppress his guilt resulting from a childhood incident. Unfortunately, Large avoids makes a point of avoiding his father during the film and we see very little of him except for brief interludes and a final conversation when he reaches out to him in a heartfelt and touching sequence. As one would expect, some pretty strange characters surround Andrew. Losers-in-training Mark (Peter Saarsgard), a gravedigger who robs jewelry from the dead and bilks department stores, a former cocaine addict turned policeman (Michael Weston), and a knight (Geoffrey Arend) who works at a fast food restaurant and wears his knight costume around the house.<br/><br/>Another friend Albert (Denis O'Hare) has become wealthy by inventing noiseless Velcro but his world seems empty. Braff does not look down on his characters, however, and they have a redeeming touch of humanity that makes them likable. When Andrew meets Samantha (Natalie Portman), her energy and enthusiasm give Large the courage to get in touch with his aliveness. Their relationship develops in an emotionally honest way without them having to first jump into bed and then ask each other's name the next morning. The things they talk about are real and involve their emotions. Though it happens rather suddenly, watching Andrew open up to life is a rare satisfaction and Braff can be forgiven for an ending that is as contrived as it is derivative."

","This film is NOT comparable to films such as ""The Graduate"" and ""Fight Club."" Characters were quirky and strange just for the sake of adding some interest to a weak plot. Weird for the sake of weirdness. What can you say about a film that highlights humping and masturbating dogs and a dead hamster (yep, you guessed it, a painfully protracted & dumb burial scene). I guess it says this film has the intellect and maturity of a cognitively challenged 15 year old.<br/><br/>The film's only two Black characters were shameful. Titembay was as insignificant as the ""adopted"" brother from Africa. He seemed like another one of the pets in the shabby, pet-crowded house. The other character played by a Black actor was hotel staff (in ludricrous uniform) who bought an illegal substance (no stereotype here!) from the grave digger character. This entire scene was bad news. This unfortunate actor's main lines were: ""Did you see the titties? Raise your hand if you saw the titties."" Ugh.<br/><br/>Andrew, the main character is played by the writer and director for this film, Zach Braff. Mistake! Another mistake was the zombie portrayal of the psychiatrist father by Ian Holm. What a dismal experience to see an actor of his talent in this type of role in this type of film.<br/><br/>What saves this film from being a complete waste of time was the sound track (yet, in reality, you'd be better off just listening to the CD on your own) and the cinematography."

","We were two of three people in the theater, and with no one behind us and beside us we were able to stand up from time to time just to keep from screaming at the dumbest film we have ever seen.<br/><br/>I think the script was penned by about 15 persons who were handed blank sheets of paper -- to write anything regarding these characters.  Then all these chapters were gathered, with a few rewrites to connect the stories. That's how horrid this film is.<br/><br/>The differing speeds of the film were arbitrary -- as in, HUH, what's the purpose for that?  So many scenes were stupid, ditto the props and the costuming.  And what's with the leading male character's red, red lips?  The abyss, the sneak-peeks, the gerbil set-up -- everything was so forced.  And the dialogue -- not to mention the vulgarities -- was awful.<br/><br/>Upon leaving, we asked the one other viewer her thoughts.  ""Heavy,"" she replied.  So I guess that's it -- we were just too dumb to appreciate so esoteric a film.<br/><br/>At one point, the screen was dark and quiet.  We thought that was the end. What a disappointment when ""action"" resumed.

","Okay, here's the concept. Andrew Largeman (Zach Braff) has been on antidepressants for 16 years, ever since he was a young boy, and thus has not been able to deal with some fundamental issues in his life. Suddenly, his mother passes away, and he returns to Newark, New Jersey, to attend her funeral and face his past.<br/><br/>Only he doesn't, really, and that's one of the problems with this film. The media hype leads you to believe Largeman must deal with some deep dark secret, and you expect a major confrontation with his psychiatrist father (Ian Holm). We get neither of these things.<br/><br/>What we get instead is an array of characters that are each, in their way, as weird and peculiar as Largeman himself. I guess the idea is that, no matter how strange one's circumstances may be, normal is relative. (Hey, that would make a good tag line.)<br/><br/>But that's like saying that all families are dysfunctional. It's a truism, a self-evident truth. And besides, Tolstoy said it already, and better, in the opening line of ""Anna Karenina"""" ""Happy families are all alike. Unhappy families are each unhappy in their own way.""<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong. The cast of ""Garden State"" is wonderful. As Largeman, Zach Braff is physically reminiscent of a young John Ritter in his ""Three's Company"" glory days. As the mother of one of his friends, Jean Smart is a dead ringer for Shirley Jones in ""The Partridge Family"". Ian Holm is in fine form as always. And Natalie Portman shines as compulsive liar Sam.<br/><br/>There are some funny gags along the way, too. You haven't lived until you've heard ""Three Times a Lady"" sung with a Jersey accent. And there is a rather unusual dog trick you've probably never seen before, and probably won't care to see again.<br/><br/>Ultimately, however, all this weirdness becomes too much to absorb, and this critic's brain simply shut off. To put it another way, all this dysfunctionality is ... well, dysfunctional. ""Garden State"" is just too damn quirky for its own good."

","This is the first time I've written a critique on IMDb and I was motivated to do so because I was surprised by the number of glowing reviews this movie has received. Essentially, ""Garden State"" felt like a glossy film school project--written by an angst-ridden, jejune 20-something--in which, as one astute reviewer wrote, ""real problems make cameos."" The poorly structured script is just a series of contrived vignettes, which, despite displaying glimpses of Braff's talent and comic timing, ultimately ring hollow and too cute for their own good. He's trying too hard to be profound. Natalie Portman is lovely, but I felt like wringing her neck! It seems as though early fame and fortune has dampened any real emotional connection she may have to what most people her age go through - I just did not buy her as the epileptic misfit with the wacky mother, and none of her precious mannerisms and speech patterns (""oh my god, I can TOTALLY see you freakin' out right now, you so want to leave don't you?"") came across as remotely authentic. And being able to turn on the tears in one two many scenes does not make you a good actress.<br/><br/>And the great Ian Holm? What was he doing in this movie? Did he read a different script than the one that ultimately was produced? His character had no arc, no layers, no nuthin'. <br/><br/>Braff obviously has talent but he needs someone with a good bull*$#! detector to read his next script--someone who won't be swayed by the hyperbolic praise that has been heaped prematurely upon his shoulders."

","Alright, so most of you and your comments are totally perplexing me. How desperate are some of you for a decent film that you are ushering this amusing but immensely flawed picture in as the greatest film of the year? I'm sorry, but this film was nothing but a let down and inconsistent, despite best efforts.<br/><br/>And I don't mean to seem condescending in any way. I'm simply stating my feelings, which, in a bias way, I deem truthful and right. So...<br/><br/>The film started itself out on an interesting foot, slow and capable but engaging and endearing. It makes us care about the lead character, who, I might add, is quite the fox. Amusing scenes at his work as well as his mother's funeral and reception build the audience up for a calculated, dark, and moody film exploring the psyche of a confused young adult.<br/><br/>But right about the time Natalie Portman hits the screen, and she's very good, the sh*t truly seems to hit the fan...hard. Plugging The Shins mindlessly and for no decent reason other than ""because"" starts the pitfall. Then the erratic chain of events that ensues merely causes the film to crumble. While I enjoyed some of the scenes at Portman's house, everything rang false and flat, deriving from a rocky script, not poor acting.<br/><br/>The tension with the father, which is supposed to explain the troubled Braff's ways and lack of emotion, comes across WAAAAY underdeveloped and lackluster--completely dull and emotionless. How can we care about a relationship with a father that is one dimensional and boring? How can we care if things get patched up when we never really understand anything but anger and confusion between the two? It's rather ridiculous.<br/><br/>The film tries to end with the stupid hunt for the necklace that only has some hack, sappy memory thought up from a cereal box in the 1950s, and comes across as just that. Where the film could have been more focused on the internal issues conflicting the characters, as well as more deliberate, both of which seemed most plausible at the film's beginning, instead Braff decides to take the trite road to appease the dull and simple-minded. Ending a lifetime of trouble with his father in a stupid monologue over a bed while laying his hand on his father's chest rang false and ridiculous. And the whole ""I'm leaving...OOPS, no I'm not, I love you so"" ending and the kiss out into darkness could not have been more cliché and more opposite the movie's tone and feeling set-up in the first few frames.<br/><br/>I don't how something so promising could go wrong, other than the fact that Braff got bored and lazy. In the end, I was simply nothing short of disappointed and sit here now incredibly confused how anyone could be anything less. This film is one that will be heralded by few and then drift off into complete obscurity...boo with a capital B."

But it's hard to figure out why this movie caused such a stir at Sundance.

I guess it works both ways, my second option at least starts off with sort of a compliment.<br/><br/>This is the kind of film I would have related to a lot better when I was around the same age as the principals, but a lifetime of living (and watching thousands of movies) has offered a somewhat different perspective. I really don't have anything against the picture per se, it's just that the characters and situations are fundamentally shallow and made quirky for the sake of being quirky. Where else for example would you find an armor wearing Renaissance actor, a silent-Velcro inventor guy or a guardian of the infinite abyss? All a bit too pretentious to be taken seriously, not to mention Natalie Portman's invisible epilepsy and inability to speak the truth. Then there's the entire question I have about the ethics of a father prescribing medication for an immediate family member. Seems to me like there could be some kind of grounds there for medical malfeasance there, in fact I was bothered enough by that to look it up. To keep it simple, the A.M.A. states that physicians generally should not treat themselves or members of their immediate families because professional objectivity may be compromised when an immediate family member or the physician is the patient.<br/><br/>Anyway, without scorching the picture, I'd give Zach Braff some credit for coming up with a relatively decent first time writing and directorial effort. I thought he did a nice acting job on 'Scrubs', but because of that, probably should have nailed that business on the doctor/patient relationship. He probably knows better by now."

","This is a beautiful movie in so many ways. The beginning made me feel for the main character, Andrew, and how utterly numb he truly was. The situation didn't seem to matter at all; he just didn't feel anything due to the medication he was on. We then get to follow him through a couple of days when he goes back home for his mother's funeral, and this turns out to be a major game changer for him. He decides to stop taking his medicine, he meet up with old friends... and he meet a girl. It's an emotional (no pun intended) journey with a lot of character growth involved. It's very well done by Zach Braff who not only played Andrew but also wrote and directed the movie.<br/><br/>The girl, Sam, was kind of weird, though. Not necessarily a bad thing, but I didn't really get as attached to her as I would have liked to. But I have to say that Natalie Portman did an amazing job playing her. It was just the character who wasn't really ""my kind of character"". But she did add humor to the equation. I'll give her that.<br/><br/>As a person suffering from mental health issues and taking medication for it, and also being a nurse, I did feel that the movie might give the wrong idea concerning some things. Like, yeah, for this guy to suddenly stop taking his pills turned out just fine, even though this in no way means that he's all of a sudden completely okay again. But I do think that it can give the idea that if you stop taking your pills the world will become clearer and you'll be that much closer to feeling okay, cause there's so much more to it than that.<br/><br/>But as a whole this is a movie that I really liked. It makes me feel good and in a way it also gives me hope."

","I recently watched this again and noticed a lot that I had not noticed when I was watching it repeatedly in my early 20's. I found it moving at the time but can't say that I find it the same at age 34. Now it just seems forced, but then it was quite moving (I guess it captured a moment). Then again, I decided to cast a more analytical eye toward Garden State this time as I have been planning for a sermon on the Christian holiday of Pentecost (yes, I'm a pastor). I remembered the fireplace dance scene being a pivotal scene in the film, but I was struck by the frequency with which Sam is visually associated with reds and oranges while Largeman is associated with blues and greens. While we could easily say that Sam is more fiery while Largeman is morose, we can also say that there is clearly an internal spark and not simply an external glow that inspires Sam. Given the circumstances of her life, she should also be spiraling into the same kind of disaffectedness as Large, but she is not. Perhaps it is because Sam is a Gen-Xer while Large is a Millennial (seriously), but perhaps it is a willingness to accept circumstances rather than escape them artificially (through drugs, prescribed or otherwise). After all, that seems to be a main theme of the movie: living with yourself. Still, I can't help but shake the cinematography surrounding Sam and the passage of Pentecost, when the Holy Spirit inspired the people to understand one another with tongues of fire. Given that Pentecost is the spiritual empowerment of people after Jesus's death, it's fitting."

His father is a psychiatrist who has been treating him for most of his life. Prescribing all kinds of meds that have put him into a fog, moving through his life as a sort of emotional zombie. His mother was a paraplegic and how she became that way is the event that has shaped Largeman's life. Upon returning home he meets up with people he knew in high school. Mark, played by Peter Sarsgaard, still lives at home. He digs graves and scams the local hardware store for money. Nothing changes in the old neighborhood. Everybody goes about their business and every once in awhile a guy like Andrew Largeman is able to escape and try to make something of his life. Although one guy in the neighborhood did made it big by inventing silent Velcro. Largeman is just as lost and messed up as everyone else. <br/><br/>Soon enough everything is about to change. While in a doctor's office waiting room Largeman meets Sam, played by Natalie Portman. An almost too perfect local girl who we find out has epilepsy. Their relationship builds over the course of the film to a satisfying but somewhat clichéd ending. ""Garden State"" has a great overall feeling to it. The characters a very real and down to earth. They feel like your own friends and are quite relatable. It's the timeless story of one man's journey to find his place in the world and to reconcile his past.

(It's like some indie guy went all like-- this is down-to-earth for me. Compared to Star Wars.) <br/><br/>Because if I see one malus in this movie, it's that I think it tries a little too hard to be a little weird and softcore disturbing. I feel like that's the vibe that it wanted to feed off of. <br/><br/>I also feel like it's one of these indie films that has an overblown sense of its own importance-- although this could have been far, far worse. After all, they weren't too stuck up to put Coldplay on the soundtrack-- a Britpop act that I much prefer to the weeping-and- gnashing-of-teeth you get from the average alt rock group. So the grandiosity was definitely downplayed, but I still felt that there were times when (or there was an undercurrent that made) the subtle work that they were trying to do interfered with by this desire to just be weird for the hell of it, if that makes sense. <br/><br/>After all, there's a difference between simply holding life up to the lens-- like Linda McCartney, who took these great second-in-the-life photos-- and sorta sitting around the coffee table, saying, 'Okay, how weird would it be if....'. If that makes sense. <br/><br/>(Also, this blends into another issue, a character issue-- the fact that a lot of the characters are very immature, e.g., I don't want to grow up and get a steady job; I want to smoke pot and be a Trekkie because I don't want to grow up.... That's less of a technical issue, but in a broader sense it speaks to what much of the movie is about, and for me it's just not that interesting to watch.) <br/><br/>But it could have been way more *exaggerated*, than it is, which is something. (Although it does tend towards exaggeration, but it could have been worse.)<br/><br/>And there's no gore and blood-splattering, which is more or less my prerequisite to even watch a film these days.<br/><br/>So it's not explode-y; that's good. It has that. <br/><br/>And it's not a *bad* movie. Overall it's decent. It's just that it leaves you with the impression that it thinks of itself as being far better (and more important!) than it really is. <br/><br/>It's not one of these wonderful movies (Greenberg, Juno, come to mind) that makes you jump up and down, saying, 'Yes, that's exactly how it is'. <br/><br/>Because that's not exactly how it is, I think. Although it has some resemblance, I think. <br/><br/>(Although it would be easy to use the word immature.)<br/><br/>............<br/><br/>Still, it's vaguely irritating, because it's just not quite right. <br/><br/>(7/10)"

","This film is about Braff's character, Large, but it is a reflection of Portman's character, Sam. Sam is beautiful, unique, witty, funny, and fun. She is also quirky, talks a mile a minute, and wears her flaws like a fur coatLarge can't figure out whether she is openly insecure or incredibly self-confident. But he is overwhelmed by howalive she is. She excites himand she excites the viewer. Portman really brought the Girlfriend Experience (look it up at livemancave.wordpress.com) in this flick, and it really strikes a chord with me, because Sam's aforementioned characteristics are what attracted me so strongly to my current girlfriend.<br/><br/>As I said, though, this movie is about Large. He is perpetually numb, floating through life without a defined purpose, and he doesn't even understand what happiness is. He is in a profession and in a city that reward superficiality, self-centeredness over community, and wearing a metaphorical war mask to cover one's vulnerable emotions. His sudden trip home reminds him that you don't have to make a ton of money or be in an exotic place to find happinessthe happiest moments come unexpectedly when you're in great company. Happiness lies in self acceptance and appreciating the presentmaking the most of who and where you are, and who you are with, right now. I believe that most of us have learned or re-learned this lesson the hard way, or have yet to learn the lessonthat's why I believe that most of you will relate to this film, even if you don't necessarily relate to Large.<br/><br/>As I also said earlier, this movie is a reflection of Sam. Like her, it is unique, witty, funny, and funyou often wish you could step through the TV screen and hang out with some of these strange-but-interesting people, even if you don't do drugs (and I don't). It is also quirky, dark, and deep. Living in the moment is a constant theme of this film, as it puts a microscope on 4 days that potentially changed a young man's life. Taking control of your life is another theme, as it cautions the viewer about how something as seemingly-trivial as a quarter-inch piece of plastic can determine the majority of your life, if you let it.<br/><br/>While the movie is titled ""Garden State,"" and it is filmed in New Jersey, it doesn't feature landmarks or many aspects that are uniquely Jersey (according to IMDb, the site of the swimming pool scene was chosen for its view of the Manhattan skyline, but fog on the day of filming obscured the view). Having grown up in Jersey, I would have liked to have seen the Garden State Parkway or Turnpike featured at least once, but I guess the flick as is makes it more relatable to people from other states. This movie is not necessarily about coming home to Jersey, it's about coming home.<br/><br/>Honestly, though, I've always said this to people: what makes New Jersey a great place to live is not landmarks, a grand list of things to do, or a good tax situation; instead, it is the people. For the most part, the people are genuine. They speak their mind, and although they may have a rough exterior, loyalty is a common trait; they can rag on their friends mercilessly, but don't you dare or you might find yourself in a fistfight. I felt that this flick did a good job of representing that.<br/><br/>And the movie's director seemed to really understand that, as, also according to IMDb, the film was based partly on Braff's own childhood in New Jersey (he attended Columbia High School in Maplewood), as well as his days as a struggling actor in Los Angeles before the success of Scrubs. He also hand-picked the songs for the soundtrack. In effect, Braff kind of bared his soul to the world through this flick, and I think that if you like him or Portman, you should set aside time to watch it at some point. My respect for Braff has definitely increased after seeing it (and I already liked him as a comedic actor before).<br/><br/>For more reviews and a kick-ass podcast, check out: www.livemancave.com"
"axel-koch","8","0","0","14 August 2013"," A very lovely and unconventional debut by a writer/director I'd now like to see more of
","Not many movies are made with such enthusiasm as Zach Braff's directorial debut, Garden State. Shot during a very few weeks of break from the sitcom that made him famous, the sympathetic young New Jerseyan - ah, now you get the movie's title - was likely still too stunned that he managed to get Hollywood VIPs Natalie Portman, Ian Holm, and Peter Sarsgaard to star in his first (and last, up to the present day) cinematic project to waste a thought on possible critical or commercial acclaim the movie would turn out to receive in abundance. And now, more than ten years after its premiere at the Sundance Film Festival in early 2004, Garden State hasn't lost one bit of its popularity. Neither the cult following it garnered nor that the gross would be fourteen times as much as the budget were foreseen by any movie expert. Interestingly though, the reason for it is as logical as anything: the genuine emotions Braff had put into every single part of the making of this movie are transferred onto the audience and one can't help but feel happy while watching it. And that's outstanding film-making.<br/><br/>Written autobiographically to some 80% according to Braff, the great script is the indispensable foundation for the success of Garden State. The relatable difficulties the down-to-earth characters have to face together with absurdist humor only slightly less weird than the daydreams in Scrubs, make Garden State as special as it is. The simple plot about a fairly unsuccessful young actor who returns to his hometown after his mom has died and is confronted with emotions for the first time in his life when he meets a charismatic peer in the doctor's office is spiced up by several moments of brilliancy in writing and unpaid actors, a dozen times more engaged than their highly salaried colleagues in other romantic comedies. And another part any but halfway attentive viewer should definitely have perceived is the fantastic, Grammy-winning soundtrack. Before even sending the screenplay to the actors he had in mind, Zach Braff had already hand-picked the 13 indie tracks ranging from The Shins over Simon & Garfunkel to Colin Hay. The importance of every single one of those songs is unmistakable and they seem to have been made for the exact scene in which they are used in the movie. <br/><br/>This all sums up to a movie that isn't the funniest, the most touching, or the most realistic, yet a lovely and rememberable mixture of all three. I thought that some of the scenes, especially the first scene at the house of Natalie Portman's character, were over-the-top and just didn't hit my sense of humor, but that's fine since the ones that made me smile were definitely predominant. Zach Braff proves to not only have a talent for acting, but also writing and directing and until he finally releases a new movie, we'll have to content ourselves with watching Garden State over and over again - something that I am very keen on doing."

","Knowing Zach Braff, and by that i mean watching Scrubs and seeing him on Brand X once, i wasn't expecting what i saw. What i sat down expecting to see was a comedy about it didn't matter what that would be, well, pretty scrubs-esk. I was mistaken, but not in a bad way. i was surprised, while there was some unmistakably funny moments, the focus of the movie wasn't that it was meant to be so much a comedy as it was a drama. I liked seeing that different side of Zach Braff. While the beginning was a little confusing, certain elements came together by the end, and a few themes recurred and were expressed very well. The film was very profound and i highly recommend it. Braff's acting in the beginning is pretty sullen but as you find out there is a purpose to it as the viewer will find out. I also think Zach Braff is a pretty serious Shins fan."
"James_Ernesto","5","0","0","26 May 2013"," Average flick
","Finally got around to watch this movie today (I'm late, I know). First, let me say that I've always been a big Scrubs fan, which made me want to watch this movie. And while I think for a first time writer-director it's an alright effort with some good ideas, on the whole it's no more than a mediocre movie for me. Braff has clearly tried to make an ambitious movie and I give him credit for that, but in the end this movie ends up more like a standard romance flick than a serious character study.<br/><br/>Even though the airport scene was clearly a rip-off from Fight Club, I actually liked the first 15-20 minutes, maybe until the party scene (which is filmed in a style that's also been done in a lot of films). But from then on, the movie (slowly but surely) becomes the victim of its own ambition. <br/><br/>The biggest flaw for me is the character drawing. I actually like Braff's character, he has got some depth and you really get to know him. But sadly, that's about it. Natalie Portman? Yes, she's incredibly gorgeous. Yes, she plays her role extremely well. But her character remains unrealistic and cliché for me. She hasn't got real depth and at the end of the movie, I didn't have the feeling I knew very much about Sam. You see, she's incredibly nice, quirky, adventurous, always upbeat and seems to be incredibly innocent. Yes, she's an obsessive liar, but apart from that she's a total cliché. It's like Braff thought 'Well, what kind of girl could a guy like Largeman fall in love with?' And sadly, he came up with the stereotype of girls who get the guy in romantic movies. It's always the same, there's this one totally awesome girl, this sweet-girl-next-door-type, who never says a bad word and never does a bad thing, who's absolutely likable and who ends up with the guy. This is not inventive character drawing, this is 08/15.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Largeman's friends are quite realistically drawn, but completely unlikeable. I wouldn't even spent time with most of them if I'd been offered money.<br/><br/>The worst character is his father, though, as it looks like Braff didn't even make any effort to give him any kind of personality at all. Yes, he's drugging Largeman, fine. That's not nice. And he seems to hold him somewhat responsible for the accident which led to the paraplegia of Largeman's mother. But that's about everything we get to know about him. I think that to really explore Largeman's character we would have to take a deep look into the relationship with his father and how that affects his life, but unfortunately Braff doesn't give us the opportunity to. The 'conversation' they have at the end is a complete joke, the dialogue being about 60 seconds long and the summary of it would look like this:<br/><br/>Largeman: The drugs are ruining my life. I will not take them any more. But I forgive you for drugging me. His father then only says one sentence, like: I am your doctor and you shouldn't go against my recommendation. Then Largeman says: I will live my life the way I want to. But I think we should respect each other and try to be happy. I hope we can do that.<br/><br/>That's it. That's where the movie completely lost me. If you ask me, that's really awfully done. Just look at a movie like Magnolia, which explored parent-child-relationships and their impact on both incredibly well, and this looks absolutely amateurish in comparison. And that's because it is.<br/><br/>I didn't really care much for the cheesy love scene at the end, where Largeman is about to fly back to L.A., only to change his mind, leave the plane and go back to the weeping Sam, who he met some three days ago. That's the typical ending of a romance movie again, which, again, isn't bad - but if you try to make an ambitious movie that's more than the average Hollywood love story, you shouldn't let it end that way. <br/><br/>So, on the whole, it's not like there's nothing to enjoy in Garden State. But it certainly is no extraordinary movie. It's a decent love story and that's where it succeeds. But if you expect it to really explore the life of a troubled young man in his mid-20s, it simply falls short."

","This was a truly masterful and moving piece of work. Zach Braff was always an idol for me, but he really did become incredible after this movie. I of course am fully supportive of his new ambitions, ""Wish I Was Here"". <br/><br/>The love story was very well planned out, and what I loved the most was the growth of the characters. It was also great to see a love story that had more going on than just the romance, yet still deliver that sweet ending we all craved.<br/><br/>As an aspiring director myself, I one-day hope to be able to do something half as good as Garden State, it is sweet, moving and a fresh take on love ."
"sammorgan84","8","0","0","27 March 2013"," 'Maybe that's what family really is. A group of people who miss the same imaginary place'
","If you want a feel good film then maybe this is not for you. The reasons being despite the romance, the relationships and the positives all of the character struggle through a real and believably cold and depressing existence looking for moments of happiness.<br/><br/>Zachary Braff really has created something unique, his character is sad, lonely and believable. The broken family relationships, the loss of childhood and sense of home mean that you do pity his feeble empty life. This film reminds me of George Orwell's book 'coming up for air' where returning to your home town brings back all sorts of emotions often what could have been, better times and how things when reflecting on them have not turned out how you would have expected.<br/><br/>Coldplay and Shins help suit the flow of the movie with it being generally soft and light. It's very easy watching and when Braff starts to connect with his father and Portman it's uplifting. Ian Holm is excellent as Braff's emotionally repressed Dad.<br/><br/>It's a great film if you can connect with it. Not everyone will but for those who do you will get a lot out of it."

","I heard about this movie from a magazine that I was reading at the time. From there I read that the film runs only a few theaters in our country and we better not miss it. Now I think it's not cool to believe everything written in magazines. I saw him last night and I can not believe it has a high rating while other films much better have a low rating. I noticed that the actor who plays Andrew looks like Dax Shepard. Interestingly, not only physically but also in acting, both being so indifferent, boring, monotone does not excel in anything, if they are from another planet. About this film, I can not say anything because nothing happens in it is very boring, long scenes, weak dialog. Sam who has a tick by telling lies without realizing, after a while she is heal. I don't remember saying any lie. Avoid it."
"AvidClimber","9","0","0","2 March 2013"," Garden State — A young man's emotionless life being challenged in the face of change
","Garden State is a low key movie about the importance of emotions and living your life.<br/><br/>Nice score with excellent editing and photography make for a great ambiance. It's simple, yet effective. You get quickly plunged in the world of the main character and see with his eyes. Life is messed up, but you have to start making sense of yours at some point. The story is a short and important journey in his life, and the details are at times funny, but always interesting.<br/><br/>As a writer-director playing the main role of this flick, Zach Braff did an incredible job. I like him as an actor, but I didn't know he had the talent for the rest. Playing opposite him is the talented Natalie Portman, and Peter Sarsgaard, who both deliver a very good performance. I'm not sure about the quality of Ian Holm work's here, it difficult to say, but at least on par with the rest of the cast who did a good job.<br/><br/>The only negative thing I could say is that the very final moment, is offbeat from the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>If you want to see something different that will make you think and have a few laughs with a touch of romance, this is it."
"ironhorse_iv","8","0","0","22 January 2013"," Garden State of Mind
","Great debut from Zach as writer/director/actor in a soporific type performance that inspires the open minded. The movie is just as beautiful to watch, as if watching Adam from the Garden of Eden coming alive for the first time Adam taste the forbidden food, as Andrew Largeman (Zack Braff), a moderately successful TV actor living in LA has been going through life in a drug lithium-induced coma until his mother's death inspired a vacation from the pills to see what might happen to truly taste life. Zack does a great job on his character, as it's so unlike his role as J.D in the TV Show 'Scrubs'. Andrew is medicated with antidepressants and therefore emotionally numb. Braff depicted perfectly that feeling of aloofness when you are just not into taking drugs with a crowd you don't really know. This captures the dissociative nature of the drug experience so well. the way drugs alter your thinking can be stimulating and exciting but at times very unsettling in others. So sick of drug use being glamorized, and sick of seeing it in almost every movie, but in this film, it's really does show the negative light of it. In my opinion, the character development is part of what makes this movie fantastic. He returns to New Jersey AKA the Garden State for a few days to attend his mother's funeral staying with his domineering over barely father Gideon (Ian Holms) who also his doctor. Meanwhile, at home, he does his best to avoid a long-simmering but inevitable confrontation with his father. Stunned to find himself in his hometown after such a long absence, Large finds old acquaintances around every corner living quite unique lives as gravediggers like Mark (Peter Sarsgaard), fast food knights (Jim Parsons), rich inventors (Armando Riesco) and the panderers of pyramid schemes. Not only that, Large meets Sam (Natalie Portman) at the hospital for a check up, a girl who is everything he isn't. A blast of color, hope and quirks, but also corky pathological liar with epilepsy. Natalie does a great job in the role, making her charming and innocent, yet somebody trying to open up to somebody herself. He opens up his life to Sam for the first time, with speeches in both the pool and bathtub. 'The Home Speech"" is just great writing from Zack Braff. This scene is great. And I love their conversation. But it always made me giggle,because the way that their heads are just at the surface of the water, and the way that their bodies look under the water. It looks like big heads with no necks and little legs. This movie has plenty of deep meanings which works with the beautiful camera shots. Some of them are written, some of them just out there for the audience to figure them out. The 't-shirt' in the bathroom scene, the children crossing the street, the alligator ice skating, and the 'Ark' on the edge of infinite abyss. This movie looks amazing I love the way it is shot, very good cinematography! Suspiciously﻿ Wes Anderson-y. Not only the great cinematography. Zach has an amazing good taste in music. The music like New Slang-The Shins, Fair-Remy Zero, The only living boy in New York-Simon & Garfunkel, Let go-Frou Frou, Don't Panic-Coldplay, Such Great Heights-irone and wine all works, but the film get criticize for being a hipster movie, personally I don't see that. If the film need some criticize, it's will be with the pretentious. I can do without Methon Man cameo and the hotel scenes. It feel disturbing. Not needed. The many contemplation Zack Braff poses can be annoying. He can be poster boy for narcissism, heralding in the facebook generation. I think it has something to do with the how there's so much going on in his head but it doesn't show through to an outsider's perspective. Some people just live life without thinking and some think through life without living. There's a middle ground in there somewhere but there are people that are so far off to one side they can barely function. The movie is about him trying to get his bearings on life. Strangers think he's just bored but those who relate to him know better. Criticize can say, how much it's mirror Zack's real life's life. Funny, how Andrew, a waiter at Vietnamese restaurant. Before he played in Scrubs, Zack actually was a waiter at a Vietnamese restaurant . He's struggled with OCD since he was ten. Also his character has been medicated since he was ten. He's also Jewish in real life and his parents were a sociologist and a psychologist. He's really from New Jersey. Also at first he really struggled becoming an actor until he got his break with Scrubs. I mean the movie isn't his biography but the basis is from his life. Still it's discomfort, combined with laughter. Kudo to Zack, that's a hard combo to do. This ending to this film is perfect, because life is just a series of moments and decisions we make, and he needs to make one right there that could changes everything. We don't see what happens next, because we don't need to. Funny how the last part of this scene takes place in a ""baggage claim"" area too. Sam warmth and fearlessness give Large the courage to open his heart to the joy and pain of the infinite abyss that is life. The question is, will Andrew have the courage to face his father, and accede Sam into his life. Watch the movie to find out."

"clarne","6","0","0","27 August 2012"," A moving, but frustrating indie
","Zach Braff's first foray into directing as well as writing is a warm, funny and expressive journey into the life of Andrew Largeman, whose life has led him on a constant downward spiral ever since his mother had a terrible accident fifteen years earlier. It is said mother's death that draws him back to the town he left behind 9 years earlier, and forces him to come to terms with the life he has led.<br/><br/>The movie is a colorful, and at times daring experiment with a great soundtrack and a number of quirky side characters that spices things up when the main story gets to depressing. The script is quite impressive in a number of ways, and that Braff did this all by himself, considering his young age is even more impressive. Unfortunately the movie, while strong in a number of ways is let down by a couple of weak key components that drags it down.<br/><br/>Constantly medicated, and without any real kind of connection to the world around him, Braff's acting skills are put to the test, and unfortunately he's not up to the task. He constantly comes across as annoying, and his delivery of what could have been quite good, and heartfelt dialogue is generally underwhelming. Natalie Portman gives us a more believable portrayal as Sam, the notorious liar with a big heart. Sadly, her character is as believable as she is annoying, and her quirkiness just makes you cringe at times. This, combined with the fact that the movie at times seems to try way to hard to fit into the alternative indie-genre weakens the overall impression.<br/><br/>On the plus side, we get some truly memorable scenes, characters and probably the funniest version of ""three times a lady"" you will ever hear. If you enjoy Indie cinema ""Garden State"" is one of the essential movies of the last decade, but time has not been as kind to the movie as one would hope. It may have been a trendsetter, but it has been exceeded by later additions to the genre."

","If your one that thinks about the next step in life and is afraid to move, watch this film and you'll be ready to start moving forward. Garden State makes one contemplate about if we are certain that where we are going in life is where we want to be, but more importantly who we want to be there with. The soundtrack is one of the greatest compilations ever constructed and implemented into a film. Every song struck a chord with a specific scene and to put together real emotion/depth and combine that with perfect placement equals nothing less than what Garden State is as a film in its entirety. Zach Braff puts on a performance, so genuine and pure he truly convinces an audience it's not his character, it's himself."

","'Garden State' came out in the Uk on December 10th.

I thought the opening in which we met Braff lying emotionless in bed. Listening to the answer machine message from his dad about his mother's death was disturbing and really drew me in.<br/><br/>So many memorable moments: The funeral, touching and funny, the party scenes, the scan scene...And as for the dialogue - well, sharp and witty. I don't think I will ever forget Natalie Portman's dancing in her bedroom - just to be 'unique' or Zach Braff's touching comments about what makes a 'home' in the swimming pool.<br/><br/>Even those touching moments were funny; the fact that he couldn't swim! As a mid twenty-something, This film really spoke to me. It's that question we all dread. We've graduated university, got jobs....then what?

","I'm a girlie teenager. I'm into romantic and the high school drama kind of movies still. Once I heard, ""Garden State"" the first thing I thought was a movie talking about medical issues and political experiments, all that boring things. I was surprised with how much I ended up enjoying this movie and how it was the complete opposite of what I expected it to be.<br/><br/>The movie starts with the male lead lying down in the bed; this personally gave a complete spin to my head. Once I saw Zach Braff, I was like ""hey let's give this movie a try!"" If you've seen scrubs, you would have reacted the same way. Since Zach's character makes you laugh too much in every episode and in this movie it was no different. He has the lead as the guy who has not come home since he was young until the day of his mother's death, and that's when he starts realizing much stuff from his past or how he can have a better future here now that things are about to spice up. Apart from all of that, I was really interested in this film once I heard he had written and directed it too. This made me wonder many things! For example, does the story have anything to do with his personal life? I believe this is a story of man who is growing up mentally and transforming himself due to the romance he is experiencing. That's when Natalie Portman comes to hand with her cute but adventurous character. She's my favorite thing in the story! And who would have thought two persons who met at the doctor's office would fall in love? (I wouldn't mind having a love story like that!) Sam was of much help in Andrew's life. She was a sign of hope and faith. Andrew had left New Jersey because of family issues, and was an actor out of state. His most important contribution was as a ""retarded quarterback"" in a cable movie. This right away made me think ""Did he really like to be remembered as retarded?"" It's not something to be proud of (If he was Brad Pitt it would be complete different story!). The moment he comes back home to his mother's funeral, you can see a person that has no feelings and is totally numb to what is going around him mainly because of the medications. After that scene, when he decided to meet up with his old friends and starts doing drugs, drinking and hanging out with younger girls you can totally catch how even though he is 26, he is not mature enough to know what he wants and basically just does what he is told. But once he meets Sam, he starts speaking up for himself, saying the truth behind himself and his mother and telling his dad he's no longer a child to follow his orders. At the end, once he was about to head back to Los Angeles I couldn't figure out if he was actually going to go or stay. But he realized life couldn't get any better, he had found love, and had ended up being a complete different person. You may think this is like any other movie, where one person is trying to find himself and ends up falling in love but something that can be ""welcome, in that it's true to life and different from most movies."" like Mick LaSalle said is how ""Andrew is not in a romantic frame of mind, and so Andrew and Sam get to know each other as friends before there's any physical contact."" This shows how love without sex is possible and most importantly is a lesson to most teenagers in today's life. Zach Braff did a good job doing this, he made a movie many thought would be no different to others into something completely new.<br/><br/>Overall, like Robert Ebert said, ""This is not a perfect movie; it meanders and ambles and makes puzzling detours."" but if you take a moment to see it, you'll clap for Zach Braff's job. Do I recommend this movie? Of course! If I was able to appreciate it, I'm sure many people would too (and no I'm not saying it to get a better grade!)."

","Garden State was very complex from the beginning because it had bizarre scene with the plane that was in turbulence and everyone is screaming in chaos while the protagonist who was played by Zach Braff as Andrew Largeman just sat there in his seat looking ahead emotionless. Instead of the natural reaction to turn around and panic with the crowd Andrew just acted if nothing was going on. From then on what I picked up was ""Is this the beginning of the movie or the ending?"" It was confusing and I didn't know what the movie was going to be about. Just by looking at the expressionless face that Andrew portrayed really made me feel like wanting to punch him in face and scream ""what's wrong with you!"" The scenes that I thought were irrelevant were the party scene and the whole scouting for the present issue. The first scene I mentioned is when Andrew Largeman goes to a party with his longtime friends and there are drugs involved. I believe it would have been a better movie without the whole drug scene because what my impression was ""not another drug movie"" like Harold and Kumar. The second part that I wasn't so thrilled about was when friend Mark (that was played by Peter Sarsgarrd) takes them scouting to find the present he wants to give Andrew. Then they happen to stumble upon the hotel and the porn scene. That had nothing to do with the characters and it was plain idiotic to have it in the film. If these two scenes weren't in the film I think it would have been better. What I found to make the film a heartfelt and a success was the relationship with Sam (played by Natalie Portman). The character Andrew showed more emotion with Sam because Andrew and Sam connected a lot and it showed a lot of heartwarming moments. For example when Andrew and Sam are in the tub together and Sam is trying to comfort Andrew because of his past experience of his mother was a very sentimental moment. If the plot didn't incorporate Andrew and Sam together then it would have missed a big element, As Tim Merril expresses ""The chemistry between Braff and Portman and their characters goes a long way, saving the film when it takes a few too many bizarre plot/location turns"" To be honest I had no idea what the movie was about because it was difficult to predict what was going to happen next, like the movie Inception that was filled with a lot of psychological elements and the plot was mind boggling. I really enjoyed the movie because it had a bunch of things that made me go in ""WOW, I didn't expect that to happen!"" It just shows how the character develops and gets out from the bottomless pit to awaken to a new world that was shut out. Garden State is an unforgettable film that really teaches the value of life and what journey each character goes through especially Andrew once he realizes what he has in his life is potential because her really didn't get to live life and experience everything around him. As Kevin Thomas puts it ""Illuminates a young man's overdue coming of age with unexpected depth and grace."""

","A Review of Garden State<br/><br/>I have never really been into you could say, ""lovey dovy"" or ""girly romantic"" films that have that same typical rhythm of love scenes that end up with that same corny ending. They usually start off with a couple that's madly in love; to someone or something intervening in the relationship; to kissing and making up to live happily ever after. Besides the fact that the film did not have those types of attributes, and that I'm a huge fan of the irresistibly adorable Natalie Portman, I can safely say that I really enjoyed the film Garden State. Zach Braff (the guy from scrubs)who plays (Largeman) and Natalie Portman who plays (Sam) display a mildly romantic, dry humorous performance that you don't normally see on your regular blockbuster night.<br/><br/>The first time I ever saw Natalie Portman was on the 1994 thriller, Leon: The Professional, where she plays this scrawny 12 year old girl that lives with a disturbing abusive family. It was obviously not the breakthrough of her career, but her potential certainly did catch the attention of many big shot Hollywood movie makers when you take a good look at her up-to-date achievements, which includes the Oscar Emmy Award she just won for her leading performance on Black Swan. Let's just say that without Portman's supporting role, I would be speaking otherwise about Garden State.<br/><br/>I'm not going to deny that I have enjoyed other comedy/romantic films like She's Out of My League or Just Friends, but let's admit that those films have the same typical role where the guy chases after the girl and eventually ends up with her. Garden State has more of a mellow pace to it. While the film does start off a bit on the down side by Largeman receiving the bad news of the passing of his mother, moments later opening his bathroom cabinet to dozens of anti-depressant pills, then flying to his hometown for the funeral, it does crawl its way up to some pleasant scenes and unexpected humor. I like that the film has this tranquil mellow flow to it. The way Largeman cruises down the streets of his hometown in this old sidecar motorcycle, which I think is hilariously cool by the way. It has these beautiful green sceneries of the humble neighborhoods that seem like the ideal place to raise a family. It just brings this peacefulness to the viewers. As Jesse Hassenger stated ""...the film's warmth sneaks up on you."" It wasn't that unpredictable that Largeman and Sam would end up falling for each other the moment they met at the Doc's office while the dog was humping Largeman's leg. But I love that the focus wasn't based on Largeman going out of his way to impress Sam, or either of them seeking an apology for something stupid they did. They both go with the flow of who they are without making things complicated. Sam is the cute girl next door type that just can't help from smiling or make others around her smile. She has this harmless side to her about compulsive lying, but in a humorous way. Largeman is just plain serious, and has this dry humor that makes viewers laugh almost effortlessly. Even on the most romantic part of the film by the fireplace where Largeman confesses to Sam that he likes her a lot, is turned humorous by Sam starting to tap dance.<br/><br/>The main aspect of the film was that Largeman wasn't very happy with where his life was going until he went back home. He right away felt comfortable after hanging out with his old friend Mark at a party and the next day meeting Sam. It almost seems that he has felt left out of everything, especially with all the medication he had been under. He finds out that he can care for others and others can care for him. There's this part where Mark asks Largeman to help him track down a going away present for Largeman. Largeman brings Sam along and the three of them go through the most awkward situations to track this item. Largeman gets frustrated, and finally shows some emotion to Mark of how he's not comfortable with Sam having to go through all that. It showed that Largeman really cares about Sam, and Sam seemed to find his emotions adorable.<br/><br/>The ending had to of course be dramatic by Largeman having to be in the plane to realize that he wants to stay with Sam. Does he really need to get in the plane to realize that? I guess! I do agree with Roger Ebert when he states ""This is not a perfect movie"" But what can you really expect from a film that was filmed in 25 days with a budget under $3,000,000.00. I say, ""not bad at all!"" This film can be found motivating by people who have been or currently are depressed. Especially for young people who feel neglected by their family or society itself. Overall, it's a very pleasant film, and would recommend anyone to sit down and enjoy it."
"alejandro-santibanez87","Null","0","0","24 October 2011"," My take on Garden State
","Garden State is a fairly good dramedy that your girlfriend forces on you to watch with her on those lazy Sundays. Zach Braff plays a numb twenty something year old waiter/actor that goes back home, after nine years of not having any contact with any of his friends and family, for his mother's funeral. The movie was fairly predictable, the typical coming of age story, where the main character has to find him-self to change his life. The film brings you in with weird humor by Natalie Portman as Sam and by the character growth that Zach Braff as Andrew Largeman experiences. A fairly weird but intriguing love story, which I enjoyed because of its unexpected moments and character development. Zach or ""Large"" is a young struggling actor in California who is emotionally disconnected from the world, due to a tragic event in his childhood. He's emotionless for the better part of the movie, even after parties and some drug use he still seems to be out in his own world. Just like in this sitcom show ""Scrubs"". Where he looks to the side and has a strange fantasy of some sort before coming back to the real world. Andrew being so emotionless through the scene were you see a reckless group of old high school friends together using drugs and playing sexual games amongst them, drew me into the movie more and more. I wanted to know why this guy is acting so weird. Why he's delaying to talk to his dad? What is he avoiding? Then the plot of the movie gets even weirder when ""Sam"" (Natalie Portman), a compulsive liar, comes into the movie, but with her she brings life into the film, making it more enjoyable to watch. All these questions are brought up so early in the film, that it makes you eager to find out all the answers. <br/><br/>Sam is beautiful, unpredictable, spontaneous and original. She catches Large's eye immediately at a doctor's office. They spend all this time back home together and the more they are together the more alive the movie and Large seem to get. Ann Hornaday talks about this in her critic ""Large begins to wake up, and the few days he spends with her"". I like how their difference's in characters allows them to be perfectly them self's with each other, creating that bond, that he will have to fight for and grow up from boy to man in order to keep. Even with Sam's randomness the movie drags from time to time, showing unnecessary dialog that's not geared to the transformation of Andrew Largeman character.<br/><br/>The most important part or turning point, is when Andrew shares the reason of his usage of prescription drugs by him explaining the cause of his mother's paraplegic sate made the film not only come together but showed the emotion that I had been waiting for this whole time. It was refreshing and made the movie interesting to me because it gave me hope like for the rest of the movie and I wasn't disappointed. Andrew had presence and weight as a character from this point on in the movie. <br/><br/>In my opinion, the most interesting plot of this movie was brought in by Andrew's grave robbing friend ""Mark"". He takes Andrew and Sam all over town on a hunt for a farewell present for Andrew. Most of the comical relief and character growth is done in this part of the film. Not only do Andrew and Sam grow, but also Mark has a change in his personality. Andrew is taken to this underworld of crime, the most bizarre places imaginable in this little town of Jersey. ""As an audience, we're interested in what outlandish character might emerge in the next scene"" writes Muller and that's exactly how I felt. After all the running around they end up in this boat or home of some sort that is located in a huge hole where a mall was going to be built. That's where Mark finally gets his gift for Andrew. In that same place is when Andrew showed all his frustration and emotion and lets it go by yelling in to the abyss of the hole. By the end of the movie I was all in. the characters grew on me and the plot that wasn't so strong in the beginning but it grew and came together. Andrew got his gift which was his mother's necklace. The ending was very predictable to me, I knew he was going to come back and stay with Sam she made him feel and for him that was very important, so it was nice to see that he cared for her as much as she did for him and that they felt that they needed each other to be happy because they could be themselves."
"zulemasaldana","Null","0","0","22 October 2011"," A part of the movie that really did't have no meaning at all.
","It really is so satisfying to know that even when a movie is destroyed by some parts it recovers what the movie was trying to project, by introducing Sam (Natalie Portman) when it really had lost the meaning of it. Sam comes in and they are both the opposite of each other, where Andrew had no idea of showing affection, Sam did all through her life she had her mother who showed her how to appreciate and love everything she had around her. it was clearly that Sam, even with her epileptic attacks, and her lies, really becomes the center of Andrew's life as they start knowing each other. Even though when Andrew starts telling Sam about the accident his mother had when he was growing up, and how for the first time one day he was crying and his mother gave him the sleeve of her sweater to clean his nose, he thought ""wow"" is this what love is and he felt for that moment that he was loved by his mother; Sam showed her love as they both hug each other and comfort one another this is the part that really said it all that the movie had a love meaning, even though Andrew didn't know how to cry or love, he had learned with Sam. It is obvious that there is love all through the movie when Andrew is getting ready to leave he goes with Mark (Peter Sarsgaard) where he is digging a grave and sees Mark stealing jewelry from the body that he is about to bury it is the time that Mark takes Andrew to a faraway place where Albert(Dennise O'Hare)gives him a pendent that belonged to his mother and Mark had taken and now he thought that Andrew should have it, that was a way of showing that he appreciated Andrew for being his friend. as they all spent time with Albert while they were getting the pendent they got to know Albert's wife and child, Albert told them that what he had in that place was all he needed to be happy and be somebody that no one had ever been that is when Andrew showed his love for Sam and kissed her as he is on top of a crane it was obviously that he had gotten inspired by Albert's speech which had reminded him of Sam in a earlier speech that she had with him."
"joan_na","Null","0","0","11 October 2011"," Garden State Critique
","Garden State marks Zach Braff's directorial debut in a full length feature movie, based on a story written by him, and starring himself. At first glance I saw the actor portrayed in Scrubs, a TV show where he plays an intern, then resident, at a hospital. It was, and continues to be, a popular show.The movie also stars Natalie Portman as Sam. Portman, anaturally adorable person which seems like the girl next door, plays his love interest in the movie. This relationship in the movie translates to a beautiful, but strange, story. The movie, though, seems to be an awakening of sorts for the protagonist, Andrew Largeman (Zach Braff). There is nothing conventional about the movie. The opening scene is on board a plane that seems destined to crash,and Largeman shows no emotion. This is due to Largeman being heavily medicated most of the time. As Roger Ebert mentions in his movie critique of Garden State, ""Andrew is awakening gradually from a long, sedated nothingness,"" therefore, giving the assumption he is on some sort of altered state all of the time. In the next scene Largeman is lying down in a white bed with white linens inside a white room listening to an answering machine recording of his father voice telling him his mom passed away, and Andrew does not immediately react to this news with any kind of sorrow or mournful expressions. He continues with his morning routine of taking his usual medication from a medicine cabinet that seems more like a drugstore. Largeman over-medicated lifestyle explains his blank stares, consequently, showing no emotion to the situations around him. The story continues in California where he is an out of work actor working as a waiter at a Vietnamese restaurant, but then, it takes us to his small hometown in New Jersey, where he attends his mom's funeral. Expecting to see a grieving son, he rarely shows emotions. This gives the viewer the notion of his detachment from that part of his life and not wanting to relive those painful memories. The story seems to get even more awkward the moment in the film when Largeman sees some of his old friends, who are digging his mom's grave. He realizes he is not the only one with problems, mental or otherwise. As he begins to run into more of his hometown friends, he recognizes that most of them are still living in the past. Living a life where there are no consequences. As Mick LaSalle, from the San Francisco Chronicle states, ""He finds that his friends haven't really changed; they're just more miserable. Everyone is at loose ends, caught in a slothful dead zone between college free-spiritedness and adult responsibility."" His underachieving friends, who engage in risky business and getting high, show Largeman his life is really not so meaningless. Portman's character, Sam, portrays Largeman's love interest in the movie. The relationship starts of rather unusual as they meet in a psychiatric clinic. They form a special bond as friend that grows throughout each scene more and more. Largeman sees Sam as a very important part of his life, but what he does not realize is that Sam needs him just as much. Throughout the movie I wanted to slap Andrew Largeman, and perhaps, he would wake up from the numb world he was living in, but Sam gives him this wakeup call. She was the medication he needed. Together they are complete and form a very special bond; apart they are aimlessly lost. What I really like about the movie is its universal message. We all have troubled times in our life, and we have to find a way to resolve them. We cannot hide from them by moving away nor can we try to just cover them up, as Largeman's father tries to do with the medication. We need to come to the realization of the problem and find a way to successfully overcome it, as Largeman realizes towards the end of the movie. Largeman states to Albert as he is leaving Albert's home in the quarry, ""Good luck exploring the infinite abyss."" It seems he is referring to himself. He will no longer be afraid of the future or see it in a negative way. His future is bright, with a new sense of worth."
"ajs-10","Null","0","0","13 September 2011"," Interesting stuff from Zach Braff...
","I really did not no much about this film before seeing it, well, I probably did know that Zach Braff (of TV's 'Scrubs' fame) both wrote and directed it. I watched it on a recommendation from someone on Rotten Tomatoes, sorry, I can't remember who, but rest assured, it's another one crossed off 'The List'. I found it very interesting, a little surreal in places, quite enjoyable, but in the end, not as fulfilling as I had expected. I'll explain more after this brief summary.<br/><br/>Andrew Largeman, a failed actor has had to return to the small town he grew up after the sudden death of his mother. He has anxiety problems and usually takes quite a lot of medication, but he has left all that behind in L.A. He runs into quite a few of his old friends from school, primarily Mark, Dave and Kenny, and they all hang out together, go to parties and the like. During a visit to a doctor, Andrew meets Sam and they immediately hit it off. He gives her a lift home and they end up spending the next few days together. This seems to bring Andrew back to life, but it's nearing the time he has to leave I'll stop there or the Spoiler Police will have me bang to rights! And I don't want that.<br/><br/>I must first say the film has a cracking soundtrack, there are some great tunes throughout. All the performances were very good; Zach Braff as Andrew Largeman, Natalie Portman, who I thought was excellent, as Sam, Peter Sarsgaard as Mark, Alex Burns as Dave, Michael Weston as Kenny, Ian Holm as Andrew's father, Gideon Largeman. Finally a mention for a brief appearance from Jim Parsons ('The Big Bang Theory') as Tim.<br/><br/>The film has a very muted feel to it which was fine at first, it allowed for small pieces of comic genius to flower, but after a while I began to find it a little depressing. Braff plays Largeman so downbeat from the beginning that by the end when you're supposed to be uplifted, you're still down somewhere near the floor. Don't get me wrong, there are many things to admire about this film and I did enjoy several aspects of it. I think I'll have to see it again sometime to appreciate it properly but for now Recommended (but only just).<br/><br/>My Score: 6.6/10.<br/><br/>IMDb Score: 7.8/10 (based on 104,531 votes at the time of going to press).<br/><br/>Rotten Tomatoes Score: 86/100 (based on 185 reviews counted at the time of going to press)."
"TheDarkKnight12","Null","0","0","11 April 2008"," Garden State - A Review
","So, Mr. Braff, from a relatively unknown actor to the (apparently) highest paid soap opera actor ever (130,000 dollars per episode) to the Writer and Director of 'Garden State'. A film documenting the life of a struggling young actor and his associated difficulties.<br/><br/>I struggle to believe that this film would have received such widespread acclaim if Zach Braff wasn't so well known. And, of course, the (rather surprise) inclusion of esteemed actress Natalie Portman makes this film what it is. That being said, I still love this movie and am so glad it has made the waves it has done.<br/><br/>So, why is this movie good? I would give it 7 or 8 out of ten. I don't know much about Camera shots or Character Development or general movie production stuff so I'm not going to comment on the aesthetic or juxtaposition of scenes/dialogue/character interaction in any great depth.<br/><br/>Much like Lost in Translation (For me, anyway) this film doesn't really have a plot at all. In fact, it's hard to pick out one stand out sequence which really sticks in my head. But, I still really like Lost in Translation. And this leads me onto my first point. The Soundtrack.<br/><br/>Zach Braff hand picked these songs, unsurprisingly for his own film. And as a result, send a complete CD of the track listing to potential actors to give them an idea of the feel of the movie. And it's so important since there really isn't a 'feel' to this movie. It's such a calm, introverted, back-story of self discovery, recollection and analysis that rather than an 'in-your-face' obvious, and logical progression in the form of 'Beginning, Middle and End' and that's what makes this film so important. Braff's character is highly medicated with anti-depressants and has been for years. And I think this is what most people who dislike this film, might not understand. The entire point is that his medication has numbed him from the world, from his own emotion, from living a life and music provides inspiration to the acting itself.<br/><br/>For me personally, this film is about the hopelessness of reaching adulthood whereby everything leads up to a point where you either make, break or figure out why things maybe haven't worked out quite how you wanted them to be. It's about partying when you're young, where everyone is 'someone' and you're part of this tight knit friendship group and it's the potential for your life when you grow up which keeps friendships fresh. Unfortunately, when you're older and you've not really achieved anything and everyone is in the same boat, it's a bit like going home to see old friends and wonder how they are. Only, when you go back you realise nothing has changed.<br/><br/>The main point of this film is that Zach Braff's character felt forced to leave home since his Dad made his feel guilty for his Mum's paralysis and since then he can't live a normal life due to the guilt and shame he feels (And of course, his medication, which may in fact be the thing that's largely preventing him from moving on).<br/><br/>It takes the death of his Mother for him to return home. And following this he meets Natalie Portman's character, with whom he falls in love. And he meets and old best friend of his, who isn't actually getting anywhere with his life, and seems completely contented with this which reassures Zach Braff's character.<br/><br/>Overall, since I could type away about this movie all day, but I'm probably boring people, this movie isn't about anything concrete or material. It isn't about self-discovery or love or taking chances or happiness or romance or friendship. It's purely and simply one mans struggle with himself to overcome an obstacle and burden he should never have been forced to bear as a child which as a result has left him confused, alone and unable to properly interact or achieve success in life. And all in all, he realises that he should never have been made to feel guilty, and as a result can get on with his life. And rather fortunately, the presence of Natalie Portman's character, who is utterly charming, provides the trigger for him to be released from his depression."
"colettesplace","8","0","0","14 March 2006"," a coming of age rom com with character as well as quirk
","The first feature from writer, director and actor Zach Braff is a quirky but sincere film that transcends its traditional romantic comedy structure.<br/><br/>Braff stars as Andrew Largeman, a 26-year-old washed up actor who's been zoned on lithium for 16 years, courtesy of an over-zealous shrink father (Sir Ian Holm). When Andrew returns home for his mother's funeral, he quits the pills and reunites with school pal Mark (Peter Sarsgaard), a gravedigger who collects Desert Storm trading cards, and meets Sam (Natalie Portman), a fearless, expressive inspiration of a girl.<br/><br/>It's Andrew's gradual thawing from his numbed existence into a full and participatory life that's so beautiful in this film. His interaction with Sam is natural and revelatory, and the humour is both spontaneous and believable.<br/><br/>Where Garden State is least successful is in Andrew re-negotiating his relationship with his father, but this sentiment doesn't overshadow the resonance of the rest of this film.<br/><br/>Garden State is a rare cinematic experience  a commercially successful independent film that's heart-warming, but not irritating, memorable but not a guilty pleasure, significant, but about insignificant people, and humorous without being (too) derivative."

","Thought this film was great. I'm a great fan of scrubs, Zach Braff is a brilliant actor/writer/director. I felt the acting by Natalie Portman is brilliant (if only she was this good in Star Wars) if someone like Sam came into my life I could spend hours with them. This movie speaks a lot post-modern people and the focus on individualism at the moment. The frustration of being defined by yourself and relationships with your peers. The moment when they scream down into the cavern just sums up the whole inner feelings of people in my generation (i was born in 1983).<br/><br/>The idea about the lack of home is also true. You get the feeling Andrew is navigating his way around his hometown as soon as he arrives back. I've had the same experience returning home. The fact he can't cry is something i can relate to. Braff is opening up a style of post-modern movie from a new generation, in a way similar to David Kelly (but not as bizarre).<br/><br/>I look forward to seeing some more films from Braff and upcoming director/writers, lets just hope Hollywood isn't stupid and reject this next generation of film makers."

Jesus Christ, how many more films do we need with twentysomethings who can't get over the whole 'there must be something bigger than this' problem? it's the reason that douglas coupland still makes a ruck of cash for knocking out the same story he's been doing since generation x. i loved his books up to and including girlfriend in a coma, but tired of the fact that imagery aside, they all say THE SAME THING. but the amount of awards and praise heaped on this kind of film just makes me lose my faith in people. the questions that this movie pose have been raised hundreds of times before, and without the snivelling lightweight soundtrack that accompanies it as well. watch it if there's NOTHING else for you to do, and even then only for the shirt that gets made out of the leftover material from the bathroom redecoration. otherwise, don't bother."

","Garden State is heartfelt and amusing on a small scale. There are numerous mildly clever lines and shots. The first hour flies by and absorbs the viewer with its deadpan look at mid-20s angst. The film drags a bit in its second hour. The final half-hour of the film is disappointing - instead of trying to resolve any of its interesting plot lines, the film becomes a simple ""Will-he-or-won't-he?"" love story. Braff is solid as the bland, quiet center of the film. Portman annoys initially, coming across as forced, but settles into a groove as she stops trying to convince us her character is eccentric. The side characters provide most of the humor. The love story is well-played and believable. A good film that could have been great, and is worth seeing. Zack Braff's combined contributions to this film are impressive enough to make me curious to see his next project."

Why, oh why it had to be so short. I mean, the editing and the story was all great, but i believe that the audience needed something more. It should dig more into the characters, it should explain some things it didn't quite well explain (see; the void, the ark, the necklace). It should be at least a 120min film. That way everything would be perfect. The story would have a more natural continuity and everyone would be happy. Two people we can blame. Either the writer for not writing a more complete script or the studio for not allowing the film to exceed the 90 minutes of runtime. Well, this is air-talk now. It was a good film and this is all that matters."

","Zach Braff put forth an exceptional effort in his directorial/writing debut about a forced-out son (Braff) who returns to his New Jersey home after a decade for his mom's funeral, only to meet the one girl (Portman) that made him feel again. <br/><br/>The movie flowed very well, and the characters were believable. I will admit that I despise the standard romantic comedy, but this was far from standard. The bittersweet approach to the romantic story by the characters made this movie more than tolerable for me, it made the movie downright lovable.<br/><br/>The only bit of resistance I have towards the movie comes from the overall feel I got from it. It seemed to be Lost In Translation meets Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind in a few aspects. Andrew Largeman could be compared to Joel Barish in that they both have difficulties with emotions and feeling happy/satisfied (clearly for two very separate reasons). And Sam could be compared to Clementine through the ideas that they were both very quirky, fumbling, but also very cute (again, through different ways). And this movie reminds me of Lost In Translation primarily because it's about two people who meet each other and through the course of a few days, manage to change each other's life. Granted, the ending here is a bit different from the ending in Lost In Translation, but the similarities are hard for me to ignore.<br/><br/>I give high praise to Braff for this movie. It's nearly flawless, and that's a feat for any a veteran director/writer. I give it an 8/10 solely because I felt something at the end, but it wasn't something I haven't experience before."

","Have you seen ""Scrubs"" yet? If not, then you should really be ashamed of yourself. It's one of the best shows to come around in years, and NBC has treated it like crap, so here we get to see why that show is so brilliant because stars make the shows and Zach Braff shows why he's one of the most underrated comic talents in showbiz today. I like Zach Braff a lot, so when ""Garden State"" came around, I took a chance and made a blind buy (buying without having seen the film) on the DVD, and, not surprisingly, I wasn't disappointed, as a matter of fact I was shocked at how utterly accomplished Braff has become.<br/><br/>""Garden State"" is further proof to why ""Scrubs"" is such an underrated mistreated property. Directed by, written by, and starring Braff, he plays twenty - something out of work actor Andrew Largeman, a young man whose sleepwalking his way through a heavily medicated life of hazy dreams and meaningless benign events of monotony and routine and basically doesn't know where it all is ending or beginning for him through his work as a pretend Asian man, and his medicine cabinet stacked through the brim with anti-depressants, but when his mom dies, he's forced to break out of his life and go back home to Garden State where he is forced to communicate to his emotionally non-existent father (well played performance from Sir Ian Holm), re-unites with his stoner friends, experiences a sort of spiritual re-awakening, and gains a new perspective on life through a beautiful charismatic girl Sam.<br/><br/>Sam, played by Natalie Portman, is a character wise beyond her years and meets Andrew through a series of odd events one day at a hospital and instantly the two forms a bond that emanates throughout the entire movie. Braff pulls off their romance with enough pace to get the audience involved and actually care for the two people in front of us, and I actually wanted to see if they'd get together, or if they'd fall in love and Braff works their romance in well with the coming of age story which is utterly bittersweet through the whimsical folly Braff brings to the big screen with so much charm.<br/><br/>The direction is great, the script is so very good and the dialogue is so funny, quirky, and original. The conversations between characters here are never forced or trite, it's always so simple but so entertaining to watch and Braff has a knack for dialogue here. Braff accomplishes something here that hasn't been accomplished in the past years. You also can't help but love the characters here including Braff who is so hilarious with his wide-eyed and shocked expressions at the life he left behind at home. His best reaction is when someone confronts him and says ""I thought you killed yourself"" to which he replies, ""No"" with a stunned expression. He takes everything in stride and everyone in acknowledgement of how completely weird they are and winces at everything, which in turn makes us wince and laugh aloud at Braff who gives a great performance here.<br/><br/>Portman gives one of the best performances of her career in an underrated role as Sam, the enthusiastic girl with a child-like sensibility to life with smiles and stories as she carries on like a ten year old looking for attention and acceptance. She's innocent and adorable here, and becomes one of the best characters in the film. Peter Sarsgaard is great here with the supporting role of stoner/friend Mark who just absorbs the two main characters. Sarsgaard is fun to watch here as he is every movie, and I gotta tell ya, I'd watch this dude in anything.<br/><br/>Braff manages to make the simplest imagery look so utterly funny and out of this world, for example the one scene where a guest of his mom's funeral made him a shirt out of the remaining wall carpet of their bathroom. The odd and utterly surrealistic images we're presented with are amplified through the simply great direction from Braff, and the eccentricity that flows through the characters and utterly plain backdrop of New Jersey is so resonant and charming that you can't help but smile throughout the entire film feeling as if you've seen a sublime piece of food for the soul."

","Overall, this is a movie that people should see. However, there were some things about it that bothered me. The first, that some of the situations seemed contrived -- Andrew's last conversation with his father and the airport ending come to mind. The actors and the direction made both scenes the best that they could possibly be, but I still watched with the feeling that everything was being tied up too neatly -- that this character, who had spend over 15 years on medication would be so self-aware, so receptive toward (welcoming of) what he was beginning to feel, and most of all, so articulate in expressing those feelings. The ending just didn't match the flow of the film -- easy storytelling met with abrupt resolution. <br/><br/>Still, I think the movie was beautiful. The camera work wasn't the pretentious, confusing hand-held and grainy that we sometimes see in these coming of age (of age) stories -- I liked how it stuck to tradition in terms of framing, in terms of tracking. The editing was interesting without being schizophrenic. The scene with the ""fast food knight"" was hilarious -- additionally, the scene where Andrew and Sam first meet was very genuine. The dialogue was very smart, and not cheesy (for the most part -- but then, what movie is completely without cliché?).<br/><br/>I think that the acting was wonderful.

And I was afraid that being almost 40 and missing a lot of the Gen Y stuff (and even Gen X stuff), I might find this unrelatable. <br/><br/>But in the end I did find it completely endearing. Maybe it's because everyone in the flick had elements of people I've known. <br/><br/>The fact that our hero can't shed a tear from the medications. I've known people like that. I've known people that doped up for so long they've lost their feelings decades ago. <br/><br/>The tension between parents and children over past turmoils. Been there.<br/><br/>And even the weird loser turned fluke millionaire. Known a few of those in my lifetime.<br/><br/>I thought it was a touching first effort with lots of great tension releasing humor. I can't wait to see what Zach is capable of next."
"playingkarrde","Null","0","0","12 November 2004"," Almost brilliant
","First time director, writer and comedy star Zach Braff takes on a weighty task to deliver an unmissable and genuine movie, but has trouble making it last.<br/><br/>The themes and overall idea behind Garden State is not one of particular originality, yet Braff seems adamant to take it beyond a simple ""boy comes home to discover his true self"" plot. The focus is on Braff in more ways than one in this movie and so his ambititousness is noted.<br/><br/>The movie begins with some brilliant characterisation and fantastic film making. The first half of the movie is alive with interesting characters and some genuinely heartfelt moments. Natalie Portman shines like we haven't seen since Leon and the introduction of many other unique characters is both incredibly funny and telling of Braff's depth into the story.<br/><br/>However, midway during the movie the writing and direction takes a bit of a nosedive. No longer are we allowed to see anything of Portman's character as she was built up to be, instead she is denigrated to tag along girlfriend whilst Braff goes on his self discovery journey that we all knew was (although hoped wouldn't) coming.<br/><br/>I am a big fan of Zach Braff though, indeed he was the reason I wanted to see the movie. However his lack of experience in taking on a project of this scale shows as we are left with half of an otherwise brilliant movie. Scrubs is now well into it's fourth season but I am hoping that someone can nurture Braff's writing and directing talent to give him the longevity that many other writer/directors don't have as we have moments of genius, both in his obviously great handle on comedy (although interestingly most of the moments are not directed at his character) as well as allowing the viewer to feel some really true moments.<br/><br/>Ian Holm and supporting cast are excellent where allowed to be, Natalie Portman is again outstanding when given room and Braff, well lets just say he is just Zach Braff and allow that time to mature.<br/><br/>Watch it and love it, but don't be too disappointed when it takes a downward turn and you will be pleasantly surprised."

","I had pretty high expectations going into this film, and they were all met. If I had not seen Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, I would have said that this was the best film I saw all year. There was just something about this film that clicked with me. There was just something about it that made me not want it to end. It was easy to understand and connect with the characters. I felt very much at ease watching it, if that makes any sense at all. While the symbolism was obvious, it was not heavy handed and certainly not overdone. The movie spoke clearly, but not to the point where I felt like yelling, ""Thanks, I get it"" at the screen. Visually the film was extremely successful. And you might have thought it would be difficult to make a beautiful film in New Jersey. I can of course make those kinds of jokes because I was born there. But Garden State was simply a beautiful film accompanied by a beautiful soundtrack. The script was well written; both funny and touching. The person who I saw Garden State with complained that there was not enough plot. She complained that there was nothing substantial to it. Well, I disagree. I think that she missed the point. I found the plot to be an interesting concept, and I believe that the part that made it great was not so much the plot as the dialogue and the characters. It's a simple, honest story that is told beautifully. I left the theatre feeling different from when I went in, which I guess is part of what I'm looking for when I see a film."

The whole movie was surreal but the constant lack of reality made it seem more real.<br/><br/>Kind of the same thing as in the movie Big Fish.

Beautifully acted, especially by Natalie Portman (who knew she could act, after all those crummy Star Wars movies?)Zack Braff isn't going to be in sitcoms very long, with a writing and directing talent like his. I especially enjoyed the way his characters had their stories dragged out of them slowly, engaging the viewer instead of just throwing everything in your face.

","***POSSIBLE SPOILERS*** ""Garden State"" succeeds primarily in its delightful execution: its convenient, personal, conventional style while retaining a unique peculiarity that is simple yet intelligent. There are plenty of touching, funny allusions to contemporary society here, as the characters, their conflictions and environments represent a little piece of modern America. The players include: the antisocial junkies who simply live for themselves, the quirky, spontaneous ""girl next door"" (Natalie Portman), the free-spirited dopamines, and the still-searching, hapless young adult, struggling to find his own existence. The story revolves around Andrew Largeman, the latter of these characters, who ""can't shed a tear for his mother's unexpected death"" and is struggling to make something for himself years after his minor role on a television show, which happens to be the only achievement he is recognized for. So ensues an unpredictable, enjoyable odyssey of love, reconciliation, and self discovery in Largeman's quest to become SOMEBODY. Funny, intelligent, and enjoyable, though not too inspiring or in any ways virtuous, ""Garden State"" delivers at the very least a thoughtful message about the fates of life and how we respond and develop ourselves through acquaintances, reflections, and self understanding. ""This is life. This is it."" (Andrew Largeman) This film and its value is as simple and universal as that: don't choose to question life, but instead, merely accept what you are given and live the best you can. ***1/2 OUT OF ****"

","Movie trailers rarely prepare you for what a film really 'feels' like, and that was the case for me with Zach Braff's mini-gem, 'Garden State'. Also, comparing it to another film (Lost In Translation) is quite misleading too. Honestly, it was the eclectic soundtrack, and the chance to see Miss Portman in something other than Star Wars, was what drove me to go see this movie.<br/><br/>The film starts off very somber and slowly (the main character, Andrew Largeman, portrayed by Zach Braff, returns home after his mother's death), but it picks up by turns and events. The biggest of these is the later introduction of Natalie Portman as Andrew's love interest, and for me illustrated perfectly the saying, 'For every ending, their is also a new beginning'. <br/><br/>To not give too much info away here, I just want to say that the film is a great story of one young man's personal odyssey in coming to grips with his own life, and on his own terms. And that this film has everything I look for -- a good, entertaining story; interesting people and situations; some laughs; some tears; some 'brain food' to munch on for later. In short, this movie touched on every emotion and neuron in me. <br/><br/>THANK-YOU, ZACH!"

I don't think there's anything that hasn't been said before in this movie, but there are still parts of it that one can relate to. As someone who had to go home for the funeral of a parent and deal with the same kind of family and friend issues, I saw a lot in this that I could relate to. It wasn't pretentious or trying too hard, it was just there. It said what needed to be said without the fanfare, which is how things really happen. I didn't care too much for the ""screaming-into-the-abyss"" bit, and the very end could have been better, but that doesn't prevent you from becoming involved in the story. And P.S.

","This movie is definitely worth seeing. However, in its tempo and style it reminded me a lot of another flick set in New Jersey...The Station Agent. The characters have quirky and often likable flaws (except perhaps for the gravedigger, but that is o.k. too). The movie does start out slow, with the audience straining to care about the characters, but it eventually settles in. The movie sorta seems like the Big Chill for twenty or thirtysomethings, and in that sense it is somewhat cliché of all such movies (i.e. a flawed character comes home to confront a death, and magically discovers something they've been missing over the weekend). Portmann and Braff were good, but Ian Holm is completely wasted in an undeveloped father figure and is a long way from the Shire or Henry V."

Zach Braff has proved that he has Hollywood staying power with this hilarious but heavy romantic dramedy that he not only stars in, but also wrote and directed. <br/><br/>Braff's writing is very refreshing. The dialouge in this movie doesn't make the characters seem unbelievable, which is something I have a problem with in SOME indie movies about young people. The 20-somethings in this movie have meaningful dialouge without sounding like they have researched the exact thing to say four months in advance. I think all the main characters are well-developed and come off as very likable, at least at the end.<br/><br/>Oh, one thing to mention is that this film is FUNNY! Yes, it is about a struggling actor who comes back to New Jersey after a nine year absence to bury his mother, where he finds all of his friends coked up and in dead end jobs, however, I found myself laughing OUT LOUD several times.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman's character, Sam, is one of the best film characters I have seen in a long time. She is funny, likable, charming but doesn't come off as contrived. She is a sweet animal lover who can be insecure about her family and past. I honestly wanted to pluck her from the screen and take her home with me. The only negative thing that I can say about this movie is that Braff may have outdone himself. The scenes were each so unique and charming that I hope he has something left for a follow up.<br/><br/>I really, really liked this film.

","Who would have thought that the unassuming kid from Scrubs would turn around and create such a poignant, funny, unassuming film? In the same vein as Rushmore and Napoleon Dynamite, Zach Braff's deadpan, existential Garden State is an outstanding debut. Braff (who also wrote and directed) stars as Andrew Largeman, a heavily sedated actor who returns home for the first time in a decade for his mother's funeral. Largeman's claim to fame is that he once played a retarded athlete in a MOW. While Braff's character observes life through lithium-glazed eyes and a passive attitude, Garden State is filled with energetic and unpredictable characters. Stellan Sarsgaard plays a moody grave digger who steals jewelry off the corpses he buries; and Natalie Portman brings an adorable depth and humor to Sam, an epileptic, pathological liar who slowly falls in love with Largeman. All of Braff's characters are effortlessly likable as they continuously take stock of their lives and struggle with their angst. There's a particularly hilarious scene involving a hardware store employee trying to bring Largeman in on a pyramid scheme that should make everyone wonder what happened to the people they lost touch with after high school. The film's real trick though is the way it lets a lot of exposition hang in the air without forcing the story forward, relying instead on wonderfully funny gags, a thoughtful soundtrack and smart dialogue. Nothing is made of Sam's condition, or Sarsgaard's disturbing habits. Even Largeman's relationship with his psychiatrist (who also happens to be his father) is allowed to unfold rather matter-of-factly. It's a decision that can backfire very easily. But Garden State pulls it off and leaves you anticipating Braff's next move."

Braff returns home for mom's funeral after long absence, hangs with deadbeat friends, meets Portman, tries to sort out life. As we go along layers are stripped off each main character. Slice of life is good stuff for me, but when it gets too quirky too often it becomes cute rather than real, I would vote we got close but never quite went over the line. Braff is fine in reactive role, took me a while to warm up to Portman and to buy the leads' chemistry but I was becoming a believer towards the end.

","Garden State doomed itself with it's impressive marketing. Yes, that sounds odd. Shouldn't it be the other way around? Well, by doomed I mean it set a standard it couldn't meet. The marketing will make Garden State a modest gross for its size. The trailer that caught your eye back in February tries here to show that it can be more than just a three-minute collection of the film's best quirky moments. Of course there is something more than a surreal sounding song by Frou Frou but the emotions that emulate here are not as subtle and artfully brought out as they were there.<br/><br/>Zack Braff makes his directorial debut here with a film that combines The Graduate with The Odyssey. Braff has obviously seen The Graduate and has let it inspire him. I don't think he's used to much of the existing material here and that Garden State has enough other original aspects that it's not something people should make a big stink about. The screenplay in question is actually far from the quality of The Graduate. It's overdone in an attempt to be simple. Each character presents a new use for their stereotype but they are still stereotypes nonetheless. The humor is honest and this film that could have a dark cloud hanging over the audience is actually surprisingly funny.<br/><br/>As a director, Braff is too obvious. He's presence is in every scene and not the way M. Night Shyamalan has a presence in a trademark sense but more he goes over the top on director's gags such as color and scene construction. He spends so much time trying to capture reality and is almost on to something when he goes to a very director's shot and we are pulled out of the quirky reality and put back in the movie theater.<br/><br/>It's nice to see that all the actors were top notch here despite their lack of good source material. Peter Sarsgaard, although his character isn't quite what it was in Shattered Glass, he is perfectly cast in this role of Braff's old friend who now does drugs and digs graves. Braff is not new or original with his performance but he keeps things moving and has potential to be good in the future. Natalie Portman may finally be making sense to me. Before all she has been is flat and annoying but with this and her turn in last years Cold Mountain, she's making a comeback form Star Wars.<br/><br/>Garden State wants to be original and quirky. It's not really either. It also wants to be a sweet love story that shows the values of friends and family. Despite a mediocre script and some obvious errors in continuity with the editing, Garden State is a great story about what we leave behind and who we become because of them. ***1/2/*****"

Peter Sarsgaard is also impressive as the shifty friend who may not treat others well, but treats himself much worse. It's also nice to see Natalie Portman playing her age, rather than a woman wise beyond her years, for once. Great work all around."

","Having seen a preview showing in San Diego / Hillcrest this past week, and then listening to Zach Braff talk after the showing and answering many probing questions, I am even more impressed with his first time directing/writing/movie acting debut. I expect many future gems from Zach over the years.<br/><br/>As he talked about this film after the viewing, I could see how much he's put in to it, and how in real life he is a lot like the character he plays on Scrubs. He mentioned how painful it was to cut at least 45 minutes from the film, which should make for a very good future DVD with the deleted scenes intact. <br/><br/>He told a very funny story about how a mutual friend knew of this masturbating dog, and they just had to find a way to work him in to the movie. There's actually a couple of scenes with dogs in the movie. Apparently the camerman stood with the dog all day to get the shot, and the dog, a bit nervous for the cameras, was not doing his thing on cue as usual.<br/><br/>Camped in a house, camera training on the dog, waiting, the rest of the crew was shooting a scene outside. Out comes the cameraman finally after all day in the house with the dog, thumbs up, smoking a cigarette - ""Got the shot man !"".<br/><br/>This movie hits on many levels - good acting, even better script, and tight camera work. And all on a 2 1/2 million dollar budget shot in 45 days. Superb job Zach. Everyone should see this film."

","Zach Braff has pulled off the indie dramedy with flying colors. I think we've all been spoiled by ""Lost in Translation""'s exercise in restraint, and I don't feel that should sully what Zach Braff has done here. It is a remarkable first feature, with no art school nonsense. What surprised me most was how well-directed it was. I expected an at-least-decent script, but I did not expect style to be used to such great effect (especially in the opening scenes). The script itself was actually a bit disjointed, but it was honest, and (again) the debut of an unexperienced director. I was touched by this movie, and I laughed more than a few times. Note how seamlessly Braff switches the mood with color and body language. Also note the indie rock/folk soundtrack. If you like that.

"abelonline","8","0","0","14 July 2004"," beautifully shot, well written, funny, touching debut
","Saw this at a screening last night in Atlanta with Zach Braff in attendance, so it was followed with a little Q&A. The movie itself was great - beautifully shot, beautifully set (no one set used more than once, by the way) and well art directed - lush and interesting without being ""over art-ed"" like Wes Anderson films (which is a style and a director I also love). The story line and characters that populate Braff's suburbia are both realistic and absurd, tragic and lovable - even creepy and despicable at times - all wrapped up in one - kind of like real life. Braff lets the scenes become scenes, appropriately framing and letting the actors do their stuff. After the show, Braff said he strives for two things that really came across on film - 1) he shoots for performance, not continuity - not that I noticed any gaffes, but the key is that he is looking for the best performance from his actors, and finds it more often than not. 2) He shoots hoping that a viewer could stop the film on any frame, print it and hang it on the wall. This film is damn close. Even with the film geek-infused Q&A session (""I noticed some connections between this film and Camus' The Stranger. Was that intentional?"" ""Huh? I'm not really well read""), this movie was a great experience. I can't wait to see it again to relive it and to zero in on the bits and pieces I missed. I love Scrubs, but I hope Zach keeps making movies like this one for some time to come."
"littlemissknowitall","8","0","0","7 July 2004"," Charming and introspective
","Garden State is one of those gentle, introspective films that rarely get made, and when they do rarely work. It is (as studio execs turning down the script apparently told Braff) ""execution dependent"". As is evidenced by the fact that two of those same studios are now bringing the film to theaters, the execution works.<br/><br/>It's not a film for everyone. It has no desire to meet audience expectations in the old-school ""if you see a gun hanging on the wall in the first act, it better have been fired before the final curtain"" rule of theatre. Don't expect Scrubs-style one liners. (If I had to compare this film to a TV series it would be Six Feet Under.) It is in no way a straight-ahead comedy. Its most powerful moments are often silent, shared understanding between characters.<br/><br/>If you're willing to settle in for the long haul it is very rewarding, despite its flaws (it's a first time film, it's gonna have 'em). It put me in mind of Tom Gilroy's indie film of a few years ago, Spring Forward. Though I have to say Garden State felt more consistent than I remember that film being.<br/><br/>The acting is great. Peter Sarsgaard is particularly impressive. <br/><br/>I would have liked to have seen more of Ian Holm as the father, though I qualify this by saying I think the movie is truer as it is. I felt the need for some information and set up that the film never found an opportunity to provide vis a vis Large's father's intentions and desires for his family. When they are revealed they are, while not unbelievable, a surprise (not a dramatic revelation, either, just something the audience didn't know). But the movie is committed to being from Large's point of view, which I can't fault, and as a result we don't get as far into the hearts and minds of other characters, especially one Large is avoiding!<br/><br/>Garden State is definitely what the studios call summer counter-programming, but I hope people in those cities it gets released in will take a break from Spiderman 2 and the rest of the blockbusters, and check it out.<br/><br/>****SPOILER****<br/><br/>A word about the ending - I liked the ending. I believed it, although I didn't feel the need for it to be quite so dramatic. I would have been happy if he'd made his decision on the steps.<br/><br/>Listening to friends and other people talk about it there were some common themes. Some wondered why Sam (Natalie Portman) couldn't just go with Large (i.e. why the female character didn't give up her home, job and ambitions to be with the male character. Might be some unconscious sexism, but audiences are also used to secondary characters giving up their dreams to support protagonists, so I give 'em the benefit of the doubt.) As with other conventions Garden State doesn't care, and I applaud it for that. I'd have been disappointed if Large had invited Sam out to Tinseltown and she had said yes.<br/><br/>Others wanted him to stay on the plane. I argue that the whole point of the third act (and despite Braff and other's comments to the contrary I think the film does fall rather neatly into three acts: act two begins with meeting Sam/the doctor's office, and ends with the scream from the Ark) is that Large has found his way out of his rut. He's not avoiding his life anymore. <br/><br/>Others were uncomfortable with the unfinished quality of the ending. As in real life, the characters are not done growing. Their story arcs have not resulted in some perfect understanding that we are to believe will govern their actions for the rest of their lives. We could easily come back and visit Large in a few years and have another movie, just as messy, just as complicated.<br/><br/>In the spirit of Decline of the American Empire/The Barbarian Invasions, I kind of hope we do."

","Garden State, Zach Braff's freshman hyphenated outing (writer-director-star), explores the complicated experiences of being disconnected and reconnected in places and ways we don't expect. Bigger than a baby's fist but smaller than a breadbox, the film aspires to (and largely achieves) high production values without compromising its unusual storytelling style and colorful characters. I find this combination rather rare - and refreshing - in US films.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman is luminous. Her portrayal of Sam is touching, funny, and truly the work of an actress coming into the strengths we've always believed she had. <br/><br/>The rest of the supporting cast is more than serviceable, populating the film with quirks both familiar and discomfiting but always real and drawn from the heart. <br/><br/>If you like to think a little while munching your popcorn, I'd recommend this film. While there are definite tell-tale signs of both a first-time writer and a first-time director (and worse, the combination of writer-director-actor wherein some checks and balances are removed), the film nonetheless delivers a solid movie-going experience. Congrats to the team who delivered it to us!"

","I knew nothing about this film until I attended the screening at UCLA, and I am very glad I did, because I was able to experience the creativity of Zach Braff. <br/><br/>Garden State was refreshing, brilliant, and strikes a chord with the ""20-something"" generation. A good chord.<br/><br/>The first scene does a good job at presenting us with the state of mind that the character Andrew Largeman ""Large"" has been in for the past several years as a 20-something year old...who has been taking his psychologist father's prescribed medication since the age of 10. He wakes up to a living ""coma"", with a not-so-good life. He leaves LA to go finally go back home to New Jersey for his mother's funeral after years of alienation from his family. It is here that he stops taking his medication, and we see how ""Large"" sees life with a little bit less sarcasm as the medicated drugs clear from his system.<br/><br/>It's very humorous and genuine to watch the first encounter with Natalie Portman's character Sam. It is so offbeat and random, but you just can't help but enjoy watching her performance, as the gist of the movie has its own weird random moments. The interesting vignettes really bring an insight to how everything else is seen through the eyes of Large.<br/><br/>Braff does a brilliant job with the dialogue, delivering a sarcastic numbness with witty humor. It's just very impressive that he wrote and directed this film. I could not stop thinking about how well the script was written. With such wit and such warmth, this movie cannot be categorized as just a comedy or as just a drama. Garden State touches upon different categories and it touches upon the worries of everyday life that people of this generation embrace. <br/><br/>With a very low budget and 25 days of filming this movie, the sum of the parts are much greater than the whole, if not more. Braff's down-to-earth script, the great soundtrack, and the exceptional acting from the supporting cast puts this movie at the top of my list along with Eternal Sunshine."

","Having watched the teaser trailer for Zach Braff's GARDEN STATE an embarassing number of times, I expected the worse.  But, the film doesn't disappoint.  It's weird, a little stilted at times, sure, but there's something to it.<br/><br/>Largeman (Braff) heads home after 9 years to attend his mother's funeral. Everybody recognizes him as that guy who played a retarded quarterback in that movie.  He's been on prescription medication forever, and he's kind of a zombie when we first see him.  But, along comes this girl to make him re-evaluate his life... yada yada.  <br/><br/>The best thing about GARDEN STATE is it's direction.  I like the way the images linger.  The performances are effective, especially by Braff, whose character's slow snapping-out-of-it process is convincing, and Natalie Portman; their scene in the rain is a thing of beauty.  Sweet relationship. I'm still not sure the last scene works; actually, I know it doesn't.  We clearly understand, from the dialogue on the steps, what is said in the very next scene, without it having to be spelled out."

","Garden State is a noble effort, which occasionally touches greatness but then drops the ball in the last five minutes.  I went to a screening of this movie in NY and greatly enjoyed myself.  Zach Braff has a great eye and a truly wry and interesting sense of humor, both visually and with the dialogue.  The banter is inspired, however, the longer speeches need some work.  I don't want to give away the ending, but I will say that for such a strange and wonderful movie, which is one of the few that really taps into the weird ennui of being a twenty-something returning to your hometown, it turns oddly trite and emotionally unsatisfying in the final five minutes. As if he knew he only had a few minutes left of film and was trying to give the audience a satisfying ending.  But it didn't fit.  That said... Natalie Portman gives the best performance I've seen from her since her near perfect turns in Beautiful Girls and The Professional.  Ian Holm was wonderful, as always.  Zach Braff, ambitiously taking the helm as director, writer, and actor works ably at all three, and definitely has a long and prosperous future in whatever avenue he chooses.  Overall, well worth seeing, I just wish Mr. Braff had the courage to trust his audience to understand the subtext and leave his characters with less explicitly spelled out at the end."

","This film started off with a lot of promise.  We were clearly and humorously introduced to the character of Andrew Largeman, a 20-something completely disconnected from the world due to a lifetime of taking prescription anti-depression drugs.  However, after a certain pivotal scene in which he meets Sam (Natalie Portman), the film loses its edge and its pacing.  The dialogue goes from clever to mundane and the film works too hard to *tell* rather than *show* the alleged transition that Largeman goes through.  He starts as disconnected, then for awhile, becomes merely *mellow*, and then quite suddenly has an epiphany and is able to feel emotions again.  Perhaps with better uses of editing, pacing, and filmmaking in general, the thawing of Largeman would have come across more successfully.  Instead, I found myself increasingly disinterested with his character and began to feel like a bored psychiatrist listening to the only occasionally interesting problems of a patient.  While many of the problems could have been solved better in post-production, some problems exist within the screenplay itself as it wanders around a bit too much.<br/><br/>It's stylistically impressive for a director's first outing (especially considering he also wrote and starred on a low budget), but I don't think it'll touch most audiences the way it obviously touches the filmmakers themselves.  There's just not enough there.<br/><br/>It also should be noted that the performances were generally all good, especially Peter Sarsgaard as Largeman's high school buddy, and Ron Leibman's cameo as the neurologist.<br/><br/>Grade: C-"

","Garden State is Zach Braff's first feature length movie that was directed and written by him, and it shows. Like many directorial debuts, it is bloated with ill-fitting but ""cool"" tangents and subplots, is a semi-autobiography, and is a coming-of-age film. But the strings making the puppet dance to a cute indie soundtrack have never been so visible.<br/><br/>Garden State is generic. Flip through it's scenes of quirky-ness, medieval knight fast food workers, and an adopted brother who is searching for the criminal who defiled his Gamecube, and you have a bunch of ideas that could've been found in any college (or for that matter, high school) kid's ""cool ideas"" notebook. Wouldn't it be cool if a doctor had a diploma on a wall? Apparently it's more important than presenting the story. The jokes never seem to follow a theme, but Braff is reluctant to cut out any of his ""cool"" ideas, thus making it an empty exercise in quirky showmanship rather than a honest attempt at using humor to make a point.<br/><br/>It's these tangents that really hurt what has been described as the ""heartfelt"" and ""honest"" themes in the movie. It would also help if they weren't delivered in such a by-the-numbers style. Garden State's ""serious"" scenes tread no new territory, and are an exercise in the mundane. ""I feel so f*cking numb,"" says Braff to his cold father. So did I: I was watching Director/Writer Braff on his soapbox delivering The Theme of the Movie rather than unfolding it myself. The character arcs are handed to you in such a way that you realize what is going to happen as soon as the characters are introduced, and feel let down that a quirky film did not lend any of it's twists to actual character building, leaving them squandered in pointless sight gags.<br/><br/>However, the movie has struck a resonant chord with teenage audiences, and has critics praising Braff's debut, which according to them, shows promise for a new filmmaker. If only any kid who wanted to be a filmmaker could have contacts and money at his beck and call... we could have hundreds of Garden States. One thinks that showing promise would be doing something new, not traversing the flat, empty plain of half-developed teenage idea wasteland."

","It must take a lot of courage for Hollywood's successful, glamorous, pseudo-intellectuals to make fun of average people and their pathetic lives and values. Like Sofia Coppola's ""look at how clever we are"" Lost In Translation, Zach Braff's GARDEN STATE is another smug, superior and condescending exercise in how a disaffected man  with the help of an adorable, and incomprehensibly available, girl  can mock the hapless and hopeless and ridiculous while reconnecting with a world not worthy of him. (A suggestion: let's save these guys the trouble, tell them they are too smart and sensitive for this world and shoot them.)<br/><br/>Excessively quirky, as these films usually are, and hopelessly episodic, the film wants to be cool and wickedly ""inside""  a diversionary piece of satirical entertainment for the tuned-out, too-cool zombies who will delight in the laughs the film scores at the expense of, restrain yourself, a truly bad singer's rendition of ""Three Times a Lady"" sung at a funeral, a horny sight seeing dog, etc. It's all here. No obvious joke has been overlooked.<br/><br/>Every scene, every set, every moment has a distracting ""cool"" element (the motorcycle with a sidecar, the house overrun by a habitrail, the mansion devoid of furniture in which characters get around in a golf cart, the abandoned boat at the bottom of a quarry). And just to make sure that you'll stay awake: the soundtrack cranks in to signal every scene change, every emotional beat.<br/><br/>You might be able to entertain yourself through the movie by randomly moving props around in your head: what if Zach got around town in a golf cart and the former classmate who invented silent Velcro (too, too funny  not!) moved around his empty mansion in the motorcycle. Or lived in the boat at the bottom of the quarry. Nothing has any real reason for being in the movie  and that includes the characters. And when our filmmakers can no longer trust an audience to watch even a simple drama unless it is festooned with bells and whistles, we have much bigger problems than whether or not one overly medicated man finds love and rejoins the world."
"teddyk4","4","2","5","7 December 2004"," A sad stain on the brilliant legacy of Scrubs
","From the moment I saw the first preview and saw Zach Braff staring forlornly into the camera while blending into the oh-so tacky wallpaper I my stomach clinched with the fear that this movie would ruin my weekly Scrubs experience. Thankfully it has not, but Garden State is still neck and neck with Napoleon Dynamite for most overrated movie of year and possibly Millennium for the following reasons:<br/><br/>1) A watered-down version of J.D. can't sustain a feature-length film.<br/><br/>2) Every visual ""moment"" I was supposed to feel was so boring and pretentious that my eyes roamed around the screen hoping for something interesting to find.<br/><br/>3) Although I like Natalie Portman's performance, the ""weird girl that doesn't care what people think (but really does)"" character is tired and obvious. That said, I almost bought it.<br/><br/>4) Nothing happened... in a bad way. I'm plenty into sparse plots and extended takes or anything else, but in this case the movie pretended to have something happen and actually believed there was some kind of payoff in the acquaintance, turned grave-robber, turned true friend ending (and I did find Peter Sarsgaard hilarious and perfect) but there was no payoff, just a disappointing ability to tie up an implied meaningful ending.<br/><br/>5) Talking to his dad. (I won't say a bad word about Ian Holm) I'm 24 and I've said a lot of ""honest"" things to my parents, but this seemed more like an after-school special or some kind of repressed kid's fantasy than a genuine interaction by a father and son.<br/><br/>6) The soundtrack. I love Iron & Wine and I love Postal Service, and mixing the two together seems like a great idea but it's not. The odds of the song being improved are so small, only some like Jimi Hendrix can improve an already brilliant song, that it should have been avoided. I know the artists agreed to it, but they should never have been given the idea in the first place. And I hope Zach Braff was being ironic/sarcastic/facetious by saying that ANY song by The Shins would change your life. And you can guess how I feel about the use of Nick Drake. The point is he exploited great songs to create moments where there were none, unlike Wes Anderson (who I assume is his idol) who uses songs to compliment moments that could be almost as strong in silence.<br/><br/>7) The hype. This isn't Zach Braff's fault, but the fault of a young (my age cohort) movie-going group that wants badly to like good movies but falls prey to simple clichés and good music (I include Zach Braff in this category).

Never mind that the movie seemed to be a bunch of ideas from main actor/writer/director Braff's old college notebook written when he was most likely under the influence of his own ego tripping and stoned out of his gourd. He used these clever ideas in his notebook and pasted them together, added a little filler, and voilà a movie was born. Some of these ideas from his ganja-ridden notebook actually are funny and clever. It is the pasting together of these little ""spots of time"" where the movie turns sour. The movie becomes cliché, downright stupid, and so utterly predictable emotionally. When it isn't predictable emotionally it suffers from randomness for the sake of randomness (which isn't a talent). Too often mister director often seems to rest trite little indierocka film's foundation on such randomness.

","Andrew Largeman (Zach Braff) returns to his hometown in order to attend his mother's funeral. Because he is an actor, many of Andrew's friends see him as a 'big shot' and upon his return home Andrew is treated as a bit of a celebrity. However, Andrew is a troubled man with a troubling past who strikes up a friendship (and eventually) a relationship with Sam (Natalie Portman) a young woman with troubles of her own.<br/><br/>It's clear from this film that Braff is setting up a narrative that brings together two seemingly different people who aren't actually all that different. It isn't an entirely original concept, but it's one that can really pull at the heartstrings if it's executed correctly. Unfortunately, Garden State gets some things right and some things wrong...<br/><br/>One issue I had with this film is that I never really felt that Braff offered much development to any of his characters; his friends just seemed to be a rather clichéd bunch of frat-boy doofuses which actually made the first 20 minutes or so of the picture to be a particularly painful experience. Sam is an interesting character and I really hoped that more would have been made out of her being a compulsive liar - perhaps a bit of character depth or complexity to explain away her reasons for choosing to lie. Instead of this, you end up with Sam mentioning now and again that she's a compulsive liar and then her mentioning that she doesn't know why she lies, but that's all you get. There's little insight or depth to the picture which at times makes it hard to care what's happening. I could argue the same point with Andrew; a big deal is made about his past and his reasons for disappearing, but again all these details are skimmed over rather than being analysed deeper and I couldn't help but feel that the narrative was a tad simplistic at times. There is some animosity between Largeman and his father which could have been interesting, but is barely given any focus at all resulting in their exchanges having very little bearing on the picture.<br/><br/>The one thing running in this film's favour are that both Andrew and Sam are likable and despite the narrative and character weaknesses I did actually find their blossoming relationship believable and kind of endearing. Natalie Portman is another selling point for this film giving a wonderfully quirky and edgy performance - it's a pity really that she didn't have more of a character to work with. Braff is OK, but is no match for Portman and I think he knows it. Sarsgaard is energetic, but his character is annoying and never really feels important to the story. Holm is in this film, but isn't really given anything to do.<br/><br/>Garden State has its moments and both Braff and Portman are likable enough and share good chemistry and yes I did find their romance believable and engaging. However, when all is said and done, I just never felt that this film was firing on all four cylinders consistently enough and I found many of the characters to be underdeveloped, underwritten and therefore, both they, and the story, were never as interesting as they could have been. As I said in my summary, it is mildly engaging, but not much more than that."

","Garden State is written and directed by Zach Braff, who is obviously a super genius. It was produced in 2004 and is a comedy-drama. Garden State is based on real life events that have happened in Zach Braff's life, and Braff acts as main character Andrew Largeman. Largeman is a young man, 26 years of age, that has been on antidepressants, mood stabilizers and lithium (sounds like every single Canadian person).<br/><br/>The movie begins with Largeman having a nightmare and being awakened by a phone call from his father saying that his mother has passed away, and so he goes to New Jersey, his hometown. While there, Largeman runs into some old friends Mark and Dave who are employed as grave diggers. He also gets reacquainted with friend Jesse, who has made a fortune from inventing silent Velcro and now lives in a mansion. In Garden State, Largeman meets Sam, a pathological liar that is honest about this, and is also an epileptic, whom he develops a deep relationship with.<br/><br/>Garden State is about a young man coming out of a drug induced lifestyle and returning home again, not just physically but spiritually. It is about dealing with the grief of losing a mother as well as confronting his issues. The soundtrack for Garden State won a Grammy, Braff hand picked the music for the film. Garden State has also received a cult following. Cast includes Braff, Portman as Sam, Holm as father Gideon, Sarsgaard as Mark and Alex Burns as Dave. This is truly a work of art and I can watch Garden State over and over."

","Greetings from hicflicks.wordpress.com !<br/><br/>I had a feeling from the first scene of this movie, that this would be a good one, and it actually turned out to be a delectable watch. The director and the lead character of this movie is Zach Braff, better known as the lead character from the hit sitcom ""Scrubs"". He is presently about 35 years of age, so that would make him about 28 or 29 years old when this film was made. That's very impressive, considering that the movie seems to have been directed by a much more mature and seasoned professional.<br/><br/>The female lead character in this movie is Natalie Portman, who has done some amazing acting and appears to be the sweetest (cutest) ideal girlfriend, which any guy would dream to have. The soundtrack of the movie is enchanting and also won a Grammy award for the Best Compilation Soundtrack for a Motion Picture. I particularly like the tracks, ""Let Go"" by Frou Frou, ""Lebanese Blonde"" by Thievery Corporation and ""New Slang"" by The Shins.<br/><br/>In a nutshell this movie put me in a great mood after watching it.

","A struggling young actor returns to his home town in New Jersey to attend his mother's funeral and connects with friends old and new. This is an offbeat comedy-drama that has its moments but doesn't really rise above mediocrity. Besides his starring role, Braff makes a promising debut as director and writer, although he does not excel in any of the three facets and the film comes across as somewhat of an ego trip. As an actor, he relies too much on his deadpan look for laughs. The script fails to sustain interest and shifts uneasily between comedy and drama. Portman is interesting if a bit too goofy as an unstable young woman he meets and falls in love with."

","""I'm okay with being unimpressive. I sleep better.""<br/><br/>Watching Garden State makes me seriously nostalgic, even though it's not very old at all. It reminds me of my early years in college, when I was just being exposed to movies like this, and music like the tunes on the soundtrack. But I don't think the entire reason I like this movie can be chalked up to nostalgia.<br/><br/>Garden State is made for people who like melancholy movies about disaffected young adults. Which is not to say that it's glacial or depressing, there's actually a lot of humor. But if you enjoy more manic, lighthearted relationship movies, you'll do well to avoid this and save yourself some boredom.<br/><br/>For the rest of us, Garden State is a breath of fresh air. I never would have guessed that Zach Braff could have pulled something like this off, but he certainly nailed the unfocused pointlessness that many people in their mid-twenties may feel. Fans of Natalie Portman will be pleased, as well, because she's great in this. Recommended."

Zach Braff created a very good script; nothing was cliché, it was all rather original. Some of the shots weren't great, but in the last 45 minutes everything was shot perfectly.

","Garden State came out in the summer of 2004 and I remember my excitement of seeing JD in something other than Scrubs. I soon saw the film and to my surprise, I didn't love it as much as I had hoped. I in fact I felt a little down/dirty as the tone and premise of the film caught me off guard. It wasn't until 6 months later when I saw the film on video that I truly fell in love with the film. On the second viewing, what had once seemed depressing was now beautifully melancholy. Additionally, the film is shot wonderfully. The colors in the film help convey emotion. This along with a great soundtrack makes for a very captivating movie experience. Further, I really began to enjoy the characters. Well acted by Ian Holm as a distant parent/psychiatrist and Peter Skarrsgard as towny/graverobber the supporting cast contributes to the dark somber tone of the film. I also must say that Braff and Portman are a wonderful pair in the film. They truly light up the screen in there warmer moments. Finally, what makes this movie great for me is the how genuine the interaction seems between the characters. All of the films characters have unrealistic kwirks, however the dialogue and acting feel very real, that we are really able to identify with these characters. They are seriously flawed and they aren't overly witty. The magic of the film is the authenticity of the characters relationships and how one has to reflect on the past in order to truly grow up and learn to feel."

There is plenty more going on to label it amongst the Hugh Grant brand of love stories. The screenplay tackles family drama and the struggle of the past that has hindered between the relationship of father and son. Whilst it isn't close to matching the works of a Pedro Almodovar, this is a brave attempt that isn't too complicated and isn't too far fetched. And whilst intentionally sad, doesn't generate as much sadness as perhaps it could have done.<br/><br/>Braff himself taking a step out of the brilliant Scrubs sitcom, demonstrates that he has the potential to do more than fall over in a hospital. He dives deep within his character to reflect on the struggle of guilt and forced loyalty to others. Because the American has tackled directing, writing and starring in the same film, you wonder whether he tackled a tad too much. There are moments when you think a stronger lead would have been required, and yet thankfully nothing hinders upon his direction.<br/><br/>The scene in the outer world as it were on top of the van screaming into the valley is great, the motorcycle sequences are done without fault and the first party he attends at home has all the right montages and shots to generate a feeling of uniqueness that reflects upon the isolation his character is feeling. Portman likewise may not be at her strongest but her character certainly has a few cool quirks, such as the concept of originality in the moment and her ability to tell lies.<br/><br/>The climax feels a tad thin and a conformity to the romance genre but what we have here is a drama that fulfils its purpose with dramatic real life construction of family and personal problems that encodes some humour along with a reflecting and relaxing soundtrack that epitomises the mood and is definitely worth catching."
"rustyalex2","10","1","2","21 January 2010"," The best Indie Gem
","I first came across Garden State in 2006. I wasn't into movies as much as I am now, so I didn't appreciate it to a full extent. Two years later (and now a devoted film lover, of not only mainstream films, but indie and avant garde) I re-watched this indie gem with a mature outlook and fell in love with it instantly.<br/><br/>At first I was surprised that Zach Braff from Scrubs had not only acted in it, but directed and wrote it. I must say I'm not a fan of the show and find the humor boring and unintelligent, so I wasn't expecting Garden State to be a masterpiece. However, I was wrong.<br/><br/>So why did Garden State, a film with a budget of only 2.5 million dollars soar into my top ten films of all time list? Well the film had heart, it is a beautiful love story with themes of homecoming and letting go.<br/><br/>The story follows Andrew Largeman (Braff) who is a struggling actor living in the rat race of LA. He receives a phone call from his estranged father, informing him of his mother's death. After ten or so years away from home, he returns to suburban New Jersey to find that the life he left hadn't changed that much at all. His friends are still partying and he still faces the guilt of being responsible for his mothers handicap. On medication, Largeman is unable to feel the emotions of love, anger, sadness and can't seem to forgive himself of the wrongdoings of the past, that is until he meets the love of his life.<br/><br/>The cast is absolutely stellar, Zach Braff plays his role well. I really enjoyed his distance from human emotion in the first half of the film and how he slowly lets go of life's unfair burdens and is able to feel himself again. His body language changes admirably, showing the audience his great acting skills. What's even more amazing about the acting in this film is Natalie Portman who plays the cute and lovely Sam. She practically awakens Andrew and the two fall in love. Portman truly steals the show and establishes the magic of the film. Minor characters such as Andrew's father, played by Ian Holm and Peter Sarsgaard who plays Mark, also add an amazing touch into the story.<br/><br/>The script is well written, mixing comedy into drama is quite hard to do, but Braff manages to nail it spot on. He delivers dry humor into a more emotional script. What I personally loved was the characterization. Each character feels so real, especially Sam (Portman) who plays that unique person that everyone has come across once in their life. Although, this film can be viewed by anyone I recommend it for mature people as they would feel connected towards the events and themes. On my second viewing I just wanted to watch this again as I felt like a little bit of me was portrayed in Andrew. This film is guaranteed to leave any audience feeling connected in some way, whether it is the love they've experienced, finding that special someone, coming home for the first time in ages, seeing old friends and finding it awkward or it may even be the letting go of the frustrating moments life gives you and moving on.<br/><br/>Oh and did I mention the soundtrack? It's absolutely fantastic, featuring bands such as The Shins, Coldplay, Nick Drake, Iron & Wine and Frou Frou. I loved how each song that is played connects with the scene somehow. Like on the scene were he screams on top of the yellow boat and ""The only living boy in New York"" by Simon & Garfunkel is playing in the background each lyric matching the emotions of Largeman. It was truly one of the greatest scenes I've seen in a long time. Braff's directing is outstanding and this is one indie gem that will put a tear in your eye, a smile on your face and leave you questioning your journey in life so far. Absolutely beautiful, I recommended it to everyone!"

Andrew, like the ""retarded"" football player he plays on TV, is mentally and emotionally disabled, partly due to the fact that he had been drugged profusely throughout his childhood as a treatment for aggression he would exhibit as a child, one such incident left her mother paraplegic bound to a wheel-chair for the rest of her life. Four days, a few drugged orgies, and two days of romance later he may have found his way out of his ""disability"". But the journey there was dull and uninspiring; weird cannot substitute for experiences that are meaningful and truly transformational. Good soundtrack or cast does not always equate to a good movie without a script of substance."

He plans to be there only a few days. He goes to a neurologist's office because he's been experiencing brief but intense headaches) where he meets Sam (Natalie Portman), who has a quirk of constantly fibbing.<br/><br/>Eventually we learn that his father is his psychiatrist and the one who prescribed all the drugs. (The film doesn't go into how the father justifies renewing prescriptions without examining the patient in 9 years. It does have another doctor point out that the father knows it is improper for him to be his son's psychiatrist.) We also learn that Largeman was shipped away to a boarding school after he caused an accident that left his mother paraplegic.<br/><br/>Largeman is recognized by his old friends in town and spends most of the visit with them and new friend Sam and avoids his father. His friends consider him somewhat of a celebratory because he was on TV. Sam is helping him deal with his psychological problems and a romance is developing.<br/><br/>I found the film to be slow moving and serious with relatively little comic relief,although it does have a romantic comedy end.<br/><br/>* Depakote is FDA approved as an anti-seizure medicine. Lithium is approved for bipolar disorder. However, psychiatrists sometimes use one or both of these in combination with an antidepressant because they tend to boost the effectiveness of the antidepressant. Although Largeman decided to quit them cold turkey, in reality there is mental health danger if one is not weaned slowly from them. In addition, people using these drugs need to have their blood tested periodically because of a dangerous muscle wasting side effect they can cause as well as potential kidney damage. Furthermore, there are strong cautions about using alcohol or other recreational drugs when on these medicines. Having personal experience with such medications caused me to see the film as unbelievable."

Directed by, written by and starring Scrubs' Zach Braff, he plays semi-successful TV actor Andrew 'Large' Largeman, who have shuffled through life in a lithium-induced coma, until the death of his mother, which he decides to stop taking his pills. Even without being home for 9 years, Large still can't escape his domineering father Gideon (Sir Ian Holm) and his effect from life afar. Stunned to be in his hometown after such a long absence, he is finds old acquaintances many places he goes, he does his best to keep away from his father, and by a twist of fate, Large meets Sam (Natalie Portman), everything he isn't, and becoming his sidekick as such. She gives Large the courage to really open up about his joy and pain in the abyss that is life, and thank goodness he decides not to go away in the end like he intended. Also starring Ron Leibman as Dr. Cohen, Method Man as Diego, Flightplan's Peter Sarsgaard as Mark, Jean Smart as Carol, Ann Dowd as Olivia, Denis O'Hare as Albert, Michael Weston as Kenny, Jim Parsons as Tim, Jackie Hoffman as Aunt Sylvia Largeman, Amy Ferguson as Dana and Ato Essandoh as Titembay. I can certainly see that Braff proves himself a good director as well as quite a good actor, it may not be the funniest film ever, but it is certainly worth a look. Good!"

","First of all, i like Zach ""John Dorian"" Braff. Second, I'm not sure if I like ""Zach ""The director"" Braff or Zach ""The writer"" Braff. For me it seems, that in ""Garden State"" Braff puts together the typical ingredients for a, lets call it 'Generation Movie' but doesn't manage to create something really new. Well we have contemporary alternative music (any similarity to the Scrubs ST is purely coincidential..), depressed youngsters, a complicated love story, some surrealistic elements and wonderful photography. But where is the relevance? what is the guys problem that's so different from ""graduate"" or ""reality bites""? if you just show an unoriented young man without establishing a repressive social surrounding it's quite a cheap trick to become philosophical about his reasons. As easy maybe as you can cover an uninspired story by a guy who's walking through a couple of strange environments without changing his facial expression. Anyway, watch the movie, enjoy it and if you don't think about it, you don't have to ask ""So, what?"""
"walterffick","Null","1","2","4 April 2008"," Must-Watch Film
","This is an absolutely amazing and phenomenal film! If you have not seen it, buy it today and watch it; if you have seen it, watch it again. Garden State portrays Andrew Largeman, a young emotionally withdrawn man (Zach Braff), whose life is changed by his encounters with Sam (Natalie Portman). Sam serves as the perfect foil to Andrew, through her free-spirited, energetic, quirky, unrestrained nature. Whereas Andrew restrains from disclosing anything and typically complies with requests, Sam says and does whatever comes into her mind, and insists on being independent. The plot takes place over four days, when Andrew returns to his home town to attend his mother's funeral. In the process, he explores the tragedy of his current life, and for the first time in years, sees hope for the future. Combining a delicate sense of humor, shockingly real characters, a riveting soundtrack, and superb acting, Garden State leaves a viewer wanting to laugh, cry, and change their life all at the same time. It is a must-watch film for anyone who claims to be a film"
"la_meme_chose","10","1","2","18 December 2007"," my favorite film
","for those who say that this film is full of cliché's, etc, what film isn't? i absolutely hate movies these days, but garden state caught my eye and it's been my favorite since. life is full of cliché's and it can be predictable sometimes, but we don't say that life is full of cliché's and no one should watch it.<br/><br/>anyway- i really loved this film because i could relate to it almost completely. the music is amazing; i've never wanted a complete album from a movie before, but the music in this movie really made you feel something, anything. the quirkiness of the movie is nice; it made me feel like i wasn't the only weird one out there dating someone who had issues with their emotions. <br/><br/>this movie isn't for those who listen to the radio or pay attention to celebrities. i just don't think they'll enjoy the weirdness of this movie. this film is better left to those who don't really know what's going to happen in life, but are okay about it because they've been loved.<br/><br/>cheesy and probably cliché, but life is full of that kind of stuff and it's not so bad to have it once in a while."
"luke-346","7","1","2","6 December 2007"," Contemporary, interesting and stereotypical!
","This is a very good film; it's a film that will speak to a generation of people. Predominantly those in their late teens to early 20s, those that feel alienated, different and to those that feel every personal problem can only be likened to a nuclear holocaust. It is for a section of contemporary youth who believe that a late assignment, a failed relationship or an untidy bedroom are on a similar level to Andrew Largemen's (Zach Braff) issues of being prescribed mind bending/altering medication since the age of 11, crippling your own mother and the guilt trip encompassing her death. The clichés of modern youth are played out with almost every character through them having either an OCD or some kind of neurotic condition e.g. Sam (Natalie Portman) is a compulsive liar and plain strange, there's the man who's obsessed with pyramid schemes, Sam's brother who becomes so upset when somebody urinates on his console he dusts for fingerprints, the man that works in a Medieval-themed restaurant and wears his armour home and the man who became rich by inventing silent Velcro.<br/><br/>Garden State is a good old fashioned exploitation film as it stereotypes the youth of today, it places them in a corner and tells them that even the most damaged and confused of you can find happiness in the end. Luckily in some quarters this is how people saw the film although other quarters will feel it speaks directly to them (a common attribute of exploitation films; look at Bridget Jones for a prime example). I feel that Garden State is not a parody of itself, but a parody of the audience it's trying to connect with exemplified by what I've already written and the amount of quirkiness on screen, it is almost admitting to itself that the audience might have an ADD  another stereotype of today's youth.<br/><br/>Overall the film is quirky, prime examples being the scenes of a young couple living in a boat in a quarry, a hamster graveyard and Andrew's means of transport. It is also stylish with its cleverly filmed swimming pool scene (depicts Andrew's isolation brilliantly), its party scene and the bleak ending. Garden State is well acted (Portman is Brilliant, best role since Leon) and well directed and it deserves top marks for being the first outing by Zach Braff as a film director, writer and star but not for being a film that's so untrue to itself."
"mmagliaro","9","1","2","5 November 2007"," Genius - Could watch it 50 times
","The complicated personalities play out beautifully in this film. I love the scene where Braff's friend steals a set of knives off the shelf in the store so he can return them for a ""refund.""<br/><br/>But honestly, the real star of the movie is Natalie Portman. How lucky can they get to pick her for this part. She is the perfect balance of innocent, savvy, emotional, cute, ""one of the guys""...<br/><br/>There are a few coarse moments in the movie, like the hotel where people peep through the walls at people having sex. Frankly, that whole scene could have easily been left out. It adds nothing to the movie and is just kind of, well, crude.<br/><br/>But overall, a really great movie."
"ClaytonDavis","10","1","2","1 November 2007"," I wish Largeman was my brother...
","TV Star Zach Braff of the hit show ""Scrubs,"" writes, directs and stars in the comedic and poignant Garden State.<br/><br/>The film tells the story of Andrew Largeman, (Braff) a twenty something man living in Los Angeles as a working actor. When he receives a call from his estranged father that his mother as passed away, Largeman must travel back to the place he left nine years ago and never looked back, New Jersey.<br/><br/>This is the most personal and revealing work by any actor turned writer-director in the new millennium thus far. Braff doesn't shoot this film as a gimmick to his friends at home but takes on this task with high levels of respect and dignity. Braff shows how multi-talented he really is from the always engaging dialogue to the semi-pro eye catching director's skill. And if writing and directing weren't impressive enough, Braff turns in one of the best performances by any actor of 2004. Completely mind-shattering and completely awards worthy. Braff is the revelation of Garden State by far.<br/><br/>But with all the praise going to his performance, the director sure did make sure to get top notch work out of his supporting cast. Natalie Portman as the lovable and pathological liar Sam is the beauty of any heroin to any man. Portman shows great esteem and the natural essence of a Jersey girl. Peter Sarsgaard who broke out on the scene in Shattered Glass, has such an uncomfortable scene presence but nearly knocks it out of the park every time. Ian Holm, the acting legend of the 80's and 90's, plays Largeman's father. As his tough demeanor progresses, we see how much of an icon Holm actually is. Breaking into mainstream cinema has never been his forte, unless you bring it back to Chariots of Fire, but as a fine wine that gets better with age, Holm is an acting master class.<br/><br/>The inclusion of music in the film with great bands and Jersey-style aura has the viewer in awe. The soundtrack is one of the best film soundtracks of all time, if you dig this style of music. The ending credit song places icing on the cake of this film. Listen to Frou Frou's ""Let Go"" and try to watch this film without feeling like the whole film as been encompassed in three verses and a chorus.<br/><br/>Garden State is the best independent picture of 2004 that every Suburban, Jersey kid should experience.<br/><br/>Grade: ****/****"
"greenridersharysa","8","1","2","14 August 2007"," It has its bad spots, but it's well-done for Zach's first movie.
","Most of the comments here are either glowing praise or rants about how horrible it is. I agree with some people that Garden State had a few slow spots, as well as things that just didn't work, but I doubt most people could have done so well on directing their first movie.<br/><br/>You definitely can't turn your brain off during Garden State--otherwise it will be VERY boring for you. The humor here is not ""Haha, look at that!"", and likewise the romance isn't ""Oh, how sweet,"" unless you count the end. I've tried to just *watch* Garden State, and usually half the movie goes by before I realize it. It probably isn't a realistic view of New Jersey, either, but I have to admit that ""Garden State"" just sounds better than ""Large's Arc"" (the original title Braff wanted).<br/><br/>This movie is not for those who need a break from life or thinking, and I think that's the problem with most moviegoers today. They think movies have to be absolutely spectacular in some way, and then they watch Garden State and go ""That's it?"" because at the end, Large stays there at the airport with Sam. But there's no epilogue showing them married with kids, or Large making millions off his latest movie. The movie's ended, but we don't know what happens next.<br/><br/>So yes, that's it. Garden State's not mind-blowing or spectacular or tearfully poignant--it just IS, and I can live with that."
"blanche-2","8","1","2","9 August 2007"," Coming home
","Zach Braff stars in ""Garden State,"" a film he also wrote and directed -those are some accomplishments.<br/><br/>Braff plays a heavily medicated young man, Andrew Largeman, who comes back to his home town upon the death of his mother. He's on complete disconnect from his father (Ian Holm) who also is his psychiatrist. While in a doctor's office for headaches, he meets the beautiful Sam (Natalie Portman) who claims she's at the doctor's because she's a robot who needs to get charged. It's this kind of off-the-cuff humor that makes ""Garden State"" a truly unique, touching and wonderful film. Large and Sam are as opposite as can be - she talks incessantly; he's quiet; she cries at card tricks; he claims he never cries, including at his mother's funeral. Yet they connect, and she opens up a world of feeling to him that he's never known. As he tells his father, he's been numb for years. So he takes a vacation from all those medications to find out who he is.<br/><br/>I can't relate to this movie the way that some people on the board can - this isn't my generation - but because of the acting and the story, I can appreciate what they're going through. And it doesn't matter what generation you are - being young is tough going.<br/><br/>The acting is uniformly excellent, with Portman being a standout as a vivacious, friendly young woman who embraces life. There are some familiar faces -Portman, Jean Smart, Ian Holm, Ron Liebman and Peter Sarsgaard as well as some young and attractive new ones. Very well done by Braff; I look forward to seeing more of his work."
"geertvdheide","8","1","2","6 August 2007"," Great characters, humour and emotion
","I had high expectations for Garden State based on what I read about it, and they were exceeded by miles. In short, this film is an offbeat romantic comedy / drama that sets a unique mood which sets it apart from the majority of romantic movies out there. The movie tells a great little story in a beautiful way. The performances by Zach Braff and Natalie Portman are great, as is the supporting cast.<br/><br/>The plot, characters, camera-work, humor, sets and dialogs are all amazingly well done. The movie has a serene and slightly surreal style which I really appreciated. Also I'd like to praise the beautiful soundtrack of the film, which I listen to regularly since having watched the film.<br/><br/>I recommend Garden State to anyone who appreciates an offbeat movie about life, and isn't afraid to feel something."
"spacechick2003","8","1","2","29 July 2007"," Great movie, funny and sad at the same time.
","Caught this movie for first time tonight. It was excellent, being both funny, touching and the plot and characters were brilliant. Even Natalie Portman (who I ain't such a big fan of) was good in it. Maybe it's because she's a bit older, but her acting has certainly improved since V for Vendetta.<br/><br/>Zach Braff (JD out from Scrubs on TV) directed, wrote and starred in the movie. Maybe 'starred' is the wrong word in this context, as all the actors (many of whom had familiar faces, if not names) were equally good. Thinking on it a lot of the actors I had seen before on TV comedies, Rachel's dad, from 'Friends' was in it. Again, playing a doctor (is this guy typecast or what. I could go and look up his name no problem, but would anyone care? I think not.<br/><br/>It was very funny in parts, the relationship between the two leads doesn't feel forced or hurried and is believable. It makes some very important points about the importance of friends and family. The direction is very good, it can't be easy directing yourself, so well done Zach. You can really feel the characters dilemma and empathise with him.<br/><br/>The people in the movie where very real people, the actors made you feel as though they weren't acting (always a good thing). I loved both the friendship between the lead and his best friend and also the relationship between the best friend and his mother. It was great to see a woman over 40 in a movie with attitude.<br/><br/>Recommend you see this movie, would appeal to ages 18+ mainly, either sex."
"r-stevens876","10","1","2","23 July 2007"," This film changed my life!!!!!!!!!
","Very few films warrant a perfect ten rating from me. I've watched films for the past 25 years and can categorically say that never has a film reached in and touched me in the same way as this wonderful directorial debut from the insanely talented Mr Braff. Having recently gone through a divorce and being very much lost at the time of viewing this for the first of many times, this quite literally picked me up and placed me well and truly on the road to repair. Firstly, I have to give Zach Braff kudos for writing, directing, starring in and carefully hand-picking the soundtrack for this gem. By the time the end credits rolled to the tune of Frau Frau 'Let Go' I was completely spellbound. Cynics constantly whinge about films with unrealistically happy endings and, I don't know about anyone else, but sometimes it is refreshing when a film leaves you with a warm feeling inside. This film most certainly did. I fell in love with Natalie Portman's character after watching this and she is quite simply stunning as Sam, Peter Saarsgard puts in a remarkable performance as the lead's best friend and Braff does commendably well in his big-screen debut.I won't go too much into the plot as I'll leave it up to anyone who reads this to just watch it and discover a film that , to quote Braff's character Wiseman ''changed my life''. Also, the soundtrack is, as I mentioned before, superb as is every conceivable aspect of this remarkable film. Enjoy and join the masses of film-watchers everywhere who hold this very close to their hearts."

","HYper-depressed writer/actor Andrew Largeman(ZAck Braff,writer and director here)flies home from LA to New Jersey(hence the title)for his mother's funeral after she dies accidentally from a mishap that has a longer,attached story to his life. When he returns home,he finds that much of what he left behind didn't change all that radically,except that most of who he knows is older and somewhat more pathetic. To top that off,his therapist father(Ian Homl,perfect here)is even MORE of a cold,detached professional that he remembered. The return home seems to be a mere exercise of expectations than a true healing or revelation,save for the fact that he meets by chance a slightly unhinged free-spirit named Sam(NAtalie Portman,maybe a little TOO chipper and breezy for this).<br/><br/>This film may lack energy,or have some internal logic weaknesses(Andrew's relationship,or lack thereof,with his family,starting with his mother seems to be somewhat sloppily explained),but there seems to be an almost matter-of-fact,laid-back sense of dark comedy that makes this film refreshingly different from cookie-cutter type action/comedy/thriller/whatever. The film seems to be more interested in letting the viewer ""breathe in"" the atmosphere of loneliness and detachment of the characters,particularly Andrew,for whom it seems both appropriate yet sad that he was so alienated by his own flesh-and-blood that he left them behind for the other coast and never really looked back for a whole decade. THis may be how comedy in films really SHOULD be more like:human,relaxed and not always pretty. Most of the acting is standard,neither great nor terrible,with the exceptions being Braff,Holm and Peter Skaarsgaard as a fairly depressed and slightly off former neighborhood and childhood friend. This would be another ""Palate-cleanser"" movie for someone who';s renting or seeing a spate of large scale,intensity films(say, between viewings of a SAw movie and a POTC or LOTR film)and it's a nice debut for Scrubs' Braff."

He can be angry, sad, depress, tired of everything and smile all at the same time and in the mine while, he directs this film doing a great job in both thing.<br/><br/>The film is very impressive, i think. It really capped my attention from the beginning and let me thinking at the end.<br/><br/>The places, the people, and the music is all so connected that you feel the moment like it is real, i really think that those factors are the very essence of this movie<br/><br/>If you see it, you will have 102 minutes of your life well used."
"shashikrishna","8","1","2","28 December 2006"," A very relevant and special movie
","'Garden State' was a refreshing movie to watch. It was unlike anything I have seen in a long time. The flow of the narrative, the profiles of the characters and of course the moment it was trying to showcase. Let me make one thing quite clear. It takes a minimum of two viewings to understand and appreciate what the movie was trying to highlight.<br/><br/>Andrew returns to his hometown for his mother's funeral. A sad reason to finally meet with his old man after almost a decade, but a reason nonetheless. The father and son are trying to look for ways to bond. The father has his reasons while the son definitely has his for being away from each other. <br/><br/>Andrew is struggling with his inner self since he has stopped feeling  anything  for almost a decade now. Ever since he started on the drugs that were given to him for his 'health' reasons. They have stopped him from feeling. They have stopped him from being.<br/><br/>On his short visit he runs into Sam. An epileptic who is so emotional that crying comes so easy to her. I think the reason why he is drawn to her so quickly is she feels everything. Even if it is someone else's pain. She weeps for his mother's loss. She laughs at his joy. She feels everything.<br/><br/>This, despite being a real patient herself. When Andrew realizes this so comes the next obvious emotion  love. He starts spending more time with Sam all the while realizing he is being drawn to her. That he is falling in love. A new feeling, finally, that is happening to him after so long. 'Garden State' is a snapshot of one brief milestone in Andrew's life that sees him becoming a different person. A real person with real emotions. Even if it is pain. <br/><br/>I had seen Zach Braff only in 'Scrubs' so my image of him was always of the geeky doctor who always behaves like an intern. Seeing him in this much mature, almost adult, role was a refreshing change. My perception of him as an actor (and a director!) has definitely changed. I look forward to seeing more of his work in the future. <br/><br/>The soundtracks are very well chosen to make the story go forward. A real delight to be able to associate a good track with the visuals. Well done Zach! Good call. Technically the movie is well shot with some neat camera work. I was not too crazy about the climax but hey, its all about being in the Garden state isn't it. So I will let it slide. <br/><br/>I would definitely recommend this simple, yet very relevant feature for those who need a break from the cliché Hollywood dishes out tirelessly."
"jeremygross83","8","1","2","30 October 2006"," Great movie however lets not go overboard
","To say this movie defines a generation is a total exaggeration. Sure It is a very well written and superbly casted piece, it does not define a generation. It does not define 20 something year old inner city youths or the Canadian native population or anyone but the upper middle class and over medicated population. Thats like saying Boyz in da hood defined our generation. No it did not it explained what life is like for a certain group of people... So did Garden state. <br/><br/>That being said this movie was pretty good. Natalie Portman gave a stellar performance and totally redeemed herself for the star wars movies. I also enjoyed the many different religious and mythological references in this movie. Thee boatman at the end of the abyss returning the lost family heirloom was an interesting concept and represented Charon returning a trinket from the underworld. These characters all go through a journey and it is fundamentaly important that everyone understands that it was not made to ""define a generation"" it was made to convey a far more important question: can life be real without feeling? Think about it and stop trying to define our generation with movies... just enjoy them."

Fortunately, I was presently surprised.<br/><br/>""Garden State"" is at is heart a very simple boy-meets-girl story, and there really isn't much to the plot, but it's delivered in a very refreshing way.<br/><br/>First of all, the actors all do a wonderful job. They all put in wonderfully subtle and believable performances and really make you care about them, even though some of them really have a quite limited part. It's somewhat of a shame, since most of these characters are interesting enough to want to get to know them better. Fortunately, Natalie Portman more than makes up for this in a very charming performance.<br/><br/>Next, it's one of the most uniquely funny movies I've ever seen. It's definitely not a movie that has you constantly rolling over the floor in laughter, but it will constantly catch you by surprise with some really unexpected and surreal jokes. It might not be humour for everybody, but I definitely liked it.<br/><br/>Finally, it's a wonderfully atmospheric movie. The excellent soundtrack and the beautiful cinematography both come together well to create a movie that's very pleasing to the eye and the ear, and basically just puts you in happy mood.<br/><br/>""Garden State"" might not be a movie that will be remembered in half a century...it's too quirky and unassuming for that.

Everything, and I do mean everything, from the acting to the music, was excellent. Especially Braff himself and Portman stood out. I've become quite obsessed with this movie, and it's a pity that it's not that well-known here in Sweden. But my friend and i will watch it tomorrow, so I'm hoping to get people hooked. I'm even going as far as to saying that this is the best movie I've ever seen! And I really do mean that, this is right along the lines of other great but a little weird movies like Ghost World or Donnie Darko(Not saying that it ''s like those, but it's just as good)."

","I love Garden State. From start to end it's a fantastic movie ... but I can't tell you why exactly! I can say it is funny, intelligent, well written, sweet and real - but a lot of movies are like this and still fail to hit the mark. Garden State hits the mark dead on! Although it's not side-splittingly funny, it is charmingly funny and brings a smile to your face for almost the entire film. <br/><br/>Zach Braff does an excellent job in every way, as a writer, director and the star. He manages to play the part without making you think for one second that he's simply J.D. which can be difficult for anyone (Matthew Perry seems to be Chandler in every film he's in - not that that's entirely a bad thing)<br/><br/>I recommend to anyone that they watch this movie. It's a definite 10/10! <br/><br/>Let's hope Zach Braff can do more like this."

","I was surprised to find out that zach braff the star of the TV show scrubs was directing a movie. Being a fan of zach braff i found myself very hopeful before watching garden state. What really made this movie great was how it develop, the first few minutes seems quite average and you begin to believe that their is not much more the film will offer but as you watch on and introduction of Natalie Portmans character you develop and interest her character introduces so many aspects and emotions into the film.<br/><br/>Zach braff went all out on this film and i can only hope he will continue to direct and produce films. Garden state has the unique element of witnessing the director act and this is evident in the role of largemen, zach braff nows what he wants and thus acts it out to perfection. The unsung hero though of the film is not largemans character but natalie portmans characters she remains mysterious and her ability to lie in situations that do not call for it is something that i thing the audience can relate to and though she is perceived as a quite different or unique character there are qualities within her that the viewers relate to thus the audience is drawn to her character. Her outlook on life is one we all wish to have were she looks at all situations positively.<br/><br/>The final comment to make is that this movie excels the introduction of comical moments transcending into serious moments keeps the audience on there toes and unaware of what will happen next. this is an awesome film and deserves nothing but a 10/10."

","This movie is by far one of the best that I have ever seen! It was funny, smart, and heartfelt, and the performances were fantastic! Not to mention the absolutely fantastic writing. This movie will really get Zach Braff noticed and recognized for the comedic genius he is! He really shows his talent in this movie, which he wrote, directed, and starred in. It was filmed in only six weeks, and Braff edited it over the weekends. Braff has yet to be recognized as a serious actor or as really anything, even though he has one of the best shows on television. The quirky, sweet, smart comedy Scrubs. In Scrubs and in Garden State you will fall madly in love with ever character. They are written with such personalities that you can't not. Natalie Portman was phenomenal and she should have been nominated for something, anything! I don't particularly like Ian Holm but he was actually really good in it. It also opened my eyes to Peter Saarsgard who was hilarious without even trying! I just hope that more people will see this film because it is totally one of the best films ever. Please everyone watch this film you totally won't be disappointed. not."

","Life-affirming and joyous, this quirky movie lets you, as the observer, really feel for Large; you really care what happens to him, and pray that he manages to stay off the lithium.<br/><br/>He sees his childhood friends, and sees what they've made of their lives (not much), but doesn't judge them. He meets Sam, a girl who is refreshingly honest and open to life's experiences. And he comes to terms with his father's reason for putting him on antidepressants.<br/><br/>Apart from the ending, which seems hastily tacked-on to pander to the idealised ""romcom"" conclusion, the whole thing was believable and well-made. Brilliant film."

","I've never seen a movie that has affected me the way Garden State has. I enjoyed it more than I could ever imagine. All the characters are incredibly believable. The love between Large and Sam is so natural and so beautiful, so unlike typical love stories. This film really grew on me. Every time I watch it it gets better. If you watch it in a noisy atmosphere with friends where you're not really paying attention it might not seem like anything great. But when I felt like I truly knew the characters... I was overcome with emotion in the seemingly little things. And the music fits so beautifully. To all those people who posted negative and rude comments... you are cynical and you need to get out more."

The idea of not having a home to go to (in an emotional sense obviously) is probably my greatest fear and Braff captures perfectly the feeling of never being home. I also have a friend who is on medication similar to that which the Large is on and i believe Zach Braff perfectly captured the effect of such drugs.<br/><br/>as well as being very very funny the movie really struck a chord with me - this is THE movie for the generation of people leaving college with a world of opportunity and not a clue what to do next."
"peacefrogx","5","1","2","15 November 2005"," like treating hemorrhoids with lithium
","The script for this film was so thin, the character development so weak, and the acting, for the most part, so rote, I was thankful that the film was relatively short (approx 100 mins.) I'm a big fan of Zach Braff but he would have had a much easier time dumbing down the 'adult-content' theme of the flick and selling it to the Disney channel. Why do screenwriters feel the need that, when creating angst-ridden characters, they have to over apply all the knee-jerk symptoms - no love, no family, no work, no home - to get the message across that their character is 'deeply troubled?' Audiences, especially the target audience for this film, are not stupid and do not have to be spoon-fed character development. <br/><br/>What a waste of a decent cast."

","Not one of my favorite movies. I'm from New Jersey and recognized most of the locales in the movie, and my mother grew up in the town, South Orange, where it was filmed. Most of her mother's friends knew Zach Braff's family growing up. The quarry's behind my mother's best friend's childhood house, by the way, and not in Newark. They built luxury condominiums over it after this movie was shot. Oh well! But nothing in this movie is especially like New Jersey. Any native New Jerseyite who's actually lived there all of their life would say that. It could be anywhere. So why is it called ""Garden State""?<br/><br/>I also think it's a typical Indie deathtrap with nothing new or unique to say about life, just the typical uplifting hooplah spelling big bucks among teenagers who think they're unique, and, more likely than not, live in New Jersey. New Jersey is a hotbed of two things-Italian ""mafioso-type"" actors and teen angst indie movies, actors, and movie makers, like Todd Solondz, Christina Ricci, Lou Pucci, and Zach Braff. Surely, some parts of the movie were excellent-Natalie Portman was luminous. But this is all so typically, disgustingly indie. At least ""Ghost World"" was an excellent movie. But now movies like that have been done to death."
"WriterDave","6","1","2","7 November 2005"," Mildly Entertaining, Shallow and Self Ingulgent
","""Garden State"" is yet another one of those so-called ""quirky slice-of-life"" comedies that is in actuality a depressing piece of misguided melodrama. What makes this type of film work is when the oddball characters ring true in some way (as they did in the far better ""Sideways"" or ""The Station Agent""). The problem with Zach Braff's film is that none of the characters seem real and all their quirks are there for no reason other than their own quirkiness (for instance, the listless druggie who makes millions off inventing silent Velcro or the moron who wears his knight costume to breakfast before going to work at a ""Midieval Times"" restaurant).<br/><br/>The film isn't totally without its charms. Natalie Portman is delightful and adorable. This is a perfect transition role for her as she matures from precocious child actress to leading lady. She does the most with her overwritten role as an epileptic ex-ice skater with a plethora of pets and an ""adopted brother"" from one of those Sally Struther's ""save the children"" campaigns. She comes across as endearing and genuine and is the only one of this motley ""Garden State"" lot I would want to spend some time with in the real world.<br/><br/>Writer/director Zach Braff, on the other hand, seems to be playing a pill-popping emotionless minor TV star whose mother just died for no other reason than the fact that he is an emotionless actor who can't pull off any other type of role. His performance is hollow, and only in his scenes with Portman is he acquitted of his obvious and egregious self-indulgence.<br/><br/>There's a few mildly entertaining sidebars along the misguided coming-of-age trail (the underground ""Grand Canyon"" or the dope at the hardware store trying to sell his pals on a pyramid-scheme), and every scene Portman is in is better for it, but when you tack on an annoying folksy-alterna-emo soundtrack and a horrible and safe ""Hollywood"" style ending, I couldn't help but feel cheated."

","Andrew Largeman(Zach Braff)is a disaffected man and an unsuccessful actor who returns home to New Jersey for his mother's funeral. While in town he meets up with old friends and finds his soul mate in strange but lovable girl named Sam(Natalie Portman).<br/><br/>This could be one of the greatest modern love stories of all time. I honestly did not predict Zach Braff to be such a great writer/director but he surprised me as well as the rest of the people who have seen this movie. Garden State is a humorous, clever story that can appeal to our generation unlike any other love story that there has ever been. With Portman and Braff's acting in this movie, it is not difficult to understand anyone can love this movie. But there is so much more to this movie than just that. The story can be related so well to anyone over some unrealistic, epic love story such as The Notebook. Overall, this is a fine movie and can be enjoyed very easily. No changes could make this movie any better. It is absolutely perfect for what it is.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie."

","This movie had a great plot. All of the locations and the way people act, was 100% perfect. This is a lot of how life is in the great Garden State. If you don't live here you may not understand the diverse typed of people that live here. I though the movie was great it made me remember of how life was just a few years ago living here. I honestly think everyone in NJ should at least watch this movie. It runs along the lines of a Kevin Smith film, but with different characters and a bit more serious. Its a bit unfair that I'm very impartial to any film based in NJ. Some of the locations in this film brought me back to childhood with the old houses from up north, and the crappy random weather. Living in this state i have seen many messed up families and friends and this movie just hit the nail on the head from the lucky friend to end up rich, to the wasted stoner friend, and the cute innocent liar thats just to cute to resist. I could easy go to each town in NJ and find a group of people just like this. I was just amazed at the accuracy and think everyone should check out this movie"
"evanston_dad","9","1","2","30 September 2005"," Terrific Debut
","""Garden State"" is an excellent first effort for Zach Braff: personal, textured and authentic. There are really only a couple of scenes (his reconciliation with his father and the soliloquy delivered by Denis O'Hare's character) that feel clunky and too pat. The rest of the film is notable for how realistic it feels --- the characters don't necessarily find their ways to happy endings, but they do come to better endings.<br/><br/>Zach Braff gives a great performance here in addition to his directorial debut. Natalie Portman also shines--there's something so magnetic about her persona, she can walk into a scene and immediately make the movie about her (as she did in ""Closer""). And all of the other actors in smaller roles -- Peter Sarsgaard, Ian Hom, Jean Smart -- create memorable characters with the sometimes limited material they're given to work with.<br/><br/>When I was watching the special features on the DVD of ""Garden State,"" the director of photography mentioned how he thought the movie's look and feel are reminiscent of the Hal Ashby movies from the '70's, and I thought this was very astute. Watching ""Garden State,"" I was reminded of ""Harold and Maude."" It's quirky and goofy like that movie, but it doesn't ever feel forced or like it's trying too hard.

One day, his alienated father calls and tells him that his mother has drowned, in their bathtub. Andrew returns home for the funeral, and meets with his old friends that handle life in their own ways. There Andrew meets Sam, a habitual liar that somehow gets him. The two seem to match each other and something special evolves.<br/><br/>Comment: A melancholic and humoristic look upon life today. The movie is filled with both funny moments, and emotional, even sad moments. Both Braff and Portman gives great performances and I should mention Sarsgaard as well. One can see clearly though that Braff has carved his own space in Hollywood and will probably be a name to remember for the future. In this movie he has shown that he is able to write a really good story, direct it and do both comedy and drama. Portman's capabilities I already knew about. I sensed though, that Braff is influenced by Scrubs. It might be that I connect him so tightly to the series, but in some scenes in the movie, I clearly felt a very close resemblance between Andrew and J.D. To conclude: This was a sweet funny movie that promises good things for the future. But top 250 on IMDb? Not for me it wasn't.<br/><br/>7/10"
"The_Void","8","1","2","29 July 2005"," Quirkly little drama doesn't disappoint
","Zach Braff is one lucky guy. At the start of 2004, he was just the lowly star of some of that rubbish that Americans put on TV; but by the end of the year, he's the director, writer and star of a successful and critically acclaimed movie! Garden State is the latest quirky little drama to be released independently. It seems like these sorts of films will get praised whether they're good or not these days, but to Braff's credit; this one actually isn't bad. While the film feels underdone in certain places, and the story could have been fleshed out better; Braff handles his themes with care and attention, and it's obvious throughout that this is a project that the young writer/director/actor really cared about; and that translates into the vibrancy and vitality of the story. The film follows themes of maturity and responsibility and it follows a troubled young man (Braff), who returns home to his state of New Jersey after a leave of nine years. While home he reunites with his old friends and meets a new one, in the form of serial liar; Samantha (Natalie Portman).<br/><br/>Pretty much as soon as the film starts, you can see that it's by a young, first time, director. Early in the film, Braff experiments with different shots, such as the bathroom mirror scene; which seems to be an attempt to show his character's broken state of mind. Considering he's a TV actor, Zach Braff's acting isn't at all bad; he suits the role that he's written himself like a glove, and his performance gives the whole piece an element of realism. The extraordinarily beautiful Natalie Portman stars alongside Braff as his opposite number. Portman delivers her performance with just the right amount of cuteness, while slightly hinting that her character might not quite be all smiles and sweetness. An excellent ensemble is topped off by Peter Sarsgaard and Ian Holm, who both do well with the roles Braff has given them. There isn't really anything on the technical side that makes this film stand out, but films like this are more about characters and story anyway; and this film has both of them. The film is interesting throughout, as the character are nurtured and we get to know them; and the film finally pays off when we finally get the end. All in all, I wouldn't go as far as to call this great or a masterpiece; but it's a solid movie and I'm not surprised at the positive reception it has won itself."
"philipsavory","9","1","2","3 July 2005"," Scrubs up nicely
","This is a very mature, deep and thoughtful film from Zach Braff, who displays the talents to direct many a great film to come.<br/><br/>His script is razor sharp, it avoids sentimentality and yet has great warmth and many great character moments.<br/><br/>He also gives a restrained performance and captures a sense of loss and the frustration of dealing with his own emotions.<br/><br/>His direction is also very restrained camera movements are minimal and the actors are all allowed room to breathe and there are some very nice visual touches and lighting and editing techniques that look great without overshadowing things.<br/><br/>I thoroughly recommend this for those who like great American drama like Lost In Translation and American Splendor."
"dragnilar","5","1","2","9 June 2005"," Alright, Although a Little Boring
","Going into Garden State, I was expecting something very special, after seeing all the praise the movie had received. Afterwards though, I was left feeling disappointed and actually unsurprised. Do not get me wrong, Garden State is a film that has a lot of appeal to it. It contains a lot of feeling that a young viewer can relate to; it has comic bits here and there; it even has Method Man! The unfortunate thing that Garden State seemed to have going for it though (for me at least) was just the dull pacing the movie had. It also seemed to cash in too much on the 'emotions' category and did not do enough to stick with the comedy routine. At the start the movie had a 'subtle humor' feel to it, but by the second fourth of it rolls around, all of the humor is gone. You are left then with a person hanging around in his hometown, making you feel like you are having a regular weekend off from college/high school. Nevertheless, that may have something to do with why it is liked so much.<br/><br/>The dialogue in the movie seemed a little unnatural at times (far too much swearing, inappropriate comments here and there.) The main thing that annoyed me was the running gag with Andrew every time he met someone. They would say: ""HOLY ****!"", which became both predictable and very tiring by the end. Some might find the joke to be very amusing, but relying on swearing as a joke can get rather annoying hard and fast. Otherwise, the script seemed to have a good handle on lots of casual conversations. What got me the most the most though with the dialogue though was the epic 'confrontation' that Andrew was going to have with his in-movie father. It ended up coming across as rather un-eventful, un-detailed, and there did not seem to be a very solid resolution emanating from it.<br/><br/>Andrew's relationship with Sam was also a little unrealistic if you ask me. It felt like another throwback to Titanic, with the way it just sprung up and blossomed in a very short period of time. That was probably the main thing there to appeal to the emotions, and it is only a ~2 hour movie so this is probably excusable in the end.<br/><br/>However, as I said, although I did not like it, I can understand why it is liked. That does not mean you will or will not like it though. I suggest you do see it at least once. Natalie Portman does do a good job at acting out the flakiest girl that I have ever seen. In addition, Zack's character is probably one of the most laid back I have ever seen. In the end though, it felt like just another teen movie for some reason with a lot of ""trendy"" (but fitting) music."
"WhiteShadowGranadar","7","1","2","10 May 2005"," A 7 for what could have easily have been an 8 maybe even a 9
","With pain in my heart I give this film a 7. Seven for me means I still find it worth watching and I'm sure people will like it but... The story is really about a boy and his quest to 'feel' The story takes a slow start and remains like a slow moving flow up to the end without ever giving the impression that it is pacing. The storyline is very good and I like the idea's behind it making it an interesting film. As I mentioned before BUT, the film unravels near the end and ruins the catharsis I might have had and this due to no other reason then the acting performance of the main character namely the doped-out boy. This is however not the fault of the casting director but this is what happens when the author of the script insists on taking the lead role up himself. In the end the boy has to make a decision and this is where it goes down faster a crappy version of the titanic. The film was to well thought out and to beautiful to be spoiled in such a way in the end. Maybe it is just me that got this impression but my friends that have seen the movie too came to me and expressed the same impression I struggled with as well. It is really a shame because I did not see it coming and everything was fine till the last scenes. I was setting me up for a happy ending and granted this was the general idea of the film but then the happy ending was not what I expected from it. The acting in the film is overall reasonably good and the girl really gives it all she's got. But well it seems that that wasn't enough. <br/><br/>Conclusion: This movie would rock if not for the doubt cast as a shadow over the film by the confused acting of the main character near the ending."

Zach Braff has produced a witty, interesting and original comedy that is refreshingly difficult to categorise. I recommend Garden State to anyone who likes a film to make them think and feel.As the protagonist searches for answers the audience can't help but warm to his catatonic charm. Natalie Portman, who plays the 'new friend Sam' is so youthful and sweet that despite her addiction to lying you are lulled in to loving her. The only criticism of the film i could make is a slightly under outlined plot, which is at times a little fuzzy compared to slick Hollywood fair. However, I love Garden State!"
"gazineo-1","4","1","2","25 April 2005"," Garden without flowers
","Inept, silly and shallow drama concerning the problems of a young man to fit among his family and his birthplace, after a long time of absence. Among many other problems 'Garden State' never decides along the way if the vision of the main theme would be a comic and sarcastic view or a serious, thoughtful way to tell the problems of the main character with his father, his deceased mother and his weird old friends. The overcome is a far fetched story that never hits the point and give to the audience - the intelligent audience, it must be said - the impression of a complete misfire. Maybe 'Garden State' could have been a solid story about personal discovery and at the same time a journey to find, at last, peace and self satisfaction. That would be nice; but with the bad dialogs, the weird situations, the ludicrous performances, 'Garden State' is a failed and extremely unsatisfactory experience. I think that 'Garden State' is a movie made for teenagers audience. No prejudice in this sentence. Just a fact of life: during our lives we have different moments of thought, considerations and needs. When we are teenagers we always think that the world is unbalanced and stupid (and maybe, in a sense, that's true). But we must grow up. And when it happens, our language, our senses of the world are changed, and we are not anymore fascinated by odd behaviors or hollow kind of protests. 'Garden State' is a movie made with this sense of spirit. So, if you're not a teenager anymore (or an adult with teenager's vision of life), this movie would be just a tiresome and forgettable entry."

It must be fate.<br/><br/>Anyway, don't listen to any twit who tells you that this movie was ""brilliant."" I bet they'll tell you Lost in Translation was great, and that Wes Anderson is a genius. Just because a movie -tries- be be artistic, doesn't mean it should get merit for that attempt regardless of success.<br/><br/>You don't have to fit in with all your friends and impress your family by ranking this movie up there with the Golden Age of every cinema culture on earth. An 8.0? C'mon. Indie nerds, please, get over yourselves. You're old enough by now ... or are you well into your 30s and still brag about how it's ""so cool"" to hang out in the city?"

","Although I found this to be an enjoyable film, mostly for its quirky commentary on modern pop culture, I didn't find it nearly as overwhelming as my friends and critics had built it up to be.<br/><br/>I think this was a good first outing for Braff, but I wouldn't go as far as brilliant, as many people may lead you to believe. Because I wouldn't know if ""brilliance"" was Braff's aim, I can't fault it for falling short in that capacity.<br/><br/>On the plus side, I found it amusing and an easy viewing. The story is simple, touching on ageless issues such as guilt, parental conflict, nostalgia, love, discovery, etc. I was a little annoyed with the constant interjection of music to help illustrate...I always feel music should accompany a film, not drive it. In other words, there were times I felt the scenes were written around the music, vs. the other way around.<br/><br/>Still though, it was enough to provoke me to keep an eye on Zach Braff. He may have some good things, even better things, to show us yet."
"diand_","4","1","2","22 February 2005"," Numb and dumber
","American independent cinema has always played an important role in the shaping of the future of cinema itself. But in the last few years, the major studios have attracted talent much earlier and have been more open to experiment than before, because movies with only a simple formula are losing out and the population as a whole demands more 'intelligent' movies. As a result a decline in the quality and diversity of indies can be observed. Even stronger: independent cinema itself is becoming a clichéd affair; Garden State is just proof of that.<br/><br/>On the first level we have the simple story of a young man returning to his home state and coming to grips with past and present. All the clichés are nicely presented (hey, there's even a love story!) but there are also hints of originality (the wallpaper scene, the certificates on the wall). And in presenting some unfamiliar worlds Garden State becomes downright interesting: e.g. a dysfunctional functional family, the hotel scene.<br/><br/>The problem is on the second level: in referring to some current state of mind of characters or important aspect of the story Braff uses very simple direct references. So, when Andrew is on the brink of a choice he puts him on the edge of an abyss, when he is thinking about leaving his girlfriend he goes up the stairways leaving her on an equal level, etc.<br/><br/>What saves Garden State from becoming a disaster are two very good actors: Ian Holm and Natalie Portman. Their subtle and layered performances are worth the admission price alone."
"fondablaster","10","1","2","16 February 2005"," Brighter than ""Sunshine"" and more bent than ""Sideways""
","While I loved ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"", ""Garden State"" could be the best movie I watched in 2004. The film was stylish without being pretentious and the dialog was witty without having that ""trying-to-be-witty"" vibe. Like ""...Sunshine..."", ""Garden State"" is a romantic drama with elements of humor, rather than the generic-romantic-comedy-with-the-token-dramatic-scene-thrown-in cinematic goop which we are usually spoon-fed from teenager-loving Hollywood. Unlike ""...Sunshine..."", however, ""Garden State's"" first-time writer/director Zach Braff shows us the other side of love. Specifically, what happens when we're not looking for it? When we're not, in fact, looking for anything? A late-twenty-something-slacker, Andrew Largeman (played convincingly by Braff  pulling a triple duty usually reserved for geniuses like Woody Allen, Mel Brooks and Quentin Tarantino) finds life and death and love happening all around him, whether he likes it or not. All the while Braff shows a side of New Jersey that Hollywood usually ignores: ""The Un-Sopranos"". The film lacks on-screen violence (the only firearm shown belongs to a police officer), gangsters and the ridiculous, over-exaggerated ""Noo Joisey"" accent that is only heard in bad and/or inaccurate movies and television shows (and which only exists ""in real life"" in certain sections of New York or in places of Jersey where New York natives have migrated). Braff shows a softer Jersey, while maintaining a sharp edge. The characters are all damaged goods in some way. The idea of the Garden State as a re-birthing frame of mind is a recurring theme. It's a necessary journey for the main players who are all stuck in a rut and wilting. Largeman's romantic interest is the enigmatic (re: compulsive liar) Sam (portrayed with quiet intensity and a chameleon's ability to blend into any role by ""Closer"" Academy Award nominee Natalie Portman), who seems to be tired of living her lies. Together they find a little bit of truth: You can go home again. Academy Award nominee Ian Holm (""Chariots of Fire"") and Golden Globe nominee Peter Sarsgaard (""Shattered Glass"") round out the primary cast and add substance, depth and nuance to the story. This film is entirely a work of fiction, but it feels very realistic. If, after you watch it, that sticks with you, it's meant to. If you live outside of America, or in a city, you may think this story would only apply to and appeal to teenagers. If someone were to suggest to me that they could not see the realism and discarded it as ""just another teen movie"", I would have to offer that they may be out of touch with American suburbia. Zach Braff wrote an inspired script and acted with subdued intensity. He puts more into a look than most actors do with a three page monologue. This film is dramatic, tragic, comical, romantic and touching; it's themes and characters have universal appeal; and the soundtrack acts as a minor character (with plenty to say). Everything about this movie works, yet it was completely ignored by the Academy Awards committee. The only explanation could be that the filmmaker or the studio (or perhaps both) decided not to submit the picture for judging and it was thereby deemed ineligible. This is the only explanation that will allow me to sleep at night. I pictured nominations for three of the four acting categories, as well as best picture, best original screenplay and best director. But what do I know? After all, I thought ""Sideways"" was overrated. I can only hope that Zach Braff does something else in the realm of acting worthy of critical recognition and Oscar gold, because I would have bumped any of the nominated five for his acting performance in ""Garden State"". But than (sic) again, us Joisey boyz needs to stick togethers, yo."

","I must say that from the moment I saw this movie's teaser trailer I was quite intrigued. It's rare for a teaser trailer to intrigue me like this one did, but it's probably even rarer for a movie to go beyond the expectations its trailer set up for it.<br/><br/>The story itself is deceptively simple enough being about a young man who comes back home after a long hiatus to his mother's funeral. He subsequently begins to reconcile his past while learning what it means to live and feel again.<br/><br/>This movie has some genuinely inspired moments, but is primarily the piece it is because of the acting it contains. Zach Braff, Peter Sarsgaard, and Natalie Portman are all great in their respective roles. Natalie Portman especially so.<br/><br/>This is one of the few movies this year that I truly connected with. All I can say is that, if you know what it's like to feel like you're always having to be someone you're not, then this movie just may be for you too."

It had some corky moments and sad/happy moments, but if you were looking for a hilarious comedy this wasn't the movie for you. the movie and characters were adorable. i think that zach braff didn't want a specific plott and a lot of drama, i think the fact that his movie didn't have a great plot made it more enjoyable. you can somewhat relate, because real life tent have a plot. i loved the movie. its just a movie. its for your enjoyment and i enjoyed it!"

I loved the fact that Sam and Andrew were (fairly) normal, not overly attractive people who got together in a believable way; I loved the humour (the knight in the kitchen was brilliant); I loved the subtle observations that Braff put on screen; I just loved this film.

Zach Braff is completely accessible. Peter Sarsgaard is excellent and understated (as usual). Natalie Portman is endearing. Her character is one of the best characters I've seen for a woman in a long while. The character is genuine and deeply human. The film captures the mundane of everyday life and makes it seem significant.

Whether or not you like the character that Zach broff portrays is really your own problem. I found him decidedly intriguing. I wanted to know what was going on in his head, and it kept me watching. When viewed, i was expecting good and was overly joyed when the movie was better than i had thought. It carried itself so well, and every time i have watched it since i have picked up on some new theme, or something that i just didn't pick up the first time through.To cap all of it off, the soundtrack was phenomenal.

I found myself watching it three more times before returning it. Words can not describe how much I love this movie. Garden State got a lot of mixed reviews from critics and the people.

"rbverhoef","9","1","2","23 January 2005"," One of the most delightful films of the year
","When a good project does not come to you, you just have to write it yourself. After that you don't need a director to mess up your stuff so you might as well direct it. Something like this must have gone through Zach Braff's head before he started with 'Garden State', a delightful film that could have stepped wrong many times but basically never does. It tells the story of an actor, not very successful, named Andrew Largeman (Braff) who takes a plane back from LA to New Jersey because his mother died. He has not seen his father Gideon (Ian Holm) in nine years for reasons I will not reveal. In Jersey he spends time with old friend Mark (Peter Sarsgaard) and meets a very nice girl named Sam (Natalie Portman).<br/><br/>May be the story sounds a little like something you have seen many times, but I can assure you that you have not. The friend Mark is not your typical friend, the way his relationship with Sam develops is not your typical romance and the problems Andrew had and has are not the typical problems. The only time the film does a feel a little familiar is near the end, but admittedly it is the only ending every viewer of this film wants. The funny moments are not forced the way we normally see that, the characters are just being themselves and sad and funny moments occur. You can actually believe the characters have a life out of the framework we call 'Garden State'.<br/><br/>Braff gives us an Andrew who is close to the opposite of J.D. from the series ""Scrubs"". Here he is sad and quiet, in the series he is funny and feeling like a young boy all the time. I like the series and I love Braff there; making me forget about both things while watching 'Garden State' is quite an achievement. Portman as Sam is the light of this film, bringing warmth and creating most of the funny moments. Holm and Sarsgaard find the right note for their character that are more complex than they seem at first.<br/><br/>Braff's writing is quite impressive. In the romantic scenes he does not go for clichés, and in the dramatic scenes he finds dialog that is used in real life. Especially the scenes where Andrew faces his father are so honest you forget that what's on screen is fictional. As a first-time director he does a pretty impressive job as well making me looking forward to his next project. The camera captures one beautiful image after another, the soundtrack fits the film and creates the right atmosphere. All this makes 'Garden State' one of the year's most delightful films."
"hihotintin","10","1","2","16 January 2005"," Garden State of Mind
","In all honesty when I first saw this movie in theaters it was only because Natalie Portman is an amazing actress. After seeing any movie, if I continue to think and talk about that movie after a week of seeing I consider it a good movie. Even after a month I was still talking and thinking about Garden State. The main character, Andrew Largman returns home, after nine years of living in California, for his mothers funeral. It is in his home state of New Jersey he finds love and the realization he does not need to be on medication and it is okay to feel something. This drama/comedy is wonderfully balance with the movie's soundtrack adding its own flavor to the mix. Zach Braff wrote, directed, and starred in this movie and for it to come out with such brilliance is an outstanding feat! Sam, portrayed by Natilie Portman, reminds us its okay to cry but it is better to laugh instead. Sometimes you just need to have an original moment and scream your head off."

"virinluster","10","1","2","15 January 2005"," Very quiet and well-drawn movie
","I didn't want to wait until they publish the German version of the DVD, hence, I ordered it on Amazon.com a few weeks ago. For some strange reason, the movie had minimal publicity over here, even though ""Scrubs"" was running on TV at the time, and with some success. Anyway, I watched the movie and was more than just a little impressed. Over the years, I guess I have taken a liking to these quiet, observatory movies that grant you an intimate insight into someone's life and crises, the like of ""Secretary"" or ""About Schmidt"". ""Garden State"" is one of these movies, as well.<br/><br/>It's what I would call a well-drawn movie, gifted with a fine script, and a precise, concise storyline that is to the point, even though the basic setting seems to beg for some degree of meandering at first. Zach Braff plays Andrew Largeman, a mildly successful, 26 year old wanna be-actor who returns home to Newark for the first time in 9 years. Together with his dad Gideon (Ian Holmes), he tries to tackle the recent death - or rather: suicide - of his quadriplegic mother. Prowling through his hometown, he meets with Sam (Natalie Portman), they become friends, and, ultimately, lovers. Slowly, Andrew wakes from the Lithium induced stupor that most of his life was, ever since he hurt and disabled his mom. Rather than return to Los Angeles, he finally opts for sharing his life with Sam. <br/><br/>The script is as fragile as it is careful, of course, mainly because the protagonists (not the actors) are fragile, caught together in a most decisive phase of their lifes, where every little step makes a difference. Both Zach Braff and Natalie Portman know how to fill these careful, fragile parts - Portman, in particular, is a real stunner in her role. Substract all those overblown Star Wars costumes & conventions, and what remains is very fine and gifted actor. Braff, too, demonstrates that his talents are not exhausted with comic roles. The two have a definite chemistry on screen and it's fun watching them finding their ways through the world and to each other. Ultimately, that chemistry is what prevents the (happy) ending from being schmaltzy or anything. With two weeks gone, this is the best movie I have seen so far this year, and it's very, very likely to keep that top spot. A straight 10 out of 10."
"bjolley","9","1","2","14 January 2005"," Director Braff portrays real, heartfelt feeling
","Though some of the scenes seemed rougher than necessary (drug use, sex, language), Braff did a fantastic job portraying a feeling of deep, genuine love between two very likable characters. He and Portman exuded a chemistry that was moving and sincere. He managed to throw in some particularly funny dialog along the way, and in addition collected some fantastic music that seemed to fit perfectly. I went out and got the sounds track soon after and have very much enjoyed it. Highly recommended. As the director and lead actor, Braff managed to put together one of the most interesting and touching films all year, as well as one the is cinematic ally beautiful. It's a movie I plan to add to my personal collection."

I've have come to figure out the Zack Braff has a charm towards young people( i'm 21), i'm not sure how he did it. Natile Portman's betrayal of a free spirit girl who has somewhat of a hard time relaxing in his presence made me connect to her better as a person and a character. Zack's strength and wit calmed me down and seep the choices and chances he took in the end summed it up wonderfully. the writing of the movie was not obnoxious and whinie but more of a breath of fresh air.

Zach Braff was a good fit for the lead role, playing his character just right. Natalie Portman again shines; at times innocent and at other times wise beyond her years, but always amazing. You would have to be from another planet not to fall for her character's unique personality. The supporting characters were a fun mix of oddballs and eccentrics. Besides the pace the other thing I could see giving some people a problem was the ending. An enjoyable film overall; worth the price of the video."

It seems to be aimed at late- twentysomething's, and discuss issues of family, friendship, abandonment, home, drugs, sex, music... love... death.<br/><br/>Zach Braff has collected an excellent cast for this complicated music, including Sir Ian Holm and Natalie Portman who both give the performances of their careers. <br/><br/>Whilst the film leaves something nagging at the back of your mind, it is as close to perfection as such a unique film can be.<br/><br/>My number 1 film of the year."
"Chris_Docker","8","1","2","5 January 2005"," Whacky comedy that is strangely meaningful and relevant
","Garden State is little short of a revelation. Screwball, mindless comedy has been successfully twinned with original and intelligent script writing.<br/><br/>Andrew Largeman has been in a lithium-induced haze since childhood. The heavy-duty antidepressants block out all emotions and leave him in a state where nothing bothers him very much. The opening sequences of the film are quite disorientating until we realise that we are seeing the world from Andrew's viewpoint. But then there is a series of events that involve Andrew travelling across states to his mother's funeral, a confrontation with his estranged father, and a chance meeting with a girl who is as zany as he is but in a totally different way. He decides to come off the lithium and experience life first hand.<br/><br/>The basic bad-taste elements of Garden State would barely lift it above the status of an average to good goofball comedy. There's Andrew's much talked-about minor screen role where he played a retarded kid more convincingly than a kid who is really retarded; a dog that tries to hump him and another dog that can masturbate itself; Andrew's old school mate has become a cop and practices being convincing at it when screaming at motorists, and Andrew's girlfriend will invent a random noise to convince herself of her originality. But the movie's real strength is not just that these gags, which might not be to everyone's taste, are done surprisingly well. It's almost as if Garden State manages to reach us on levels we had forgotten were important. When Andrew (who doesn't like making time for his ungracious dad) goes to his mother's funeral, his father quips about how he managed to 'fit it in' and about how it's important to 'find time to say goodbye.' But the irony is that it is Andrew, screwed up as he is, who manages to really say goodbye to the past. Not only that, his sincerity reaches through the professional wall that his psychiatrist father has erected and helps the old man also come to terms with the past.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman (as Sam) is equally dramatic in the unexpected impact her character has on us. She is a compulsive liar and not overly bright but, like Andrew, she comes to an acceptance of herself that is more truthful and revealing than the more successful characters in the film. While the visual jokes are standard off the wall - and quite good in that sort of way - the dialogue is scintillating and touches us on a much deeper level. There is a pathos in that these two characters, who have few qualities and little successes to write home about, manage to reach a harmony with life that we find not only intellectually satisfying but that most of us would perhaps want to strive to emulate. Suddenly the camel trying to pass through the eye of a needle refers not just to a material achievement that can blind us but to the mental and emotional garbage we carry around in our carefully constructed personas. Andrew, experiencing ordinary life as if from out of an emotional black hole, manages to analyse his situation simply and intelligently, unencumbered by the baggage that most of us have built up by the time we have reached his age. The effect is humbling."
"maffilms13","9","1","2","4 January 2005"," Our Graduate... a wonderful film.
","Sure it's a lofty comparison, but it's one that has to be made and Garden State measures up. Braff really does create what could be the quintessential coming of age film for this generation. The story of a suburban kid who returns home to find it just the way he left it, and realizes, he may have out grown the place and the people.<br/><br/>Portman and Raff (not to mention the wonderfully vibrant supporting cast) give great heartfelt performances, and his writing will ring true with anyone who has faced that moment of having to let go of ""home."" Partially because of all the crap Hollywood puts out, I kept waiting for the melodramatic twists to happen, but they never do and the movie is better for it. The film reminds me of a more sedate Kevin Smith style, character and dialogue based must be something in the Jersey water strike that Jersey water will just kill ya. Anyway, this is a beautiful film that may seem to drag at the start, but is really just it's character waking up to life and taking the audience with him. One of my favorites this year, with a great soundtrack.<br/><br/>(oh and if you are not watching it already, catch Raff on SCRUBS... best comedy on TV.)"

For me, the end result is a touching and grown-up film.<br/><br/>Not since ""The Professional"" have I seen Natalie Portman give such a great performance, and Peter Sarsgaard does a fantastic job in this film as well. The choice of music is phenomenal; I can't think of many movies where the music was more tastefully chosen.<br/><br/>Garden State is not a perfect movie, but perfection was not the intent of this film.

The movie itself is just very well choreographed and filmed as well. Also the soundtrack flows so well with this film, unlike anything I'd ever seen before.

Andrew (Braff) hasn't returned to his hometown in 10 years after being sent off to boarding school by his parents following a dreadful accident. Filled with sorrow and confusion Andrew struggles to find himself throughout the film. Along the way he meets perky and random Sam (Portman). Sam is just what Andrew needs to pick him up. The two become friends fast and spend most of Andrew's short visit to Jersey together. The real excitement in this film is the love between these two. You know from start that they are just made for each other and its this that keeps you hooked. You'll be laughing from start to finish in this film, with its clever humor. As well as crying in parts of it, where it seems to ever so easily touch our hearts.<br/><br/>This film definitely delivers a great performance unlike anything I've seen in a long time.

","""Garden State"" is the directorial debut from Zach Braff, who you might recognize from the NBC television series ""Scrubs"". After seeing his film, I can really only say ONE thing for sure: Zach Braff has a good career ahead of him. He is very well versed in the art of tugging at heart-strings. In fact, almost everything about his film seems made for the sole purpose of making your insides melt. For some movie goers, the dripping emotional scenes and easy accessibility of the film will be a huge attraction. However, for others, it may prove irritating and somewhat condescending. I personally enjoyed ""Garden State"" despite its inherent shortcomings and I'm definitely anxious to see what Braff will do next, but I have to say that this movie was kind of spoiled by its last half hour. Don't get me wrong. This is a good movie; however, it could have been a great one if Zach Braff had been willing to get rid of the pieces that didn't fit. What is good about Garden State is really really good, but what doesn't fit in the movie only serves to slow it down and remove the focus from a wonderful story about love and self-discovery. The film's running time is 109 minutes and if it was trimmed down a bit, I think that this would be an excellent film. Don't let that stop you from seeing ""Garden State"" though. There's too much good in it to be undermined by a few bad scenes and a few strange plot detours. This is definitely one of the better films of this summer."

","Whether you want a movie that makes you laugh, cry, challenge your brain, or just make you sit and ponder life, Garden State is the movie to get you through the day.<br/><br/>This is unquestionably one of the best movies i've seen in years, and I have no doubt that its one of the only movies whose main plot is one of those corny love stories, common to chick flicks, that I would ever consider for my top ten favorite movies of all time.<br/><br/>There are many movies out there that are merely made to entertain, which isn't exactly a bad thing but it is always refreshing to see a film that really makes you think. Life is a complicated process and Garden State takes us through some of the greater difficulties, things like family, where your going in life and love.<br/><br/>The music was also an amazing highlight for this film. The music never fails to accent the moment, which of course is expected of a film but this soundtrack features some really good bands. Namely The Shins, Simon and Garfunkle, Coldplay, and Iron and Wine, all of which are amazing groups.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen Garden State yet go out and rent it, it is absolutely amazing and is one of the best movies I've ever seen."
"mlevans","9","1","2","3 January 2005"," Braff looks like the real thing
","After watching Garden State, I feel privileged to be one of the earlier riders on the Zach Braff bandwagon. Make that the Zach Braff sidecar.<br/><br/>This little gem thoroughly impressed meespecially for a directorial debut. That Braff was also the star of the film makes his work even more commendable. I definitely look forward to seeing future projects by Braff.<br/><br/>Crew members compared Garden State's feel to a Hal Ashby film. I would agree (from what limited knowledge I have of Ashby's work) and add that he seems to have a little Lasse Hallstrom, Wes Anderson and Jean-Pierre Jeunet in him as well. Of course we're getting a bit ahead of ourselves. Obviously, Braff will have to prove himself on more than one film and will have to make the transition from indy shoestring-budget promise to major production brilliance like the aforementioned trio did before he can be mentioned in the same breath with such masters.<br/><br/>Braff is certainly off to a flying start, though. The semi-autobiographical film has a gentle, lilting feel to itsort of like Natalie Portman's contagious, lopsided smile. Somewhat dark, and yet upbeat, the film is pleasant to look at and listen to and leaves the viewer strangely fulfilled. From the acting to the unique sets to the New Jersey countryside to the interesting wide-angle shots, the film has Braff's signature clearly inscribed on it. It is more than enough to make a film fan salivate over the work Braff may produce in the future.<br/><br/>For now, his canon consists of one filman extremely well-make film. Braff teams with Portman to form a memorable couple. Portman is cuddly, spunky and full of vitalityin stark contrast to Braff's numb character during the movie's early stages. Peter Sarsgaard turns in good work as Braff's grave-digging high school buddy. The rest of the cast is very solid and gives the film an almost surrealistic feel to it. Almost in a daze until near the end, Andrew Largemen (Braff) sits stoically through some totally bizarre scenes until Portman's quirky warmth gradually penetrates his hardened outer shell.<br/><br/>I would say that if one likes Anderson's work (i.e., Rushmore, Royal Tenenbaums), Jeunet's (Amelie) or Hallstrom's (Gilbert Grape, Chocolat, etc.), one quite likely would be charmed and warmed by Garden State. Whatever Braff's future holds, he has already done what many directors never do: produce an original and memorable film."

","Zach Braff (Scrubs) stars, wrote, and directs this little gem about a guy who returns home after many years to attend his mother's funeral. His character, ""Largeman"" is one of those guys who never really understands his existence. He was blamed for his mother's initial health problems and sent away to boarding school because his father felt that he needed to be away. He is also is on every manic-depressant known to man because his father thinks he needs it. ""Largeman"" (his last name) isn't sure he really does need it, but goes anyway to please his dad.<br/><br/>He eventually hooks up with some old friends and meets a new friend, Sam (Natalie Portman. Sam is an epileptic, a liar, and also a bit of a loon, but she also understands ""Large"". The two of them, in the very short time he is back home, begin a fruitful and important friendship.<br/><br/>This movie is very low key, but it's also very charming and very funny. It's extremely well written. These are people that are identifiable, and everyone probably knows someone like ""Largeman"". He justs simply wants to live his life and begin to understand things better. Not always do what people think is right for him. (***1/2)"

They are a point where they think they don't belong to society or at least that they can't fit in it. All the sadness and misery about their existence will then start to disappear with the meeting a of girl that will change their lives for ever. While in ""Eternal....."" Kate Winslet is bit a ""crazy"", ""junky"" typed girl, Natalie Portman is more like a ""free spirited"" girl.

","Don't be fooled by what britni44 said. Garden State has a Perfect 10. The beginning isn't slow. It shows just how bland Andrew's (Zach Braff)life really is. It would seem slow to someone who really didn't get that point. Sam (Portman) comes in and really rescues him by showing that everyone in life has problems. You just need to laugh at yourself. I found that at times I was on the verge of crying and then all of a sudden I was laughing out loud. Mr. Braff really knows how to pull on the heart strings. I also found that I enjoyed watching the DVD extras. Sometimes you see deleted scenes and you know why they took them out. This is the opposite. There are some scenes that I wish they would have left in. This is a great movie to bring home to Mom (I will be this weekend) or for a quiet evening, cuddled up with a loved one."

After returning home for the first time in 9 years Largeman meets back up with his old pals who are mostly equally as unhinged. He meets Sam (Portman), who suffers from epilepsy, and her optimistic outlook on life slowly starts to rub off on Largeman.<br/><br/>This is a nicely played film and highly enjoyable. I noticed a review saying that it was equally as over rated as American Beauty and I've got to say it reminded me in feel to American Beauty and Requiem for a Dream. I'm sure it's been said in many reviews, but why can't Natalie Portman put in a performance like this in the Star War films.

LOTR for example...um the last samurai, stir of echos, all types of 4 star movies... but none them reach the mental and emotional capacity of this movie.. what caught my eye the most is how the characters were SO incredibly real! there was no specific plot, it was just LIFE period. there were parts i didn't understand because i'm so used to typical Hollywood so when i came across this totally different dialog i was a little confused and almost not interested.. but after awhile i started seeing the bigger picture.. this wasn't a movie with plot twists and hot babes like everyone expects, this was just people finding themselves and living life.. but the way Andrew and Sam interacted with each other, eventually falling in love... that stuff actually happens in life, i have yet to fall in love but i believe when a person does, it't something like that.. and you know right then and there that u can never go back. this movie has made a big impact on my life.. i know it's silly to say that but honestly if you saw it the way i saw it you would understand.. i would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who's life need a little wake up call.."
"ExplodingGopher","10","1","2","30 December 2004"," Fantastic Movie
","You ever have one of those ""wow"" moments after a movie? You know, the final scene darkens, the credits roll, and you just sit there thinking. It's like a good song or a good book: you just feel satisfied when it's over. Garden State gives you one of those moments.<br/><br/>One of the best things about it is that it's nothing like any movie you'll ever see. It's not a movie where you can coherently answer the question, ""What's it about?"" because the plot doesn't follow the average story line. I guess you could say that Garden State is about people. It's a love story of the highest sort. Not only between a man and a woman, but between a man and himself. It's the story of the most significant journey in a man's life--the journey home.<br/><br/>What really makes this movie stand apart from others is the writing. Zach Braff, who also directed and starred in the film, brilliantly crafted a screenplay that both connects you with the characters and allows you to examine your own life in their context. However, it wasn't brooding or dark in the least. In fact, you often laugh despite yourself throughout.<br/><br/>This is due only in part to the writing, as the acting is also superb. Braff really develops his character (Andrew) as the movie progresses. Natalie Portman shines as the quirky, lovable Samantha who absolutely transforms Andrew's life. All of the other characters are relatively minor in comparison, but they're all well played and accent the depth of Braff's character.<br/><br/>The soundtrack also gets an honorable mention. Featuring Colin Hay, Nick Drake, Iron & Wine, Simon & Garfunkel, and the Shins (among others), the soundtrack is more than just background music. It adds to the mood and meaning of the movie. If my life had a soundtrack, and I wish it did, I'd want it to be this one.<br/><br/>A number of characters in Garden State talk about doing something unique, something like nobody else has ever done. Zach Braff has in creating this movie.<br/><br/>Best quote: ""Maybe that's all family really is. A group of people who miss the same imaginary place."""

","I have just seen 'Beautiful Girls' again, a film starring Timothy Hutton, Uma Thurman, Matt Dillon, Micheal Rapaport and of course Natalie Portman.<br/><br/>Its interesting to note how similar these two films are. Its about a 27 year old piano player (lounge acts) who comes back to his snow laden town, for his high school reunion, thereby reconnecting with his old friends and family. Kudos for a great script, and of course the excellent direction by the late, great Ted Demme. <br/><br/>Natalie Portman plays Marty, a 13 year old 'free spirit' and old soul that becomes something of a desire to the protagonist, not too unlike 'Leon' in terms of age and character. <br/><br/>I wonder if Zach Braff has seen this film? I say this thinking about a specific point of reference. In Garden State, she was an ice skating enthusiast in her day, and in beautiful girls she ice skates,displaying similar moves as seen in garden state,(regardless if its her in the costume or not) Perhaps this a nice little knowing nod, or a reference to beautiful girls? if as it seems it may have influenced him.<br/><br/>I would go as far as saying that, if one looks at Marty from Beautiful girls and 'Sam' from Garden State, that the latter could almost be the grown up version of Marty.<br/><br/>Ah, the ramblings of a man with too much time on his hands....<br/><br/>Peace Out."
"Danny_G13","9","1","2","16 December 2004"," Classy, subtle and beautifully conceived, but...
","I saw the 8.3 on IMDb and decided this was one I had to see. I wasn't quite sure what it was about, which is a good thing - going into a movie entirely blindly is something I've not done for some considerable time, and it was refreshing to do so here.<br/><br/>Zak Braff stars as Andrew, a man in his mid 20's living in LA having emigrated away from New Jersey, to pursue a career as an actor, with only limited success. His present day-job is as a waiter in a Vietnamese restaurant, and when he receives a call from his estranged father telling him his mother has died, he travels back to his childhood home, to the area he was raised, which re-ignites old acquaintances.<br/><br/>It would be unfair to label Garden State as some kind of superfluous coming of age drama, as the main protagonist is well into his adult life. However, there is without doubt a semblance of this kind of theme, in that Andrew is a troubled individual who's been on medication since he was only a young boy, and has come to some type of crossroads since attending the funeral of his recently passed mother.<br/><br/>What it would *not* be unfair to label Garden State as is 'subtle'. I can rarely recall such an underplayed movie, which gets the balance of action and dialogue absolutely spot on, while never appearing to think a lot of itself. The humour is subtle, the acting is subtle, the entire picture is subtle. This delicate and almost poetic approach serves it extremely well and is a fine antidote to the forceful movies more commonly produced by Hollywood.<br/><br/>Another of the main aspects it has in its favour is the quality of both the dialogue and acting. Every character says just the right thing, at the right time, with the right delivery. And by 'right' I mean 'realistic'. There's even a subtle flub of a line at one point which gives the scene a genuine grit. The movie is extremely down to earth without being morbid. The acting adds to this, with all characters coming across as actual people and never caricatures of stereotypes that we usually suffer.<br/><br/>As both the main star and director, Braff is simply perfection. His character sometimes appears as awkward and bland, but believe me it is intentional, and when he actually adds a bit of emotion to a moment, it truly works and is utterly believable. His direction is absolutely spot on. Never overly flashy, never dull, there's an equilibrium which draws the viewer in as well as anything else I've seen.<br/><br/>As Sam, the love interest, Natalie Portman shows she can actually act. The only things I recall seeing her in besides this were the quite appalling Star Wars prequels and her wooden displays were an embarrassment. Here she portrays a warmth and quirkiness which is, yes, subtle, as well as personable. The fellow leads, such as Peter Sarsgaard as Mark, all add extremely well to the movie without ever outstaying their welcomes.<br/><br/>However, you *knew* there was a 'but' coming (as indicated by the title)...<br/><br/>Slight spoiler ahead:<br/><br/>The ending is atrocious. Yes, it's possibly been raised elsewhere but I have to affirm it. The ending goes disappointingly Hollywood and is an absolute rush job which undoes all the brilliant work which went before it. This ending is why Ridley Scott released the Director's Cut of Blade Runner, rather than the walking off into the sunset finale originally released.<br/><br/>Spoiler over: <br/><br/>This is a fairly original, beautifully constructed and poignant piece of cinema, which is let down by its desperation to have a conclusively predictable ending. I still rate it very highly, but I'm disappointed that I felt so empty after the ending. This should have left me with a lot more."

","An intelligent friend of mine that I thought good taste recommended this movie to me. It was only later that I would find out that she was a fan of the sitcom, Friends. If I had known, I would have taken her suggestion with a grain of salt.<br/><br/>With that said, this movie was awful. It was a capitalization on the success of movies like Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and Lost in Translation (an actually great film). Where I felt that Eternal Sunshine was a movie that looked good and was well done, but lacked the mysteries of the universe, I felt that Garden State neither looked good, contained the mysteries of the universe, or was well done, and managed to make me question whether or not love is something real or just a farce because of horrible movies like this that bastardize it.<br/><br/>The dialogue was so cliché and predictable that I found myself laughing towards the end. ""when I'm with you.....I'm home"" comes to mind, and there is a scene where Braff and Portman kiss in the rain and then Braff contorts his face for several seconds in pained revaliation of the mysteries of the universe. The film also attempts to add artistic shots at arbitrary moments. In one scene they are standing in a pool and the camera focuses on a light that grows from under the pool eventually taking over the shot while Braff and Portman just kind of look towards the camera as if they're posing.<br/><br/>There were several repetitions of bad imagery and symbolism as well as thematic motives. One sickening one that comes to mind is the whole ""do something unique, that you've never done before"" that rears it's ugly head again at the end. ""Oh!"" the viewer thinks.....""I've heard that before.....this movie is so deep!""<br/><br/>There is nothing profound about this movie. It is not honest. It is formulaic. It follows the Joseph Campbell model of the journey of the hero perfectly. A hero leaves the safe world, reluctantly, in search of the elixer. He sleeps with the mother figure, comes to the abyss (literally in this movie), and finds the actual elixer which is not the one he expects, than returns home, master of both worlds. The reason this is important is that all stories follow this model, if you adhere to the idea, however, it's the variations in the model that can make a story unique. This movie varies nothing. I almost wondered if the screen writer (Braff apparently) was laughing to himself as he wrote this cheesy typical script.<br/><br/>It's OK to make a film that doesn't have the mysteries of the universe in it, however, it's not OK to make one that pretends to."

"Lyntra","10","1","2","4 December 2004"," My pick for film of the year
","Auteurism is generally regarded as the theory where a director puts his personalised 'stamp' into a film. What happens though, when a film-maker has only made one film? Can you still recognise their stamp, or does it take more than one film to show this? After seeing Garden State I believe that Zach Braff is the new breed of auteur. Even though this is his directorial debut I can sense his personal presence everywhere, through the script (based on personal experience) to the soundtrack (chosen from his cd collection). Watching this film I combined the two of the lead characters into one and I believe that that is where Braff lies, collides, or maybe somewhere in between. Andrew Largeman (Braff) has been doped up on lithium since he was 11 and hasn't been home to the garden state in 9 years. That is, until his father rings him to ask him to come home for his mothers funeral. It is here that Largeman decides to get off the pills and try to experience some level of emotion, because he hasn't had the chance to feel anything since childhood. Largeman through out the film gives the sense of almost completing monologues to people, explaining what's in his head and why things have changed so much. They are not dialogue in conversation, they are speeches presented to his friends and to the audience. There is a large amount of drug taking in this film, including experimentation at parties with friends, Prescriptions given to you by your shrink father and the more bizarre sharing marijuana with your mother. Through the script Braff has created strange parental relationships and emphasis upon the drug taking experimentation of youth. What is the difference between him and his friends? They all take drugs, only the majority of his are prescribed. Through luck Largeman meets Sam (Natalie Portman) in a waiting room. She is sweet, funny, fun and lies compulsively. She is what brings Largeman and this film to life. Braff uses the character of Sam to make something left of centre in the film world. Her kookiness is something that I feel is an element in him and it is also what makes this feel different to other comedies. While it has a mainstream release on the surface it does not have a mainstream appeal- until Portman breathes in a breath of fresh air and grabs the audience. From her first scene involving talking about the band The Shins, Braff seems to place himself in her (He once described them as 'the coolest band in the world on his weblog) and the film travels from there. <br/><br/>With a fantastic soundtrack of indie bands and with some clever visual jokes Braff has made a film that is touching, sweet and painful all at once. Also with one of the catchiest trailers and soundtracks, I look forward to Braff's next step into auteurism."
"vertigo_14","9","1","2","5 December 2004"," A movie about a generation that Time Magazine referred to as 'Twixters.' (spoilers)
","Garden State is another low budget, honest movie that knocks the socks off anything mainstream has had to offer in it's tired repertoire in at least the last fifteen years (if not more). <br/><br/>Garden State is a sad and brutally honest look at not really apathetic youth, but more like disillusioned youth. You might particularly relate if you grew up in a small town and left after high school and came back to find that too many of the people you once knew never progressed beyond their high school character. That is seriously disheartening, especially if you're that static character. <br/><br/>This is the story of Andrew Largeman (Braff), a young man living in L.A. From the beginning, he is embued in this extreme repetitive, ritualistic life that really seems to mean nothing. He is emotionless. He gets a call from his dad to come home because his mother died. And thus, sets off events that force him to rethink things about himself, about his family, and everything else. A much needed wakeup call. Andrew meets Sam (Portman), quite a genuine character as the young woman who's opposite nature of Largeman force him to kind of shake his own emotionless state and confront all those things that he consistently avoids. One of those floating angel type of characters, where they force the protagonist to change because of their differing outlook on things. Kind of like Mark Ruffalo's character's ability to change his sister in the movie 'You Can Count on Me.' Only Sam is quite lively.<br/><br/>This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. My only problem with it was the ending at the airport, in which Braff appears to have acquiesed to the Hollywood ending (there's nothing wrong with a happy ending, it was just the sappy way it was done, which kind of deflects from a genuinely honest story and characters up to that point). Braff and Portman give excellent performances and Braff has really proved both directorial and writing capabilities. I look forward to what he has to offer in the future. But enough of that. Get off your kiester and go see the movie already!"

What is it with whiny teenage melodrama(he's 28 with a 17 year-old perspective), this movie provides no challenge to audience, it simply lulls right from the beginning with predictability.

","Garden State has received rave reviews and is praised everywhere as something very close to a masterpiece. I just saw the film and I had very high expectations, only to be disappointed to have viewed a quite boring and trivial film. I am truly puzzled as to why so many people liked the film so much.<br/><br/>The essential point of interest in this film must be the characters. I expect any evaluation of the film will be based on whether their dilemmas, personality and life styles are presented in a credible way, in a way that makes you identify with them. <br/><br/>I guess this is exactly where the film fails for me. The characters seem to me less than credible, somehow superficial. Natalie Portman is adorable, of course, but do we even believe that such a girl truly exists? And why is she so attracted to Largeman? Largeman is weighed down by his father's decision to keep him in a state of indifference through medication. He blames him for his mother's disability when it was just a freak accident. All his life Largeman has escaped into numbness because he may be a dangerous person who is capable of hurting other people in a very concrete manner. <br/><br/>And then what happens? Largeman meets this incredible person, who really is ""incredible"" and everything changes. He starts to talk. He tells his old friends, people he hasn't seen for 10 years about himself. They go on an odd quest to find his mother's favorite necklass, and they scream into the abyss. They fall in love, separate briefly, and then decide to give love a try. The essence of the film being: Life is now - let's live it.<br/><br/>It's all very conventional and very mainstream. There is nothing independent about it, if independent means making it new, showing the audience something from a different perspective. It does not suffice to make quirky characters if they do not ring true. But it pretends to do so, it pretends to have something essential to say. <br/><br/>An intelligent version of the same theme was done with credible characters in ""Beautiful Girls"" by Ted Demme. Watch that one instead!!<br/><br/>3/10"

","'Original', 'quirky' and 'exiting'. Yeah, right. This is so much the quintessential run-of-the-mill romantic comedy that you just sit pinned to you chair waiting for Hugh 'Bad career move' Grant to rear his ugly head somewhere.<br/><br/>How this film managed to run away with acclaim both from Sundance and LA Film Festival is a mystery to me. It's the same old story in a indie-ish wrapping: sympathetic if somewhat bewildered, confused and disorganized boy (who happens to be rather goodlooking) meets chaotic and somewhat neurotic yet highly attractive girl possessing all the vigour he lacks. A deus in machina (death of paralyzed mother) sets wheels in motion, yet some kind of problem arises (in this case the young man's dominant father, who actually seems quite irrelevant for the entire movie). <br/><br/>However, because these two completely unique people are sooooooo right for each other, and love is soooooooo strong (yuck) they still manage to pull it off, including the mandatory desperate-last-second-dash-at-railway-station-after-tearful-goodbye scene in the end. (Well, it's actually an airport here. And I haven't given it away for you, after 20 mins. this is bleedingly obvious anyway.)<br/><br/>This movie is all that it's pretending not to be: calculated, commercial, predictable, un-intriguing, repetitive and boring.<br/><br/>It's probably a good career move for Zach Braff. He's made a good bid to launch a career as a teenage poster boy for the next ten years or so with this flick. Good career move? Dunno. Profitable, at least. But for those of us who actually took something of a liking to him and his somewhat offbeat 'Scrubs' series, it's a disappointment nevertheless.<br/><br/>Actually, they should have made the movie out of Peter Skarsgaard's graveplundering-gravedigging-dope-head character instead. Now that could have an interesting movie.<br/><br/>But then again, Zach Braff couldn't have sported his now well-worn 'oh I'm so confused/bewildered gaze'.<br/><br/>If you insist on killing off your neurons with a movie of this kind, rent 'Four wedding and a funeral' instead. The original is still the best, even if Hugh Grant is nauseating by now."

","I went into this movie not really knowing what to think..I'd seen previews, but not too many considering I live in Kansas and it didn't even open in theaters here until late August. And the previews I had seen, didn't really explain much about the plot. <br/><br/>I saw it with my mom on the 20th of August(first day of my junior yr.) And surprisingly, we BOTH loved it. I loved the fact that there were so many unexpected comedic moments, yet it still told a touching story. It was sort of a coming-of-age story and showed that sometimes you have to just change everything and LIVE. Nobody's perfect, but everyone's got a different side to them. Zach Braff did an amazing job with this film, especially for his first film. Talk about a double/triple/whatever threat!"
"your_local_locksmith24","8","1","2","28 November 2004"," A great debut
","Zach Braff's ""garden State"", in which he writes, directs and stars, is certainly an impressive debut. I must admit I have been anticipating this movie for a little while now, and it definitely lived up to expectations. Yet it didn't exceed them - which is probably understandable for a first effort. It loses it's way a bit towards the end, and the ending itself is a bit of a cop-out - also understandable. Many others have noted that the drama feels a bit forced - also true. <br/><br/>So what exactly was it that made this movie so good? Why is everyone raving about it? Well, here's why. <br/><br/>***MINOR SPOLERS***<br/><br/>1. One morning, Andrew (Braff) receives a call from his estranged father that his mother has died and should return home to New jersey for her funeral. A few seconds later, we hear the first few chords of Coldplay's ""Don't Panic"". Later on, a drug scene is perfectly complemented by Zero 7's ""In the waiting line"", while Nick Drake calmly croons over another scene on a motorbike through the leafy suburbs. <br/><br/>Score 1: Perfect use of music. <br/><br/>2. Braff plays Andrew, the struggling Hollywood actor who has been away from home for 9 years. He has been on an assortment of anti-depressants since he was 10 years old, which have been prescribed for him by his psychologist father (Ian Holm). Upon receiving the call, he returns home to New Jersey - minus his assortment of prescription drugs. As you would expect, he gradually becomes less numb, and by the end of the movie he is far more openly emotional. Braff's performance reflects this perfectly. <br/><br/>Natalie Portman turns out a brilliant performance as Sam, a quirky, compulsive liar who befriends Andrew on his journey of self-discovery. This is the role you always knew she had in her. Braff and Portman have great on-screen chemistry, turning out more than a few moments of great wit, emotion, and joy. Elsewhere, Holm, Peter Saarsgard (Andrew's childhood friend, Mark) and others turn out some great supporting roles.<br/><br/>Score 2: Great cast, fantastic performances. <br/><br/>3. Braff does show everyone that he is capable of both drama and very clever comedy. Some of the more dramatic moments fall a bit flat, especially later on, but they are mostly saved by the great acting and some fantastic camera work. But the best moments are when Braff uses his wonderful gift for precisely the right amount and style of comedy. Many of the moments feel so real and perfect, you'll be on the verge of tears in one moment, and laughing the next. <br/><br/>Score 3: Great script, screenplay, and cinematography.<br/><br/>So all the ingredients are there for a great movie. And that's exactly what Garden State is. It's not amazing, just ""great"". And for a debut movie, that certainly counts for something. Zach Braff has certainly showed off his talent for the art of film-making, and I look forward to his work in the future. As for this movie, if it doesn't make you smile, laugh and/or cry a few times, then maybe you need therapy too. <br/><br/>8/10"

","As I write this, Garden State is in the top 250. What a sad commentary on films these days. Now, don't get me wrong, this film isn't BAD, it's just uneven. Some very clever parts. Good performances --<br/><br/>especially Natalie Portman. And interesting film techniques. But it's downright melodramatic and insulting at some points. Sorry Zach, but you make John<br/><br/>Hughes look like Shakespeare at certain times (especially near the end).

"jay4stein79-1","Null","1","2","9 November 2004"," Enjoyable Mediocrity
","I'll be honest. I did not want to like Garden State. I held it at arms length because it seemed, from the previews and gushing reviews by scenesters, like it was trying a little too hard to be cool. I don't like movies that try to be cool (Pi, for instance); I like movies that are cool.<br/><br/>Anyway, I went to see it anyway, hadn't seen anything in a while and figured it was my best bet at the local theaters. Did I dislike it? Not really, Garden State is enjoyable, even if it drags in parts. Did I like it? Not really. The movie simply left me ambivalent. The experience of watching Zach Braff and Natalie Portman fight their personal demons and find true love was not painful, nor was it revelatory. It was a nice enough way to spend a couple hours, but I could devise both better and worse ways to spend that time. So, yes, Garden State is an enjoyable flick that really had no staying power in my mind. This films differs from, say, Kill Bill or A Home at the End of the World, to use two new examples, in that respect; those movies remained in my brain for days as I picked them apart. I left the theater after seeing them and I felt that I had experienced something. They affected me bodily. Garden State did not. It is enjoyable mediocrity.<br/><br/>Why? The quirks in this film give it appeal that most romantic comedies lack; they make the story interesting (had they been left out Garden State would have been a very bad movie). I find that interesting inasmuch as I dreaded the quirks. I thought quirks meant the story was trying to hard to be ""different"" and ""hip."" Turns out, the more surreal moments are woven organically into the film; they do not sit out like sore thumbs. They make sense in the context of the movie.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman also makes the movie more enjoyable that it would have been without her. She is an angel and, in a quasi-reprise of her role in Beautiful Girls, she won my heart again. I'd given up hope on her and Garden State showed me again why I loved her in the first place.<br/><br/>That said, the rest of the movie is less compelling. Zach Braff is rather un-interesting in the lead, but I have to give him credit for getting Portman to play his love interest. If it worked for him, there's hope for the rest of us. The story, on the whole, is also lack-luster.<br/><br/>It's un-original and, for my tastes, strangely derivative of Rick Moody's completely un-related novel. (It's interesting that the movie and book have nothing to do with one another, yet they both have the same name and are about 20-somethings with mental health problems. Either young head cases are common to New Jersey or Braff decided to write his own narratively dissimilar but tonally similar version of Moody's novel). The movie also under-uses Ian Holm, a terrific actor who should be allowed more range than is given him here.<br/><br/>Again, Garden State is not terrible, nor is it good. It is so middle of the road, it might as well be a set of parallel yellow lines."
"peterbonilla1029","7","1","2","25 October 2004"," Sweet Jesus You People, it's not that Good!
","first of all, let me say that I liked Zach Braff's film. It is definitely an impressive first film, and we should all pay attention to whatever he does next. It generally had good production values, and I thought the camera-work was impressive, and its simplicity helped add to the overall drearily-comic effect of the movie. Braff was good, Sarsgaard was great, and Natalie Portman was phenomenal, by far the most engaging character I saw in a film this year, and probably one of the most instantly likable ever.<br/><br/>But good lord, it's not THAT good. An 8.4 rating out of 10? You have to be kidding me! It definitely has its problems, most of them having to do with the script, which is at points underdeveloped. A good third of the movie is spent on a quest, looking for what we don't know, and once the goal is reached, we are only left to wonder why they spent so much time searching for it. It could have been very sweet and moving, but came out as confusing and anticlimactic. And the ending was completely botched, taking the easy way out in my opinion and completely ignoring the development of their characters up to that point. <br/><br/>It's good, but it is nowhere near the icon of indie film-making many say it is, nor is it anywhere near the cultural landmark and ballad of the depressed 20-something generation they want it to be.<br/><br/>Around a 7 is what this film deserves, and that is what it gets from me."

This is the most inspirational film I have ever seen, and it actually gave me some direction and perspective on my own life, as I'm sure it will for a lot of people. I would recommend this movie anyone who has an acquired taste for slick witty humor and top notch acting. How this did not make a bigger release I don't know, but Kudos to Zach and everyone for making such a brilliant piece of work."

","Cute yes, part of IMDb's top 250 no. Un-enticing acting by director/protagonist is only partially helped by great performance from leading lady. For a no-plotter relying on mood and introspection, not as thought-provoking as one might expect. Good points though: the brain-washing of coming-of-age New-Jerseyates, such as character working in department store - clearly says something about a consumer culture gone a little too far. Funny moments, script continuously on the border between acceptable and forgettable, can't quite decide where to go. Interesting as a travelogue piece by writer/director/protagonist, but unfortunately, again, not a top 250. Just a predictable coming-of-age story from suburban New Jersey, which definitely might appeal to a certain age/demographics group."
"Riddles123","Null","1","2","25 September 2004"," Overly Praised
","I'll give Zach Braff his kibble where his kibble is due. He has created some breath taking shots (along with nabbing one from Danny Boyle's Trainspotting) in Garden State. That's all the kibble I could ever give Zach for this movie. Garden State has been compared as this generations ""The Graduate"" which it very may well be, but further pushes my point on how much I hate this generation. Garden State's plot is full of cliché's aplenty. Strange parents, prescription problems, drugs, and the ever so wonderful message that the desire of the dream doesn't matter when you fall in love. This is what made me turn around in the last 15 minutes and hump the seat, for I had nothing better to do. I knew everything that was going to happen, it was typical. Zach tried writing this movie and reached a lot of people through this film, but not me."
"rosscinema","6","1","2","14 September 2004"," Good directorial debut for Braff
","One of the wonderful things about the Independent Film movement which has grown to gigantic proportions is that is gives young artists the opportunity to make small films with the hope of furthering their career. An actor on a television series in the 1970's probably would have never been given the chance to write and direct a film and what else can you say but things have changed for the better. Story is about Andrew Largeman (Zach Braff) who's a struggling actor in Los Angeles but he receives a phone call from his father Gideon (Ian Holm) and learns that his mother has died from an accident. Andrew hasn't had much contact with his family in the last nine years and he takes plenty of medication which leaves him emotionally distant.<br/><br/>*****SPOILER ALERT*****<br/><br/>Andrew flies home to New Jersey for his mothers funeral but he leaves all of his prescription drugs at home which starts him on his road to awakening and feeling more alert. While at the funeral he recognizes one of the gravediggers as Mark (Peter Sarsgaard) who's an old friend and after talking they decide to get together and hang out. The next day Andrew meets Sam (Natalie Portman) who is funny and different and they hit it off quickly and along with Mark the three of them discover new people and places in New Jersey that help Andrew come to grips about his mother and his childhood.<br/><br/>This film marks the debut of Braff as a director and the script which he wrote also is based on his childhood in New Jersey but what really stands out in this film is the visual style that he employs. If you take a good hard look at the script it's pretty easy to see that it doesn't really have anything thought provoking to say but what it does possess is a visual flair that showcases Braff's talent as a director. Another thing that is visible is the chemistry between Braff and Portman and while their relationship seems obvious they do perform well with each other and it's nice to see Portman in a role such as this. The film is quirky in it's delivery but the overall story is fairly simple but it does possess real charm that can be attributed to it's actors and their performances and one can't help but hope that Braff continues to direct films."
"rsenor","5","1","2","6 September 2004"," Pretty good; has faults
","I agree with those who've commented that it was good, particularly for an actor/writer/director's first time out of the gate, but nothing earth-shattering. The film had some very funny and heartfelt moments. The dialog was often quick and sharp, the cinematography was great throughout the film, and for the most part it loped forward in a way that I found very endearing and easy to watch. <br/><br/>But often, I got sidetracked by the fact that the plot and characters seemed contrived, flip, and too just quirky. Take Sam. She was so pervasively off-the-wall and uber-cute she simply wasn't believable. (did anyone else get the paradox of Joseph Arthur on vinyl?) I spent the bulk of the film feeling as though I were trapped in a room with an overly-loud hyperactive 13 year-old who does require medication. Or Large, and the fact that he miraculously transformed from a marshmallow to a wise-cracker in just a few short days after 15 years on an anti-depressant, anti-convulsant, anti-psychotic cocktail strong enough to sedate a horse. And Large's confrontation with his father, who for all intents and purposes was no more present than a piece of furniture, was a bit too forced for me. <br/><br/>Additionally, other ""messages"" and their delivery,(existential, familial and otherwise), were served up in a manner that was often a little heavy handed (I'm thinking of the captain's return comment about the great abyss), and the movie seemed to volley from somber to light in a way that wasn't at all fluid. I've seen other movies do this well- Lost in Translation and Dummy, for example.<br/><br/>That all being said, I am probably being overly critical of this movie as a contrary view to all the ""best movie I've ever seen"" reviews so far. I do think it was fun, very entertaining, and no girl can complain about looking at close-ups of Zach Braff for 2 hours, center-part and all. But it has a lot of faults that detracted from this viewer's pleasure. Hopefully in time Braff will write, direct, and star in something even more impressive.<br/><br/>p.s. was anyone else bothered by what appeared to be a vast age difference between Braff and Portman, who are supposed to be contemporaries? I know in reality they not incredibly far apart in age, but more often than not, I had to push myself beyond the thought that he was a middle-aged perv with what appeared to be a high-school girl. Braff looks old for his years and Portman looks very young, and her character made her seem even younger. I know casting against a much younger actress is normal- again, Lost in Translation, for example- but here it seemed strange because they are supposed to be contemporaries."

Yeah I know some may say that it's just a movie, but this movie along with the dialogue is as realistic as they get. People need to realize that most of the time when we feel alone whether physically or mentally chances are we aren't and there are at least a handful of people feeling the exact same way.<br/><br/>When Natalie and Zach are in her room and she says ""your like totally freaked out right now and want to run out the front door"", that line is so too good/funny, everyone feels that way, or paranoid in that way, It's a perfect example of the type of insecurities that many people feel in their late teens and early 20's.<br/><br/>I simply loved this movie and I give it nothing lower then an 11/10.<br/><br/>I recommend it to those aware of life's imperfections and are comfortable enough to admit their faults."

"brbarnhart","9","1","2","18 August 2004"," Beauty in the Breakdown
","I told my friend as we were walking out of the theater that it was an A- movie. After sitting with it for a few hours I have upgraded it to an A. Many movies suffer from giving away too much in the trailers. Why do I want to see a movie when I can predict everything that is going to happen? This movie, however, suffers a bit from the opposite. There has never been a trailer that has sucked me in the way that one did. It was so visually appealing and left so much to the imagination. I imagine that any movie that fits around those beautiful scenes is going to be somewhat disappointing. However, the extremely high expectations that I had going in were met for the most part. Garden State, like great movies before it such as High Fidelity and Beautiful Girls, wrestles with accepting a flawed reality rather then searching for a non-existing fantasy. This movie took this a step further I believe. It asks it's characters to embrace reality rather then simply accepting it. I would like to quote Nat's character Sam, but having only seen the movie once, I would butcher the line. She encourages Largeman to be able to laugh at himself. The other main character Mark says that He is ""okay with being unimpressive"". We don't know if he believes himself or not, but he is only 26 and in no hurry to figure it out. This theme runs through all the character, young and old and I found it to be well done. Much of the story revolves around Largeman and Sam, with frequent appearance from Largeman's friend Mark. I have found with movies similar to this one, the characters are much more important to my enjoyment of the film then the story is. I thought Zach Braff did a great job of creating these characters and the acting was outstanding. The dynamic between Sam and Large was great. Two complex character finding their way into each other's lives. I found the character of Mark to be quite intriguing. He was likable and dis-likable at the same time. The real winner here was Natalie Portman's, Samantha. This is what we knew she was capable of when we watched Beautiful Girls, before George Lucas got ahold of her. Her character was funny and sweet and fragile and just all around beautiful. Zach Braff wrote a great character and Portman really pulled it off. This movie has a lot of great moments, but It didn't have one moment for me when I knew I would love this movie for a long time. That is what may keep this movie out of my top three. There are a lot of great moments, but just not that one for me. The movie also didn't have a slow moment for me either. Some other movies like Eternal Sunshine or Lost in Translation that I really liked had portions of the movie that dragged. I didn't get that with Garden State though. The movie moved from really funny moments to really beautiful moments with with ease. All in all, a very impressive debut from a young and talented film maker. I am a bit biased because I may be the biggest Scrubs fan out there, but I give this movie an A and look forward to more from Zach Braff and Natalie Portman in the future."

","At first when I heard about this movie, I thought to myself, ""How good can a movie be if the goofy guy from Scrubs made it AND it's about New Jersey?"" But after I saw it, I was completely dumbfounded. What an amazing production. First, the story is great as it's about an emotional and mental journey of a guy who knows he needs to move forward but can't. Second, Natalie Portman never makes a mistake when she's choosing a movie, except for Star Wars, but I'll overlook that. She was incredible in this movie. Third, the random scenes and dialogue in this movie was so off-beat and wonderful. Finally, the music in this film is incredible, from Coldplay to the Shins to Simon and Garfunkle. And Frou Frou's 'Let Go' is amazing.<br/><br/>This is by far the best movie that I've seen this summer. Forget Hollywood blockbusters. Indie films are better than anything right now. The cinematography of this movie is amazing. Zach Braff has an eye for detail and outstanding talent for drawing the audience into the movie. The script is easy to immerse yourself in and empathize with the characters. 'Garden State' keeps you laughing and contemplating at the same time. It relates to your life, if you're young, and touches the heart, if you're anyone. Natalie Portman was her sweet self and really added the zest and flavor to this movie, especially during her ""original moment"". It's nice to see her again in a great movie. We're all glad she's finally graduated from Harvard. Peter Saarsgard was terrific as a pothead slacker. The soundtrack really enhanced the effect of this movie. When you walk out of the theatre, you'll feel more infinite than before. Try it.<br/><br/>Braff really succeeded in making a movie that spoke from the heart and made people feel. Too many movies right now are just showing off and don't add value to anything, but 'Garden State' is all heart."

","Director Zack Braff co-stars in this film.  He has a sure but still developing eye for sharp scenes, both in terms of setting and dialog.  Not yet thirty, this is a guy to watch. (He's also a writer.)<br/><br/>Braff is sometime, mildly successful L.A. small screen actor Andrew Largeman.  Long estranged from his suburban New Jersey family, he flies back for his mom's funeral (a short but hilarious scene).  Before leaving for New Jersey we get a glimpse of his medicine chest which seems to have no room for a toothbrush-he's on very many meds, most apparently ordered by his psychiatrist dad, Gideon (Ian Holm).<br/><br/>""Large,"" as he's known, quickly connects with many of his old friends. Director Braff is on a potential slippery slope here.  The ""Came Home-I'm Sort of Successful-Hangin' Out with the Losers"" is a familiar theme and when the setting is New Jersey the risk of unrecoverable caricaturization is virtually inevitable (as in ""Clerks"" and ""Mallrats,"" neither of which did much for boosting out-of-state applications for local colleges).  One of Large's old friends is a truly idiotic cop.  Another two make a living digging graves, one supplementing his income by checking out coffins for valuables after the mourners depart.  At a drug and alcohol immersion party, one guy - clearly out of touch with reality - sports a t-shirt with the logo, ""I Love Newark.""  It's hard to imagine anyone hitting bottom harder than that.<br/><br/>What changes the direction of ""Garden State"" is Large's fortuitous encounter at a doctor's office with Samantha, ""Sam,"" played with real sensitivity and depth by the remarkable Natalie Portman (I previously opined on IMDb that she deserved an Oscar for her short but harrowing portrayal of a Confederate widow in ""Cold Mountain."").  Here Sam has a medical problem which doesn't really affect her developing friendship and then romance with Large but she has a different issue - an inability not to lie about matters major and minor - that gives her character a quirky and original dimension.<br/><br/>Large uses his planned short visit home to address relationship issues with his dad. Gideon loves his son but in a very controlled, unemotional way.  He wants to be a real dad and doesn't have a clue where to start at this late point. Ian Hom is excellent. <br/><br/>In the early part of the film Large projects a curiously flat affect, undoubtedly the sequela of the myriad pharmaceuticals that have unnaturally shaped his persona.  As inner awareness, and Sam's company, leads him to question his reliance on meds. He abandons them, a courageous act, and from his subterranean psyche a repressed and almost joyful guy begins a slow and imperfect emergence.<br/><br/>""Garden State"" shows a less than attractive part of N.J. On my side of the Hudson there are more New Jersey than blond jokes.  What makes this story rise above well-worn satire about immature adolescents transforming themselves into immature young adults is Large's and Sam's relationship. Sam and Large are great together.<br/><br/>The ending is both convincing and heartwarming (I know that sounds sappy but that's exactly how I felt).<br/><br/>Seated three seats from me was a very pretty young woman with a t-shirt proclaiming ""New Jersey-Only the Strong Survive.""  In ""Garden State"" Sam and Large are strong enough to handle their past and face their future.<br/><br/>8/10"

I believed her performance and the performances of every other actor in this picture as Braff weaved the world of suburban NJ into a unique microcosm of anytown USA.<br/><br/>It is obvious that Braff used his childhood, personal experience and the NJ tales he heard growing up to write a script that's almost as offbeat and entertaining as the people in it.<br/><br/>SEE THIS FILM!!"

","There must be a handbook for clichéd, ""different"" Hollywood movies. This has to follow every instruction in that book. Others have eloquently pointed out the most annoying parts - I will just try to add a few: Don't misuse Nick Drake's music for your generic, inane, contrived schmaltz movie. I hope Gabrielle Drake or anybody will stop allowing Nick's music to be used for every other movie that wants to BUY some credibility with that sadly deceased man's music.<br/><br/>So the protagonist's mother was paralyzed and it was his fault and now she's dead ... is that some kind of South Park ironic, disgusting, joking tear-jerker idea, or what? Poor Ms. Portman's eyes fill with tears. That woman is desperate to prove to the World what a fantastic, intelligent, multi-lingual, genius actor she is. In fact she's in line with other clones like Christina Ricci, Miss Scarlett Piggy etc. Generation X ? Generation Bland ! Side Note: If you're ever in need for a laugh read their ""Personal Quotes"" in the Biography section of IMDb. Sure fire remedy for depressions of any kind. Where are the days when (real) Hollywoods goddesses were actually good looking, not related to someone in the entertainment business and would act rather than illuminate the World with their nonexistent intelligence?<br/><br/>Back to the movie: Yes yes, the guy turning around at the end of the movie after guy and girl have said goodbye and that happy end. Was this the low point or the drowned paralyzed Mother? Is this movie an in-joke or is it to be taken serious? Hard to tell.<br/><br/>Anyway here is the bottom line: Zach Braff took his ""Scrubs"" fame and was seemingly let loose. To fail. And now I like ""Scrubs"" less than before. Thank you very much. This film has just the annoying schmaltz that plagues and ruins ""Scrubs"" for no good reason at all.<br/><br/>Another side-note: Anyone notice the terror-stricken, panicky eyes of supporting actors in movies? How happy they are that their existence is justified by appearing in a movie? Sad and pathetic are words that come to mind."

","GARDEN STATE (2004) **** Zach Braff, Natalie Portman, Peter Sarsgaard, Ian Holm, Jean Smart, Ron Leibman, Ann Dowd, Ato Essandoh, Method Man, Denis O' Hare, Debbon Ayer, Alex Burns, Michael Weston, Armando Riesco, Jim Parsons. Actor Zach Braff makes an audacious debut as a filmmaker in this funny, poignant portrayal of a young actor named Andrew Largeman (Braff) whose return from L.A. to New Jersey for a family funeral winds up as a few days of self-discovery thru the haze of his lifelong dependency on anti-depressives administered by his estranged psychiatrist father (Holm) and falling in love with the quirky, epileptic chronic liar Sam (Portman, light years away from Princess Amidala, in arguably her best role to date) while re-connecting with stoner buddy Mark (Sarsgaard, low-key sublimely perfect), a larcenous gravedigger. Witty, heartfelt mix of angst, anomie and  finally  acceptance  of the joys of life amidst death and depression. Has the feel of a novella and echoes of Linklater, Crowe and Nichols (i.e. 'The Graduate') yet its originality is in its comic dryness and self-depreciative protagonist (Braff, who resembles a pastiche of Ray Romano, Jerry Seinfeld and Garry Shandling, manages to balance the melancholia with barely restrained misplaced anger beautifully) that also dares to reflect authors such as Salinger and Cheever. Braff has a clever eye with camera angles (thanks to the skillful Lawrence Sher) underscoring moments of subtle nuance in capturing absurdity and beauty all at the same time and lets his co-stars shine with moments of both (Portman's scene at her backyard pet cemetery will leave you with a lump in your throat and Braff's embrace with her mom, a tear in your eye). Filmed in Braff's home state  a true metaphor (i.e. the out-of-nowhere abyss sequence)  with familiar touches (the folding chair wedged in the front of Mark's house) and sprinkled with wonderful music (including the ethereal 'Let Go' by Frou Frou (featured in the trailer and my pick for Trailer of '04); exquisite and my vote (so far) for the best film of the year."

","Garden State is a dark comedy starring, written and directed by the guy from Scrubs, Zach Braff. It also stars Natalie Portman, she's a chatty, lying epileptic and he's depressed. He comes home back to New Jersey for his mother's funeral and to repair his relationship with his father then ends up meeting her. Basically they hang out the rest of the movie, get in a few disagreements and then it ends happily ever after in the typical Rom-Com formula fashion.<br/><br/>My favorite parts are when Zach Braff's aunt sings ""3 times a lady"" at his mother's funeral and when the seeing eye dog humps his leg at the doctor's office. Another great part is Sheldon from Big Bang Theory has a small role and speaks Klingon which would serve him well for his future role. It's a decent movie but nothing too exciting."
"alombardy","5","1","3","16 October 2014"," Doesn't Scrub Up
","I had looked forward to seeing this film for a while, but come away disappointed that I didn't get more out of what looked like a promising, thoughtful movie. It's not as bad as some of the more disparaging reviews would have you believe, but it's nowhere near as clever as it thinks it's being. <br/><br/>Quite a few of the positive reviews on here describe it as 'subtle', which to me is a complete misnomer - 'underwhelming' is a more apt description, i.e. nothing much happens plot-wise and the dialogue is pretty stilted. There really isn't any subtlety in the symbolism within the film, and the message is drilled in way too much, with some particularly cringe-inducing, knowing-wink-worthy dialogue ''Have fun exploring the abyss'' ''You too'' was particularly garish and predictable .<br/><br/>I found this fairly patronising approach to the viewer was also reflected in Braff's creation of the love interest who, though played well by the as-ever on form Natalie Portman, seems to be little more than a mildly disturbing Holden Caulfield-esque 'innocent' fantasy girl. So it largely fails on the 'serious' elements, and it really isn't funny enough to make up for it either. There are a few good moments, but, perhaps unsurprisingly, a more depressed version of JD doesn't generate that many laughs.<br/><br/>The considerable acting talent in this film does warrant it some praise at least, but even the likes of Ian Holm, and the aforementioned Portman, couldn't fully save this for me. Not dreadful by any means, but ultimately Braff's writing struggles to deal with fairly heavy themes succinctly enough or with much originality. 5"

","I completely get what the message was trying to convey in this film, but what I didn't get is why Zach Braff had to drag it all out in a series of lifeless dialogue, boring depressing music, and un-original sequences. I decided to sit through this complete waste of time because of all the raving reviews about how relatable and feel-good this movie was, but in fact it was depressing the whole entire way through. If on the off-chance I am watching a romantic comedy, I want it to be upbeat and happy, not bogged down in the serious problems of real life. I absolutely love Natalie Portman, and Zach Braff is funny, but I feel this Romantic Dramady was lacking in a lot of areas, then again this is only my point of view."

","Every once in awhile the critics will get behind a truly mundane and insipid film; Garden State would be your pitch-perfect example. Many of us have long-awaited the death of this tired trend of making movies about boring, middle-class 20-somethings, doing nothing while using the same lame jokes and interacting with their merry band of local buddies. Fortunately, there is a top rate cast who turns in excellent performances, and some very pretty set pieces. However, Braff uses every film-school trick in the bag and almost every comic cliché imaginable (yes, we know, a dog humping your leg can be absolutely hilarious), in order to elevate the film to a watchable level. Not even the first-rate soundtrack is able to accomplish this. One of the reasons a film like The Graduate (which this film steals heavily from), made the impact it did was because it was making a statement on generational differences and the boredom that can come with an upper-class lifestyle and the suffocating expectations that can come with it. Garden State doesn't seem to aspire to deal with issues anywhere near this big, but simply seems content to divert your attention with pop tunes and hangdog looks from its characters until it can get to its protagonist's final monologue, which is clearly the strongest point of the film."

","This movie about Andrew Largemen, a depressed young man in his early 20s who returns to his hometown after nine years for the funeral of his mother, has all the feeling of being written by someone who just graduated from film school. Someone who has seen a lot of movies, but has not experienced much of life.<br/><br/>It tries hard to be quirky but winds up being pretentious and irritating. One of the first scenes shows our confused and depressed young hero in bed in a totally white room with no furniture but the bed and a telephone. Maybe this is supposed to symbolize the sterility of his shut down emotional state? Anyway, Andy is so affectless for the first third of the movie that his mood rubbed off on me. I wanted this thing to move on rather than dwell on these self-absorbed slackers. <br/><br/>Things did pick up a bit when Sam (Natalie Portman) appeared on the scene, but she was not able to rise above the script. Consider this exchange:<br/><br/>Andrew: This hurts so much.<br/><br/>Sam: Yeah, I know. But that is life. Nothing else, that's life you know. It's real, sometimes it f**king hurts. Yeah, it's all we have.<br/><br/>It's embarrassing.<br/><br/>When one of the characters asks if Andy has ever read ""Brave New World,"" and tries to remember the author, he first tries ""Aldous something,"" then is finally convinced that it's ""Aldous Huxtible."" That's not a conversation anyone is ever likely to have had, except perhaps on a TV sitcom.<br/><br/>Then there is the climatic scene where Andy has a heart-to-heart with his dad. Love has brought Andy to life and made a man out of him, except that that scene is totally unconvincing.<br/><br/>There are some humorous scenes and the filming is professional, but I think the overriding philosophy was to trot out some attractive young people, introduce a love theme, throw in some odd behavior, play some guitar music in the background, and call it an art film.<br/><br/>How Ian Holm ever got involved in this is a mystery."

","Garden State stars Zach Braff (widely known as the guy from Scrubs) as Andrew Largeman, a guy who has been on tranquilisers for most his life and as a result is almost unable to feel emotions. The film chronicles a week where he returns to his hometown after the death of his mother. Garden State begins with some stylish direction, Coldplay background music and a curious dead pan performance from Braff that draws you into the movie. However it is all down hill from here. Garden State is a quirky art house indie style movie that refrains from being totally off the wall. However, whilst word of mouth was positive on the film I think that people must have been confused or smoking the drugs depicted in the movie. The pace of the film is not only slow but at times excruciating, (I wished that somebody would kill me when they visited the caravan at the bottomless gorge). I found myself reaching for the forward button on a number of occasions but held out in order to deliver an informed and impartial review for the readers of this script. Quirky is fine but should not be at the cost of entertainment. Garden State touches on a number of serious issues including family relationships, tragedy, growing up and regret but delivers this within the confines of an art house quirky structure. This genre by definition is often very hit and miss but I would confidently say that Garden State falls into the miss category. There are a number of insightful threads to Garden State that deal with many serious issues in a non conventional way but this is overshadowed by the sheer fact that the movie is slow, boring and often annoying in places. Probably best to spend your time doing something else."

A kind soul emailed me and said if I love Wes Anderson movies (i do.) that I would be sure to love, _Garden State_.<br/><br/>Being that I enjoy watching movies with my sons, we go to the video store often and usually pick movies based upon consensus. Each time we'd go browsing through movies, I'd say, ""Let's rent this!"", with this being Garden State. Younger son would always say, ""I saw part of that. It sucks."" Older son, not having seen it, would make no comment. Being a consensus situation, and being that I've been so busy with other things that going to the video store on my own hasn't happened in awhile, it was just a few days ago that I finally said enough is enough I'm going to make a trip alone to the video store and rent it! <br/><br/>I'm soooooo happy I took the emailer's advice, albeit several months later. The emailer was correct: if you love Wes Anderson movies, you WILL love this movie as well. What freaks me out is that I did my IMDb.com research on the movie after watching it and discovered that Zach Braff wrote the screenplay, directed, and stars in the movie. This totally blows me away. The guy is a genius.<br/><br/>Garden State is laugh out loud funny again and again. It's the kind of laughter that spontaneously bursts out of you with childlike abandon. There's something cathartic about it.<br/><br/>The film is not only funny but it is also heartachingly poignant. Family connections -- or lack of -- drive the plot. There is a realness to the small town atmosphere that anyone who lives in a small town can relate to. Anyone who has seen Breaking Away will have an idea of the type of atmosphere I'm talking about.<br/><br/>There is a brilliance to this movie, the characters, and the plot that only comes about through sheer genius and an uncanny ability to manifest that genius into a form that others can experience. For that I thank Zach and his crew for what they have manifested for viewers to enjoy. I look forward to Zach's future as a writer, director, actor, and as a human being."

","I've seen this movie a few times (in theaters, alone, with friends) and I can't escape the fact that, while Zack Braff's directorial debut isn't perfect, it offers a fairly perfect viewing experience for a certain kind of person. Witty, moving, urbane and clearly conceived as a labor of love, this film reminds me of nothing so much as Mike Nichols' 1967 ""The Graduate"", which also offered a protagonist floundering around in adult life against the backdrop of a great soundtrack. People of a certain age or disposition (those in their early-to-mid twenties with a degree or two under their belt with no career in sight, or perhaps those who adore Natalie Portman's indie-girl charm) will probably find that this film resonates deeply, while others may reject it as too odd or exacting in its portrayal of post-adolescent malaise. But for those of you who will love it, ""Garden State"" makes you believe that someone else does Get It. And any film that makes you feel less alone in the world deserves all the praise and recognition it can get."
"Mart10","9","1","3","9 December 2005"," Really worth to watch
","I watched this film by accident. I don't use to watch film without recommendation but I did it with this movie.... and I was Lucky! <br/><br/>At the beginning I was confused because it was rated as a comedy and I didn't laugh at all. It looked like a strange movie for me.<br/><br/>But as the films goes, you realize that it can be a true story about the youth of today.<br/><br/>One of the best points is the love affair of the main characters. You don't know when or where love is coming and how the person is going to be. They both are not common people but they love each other as they are. Actors did a great job on it!! <br/><br/>To sum up, if you like sensitive-independent films rather than commercial-action movies.. you will enjoy every minute :-)"
"gjdeel","10","1","3","8 December 2005"," One of the Best Movies Made
","Garden State shocked me. When I first read about I was not impressed with it's description or plot line. All of this changed though when one of my friends made me watch it. It honestly is my favorite movie and one of the best written and directed films ever. Anyone who disagrees with this obviously likes films without any meaning to them. Zach Braff takes us through all the emotions we feel through out our lives and allows to look ourselves in this movie. It makes you examine the people you've met and the things you've experienced and how your life has been shaped. If you're in your early 20's you WILL relate with this movie. Zach Braff has proved himself to be an amazing actor, writer and director in this film masterpiece."

","This was an awesome movie. I always like Zach Braff's work on Scrubs he did a great job as a newcomer into the medical field and he did a wonderful job directing a couple of the episodes. Now he jumps head first into movies making his Directorial and Writing Debut and I believe he couldn't have done a better job. I am a really big fan of sophisticated comedies and Garden State just made me smile. It had a perfect balance of true life drama and witty comedy. The characters were wonderfully written. I truly felt for them all. I loved the soundtrack as well, the Shins are Awesome! Zach Braff and Natalie Portman did great jobs making me fell what they felt.

"robin8tor","5","1","3","28 May 2005"," Contrived
","I wanted to like this movie. I love Zack Braff from ""Scrubs."" But I just don't think it lived up to the hype. I think he's a great actor, I think he's a fine director-- the film was paced pretty well, it had a nice atmosphere and a distinct visual style, he got some good performances out of his actors (at least, the ones who had something to work with). By golly, Portman, who's been complete cardboard in everything since ""Beautiful Girls,"" was actually *charming*. But I thought the writing was clumsy. He strives so hard for whimsy, that he belies believability and emotional depth. I understand what he was trying to portray and I think most of us in our twenties and beyond can relate to clinging to memories of our pre-adulthood and returning home to find old friends stuck in a rut-- but I just didn't see it. I didn't see the relationship between him and his old friends and his attachment to his home, I wasn't convinced that Portman's character ""changed his life"" in 3 days. His father's character was practically non-existent. He is obviously attempting to emulate subversive gems like ""The Graduate"" and ""Harold and Maude"" but-- where these films were droll with the point that life sometimes is that way-- Braff seems to make the mistake of being quirky for the sake of making the film quirky. Examples-- a friend who is independently wealthy from his patent on ""silent Velcro,"" a love interest who lives in a house with a giant hamster run and was formerly a skating crocodile, a revelation about his feelings towards his mother's funeral over a graveyard for hamsters, a pursuit that ends in a boat next to an abyss-- how much of this sort of stuff really rings true for most people? And the dialogue, oy: characters are constantly breaking into speeches that sound like they were ripped off the pages of someone's WeBlog (Braff's, I would wager). When I say contrived, I mean that the impression that I get was that, in writing this script, Braff thought to himself, ""I want to make a quirky, subversive film in the style of 'The Graduate' about a young man who returns to his home and undergoes a groundbreaking personal change,"" and, rather than allowing these elements to come through by creating convincing characters and character interactions, he tries to directly manipulate it with preciously quirky details and a hipster soundtrack. In brief, I think Braff is well-suited for directing but he may be better off using other people's screenplays for the while."
"SteveHevetS","5","1","3","28 May 2005"," Thoroughly uninspiring
","I find that good films -- the really good ones -- linger with me like a stirring dream. Subtle emotive undertones, flashes of scenes, thoughts about the characters -- they remain hours after watching. The best films affect a person, in the literal sense -- changing the viewer in some way, even if subtly.<br/><br/>This film affected me very little. Yes, there was some lovely scenery. Yes, the main parts were well acted. There were some good things about it, and I would expect that some viewers were affected by the moods created. For me, though, it was all way too thin. Some of the contextual elements of the film were, as far as I could make out, irrelevant to the central storyline and I had to question whether the writers had a clear and coherent sense of their characters, what shaped them, what made them tick.<br/><br/>If I contrast this film with Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind ... well Garden State pales in comparison. I liked the main characters in Garden State, and it certainly had some promising features. Problem is, the fundamental premises of the film have been used many a time, and in light of this, all elements of the film needed to be strong in order for the makers to accomplish an engaging and complete work.<br/><br/>Garden State just didn't do it for me. Thoroughly uninspiring."
"jjparker777","9","1","3","9 May 2005"," Oh dear filme, worthy of a place upon my shelf!
","Garden State. What can I say? I LOVED it. It's definitely getting purchased. I saw one episode of Scrubs and I thought Zach Braff had a lot of talent and potential. (Don't ask me how I know these things, I just do. I should be in casting, I have an weird intuition about actor/tress talent.) This has been my favorite Natalie Portman performance since the Professional. To be honest, I don't like her as Amidala/Padme in the Star Wars movies. Incongruous is the word, I believe. The movie is just amazing; always startling, always endearing and funny. It's warm and tragic, fun and real all at once. My favorite line: Have fun exploring the infinite abyss. It's such a traditional Hero/Fool journey. The protagonist, through trials and tribulations arrives at the Guardian of the Infinite Abyss. He's given permission from the Guardian to explore and learns an important TRUTH which he takes back with him, to the 'real world' and he is transformed. What else can I say? It was amazing. See it. I give it 100 Gazillion Widgets!"

","I wanted to like this movie. I enjoy Zach Braff's work on ""Scrubs"" and I had heard good things about his directorial debut. Unfortunately, I don't like this movie. I feel it was over-directed, the director's technique squeezing out opportunities for emotional truth to develop.<br/><br/>Braff plays a 20-something who returns to his home in New Jersey to attend his mother's funeral. While he is there he encounters old and new friends and gets a chance to figure out what's wrong in his life. Braff is OK in the lead role. He plays it very flat. Too flat, in my opinion. I understand his character's situation, but never really get inside his head or work up much enthusiasm to appreciate what he is going through. Natalie Portman does a good job with her performance, it's her character I can't stand. Maybe I've seen too many ""Quirky Cute girl Who Is Hiding Her Pain""-type roles (in other movies and on TV) to appreciate this one. Her role is vastly overwritten. It's almost like Braff was worried the audience would stop liking her if she stopped showing how unique she is. I have absolutely no empathy for any of the other characters. I just could not see past their prominently displayed idiosyncrasies to care about them.<br/><br/>The movie starts off with a affectively moody atmosphere, a very good setting for a story of 21st century alienation. Unfortunately Braff does not sustain the airless, melancholic tone he establishes at the beginning. By the time the third act comes around the whole thing felt as processed as a can of sardines, or a standard sitcom. Despite the flaws, Braff does show promise as a film maker. I hope his next project has a lighter touch, and that he gets out of his characters way as far as letting them be characters and not an exhibit of peculiarities."

Besides if you are a fan of Natalie Portman go to see ""Closer"".<br/><br/>In the movie Zach Braff is Andrew Lagerman and behaves as if drugged. In fact he was traumatized at childhood and is feeling guilty for the events that took place in his past and so he is taking psychopharma. <br/><br/>Soon in the movie he gets involved with Sam (Natalie Portman) and she asks him straight to the face if he is retarded. He decides to stop his medication, and slowly his mind seems to get clearer.<br/><br/>The movie is slow and nothing interesting is happening and as in a garden you never know what will grow next.<br/><br/>Summarizing the film is a bunch of young grownup kids that don't really know what to do in their lives."

The thing I loved most about this whole film, was the music was totally intuned to every scene, and I loved it from beginning to end (although it was hollywoody and unrealistic.) The title to is very trippy, because Garden State what Jersey's called, but it's also a state of regrowth, and thats what this movie is about, rebirth and growth.

Zach Braff is a great actor. And Natalie Portman is always a delight to watch. I feel that a lot of people will identify with at least one character in the movie if not a bunch of them. It is a story that tugs very deeply at the emotional strings that are attached to ones feelings of what a family and a home are and should be. I think it teaches us a few things that everyone should know inherently. Mostly that life is what it is and we shouldn't try to hard to make it something we cant.

The film was good on all levels. Zach Braff played a great role and also directing and writing the film were done excellent by him. The script writing was perfect and the dialouge was sharp. He was practically the whole movie along with the great soundtrack and Natalie Portman's good performance.

"destroyedcelluloid","7","1","3","9 February 2005"," Predictable and slushy ending lets down otherwise great film
","I'm a big fan of low budget independent film-making. Not because I consider myself art-house or above the commercial whore that is mainstream cinema, but because I appreciate characters over action and special effects. Character development in said films is often much more satisfying and unpredictable and the indies tend to take more risks with storyline than any Hollywood tripe. Though I could name better character/story-based little/no action offerings (Elephant, Gummo, Bottle Rocket, it's just about on a par with Lost In Translation) Garden State is still an excellent example.<br/><br/>**spoilers** It's about a guy, who returns home for his mother's funeral, it about his relationship with his father, which he needs to reconcile, his odd relationship with his old pals and his new relationship with Natalie Portman. It also contains a very interesting family secret.<br/><br/>Lets get one thing off my chest first of all though; the ending. Why? The last ten minutes are so predictable and gooey-eyed I almost couldn't look. It's not that it was a happy ending that bothered me, it's the fact they sat in the airport crying, with him saying he was leaving, he gets on the plane, then he comes back. It was just too obvious and Hollywood-esquire. It also seemed tacked on at the end, I guess he couldn't think of anything better.<br/><br/>Now that's done with. This was a good film, it was funny and interesting, it had some cool characters and some wonderful scenarios (like in the hotel, and the canyon). It was pretty clear this was a debut attempt, but that hasn't affected the quality, it just seemed like a first attempt somehow. Of course the pacing was intended to be slow but at points it almost became lazy, like his first night back and he's at the party and everyone's taking drugs, it just seems to go on a bit longer than it needed to.<br/><br/>Bad points behind I really enjoyed this film and will certainly be adding it to my collection. It's just the type of film I adore, the kind where you could argue not much actually happens, but for the characters involved it could be a life changing experience. Little stories about little people. Character development, God I love it!"

I would yell at him to please stop talking or he would ruin it for me before I could see it. I said it would turn out just like Donnie Darko. I had longed to see that movie but so many people told me so much about it I now refuse. he just would not stop talking even when i would interrupt him with a smack on the head and a loud, ""SHUT UP!"" so after a few days of that I knew I had to rent it before he killed it for me. Zach Braff was wonderful as an emotional disconnected member of society. This movie brought tears to my eyes at the end, made me long for a boy, did all the things I love in a movie. The sound track to me was wonderful. I am in love with The Shins and Frou Frou and I thought their songs worked really well in this movie. I was told I am the girl in it, loud never stops talking and lies all the time. A great movie. No it was not perfect. no it was not the best. But I recommend it. highly."
"ljsavy","7","1","3","1 February 2005"," Overrated
","Was it really that great? I rented this movie with high expectations based on previously published reviews. Perhaps because I am not a 30-year-old male, Largeman's single expression of wide-eyed amazement did not resonate with me.<br/><br/>A little homework on the writer's part would have turned up the fact that Largeman would have had a severe mental MELTDOWN if he stopped taking his cocktail of mood stabilizers cold turkey. And to take recreational drugs on top of that? I don't buy it.<br/><br/>It was also difficult to sympathize with someone who severed contact with his paralyzed mother for no apparent reason. Laregeman's issue seemed to be attached to his father. Visiting one's paralyzed mother while avoiding contact with one's estranged father does present some interesting logistics, but is hardly an excuse."

Never got past the first 40 minutes. It was that boring.<br/><br/>The beginning had some potential. I got that the guy (Zach) was bored with his life, came back home after 9 years and is just at a loss, but by the time Natalie Portman enters the picture with her complete zanyness, I couldn't fathom why Zach would continue to hang out with a nutcase, screwball like her.<br/><br/>It just didn't hold me interest at all and I had to return the movie shaking my head.<br/><br/>Oh well."

Wasn't XXX supposed to do that? Actually if this movie applied to any age group, it would be late 20s, maybe early 30s. <br/><br/>The dialogue was terrible. Like fingernails against the chalkboard bad. Plus there wasn't much of a storyline.<br/><br/>It's funny, if an unknown writer tried to pitch this script, the reaction would be ""Who cares. Why would anyone want to watch some slice of life movie about your home town?""<br/><br/>But because this guy is on some TV show, and conned Portman and Holm into doing this, we have Garden State.<br/><br/>The only good thing about this is that you get to watch that little hottie Natalie Portman. But your time would be better spent watching ""Closer"", where you get to see more of Portman (and I'm talking' skin here), you get better dialogue, and a movie that is a Mike Nichols film, not one that wants to be."

The protagonist's plight is one in which his realness is consistently exhibited, and his soon-counterpart (Portman) has quirks just as people truly do. Their suffering also portrays a true side of reality, and by the end of the movie viewers will find themselves reluctant to see the film end as well as sad and truly touched by the content of this film.

","I have to admit, when I first heard about this movie, I figured it was just another girly film or a romantic comedy. Fortunately, I was mistaken, as this was a very warm, touching movie. I guess this is the directoral debut for Zack Braff, and he did a wonderful job on and off the screen. His character is actually rather reserved, considering he's playing a Hollywood actor, yet he speaks volumes by saying so little. Natalie Portman's character at first seems like a complete moron, but her character actually turns out to be fearless and full of life. There was a great chemistry between the two of them throughout the movie that I found very pleasant.<br/><br/>Not a fast paced or particularly exciting movie, as it moves at a steady pace. Simple enough plot, as a young man who's had minor success in Hollywood comes home after his mother's passing, and he has to see his father from whom he's been estranged for a decade. He runs into old friends along the way, and though you'd think an actor would want to rub his success in everyone's face, he is never showy to anyone. Then he meets Sam (Natalie Portman) and changes his perspective on things. Very subtle movie, kind of a coming of age film, it would be good on a date for sure, but an enjoyable flick for anyone that likes atmospheric movies based around strong characters. A true winner."

I can really relate to the screaming scene. It's nice to see a movie that isn't full of the typical Hollywood outline. It's different. It was a perfect mixture of love, comedy, drama, and true to life story. I also think that this is one of Natlie Portman's best movies yet.

I just loved the plot and the romance between Sam and Large. I have a lot of respect for David Kraff. I've never even heard of him before this movie, and I could barely keep my eyes off of him; he's such a talented man. He was just so mesmerizing on screen. No movie is perfect, but this movie was pretty damn close. I thought the sex part was unnecessary, and so was having method man in it. Natalie Portman did a fairly good job except for some parts in which she started to annoy me. She seemed a little young for him. I loved the beginning in which Large is laying in bed surrounded by white walls. I loved all of his expressions. The little details in the movie really stood out to me. Some parts were hilarious, like the knight part and the part where they clap and the lights turn off. The dialog was cute. I have a lot of friends who like comedy or action-packed movies, and who don't know what a good movie is if it hit them in the head. I recommend this movie to anyone who wants a funny, cute, sad, and realistic movie. You will laugh and you might even cry. All in all, I give this movie a 9.7/10 but I wouldn't say this movie is for everyone."

It wasn't until after I had slept on it, and really thought about that the lightbulb went off above my head. Upon reflection, I realized that what made this movie so great, was that it really emphasized the importance of just BEING and really feeling. I think there are a lot of people who are like Andrew, who think that because life hurts, being numb must be better, but as Andrew comes to discover, when you're numb, you can't feel ANYTHING, not just the bad things. This movie is absolutely wonderful, and if you don't get it right away...you probably will get it once you think about it. A key element is the music which captures an incredibly mellow feel that I felt on so many different levels. I think it should be required listening/viewing for all college students and twenty- somethings."

","Garden State is a sweet, sometimes somber tale of Andrew (Zach Braff), a struggling actor who returns to his childhood home in New Jersey to attend the funeral of his mother. Andrew is numb to everything, least of all his mother's death, owing in no small part to the constant stream of medication he's been on most of his life. While at home, he hooks up with some old friends, including Mark (Peter Sarsgaard), and finds a new friend, Sam (Natalie Portman).<br/><br/>Andrew's struggle to find himself, to find out where he is, where he's going, and how to deal with what may come, is at the nexus of the story; his mother's funeral is simply a gateway to strong introspection. At 26 years old, Andrew is past the point in his life where he can count on the future to solve his problems - he has to decide in the here and now how he will handle the problems he'll encounter.<br/><br/>A major catalyst in Andrew's journey is Sam, a young lady who appears to have at least as many psychological problems as Andrew does. Can Andrew depend on Sam to be his rock of sanity? Or is she more unstable and therefore unreliable? This is also a movie about relationships: Andrew's with Sam, Andrew's with Mark and other old friends, and Andrew's with his dad (Ian Holm). For each of his relationships, Andrew must decide to some degree whether he wishes to remain a reactor or to become a actor.<br/><br/>There's also unfinished business between Andrew and his father, especially regarding Andrew's mother. He has not been home since being sent to boarding school nine years prior, and understandably communication between the two has been rather strained for many years. The death of Andrew's mother serves as an impetus for them to find a way to reconcile.<br/><br/>The film has generated a lot of praise among critics, and it was nominated for a Grand Jury prize at the 2004 Sundance festival. In my opinion, the hype matches the product. Garden State is understated and powerful at the same time, a very tough trick to pull off for anyone, least of all a rookie director; Braff wrote and directed the movie as well as starred in it, and all accolades are well deserved. His Andrew is archetypal for the prodigal son, as well as for the young adult who hasn't yet grown up.<br/><br/>Sarsgaard is aces as the dreaming and scheming, hedonistic Mark. And you have to admire someone who refuses to take money - even as a loan - instead opting for somewhat-illegal means. But through and through, he's a strong friend to Andrew.<br/><br/>Portman still looks too young for grownup roles, even though she's now 23 years old. Still, despite her small stature, she ably pulls off what's really a complex role in Sam. Portman manages somehow to look adorable and serious at the same time; if one squints, one can see the sincerity behind her eyes.<br/><br/>Clever, complex, and utterly charming, Garden State is a real treat, thanks to a tight script and spot-on performances. The excellent soundtrack, produced by Braff, is icing."
"DJExcen","10","1","3","17 January 2005"," Brilliant Cinematic Masterpiece
","Zach Braff's writing and directorial debut, Garden State, is a smart piece of cinema that is as touching as it is original. His character, Andrew Largeman, is a twenty-something actor who is in a very heavy anti-psychotic and depressant haze. Sam, played by Natalie Portman, contrasts Braff's absolutely neutral character with her bubbly, but fibbing nature. Peter Scarsgaard gives an excellent performance as Mark, Largeman's friend from high school.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, the most interesting character, at least in this reviewer's opinion, was Diego the porter, played by Method Man. He is only in the movie for two scenes, but his character was very curious, and Method Man milks his lines for all they were worth, without being over-the-top. His performance was top-notch and he deserves more interesting roles than How High and Soul Plane.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie was excellent. The script brilliantly shows the desperation and hope that comes with going home again, and does so with great humor, drama and heart. The cinematography was excellent, and the visual effects and camera tricks only enhanced the awesome performances in this gem of an indie flick.<br/><br/>I give it 5 SSRIs out of 5"

I really think Zach Braff did a wonderful job with his direction in this movie. It's artsy and mysterious in film style, but you aren't overwhelmed by it. This film is great for teenagers and adults to enjoy together because it's still ""cool"" enough for the kids, and meaningful enough for the adults. I would recommend this movie to anyone. I liked it so much I went out and bought it the next day, along with the soundtrack, which is also amazing. WATCH THIS MOVIE!"

","One of the best independent films i have seen yet. The message of the movie is basically ""Home is those who love you"". Zach B. directed the movie and it turned out a lot better than i expected. He also wrote the story/ script and it was magnificent. It's not ""Disneyfied"" or sugar coated. It is what would happen if it were a real life situation and that brought a humbleness to the film that i haven't seen in a film for a while. There was no special effects or crazy plot, it was simply great on pure talent. I also like the music picked for the movie. The Shins...excellent. Natalie Portman did a wonderful job and truly brought out the character in this role. I love the story line, the acting, and the hidden messages throughout the movie.

","Put on your guard because ""Garden State"" is in the premier echelon of endearing films for the year 2004. Writer-Director Zach Braff, star of the TV hit show ""Scrubs"", shows he is no scrub when it comes to character-driven film-making. Braff also stars in the film. He plays Andrew Largeman, a middling L.A. actor who heads back to his Jersey hometown to attend his mother's funeral. In his 4 day Jersey visit, Largeman experiences a ""larger than life"" life-awakening eureka effect which will alter his life forever. He confronts issues which he had avoided in numerous years and gets into an authentic Jersey ""Garden State"" of mind. Natalie Portman co-stars as Samantha, the garrulous Jersey chic who plants the love seeds of ""Largeman's Garden"". Peter Sarsgaard plays Mark, the jocuse gravedigger who indirectly plays a grave part in Largerman's psychological discoveries. Can you ""dig"" that? To round out the top acting guards of ""Garden State"", we also have Ian Holm who plays Largeman's despondent father. All execute phenomenal performances! However, it was the ""Jersey Girl"" that really did it for me; and I am not referring to Ben Affleck's box office blunder flick. I am talking about Ms. Portman. Her performance as Samantha is Oscar-worthy. Lately, Portman has been in the ""acting zone"" with stellar works in ""Cold Mountain"", ""Closer"", and now ""Garden State"". Hopefully, she will be fighting another type of ""Star Wars"" with fellow thespians in competing for some acting awards. Nevertheless, ""Garden State"" is Zach Braff's garden of eden brainchild. His heartfelt screenplay & intuitive direction was quite impressive for a rookie filmmaker who some thought was just good enough to ""scrub"" floors! Sorry, Zach! Just joking! Do not have a ""Zach Attack""! The music of the film was quite compelling and was a key attribute in its storytelling component. For those numerous reasons just mentioned, it will be a worthwhile ride if you visit the ""Garden State"". It is one of the best films of the year! ***** Excellent"

","Garden State is the story of a young man named Andrew Largeman (Zack Braff) returning to his home state after his mother dies.

All of this changes when he meets a young woman named Sam (Natlie Portman). The movie progresses into a beautiful story about life, emotion, and love.<br/><br/>Everything about this movie was wonderfully done. Wonderful story.

","In the tradition of Harold and Maude this film is a subtle euphoria. The film is reminiscent of Mr. Deeds Goes To Town and P.T. Anderson staging and photography. The script is amazingly original wording and captures the imagination before the prerequisite of falling in love with the characters, which is really quite trusting of Mr. Braff for his audience. A winding portrayal of ""quirky/real"" characters in transformative states, with emblematic circumstances, references and symbols, this film carries it's message thoroughly and beautifully. An excellent soundtrack, (which is currently unavailable on Rhapsody), streams emotional continuance without telling the viewer what to think of a scene, and is addictive. Easily, Garden State has achieved the coveted status of being treasured for future generations and will retain the timelessness of cult black comedies and off beat coming of age, romantic films. I await the next project of Mr. Braff's with anticipation."

","My major reasons for seeing this movie were that I love Zach Braff in Scrubs, and I am a sucker for a movie with a great soundtrack. I love music, and I think Zach Braff put together an amazing compilation that really brings out the feelings Large is having throughout the film. I identified with this film because it's a ""homecoming"" film. After going off to school, or to a job, or to find your calling, etc., it's often awkward to come back home. It's always interesting what people end up doing- like Kenny the cop. I love it when Large begins to experience emotion again, and he remembers what it feels like to love and be loved. I definitely agree with the point Large makes about a home being people that love you- not necessarily a place. I think this is a movie you might want to watch more than once to get a better feel of it. I think Zach Braff did a great job in his first film."
"emp32","10","1","3","6 January 2005"," Memorable scenes, Memorable characters, Memorable movie
","I am guilty of often over-analyzing movies. I ruin them for myself and can get a little snobby about the content. Garden State is one of those rare films that allowed me to sit back and enjoy. The solid, interesting, likable characters and meaningful dialogue helped to bring down my defenses. This movie is a love story but it feels real and not goofy or cheesy like typical ""Romantic Comedies"". There are a variety of different scenes and shots that do not feel stale or repeated. I also have to comment on the wonderful use of music. I bought the soundtrack as soon as it was released. The clerk in the record store said it best ""It's not a movie soundtrack it's more like a mix CD made by a good friend."" Here is the part where I gush about how much I like Natalie Portman. She is acting but she does it so well and so naturally. You feel like the role was made for her (I think it was according to Braff). Best way to describe it is she plays the type of girl you just want to hug all the time. She can appeal to women and men, young and old. OK I'm finished. My recommendation: In some parts this movie appeals to a younger audience. That is not to say that it can't be enjoyed by anyone of any age. There is one scene of sex but it has nothing to do with Braff or Portman. It is quick and just there to be weird (You'll see what I mean). The theme does have some more serious points and issues but the overall feel of the movie is definitely warm and sweet. If you like classic romance stories and even those usual ""Romantic Comedies"" then you will like this. If you like clever lines and humorous characters then you will like this. If you just want to lose yourself and enjoy and nice story with no violence, fast cuts and snappy one liners, then you will like this. Final note: See it with a significant other or someone you would like to be your significant other. 10/10"

Zach Braff was also amazing. The soundtrack was superbly chosen. The way the film was shot was also well done. One of the things I liked best about it was that the main characters were great, but the whole story was also peppered with interesting, memorable smaller characters. Some of them were so random (such as Tim (I think that's his name) and the guy who worked at that store where Mark returned those knives). On one hand, it seems so random that they are in the movie, because they are only in there for a small blip of time, but on the other hand, you can see what they're purpose was. It was just a good movie. I could definitely follow Andrew's journey throughout the movie. The changes in him as the movie went on were noticeable, and that was nice. Not overly laugh-out-loud humorous, but very funny and amusing. It makes you smile (hard as that may seem, given the circumstances of the characters). This was an A+ effort and performance for Zach Braff.<br/><br/>Definitely a worthy movie. Definitely Oscar worthy in my opinion."

On the other hand it's only just been released and I've only seen it once so yes, I DID, find it fresh and energetic despite being a tad formulaic. This is the second movie in a year (or just over) to portray New Jersey as Mississippi-lite, sort of WHAT IF Carson McCullers had been born in Trenton, would she still have found it chock-full of dysfunctional eccentrics. Maybe we'll never know but we sure can speculate. This time around obligatory kook Natalie Portman is Geena Davis once-removed from the Accidental Tourist (Maryland, of course, is the northernmost Southern State, so there may be a Term Paper to be written on the Migration of Southern Gothic to Northern Ga Ga). Zack Graff has, no question, written and directed a very competent and sure-footed movie which involves the viewer from Frame One - at least on a first viewing - despite that same viewer's ability to second-guess both the turns in the plot and the ending - in this case it's not the arriving it's the journey. Several posters have beefed about the ending and possibly with good reason yet nevertheless there are honorable precedents; on at least two occasions (Sabrina Fair and Love In The Afternoon, both, coincidentally starring Audrey Hepburn) no less a maestro than Billy Wilder threw in a closing scene where the hero, once it came down to the wire, couldn't bear to leave the girl (okay, who COULD bear to leave Audrey Hepburn, who, indeed, in his right mind, would even CONSIDER it for a nano-second) so the writer-helmer is in excellent company. It might have been a tad more honest if it hadn't taken so long for the penny to drop but it's a minor cavil. For a first viewing 8/10."

This was a lovely Sunday afternoon with a basket full of egg salad. It's been said before, and I'll say it again: Zach Braff looks like Ray Romano. As a result, it's nearly impossible to take him seriously. To compensate, he takes himself very seriously, which seems ridiculous, especially when he's pawing his father's chest hair and making a speech about grabbing the reins of his life. I understand that it's hard for young people not to be entirely trite and mundane (Look at the world they've been left.), but there are some moving things out there.

It certainly wasn't because of New Jersey native Zack Braff. He is a main character on Scrubs, and this movie certainly validates my choice not to watch that show.<br/><br/>Garden State is in the same category as Napoleon Dynamite, another film released in 2004. Did he play in that one, too? There are a lot of people that think these quirky films are cool and that you shouldn't criticize them. Well, I actually made it all the way through Napoleon Dynamite on the second try. What a waste of time! I decided that 20 minutes was all I could give Garden State. When you bill yourself as a comedy, that is plenty of time for a laugh. It didn't happen, and I doubt if it would happen if I stayed the whole way through. I went back to basketball.<br/><br/>Maybe it was Natalie Portman that got me to try this film.

When a struggling twentysomething actor from Los Angeles returns to his hometown for his mother's funeral, he finds a vintage motorcycle out in his parents' garage (it was willed to him by his deceased uncle, but left forgotten under a tarp for no specific reason). Racing the bike up and down the street, the protagonist is immediately pulled over by a police car...driven by an old friend from high school! Braff's sensibilities all stem from a TV mentality. It turns out the actor is suffering from momentary migraines, which no doubt come from being medicated his entire young adult life. This guy is aching to FEEL something! It's quite possible the scene with the bike, or a following bit with a seeing-eye dog humping Braff's leg in the doctor's waiting room, will strike some viewers as fresh and funny, but the fake-cynicism bubbling underneath the movie's lo-fi tone is intolerable. Quirky conversations are struck up simply to reveal another layer of our hero's personality and makeup (his inner-struggle, his independence, etc.). Braff may indeed have some talent, but first he needs to acquire a sense of himself as an actor and a filmmaker, and stop channeling personalities (and situations) gleaned from the tube.

I have been looking for clues inside the reviews, anything that I may have missed but could not find anything to persuade me that this film is not the most boring, dull and pointless trash that I have seen for a long time. Zero characters, zero story development. The people in this film act just downright stupidly, most particularly the character of Sam (Natalie Portman) who confuses being weird with being interesting - her antics are just downright stupid. Largeman (Zach Braff) sleepwalks emotionless through his role, you get the feeling that he doesn't really want to be there (which is surprising, given that this is very much his own film). I suppose that this is the idea of Largeman the character but then why make a film about someone as bland as this ? This most certainly not the generation that I know and that I am part of (as some reviews appear to suggest).

","First off let me say I wasn't expecting much going in to this movie.The only reason I picked it up was because of Natile Portman (she's an amazing actress)and Zach Braff(Scrubs) I thought this movie would be a joke(oh how wrong I was).So imagine my surprise when I liked it Zach Braff's character Large is a struggling actor who goes home for his mothers funeral after nine years and sees old friends,meets the girl,and eventually falls in love with said girl.Sounds like the premise for many coming of age stories doesn't it,but the thing Zach Braff does so well with this film is make it so anyone who watches it can laugh and say""hey that's me""on at least one scene and I had a friend just like that.He also got together a great cast Natile Portman as Sam will make you fall head over heels in love with her right along with Large because of her uniqueness and admittedly sometimes down right weirdness,also in the film is the very talented Peter Sarsgard as Large's grave digging(and robbing)friend he sees again on his return. In short the movie is great movie that I definitely recommend."

","Lately it seems that movies have been lacking originality and quality. I recently saw Garden State and was simply astonished. It is a complete breath of fresh air. Zach Braff's natural talent for film-making is evident in this movie, which combines several genres of film: drama, humor, and romance. The characters are extremely likable and easy to relate to. Andrew's (Braff) battles with family drama and awaking from his numbness from emotion make him a strong character that you just have to love. Natalie Portman's role as Sam (who is lovable, cheerful, and deep-thinking)is excellent and incredibly realistic. With beautifully artistic technique and an incredible soundtrack, Garden State is a total masterpiece. Very touching and creative, I applaud Braff's ability to write, direct, and star in a remarkable film. Amazing."

","I can usually judge a movie by how long I sit and watch the credits at the end. After watching ""Garden State"", I sat and listened to the music, and thought about how great the movie was all the way til the screen turned blank. The writers and directors of this movie accomplished a rare task: They created a movie based on characters; characters who the viewer attaches themself to all the way to the end. If you like movies where real characters are developed within a real world, then go watch ""Garden State."" The movie's dialogue is witty and true, and I hope that someday its characters can sit permanently in the top 250."

","I liked this film a lot, mainly because it's one of those that are so difficult to categorise, explain, or capture in a few sentences; however it is definitely memorable for many reasons.. the slow pace shows a director mature beyond his years, the humour is refreshingly subtle, the performances are all excellent. Nothing much really happens in this film, and what does happen is understated, so that we take much more notice of each detail. These details are a mixture of film homage and glimpses of tremendous imagination, all woven into a nonchalantly meandering story. Through this rich detail the film becomes extremely curious, effortlessly funny, touching but unsentimental, and in a strange way pretty real. All good stuff."

","She plays a pathological liar with epilepsy who can ice skate. There wasn't any time to spend on her character's development, though, for all that ground work. The plot is so focused on Braff's character that she's practically wasted outside of making out (extensively), breaking up and making up with Braff's character. These love scenes seem all the more cliché in this film because so many of the other scenes are unreal by design. I missed the depth of this movie if it's there. It seems to me that these scenes were meant to look cool and the dialog written to sound cool but that meaning and continuity were secondary aims if they were goals at all."

","I don't think there are any real spoilers in here but I don't want the folks at IMDb to become angry with me so that is why you see the warning. But like I usually say: if you are really picky then move on.<br/><br/>Synopsis: ""Garden State"" at its heart, is a quirky love story. Braff's character must return to his childhood home after learning of his mother's death. This of course is a problem because it is his past that haunts him. However, Braff's character goes home nonetheless. There, he meets a very bizarre but lovable character played by Portman. They soon fall in love. Through the course of this movie Braff's character encounters many of his inner-demons and begins to deal with him. For example, Braff's character tell his father how he really feels for the first time (you know, the typical father/son cliché). Soon enough, Braff's character decides to head back home to LA, but if he does this then he will leave Portman's character behind and their love life will diminish. What does he do?! He stays of course, which makes a cute but typical ending. The acting was absolutely superb; Braff plays a complacent individual like it was second nature, and Portman breezes through a very weird role, and not only this, but she makes us love her character in the process. Braff also directed and wrote this nice little story, and I look forward to seeing more of his work. Some of the only problems with this movie was its clichés and lack of excitement at certain points. Overall I give ""Garden State"": 3 out of 5 stars.<br/><br/>NOTE: 1/5 stars = bad 2/5 stars = OK 3/5 stars = good 4/5 stars = great 5/5 stars = classic"

","GARDEN STATE (2+ outta 5 stars) I had high expectations for this movie... but, after finally seeing it, I have to admit that I was a little disappointed. It's well-done... the acting is fine and the directing and writing are decent... but over-all the movie just seems to be missing the final spark to set the whole thing aflame. Zach Braff (of TV's best sitcom, Scrubs) stars as a severely depressed actor, hooked on medication, who returns to his old hometown for his mother's funeral. He faces some childhood issues and, with the help of a funny, spunky (and underage???) girl he meets in a hospital waiting room, he gets off his pills and starts to enjoy life once again. How many movies has Natalie Portman been in now where she plays the funny, spunky (underage?) girl who is the catalyst for the renewal of an older man's appreciation of life? (Leon The Professional, Beautiful Girls, Closer... can we work Star Wars in there somehow?) Maybe the problem with the movie is just that it starts out so slow and ponderous as it sets up the bleak, depressive state of its main character? Maybe if it had started with him meeting Natalie Portman and then working backwards to explain his condition it might have been easier to sit through? Anyway, a nice try from director/writer Braff... but it just didn't work for me."

","""Garden State"" is all about a young man from Hollywood who returns home to New Jersey for his mother's funeral where he rekindles old friendships, attempts to straighten out his relationship with his father, and falls in love. A one man indie by Zack Braff, ""Garden State"" has few of the telltale indie liabilities as it develops its linear make-it-up-as-you-go story with freshness, warmth, and humor. On the upside, this film about one man's honest approach to life is a pleasing blend of quirky humor, poignant moments, and contemporary romance. On the downside, the film is skewed toward younger audiences, lacks the tinsel which the big bucks buy, and has a scene-to-scene sameness which comes from it's single-minded auteursmanship. Although one cannot expect the output of one man not even 30 years of age to result in an exceptional product, this little film received acceptable critical nods and excellent marks from the public making is a worthwhile watch for Gen-Yers and just about anyone into contemporary quirky romantic comedy fare.

","Zach Braff as Andrew Largeman wrote, directed, and starred in ""Garden State"", a reference to New Jersey where most of it takes place. In a comment he makes in the very interesting 'making of' special on the DVD, about 80% of what is in the movie comes directly from things that have really happened, although not necessarily to him and his family. The filming had a budget of $2.5Million, which is very small for a feature length movie with real film and Dolby 5.1 sound. That it has already taken in almost $30Million before DVD sales is quite an accomplishment. This is a fine story of a young man and a young woman helping each other to find themselves.<br/><br/>SPOILERS are contained in the rest of my comments. Largeman is an actor and waiter in LA, had one role playing a retarded quarterback, has been under voluntary sedation for years on prescription medicine that his psychiatrist dad (Ian Holm) has prescribed for him, when he gets a message that his mom drowned in the bath tub. After a flight to New Jersey for the funeral, and having left his medicine in LA, he begins to meet all his former friends again, the most interesting Peter Sarsgaard as Mark, the grave digger who incidentally takes the jewelry off women corpses after the burial services to supplement his income. He spends most of his spare time doing some sort of recreational drugs.<br/><br/>Seeing his dad's doctor for one-second headaches he gets occasionally, Largeman meets Sam (Natalie Portman) who, it turns out, has had some epileptic seizures and has to wear a soft helmet to avoid being dropped from her employer's health insurance. She recognizes him for his 'retarded quarterback' role. ""I can't believe you're not really retarded, you were so good."" They go places in the motorcycle with sidecar that his grandfather had left him, but she won't ride in the sidecar. Largeman and Sam find they are soul mates, each has never found someone before that they connected with. Largeman explains that he has to fly back to LA and straighten some things back, Sam cries as he heads up the escalator, then a few minutes later he comes back and finds her in a phone booth, they embrace, he has decided staying there with Sam was more important.<br/><br/>Important character observation. Largeman's mom had become paralyzed when he was 9, he had an argument, pushed mom, who tripped over the open dishwasher door which had a broken latch. That episode was what caused his dad to prescribe drugs, and later sent off to school. He remarked that the one little piece of broken plastic is what caused all the misery in his life so far. The idea that sometimes some little random thing at a particular moment can have such a big impact on our lives. In fact, his script uses the word ""random"" in a number of situations."

","30 October 2005. Unlike most viewers, I found this movie manipulative in the beginning, overly cute, the slice of life experiences disconnected, disjointed, and the actual substance of the movie light and never really joined together sufficiently, only glanced at. The movie was unusual, but the main character really didn't feel continuous in his transformation. There was never any serious attempt to focus on and take the time to really experience important points (particularly father/son) in the movie and the ending became another in a series of typical movie endings. Unlike Lost in Translation (2003) that spent time in a more connected milieu even while in a disconnected place or even Prime (2005) that spend a good amount of time on the relational issues involved, Garden State seems to take events and experiences wanting to have some impact at times, but it seems too much and too superficially handled.

Andrew should have left, and left us to figure out how it might be resolved. I feel like they caved to the money and added a sappy 'happy' ending. A good try but it's shortfalls were very noticeable.

He doesn't look forward to facing his father who has kept him under strict medication throughout most of his life due to circumstances that led to his mother being in a wheelchair.

Natalie Portman steals scenes as a convulsive liar he is attracted too whom he spends much soul searching time with. Peter Sarsgaard is well cast as one of his friends who digs graves and smokes dope. Unfortunately Ian Holm as his father is underused and his scenes lack the emotional power needed to make them work. Jean Smart plays the mother of the Sarsgaard. She is a recovering alcoholic who has faith in her son. Considering his great performance in The Sweet Hereafter this is indication that Holm is wasted. Decent independent filmmaking that works on some levels while misfiring on others but it contains an interesting theme regarding direction and one's mind set. Score: 6 ½ / 10"

"johnnyboyz","6","0","1","30 June 2013"," Middling low-level relations drama which suffices more-so blows away.
","Sad to say, Garden State is one of THOSE sorts of American independent films; the kind wherein its characters perform tap-dances for their sweethearts and will suddenly make strange, random noises with movements because they're ""unique"" and ""no one has ever done that before, nor will they ever"". This, the character deduces, is the credence behind doing such a thing – a justification born out of the fact what you've just witnessed is unique in the history of humankind and it makes them stand out in history as a result. In spite of its own erratic and eccentric nature, Garden State is far from something you have neither seen nor heard before: a sweet, although often trying film; one made with the best of intentions that doesn't work all of the time but one with a regimented character study and a proper attitude towards those with special needs.<br/><br/>The film's jarring opening, to a physical extent, in its depiction of a passenger jet full of people going nuts in the midst of what appears to be a failed on board terrorist attack put to some Arabic music does not match where the film thinks it is being equally jarring in a spiritual sense later on. Crammed into the middle of the plethora terrified people desperately trying to remedy the situation sits Andrew Largeman, played by Zach Braff. Andrew sits and does exactly that, sits and stares dead-ahead as if nothing at all were happening. When it's revealed to us that he was merely dreaming, we're aware that for such a nightmare to be accepted during its runtime suggests a seriously spaced out individual. Andrew is an actor living in Los Angeles, but he moonlights as a waiter in an oriental restaurant on account of not being in the big time. Here, he must suffer the foolhardy patrons of a place which attracts the kinds of people who believe ""ASAP"" constitutes a word and enjoy their fair share of racial slurs aimed at the place.<br/><br/>Disconnected but not yet totally out of it, Andrew is hit with the news that his mother has died back home in New Jersey, and he takes it on himself to travel back for the formalities. Once back, we are struck by how buoyed and exuberant all of his old friends are at seeing him; Andrew, by comparison, is understated and hushed – he has been desensitised by his Hollywood escapade, and it shows. One spends the briefest of moments looking for parallels between the Studio dominated American film-making West and cheaper, less fame dominated projects such as Garden State, and how the former can have the effect that it does on Andrew when all around him are more normalised and more down to Earth people merely greeting their respective friend.<br/><br/>It is during an unfortunate incident involving a dog in a doctor's surgery that introduces the one person who lives in his town who'll come to affect Andrew's stay here more than any fallout from a bereavement seemingly will. She is Natalie Portman's character named Sam, someone who's familiar with Andrew's work back in California and singles out his performances as a person with special needs the most. Things progress and we discover why it is that this may have touched her as much as it did, whereas Andrew man is quite enjoying the authenticity that comes with communicating with someone like Sam. Sam is scatty, perky and random – someone seemingly too autistic to feel the anxiety which comes with communicating with someone you recognise. Her core characteristic of lying compulsively is dwarfed only by the fact she still has a Christmas tree up in the corner of her house in spite of the fact it's far from being in season. Andrew does, of course, have the potential for partners at one of the many parties his old friend hosts, but these are fast and loose women - Sam is more ""O.C.D."" than she is ""L.S.D."" and this encourages Andrew all the more.<br/><br/>The film is, of course, a love story about someone buoyant and quirky meeting someone the polar opposite but having them fall in with one another anyway. The feminine participant in this case is the talkative, energetic one and this provides the film opportunity to have its exchanges driven by the woman who's ultimately opening up the man's world to conversation; interaction and socialisation where previously there was something more meek. Everything good about the film aside, it does fall back into the sorts of gnawing clichés often synonymous with works such as these while a lot of the behaviour of the characters away from the central pairing and in regards to the supporting acts seems inconsistent with how they'd truthfully react. When Andrew encounters what might be classified as 'grave robbing', I'd expect him to react a little more forcefully and never return to those circles again. But there is enough there to enjoy in the department of key character dynamic, a film that is light and watchable despite a subject matter veering on pretending to be more hard-line and a film that worked better than it should."
"StevePulaski","6","0","1","31 July 2012"," ""But aren't we all""
","I would love to find a woman like Natalie Portman's Sam in Garden State. Someone who is quirky, but not to the point of being difficult to take seriously. Someone with a sort of effervescent charm, but one that doesn't quickly become overcompensating. And just someone that will listen and trust me as a person. But like Zach Braff's Andrew Largeman in the film, I have a lot to go through before that can happen.<br/><br/>Andrew is a Los Angeles based actor who returns home to New Jersey after his father calls to tell him his mother has died. Andrew has been kept in a place for physic evaluation after his addiction to antidepressants nearly lead to his downfall. Upon returning home, he spends his days aimlessly wandering around the town, reacquainting with old friends, and just trying to come to terms with life and its many mysteries. But aren't we all.<br/><br/>He eventually meets Sam, an offbeat woman who claims to be a pathological liar and is just all around strange and off-putting to someone with a closed-mind. I was beginning to write off Garden State as unconvincing indie-fare until I was met with Natalie Portman's character, who breeds life into a film that was desperately seeking it up until that point in time. As always, I've found her to be one of the most charming actresses, and here, she comfortably fills her character with the eccentricities and motifs she's uniformly known for.<br/><br/>The two hit it off, and for the remainder of the film, exchange in bizarre conversations, discuss how ""screwed up"" each of their families are, and while Andrew always appears sulky and directionless, Sam seems to always be overflowing with an unidentifiable joy. This is most likely why she has been dubbed the ""manic pixie dream girl,"" a stereotype which can be applied here rather fittingly.<br/><br/>Braff's sensitive direction works in the film's favor, and he appears to be a young prodigy when it comes to directing characters and uses a variety of exciting shots to prevent monotony. However, monotony comes into play due to the screenplay's lack of ideas. I mentioned how I was pleased to see a character like Natalie Portman's Sam walk on screen, but in the end, it was not a strong enough thing for me to recommend the entire one-hundred and three minute experience. The experience is overlong, tedious, sometimes dreadfully noneventful, and all around, vaguely uninteresting. This sort of romance was documented much more powerful in (500) Days of Summer.<br/><br/>Somehow, I feel that if this film didn't immediately bandwagon the ""indie, hipster"" genre of film that is increasingly becoming so popular and took a more nonchalant, modest approach in terms of writing, this wouldn't have happened. I too feel that this is a setup that heads straight in the direction of humanity-driven mumblecore, and in the hands of the Duplass brothers, this would've become a very miraculous film. Put in the hands of a first time director, it comes off as a rather shaky first step, but you can still tell and feel that something bigger and more divine is likely to emerge.<br/><br/>I find myself placing Garden State beside the three Wes Anderson pictures I don't totally adore or recommend but feel that there is something there I am just unable to grasp. I can see some people loving the film and that is perfectly acceptable, and in that case, I encourage readers to disregard my opinion. It's truly difficult to explain why I am not recommending Garden State as a whole. It is filled with whimsy and charisma, but it never does much with either, and I can only sum it up like I summed up Wes Anderson's Rushmore; it wasn't that funny and it wasn't that interesting.<br/><br/>Starring: Zach Braff and Natalie Portman. Directed by: Zach Braff."

"Leanne_728","6","0","1","6 November 2011"," Garden State Review
","Although I didn't find the movie ""Garden State"" to be one of my favorite movies, it was indeed one of the most entertaining class sessions I've had. I'm a movie fanatic but these days it's hard to find time to watch any so it was nice killing two birds with one stone. I've heard a lot of great reviews about this movie since its debut in 2004 although I cannot say I agree. The cast definitely made for a more interesting movie. If not for the cast, I might have fallen asleep. Natalie Portman who plays Sam, a fun loving carefree spirit, is my favorite actress therefore my undivided attention to the movie was in part because she was in it. Zach Braff, Jim Parsons, and Peter Sarsgaard are other favorites of mine as well, but their characters were not as amusing as Portman's. I was not impressed with the dialogue for a found it quite predictable; a man who left New Jersey to live in New York finds himself living a meaningless life, numb to society, but returns to the smaller city for his mother's funeral (more dampening to his already depressing life) where he is able to find all he didn't think existed: love and color in life. A film critic for Rolling Stone found the movie to be ""a hilarious and heartfelt ode to twentysomething angst"" (Travers, 2004). I think the use of the word hilarious is a bit of an exaggeration, but it did have its humorous moments. This may be one of those movies you need to watch a second time to really appreciate it because with just watching it the one time and listening to all the raving reviews, I can't really comprehend the magnitude of the movie's said value. The movie was a slower pace than I'm used to. I was hoping for it to pick up, but it didn't do so until the last 10 minutes when Braff's character Large raced off his plane to chase down his love Sam. It was quite depressing for the most part. I know it's supposed to portray him as depressed and you really felt it, but it's not the kind of vibe I hope for when I watch a movie. I hope to either laugh or be at the edge of my seat. The laughs I felt were too far in between.<br/><br/>I didn't really see any parts in the movie where I can say that he reached maturity. He stopped taking his antidepressants which was a turning point for him considering he had been taking them all his life thus he felt better for it. I don't consider him mature because he stopped taking his antidepressants and shared his life story with his friends. He is for the first time able to really think about his life because he wasn't able to before because he was medicated. We really don't know what life changes he was going to make aside from choosing to be with Sam therefore I think it's fair to say we don't know if he had truly matured or not. He had words with his father, but again he wasn't on his medication hence he was able to really come out with actual feelings he felt. The movie's soundtrack was peaceful and complemented the movie wonderfully. ""From its story of the awakening of an emotionally numbed young man to its editorial use of a contemporary pop soundtrack that throws in vintage Simon and Garfunkel (''The Only Living Boy in New York''), ''Garden State'' obsessively refers to that 1967 generational landmark"" (Holden, 2004). Braff gave an independent movie feel to it which I liked. Next to Portman being in the movie, I liked the fact that it more realistic than anything else. It wasn't filled with any materialistic images or fantasy. It did not have a modernized appearance which I find to be a good thing."

For example: Zack's character Large has his first cry after telling a story about his mother and his first notion of love. Had potential, but instead of being unable to finish his story because he starts crying, which would be honest and real, Zack wrote in the soap opera inspired ""...and I knew...this is love...this is love"" and delivered it with proper soap opera cadence. There's another example immediately after where Sam similarly repeats Large's line with a similar effect. This occurs very frequently throughout the film and ruins the above tub scene. There is a lot of unnecessary dialogue as well that serves no purpose and for Natalie Portman's character (Sam) contradicts her development. An example of this comes from the bedroom scene...instead of going from talking about religion to burying the hamster, Natalie has two ""blurt out"" lines...one about not ""making out"" which makes her character suddenly seem extremely immature and naive and the other the ""Bleep, Blop, Bloop"" thing she does comes off as a desperate attempt to make her come off wacky and ""free spirited"" (I hate that phrase) when throughout the rest of the film she is timid and submissive.<br/><br/>Zack Braff's vanity comes into annoying affect a number of times, as well. He mugs the camera way too much in this film...which makes for a very uncomfortable moment for Natalie Portman in one scene. Pay close attention to Natalie Portman following the kiss on the crane/tractor...Zack goes for an awkward neck hug and then mugs for the camera in an awkward ""I'm looking off into the distance introspectively"" way, all the while Natalie's head is wrenched back and her face is straight up in the rain. He comes off very self centered in his photography throughout this film.<br/><br/>The ending is the biggest mood killer. All through the movie there is a setup for a nice dichotomy between Act 1 Large and Act 3 Large that is just wasted. After the awkward ellipsis speech (which was appropriate for the moment), Large leaves to get on a plane back to LA. But, instead of showing the antithesis of the opening dream (panic on a crashing plane as he sits stoically dazed versus normal plane scenario as he sits crying, anxious and unsure) he runs back to a hysterical Sam (keeping in mind they've only known each other for only FOUR DAYS), retracts his speech and ends the movie with the stupidest line I've heard in the longest time: ""what do we do?"" which he repeats...see above. HATE IT!!! I must preface my final gripe (there are a lot more, but there is a word limit), with the fact that I'm an academic biomedical research scientist and I teach a lecture on CNS depressants. My final gripe is that it is ridiculously obvious that Zack did absolutely no research on CNS depressants (anti-anxiety/mania and epilepsy meds) or ecstasy (MDMAs...he act like he had a few bong hits, not a tab of ecstasy). Let's hit the big long list that the neurologist rattles off. If he had been taking Lithium and only one of the downers (a benzodiazepine) it'd been appropriate, but any more than that he'd be dead from respiratory failure. A plot hole comes out of this, as well. His dad is his psychiatrist, but he hasn't been home since he was sixteen, yet he has continually been able to renew his monster list of meds without updated evaluation for at least a decade (that wouldn't happen...prescription, especially for abuse potential drugs, expire). Next, given the list of drugs and how wiped out he is at the beginning of the movie, when he quits his meds he should be going through some wicked withdrawals...in the least he'd be extremely anxious/irritable, he'd have crazy bad insomnia (so he shouldn't have been sleeping at all through the movie) and probably some muscle spasms...at the worst he'd have severe muscle spasms and seizures. And for Sam...she wouldn't have been able to drink if she was on epilepsy meds.<br/><br/>Instead of this...I recommend Last Life in the Universe, 3 Iron or Three Times for films with a similar feel, but that are better shot, directed and more honest in their writing."

","I never watched another simple, romantic comedy, drama film for a time. This film has been lying around me for a time until I knew that Natalie Portman was in it, considering as well its high rating here in IMDb, I gave it a try. Surprisingly I didn't find it boring, to be exact it was a beauty! The characters were simple and understandable in their way, and I accepted the structure of the story to be firm and brilliant. The romance and drama from the beginning was evident and implied though not explicitly portrayed yet. The comedy was indeed fun. I love the wits the characters had shown. For a few moments of having great movie marathon this simple movie had calmed my mind for a moment. The comedy gave me that. This film is truly worth time of watching and I love to watch it few more times, the laughs it gave me never failed. Natalie Portman to be true was very natural with her acting capabilities. I didn't even knew, while watching the whole film that Zach Braff was the director and the main character! This guy is talented! Cool thing he grasped the attitude of the character and was fine to go. It's tedious appearance in the first place is completely misleading, but don't think of it. Watch the movie and get hooked. Its cool and beautiful. Not only that its comedy is refreshing but I truly appreciate the beauty of the story"

","I finally decided to watch this indie because it had been compared on many points to another film I love, called THIS SPACE BETWEEN US. Both films are about how tragedy can cause a young person to withdraw and shut down emotionally, and how one comes to the point of either ""do or die"" when faced with the decision to live again or just exist.<br/><br/>Andrew Largeman (director and actor Zach Braff) is an up and coming actor in LA who is paying his dues working in a Vietnamese restaurant. He seems normal at first glance, but Andrew is often plagued with severe headaches and nightmares of himself dying in a horrific plane crash...but not really caring.<br/><br/>One day he gets a call from his father (the great Ian Holm), who also happens to be a psychiatrist. Mother has died unexpectedly, from drowning in the bathtub. As Andrew makes the trip back to his old home turf in New Jersey, attends the funeral, and is reunited with old friends (including Peter Saarsgard (sp?) he hasn't seen in a decade, we learn that he has become estranged from his father. We learn that Andrew, at age 9, had a role in the tragic accident that left his mother paralyzed from the waist down. We learn that although it is not really Andrew's fault, that a defective kitchen appliance was to blame, Andrew has been living with guilt and depression ever since, and that Andrew's father DOES blame his son. For one reason or another, Mr. Largeman has placed his son on several antidepressant and antipsychotic medications, insisting that they are for Andrew's well being.<br/><br/>While staying with his Dad, Andrew becomes acquainted with a bubbly young woman named Samantha (Natalie Portman), and their friendship soon becomes love, and Andrew makes the first real decision he has ever made for his life: to stop the medications and try to ""feel"" again, even if it's pain and guilt over the fate of his mother, and the misery in the relationship he has with his domineering father.<br/><br/>I haven't watched a whole lot of SCRUBS or much of the other films Braff has been in, but I was very impressed with his acting and directing. GARDEN STATE is another pleasant ""people"" film, a small and quiet little story. The ending seems a little surreal, as does the plane crash sequence at the start. Speculation has been made that Andrew died in that crash and that Sam was in the telephone booth crying because she had heard about the crash. The white setting of the final scene does have a dreamlike quality. <br/><br/>My own interpretation: Andrew did get off that plane and decide to stay with Sam, and that the whiteness of the final scene was symbolic of Andrew coming out of his world of depression, numbness and misery into the ""light"". It was effectively poignant.<br/><br/>The ""lightness"" at the beginning, in Andrew's room as his dad was phoning him with bad news? A sterile and phony ""light"" that his dad imposed on him with the meds.<br/><br/>It gets an A from me."

When you like movies, songs , books etc it's like your speaking to yourself. Like a part of you has separated and is speaking to you. This movie is that. It is full of charm and energy.

His journey from numbness to feeling is brilliantly acted out by Zach Braff in his directorial debut. He seems to be an immensely talented person.

"rinoa-3","7","0","1","30 January 2009"," A flawed film with a wonderful premise
","Fully written and directed by its starring actor, Zach Braff, this film tells the story of Andrew Largeman (Braff), a young man that has been on prescribed medication for emotional control ever since an incident involving his mother at the age of nine convinced his father, a psychiatrist, that a combination of drugs and, later, attending a boarding school would be best for him. After many years of detachment and now in his mid-twenties, he briefly returns to his hometown in New Jersey for his mother's funeral; during his stay, he reunites with old friends whose personal and professional lives have taken curious turns and meets Samantha, a lively, heart-on-the-sleeve girl who is everything he is not.<br/><br/>Garden State is about life and living; it portrays Andrew's journey from almost two decades of absolute drug-induced numbness to learning how to feel again: how to laugh, how to cry, how to scream, how to care. In this sense, it is a hymn to life, showing us how, whether good or bad, it is everything we've got, and how human beings must learn to accept that and make the best out of it.<br/><br/>However, despite having a wonderful base concept, this film has some flaws that ultimately make it a lot less remarkable than it promises to be in its early parts, its one major letdown being, of course, its old-fashioned, unrealistic ending: having been meds-free for only about four days, it makes no sense for Andrew's progression as a character to decidedly shackle himself to a girl whom he had known for an even shorter amount of time. For the down-to-earth viewer looking for some realistic dissection of the human mind and nature, Andrew's happy ending with Sam is not romantic: on the contrary, seeing our protagonist jump from one prison (his medication) to another (a love interest) without allowing himself the time to readjust to life on his own two feet, as well as get his newly-found feelings in order, is simply downright disappointing. This ""lovey-dovey"", naive ending feels displaced in a supposedly ""alternative"" film, and ruins whatever ""lesson"" you might have extracted from the previous 90-something minutes.<br/><br/>Unrealism, however, is not Garden State's only downside: the film is also somewhat diffuse in its essence, sometimes appearing to lose itself (and, consequently, the viewers) and forgetting what it is that it is trying to convey at a given moment; in short, you are likely to often find yourself wondering exactly what point they are attempting to make -- and, sadly, rarely getting a satisfactory answer, because thought-provoking subjects are often taken on and almost immediately put aside without any sort of closure. On a different note, it must be noted that our protagonist is not directly to blame for most of the things going wrong in his life; his circumstances have begun to mold themselves (or rather, impose themselves on him) when he was merely a child, and therefore were always somewhat beyond his control. This, in a way, excludes the need for personal, inner redemption right from the start, consequently weakening his character and/or his chance for emotional progress, an important factor to any protagonist that is further neglected in the already mentioned fluffy ending.<br/><br/>Still, many good points are undeniable; the film is well-directed and well-acted, with Natalie Portman's Sam coming off convincingly annoying in an overly cute way as desired, and the soundtrack is simply superb: Braff has managed to bring many obscure, alternative (and, may I say, awesome) artists and bands together (Zero 7, The Shins, Frou Frou, Remy Zero, the amazing Coldplay and Cary Brothers,...), and the result is awe-deserving. In fact, were it not for its seldom derailing and its truly mischosen and unoriginal ending, Garden State could be a 10/10 film: after all, it does explore the great and never overused premise of life and learning to feel it in all of its forms."
"paul2001sw-1","7","0","1","11 January 2009"," Beautiful girls
","The plot of Zach Braff's film 'Garden State' resembles that of Jonathan Demme's 'Beautiful Girls' (and in fact, I wrote this comment without remembering that Natalie Portman features in both movies); a vaguely-artistic type returns to the town he grew up in, to find himself at a time when his life seems lost. Braff's vision of New Jersey is quirky but skilfully realised, and the acting isn't bad either. However, it's also an affluent, idealised world which seems to contain no cause for the characters' existential angst; while a back story is provided, explaining this in personal terms, there never seems to be any fundamental obstacle to an inevitable happy ending. The use of every pretty-dippy folk-pop song you've ever heard, to guide our moods through the plot, maybe hints at a certain weakness in the naked story. My other criticism with this film is that everyone looks beautiful. The use of good-looking actors is standard in movies, partly because everyone likes to see a pretty girl (or guy), but also because an actor of exceptional beauty can command the viewer's attention in the same way that someone we are really in love with does (regardless of their physical beauty) - in other words, we wouldn't necessarily fall for our own loved ones on screen (or at least, not so easily). This may be an acceptable trick, but a world where everyone is good-looking loses contact with reality. The result is a sensitive, well-acted drama with some original elements that nonetheless resembles an episode of 'Hollyoaks'. It's easy viewing, but also a tale of superficial darkness lying on an essentially bright world."

","Garden State was a complete shock to me, as I have only seen Zach Braff in Scrubs, I only saw him as a comedic actor, and have never really been interested in seeing any of his films. But this one was recommended to me by a friend, so I gave it a whirl and was surprised that not only did I enjoy the film, it has become one of my all time favourites.<br/><br/>Written, directed and starring Zach Braff, the story revolves around Andrew ""Large"" Largeman, a twenty-something jersey boy living in Los Angeles who is an actor/waiter. When he was nine he accidentally crippled his mother and has been on the drug lithium ever since, causing him to feel no real emotion at all. After hearing of his mother's death he decides to go back for the funeral. Upon arriving back in Jersey he meets Sam, a pathological liar who is quirky, smart and unlike Andrew, completely open with her emotions, and the two opposites instantly have a connection.<br/><br/>Garden State doesn't follow your typical Hollywood love story (One of the reasons I love it), it has real depth, the characters are real, for instance Sam is not your day-to-day love interest, who is blonde, big chested and were's skimpy clothing. She has problems like the rest of us, dealing with seizures, and being a pathological liar. The location is also a pretty dreary place, where not a lot seems to happen, but thats what seems to give it character, it's unique.<br/><br/>Each shot is unique, all relevant to the plot, the dialogue flows beautifully, overall Braff's directing debut was a superb watch and I highly recommend you take the time see it."

Then the story follows Andrew's journey and his search for meaning. Zack Braff did great as Andrew Large,its the second time I see him in a movie,1st time was The Last Kiss, and so far he did amazingly well, don't forget he wrote, produced, and stared this movie; Natalie Portman stoles the whole thing thought. She gives so much depth to her character and delivers a terrific performance. She's probably the best actress out there right now. Peter Sarsgaard may not be an A-list but he sure has talent. The musical score is pretty spot on and Braff deserved the Grammy.Garden State is about life, its about love, its about taking action,its about the ""infinite abyss"" the characters discover which is obviously a metaphor for the unknown, the what's yet to come.Life is too short for us to sit back and wait for something better, we must start living it.As someone here said this could very well be the movie of this generation in a sense that so many people these days live in a apathetic state and unable to appreciate life. 9/10<br/><br/>Update: I just saw it again,2 days after the first viewing.

He then sees some old friends, meets some new people and faces his father. He also, of course, falls in love.<br/><br/>But it is not the story that has stayed with me, for that itself is nothing special. It is the characters.

","This debut from Braff is an absolutely fantastic and beautiful film. You very quickly get over the fact it's the goofy guy from Scrubs and you take the film very seriously. It's an interesting way to go about making a film as it doesn't really follow the standard 3 act structure, which is good because it keeps the film fresh and helps preventing it from feeling tiring after several watches. This role also let's Natalie Portman's acting talent really shine as she makes the character feel, human with every word flowing beautifully, and not making it sound scripted.<br/><br/>All in all I think you'll be very surprised on how much you'd enjoy this film and you'll want to watch it again and again."

I can relate to all of Largemann's friends at particular periods in my life and Sam reminds me of two former lovers in my life. I could write pages on this film, but I'm going to stop here...

","Garden State is one of the most thought provoking movies I have seen in a long time. The Movie had a strong plot but simple and there was a few good laughs mixed with some sad and emotional moments the movie is a mixture of comedy, drama and romance, and with clever directing, camera angles, style over substance, and honest acting from even the actors in small roles, with real life situations and stereotypes the youth of today.<br/><br/>The Movie Garden State was directed by Zach Braff and released in Australia on 25 November 2004; Zach Braff has made it. Both script, directing and main acting (Homecoming is the theme of Garden State). Andrew Largeman (Zach Braff) Left his home town of New Jersey 9 years ago and returns to attend the funeral for his mother. While having been gone, Andrew has been on lithium and other forms of anti-depressant medication all prescribed to him by his psychiatrist father Gideon (Ian Holm). Upon his homecoming Andrew has decided to take a vacation from his medication and take some time to re-connect with himself. From with old friends and finds love with a girl named Sam (Natalie Portman).<br/><br/>The acting in The movie Garden state was believable and not over done you could relate to the characters Sam (Natalie Portman), Andrew Largerman (Zach Braff) the characters played good parts and it was realistic acting, the acting made you feel as though that they weren't acting. The scenes in the movie are real life experiences with death, finding friends and finding love and the bond between relationships and the individuality of every person to themselves.<br/><br/>The sounds in the movie suited the scene as the actions and placement of areas related to the sounds being played its chosen well as it makes the story go forward, realistic sounds where used to enhance the actors movements and feelings.<br/><br/>Garden state was filmed in New Jersey, the set is a usual local town area where Andrew Largeman (Zach Braff) lived and then returned for his mother's funeral. The surroundings of the town set a natural type of movie set in real places.<br/><br/>I found the film entertaining and enjoyable to watch with the realism for the movie.

","There is no perfect 'one sure way' to capture any audience member, from young to old and male to female. Many men enjoy an action packed real thrilling start to any film, and then ladies enjoy a more love, slow and passionate movie. The creative thing about Garden State is that it starts off with an interesting 'lost' start to the movie, the film starts with the creative and interesting Andrew Largeman (Zac Braff) inside an aeroplane then all of a sudden the plane starts to malfunction and everyone is panicking except for Andrew. This part of the film portrays Andrew to be out of the ordinary and different to most people, soon enough we find out that Andrew is pumped up on drugs which force him to be very neutral and non-motivated. Andrew then awakes from this dream to the noise of his phone tuning into voice mail from his father. His father is informing Andrew that his mother had passed away and that he would like Andrew to come home for the funeral. Andrew finds himself back in his home town. He meets up with some of his old mates from school and gets invited to a party. This party is a wild drug teen party that Andrew does not look like he had ever experienced. Andrew takes some kind of drug and it sends him spinning all through the night.<br/><br/>Sam (Natalie Portman) did a terrific job in this film, she meets Andrew in a hospital, when he soon finds out that she has an compulsive lying problem. The two hit it off right from the start, her attention drawing personality keeps the viewers engaged while Andrew is just the watchmen and seeming like a very hard thinker. He watches and analysis everything without changing the emotion on his face, the sound actor also stars in the hit T.V series 'Scrubs' where he plays a linking roll to this film as a doctor.<br/><br/>Sam and Largeman create a different atmosphere when they are together, while when Largeman is alone he seems a lot more depressed and lonely. Largeman's doctor is also his controlling father which twists the film somewhat. Zac also chose the music in this film and won an award for it. ""The songs I used in this film were just picked out because they were the ones affecting my life at the time"" said Braff.<br/><br/>This film was awesome because of it's individuality towards the whole main stream 'look on life', I would recommend this film to anyone who is looking for something different to watch. I give it a 7/10, but a very well done film and very enjoyable to watch."

","Large comes home for his mother's funeral, catches up with old friends and meets a special new one. Simple stuff that is never overblown. In fact, the tone and economy of the treatment raise the film above the usual rites-of-passage finding yourself fare that, on the surface, the film resembles in many ways.<br/><br/>Garden State is funny and touching for the first two-thirds of the film. The funny moments revolve around lines, often deadpan, that have you smiling long after the film is finished. ""Silent Velcro. You lucky bastard"" may be my favourite, followed by ""I still can't believe you are not retarded."" Large accepts his old friends for what they are, be it grave robber or minted delinquent. He can't quite figure out what to do about his repressed Dad, and he is a bit mixed up when love hits him right on the back of grief. He gets there, in a slow, low-key journey of self-discovery that is fairly convincing and entertaining to go along with.<br/><br/>The films' flaws are the all-too-easy ways Large falls back in with his old mates, especially when it is revealed how abruptly and traumatically he was wrenched away from them. In the last 20 minutes the film has to tie up its romance plot line and dutifully ticks off the boxes, though it feels as if the real meat of the film has been left behind. Still, this is a movie that will resonate deeper with twentysomethings facing some of the same issues as the protagonist. For the rest of us, it is a cut-above film that will bring a smile to your face."

","Never expected this film to be so funny and touching at the same time and Zach, for his first film, truly manages to accomplish this.<br/><br/>For all of us, at some point or the other in our lives, each one is made to go back to his or her past, face the unforgettable disturbing truths and incidents that we so want to forget, reconcile and then finally and hopefully, move on.<br/><br/>For Zach's character Andrew, it is his mother's untimely death that forces him to visit home and thus, his past - all that he had left nine years ago. What happens next is what the film is essentially about. For the first few days, Andrew is literally so out of place the whole time. His expressions say it all - just asking questions - Why am I here, why is all of this happening to me? Why am I not feeling anything? Should I be feeling at all? Nobody welcomes him back with open arms - because Andrew is returning home to no-one - no family, no close high school friends, no girlfriend. Nobody. But slowly he meets his long lost friends (no close high school buddies), meets a girl Samantha(Natalie Portman) at the doctors clinic and starts hangs out with them just so that he can avoid being at home and bumping into his father. But then the past does catch up with you sooner or later and Andrew realizes this as days pass. His friend Mark and girlfriend-in-the-making Sam, through their own small but significant gestures help him tide through this. But it is Andrew who has to take charge and get his life on track for the first time in his life by letting go of the past and most importantly forcing his father to let go off the same.<br/><br/>Not an easy subject to deal with for a debut movie but Zach makes this possible with a great script. The dialogues are so well-written; witty, touching almost making you laugh aloud in one scene, making you smile in another, almost cry in others. Obviously it helps that the lead characters are very well chosen for their parts - Zach with his eye-rolling expressions, barely opening his mouth while talking and when he does its like he's in a permanent daze; Sam's character of a chronic liar but good-at-heart girl-next-door was brought alive so well by Natalie Portman; Peter Saasgard as Mark too left his ""mark"" not being outright there for Andrew but being there alright, helping him in his own little way.<br/><br/>The background score and songs are beautiful and aptly chosen. Its not often that the songs depict the characters moods well. The lyrics describe just that.<br/><br/>I really liked this film, it made me feel good - that however messy our lives can be, I guess, we can come through the mess, slowly, one step at a time."

And yet, the film comes across as moody overall. This is definitely not a movie that you could pull out of your personal collection and watch anytime. However, if you are in a lazy introspective kind of a mood, you could sink into a couch and watch the moments unfold at their leisurely pace. The acting makes the film better than it is. The actors make their characters completely believable even as they impart a bit of subtle humor to the story. Some scenes would stay in your mind for a long time while some mediocre ones fade away rapidly. A film about self-discovery has to suspend fantastic plot lines to be seen as realistic. However, by making that bargain Garden State requires the viewer to be in the right sort of mindset to appreciate it. Definitely watchable once though."

","This movie is both amazing and depressing at the same time. Zach Braff has no trouble leaving his comedy roots to write, direct, and star in this movie. I am one never to cry at a movie but this movie made me cry. Zach really showed the pain of depression and what you go thru. Natalie Portman is great as usual as his new friend Sam, who has a habit of lying but then confessing a couple minutes later. The two have great chemistry and you can honestly feel the pain they both portray in the movie. All I have to say is AMAZING, AMAZING, AMAZING!! I can see why this movie won so many awards. If you have not seen this film definitely check it out as soon as possible."

Zach Braff was great not just his words but the way you could feel his pain and his emotions through his facial expression. he also wrote a balanced and humble script. it shows all the sides to life from grief to pain to laughter it all comes full circle in just a hour and forty minutes.originally Rachel Mcadams was set to star in natalie portmans spot but personally i think it was a good thing she couldn't work on this film because portman and braff have such great on screen chemistry. Garden state is a cant miss, a little bit vile for the kids to watch but great for all ages after."

","You could call this movie a romantic comedy, I like to call it a drama with comedic quirks. This movie is 100% real, with the best soundtrack of any movie I've seen. It's not cliché, like most movies these days. The acting is phenomenal, the story line is compelling. You might think of Zach Braff as the goofball from Scrubs; but In GS he is an amazing actor. In my opinion, Zach Braff is a cinematic genius; this movie proves it. Natalie Portman shines as Sam..I didn't know how talented she was until I watched it. Like I said, this movie is so real, and it's way more than a ""romantic comedy/drama."" So get up and head over to your nearest movie store and pick this one up. By the way, I'm a tough critic on movies; there are few movies I would give 10 stars, but this would definitely be one of them."

The general tone is quiet and subtle and if you just look for comedy, give it a try, but sometimes you don't know if it is really OK to laugh. <br/><br/>I would't say the Humor is like the Humor in Scrubs, but it's similar.

It IS a funny movie.<br/><br/>Portmann and Braff are doing a great Job acting, the atmosphere is dense and the jokes feel ""real"".<br/><br/>You got to watch carefully to get the whole background of the story and you need to accept the world of the movie to really like it. The focus of the film lays on the deep, round, Characters, the witty Dialouges and especially on creating a weird/funny/believable World. And this superb done.<br/><br/>This is one of my favorite Movies. It reminds me of that you don't have a good or a bad time.

"bobsgrock","9","0","1","15 February 2008"," A touching piece of work.
","Zach Braff, the lovable Dr. Dorian from Scrubs, shows his true talents in this remarkable indie film from 2004 that is hopefully the first of many from this talented writer/director. Braff does a great job of pacing the film and balancing each scene with moments of dark humor and touching dialogue that focuses on life and the unhappy moments that make it what it is. The script is very well done, although a few scenes could have been cut in my opinion. The acting is terrific, with Natalie Portman giving the best performance as a bubbly, energetic girl who shows up in Braff's life and tries to lure him back into the human race after being distant for so long. Indeed, many scenes effectively show the loneliness and distraught that Andrew Largeman and many of us go through. Perhaps it isn't an ideal ending, but it works for me. It is touching, warm, and it gives hope, which is what we all need after going through tough times. In my opinion, Braff is a genuine talent and this film shows his vision perfectly. If he can continue to make films like this, Hollywood will be better off. Films like this say something about human emotions, situations, and ultimately, life itself. That is what films were intended to be and I hope more like Garden State come along soon."
"MovieMannia","9","0","1","3 January 2008"," 25 Reasons People Love ""Garden State""
","Perhaps the quintessential example of the new ""hipster indie flick"" genre is Zach Braff's ""Garden State."" This movie, like many others in the genre, got good but not stellar reviews. But because it ended up defining a generation of emo-angst-ridden youth, it will likely be remembered in years to come as a classic worth comparing to ""The Graduate.""<br/><br/>Zach Braff plays the male protagonist who must stop using mood-altering medication prescribed by his caring but overly controlling psychiatrist father, played by Ian Holm. His journey of self discovery is precipitated by the untimely death of his mother, which sends him back to his home state, allowing him the opportunity to meet every man's fantasy of a quirky but harmless romantic partner (Natalie Portman). This journey leads him to the discovery that it's better to be awake and facing life, while simultaneously experiencing pain and happiness.<br/><br/>Zach Braff's screenplay feels like a film school scriptIt's a random assortment of vignettes, clearly composed out of wild stories overheard at frat parties. Yet he manages to pull the disparate anecdotes together with creativity and skill. As a director, Braff also shows a knack for creating simple dioramic shots that tell jokes in their compositionBraff standing in a room wallpapered in paisley, while wearing a shirt made from the same material. <br/><br/>His other, perhaps inadvertent contribution to the pantheons of pop culture is his production of a soundtrack, taken casually off of his iPod (just the songs he was digging at the time), creating a big selling album and a new genre of music that I like to call Garden State Sountracky.<br/><br/>I recently did a viewing of the film and jotted down some observations of the film's successes, which I like to call the 25 reasons why people love ""Garden State"":<br/><br/>1. It starts with the protagonist going down in a plane, but he's so drugged up he turns on the air. Flash to real life, in a sterile room and bed. Great beginning. Very ""The Graduate."" 2. There's all these weird scenes like the gas nozzle and the paisley room and the faucets that keep turning on that seem unearthly, but they fit into the logic of the story. 3. There's something funny about the way that he treats the serious. 4. People say harsh things in subtle and normal way. 5. The soundtrack is one of the best soundtracks ever. 6. It almost has an odyssey sort of feel, like they're on a quest for philosophical truth, but don't know where the journey is going to take them. 7. It captures what it's like to grow up and what we hope growing up is like. 8. It's a cavalcade of eccentric characters. 9. It deals with the self-medication of America, a theme that so many people can relate to. 10. Surreal little jokes like ""Balls"" 11. The whole knight sequence really resonates on the American dream of adventure and achievement, marketed as fast food. 12. The whole meet-cute scene is so well written in that does what a meet-cute should do without being too cheesy. 13. It's filled with cuteness like Natalie Portman's laugh. 14. Portman's character is flawed as a compulsive liar but perfectly sweet and good, harmless, and safe in a magically endearing waymaking her the perfect girl that every guy and girl is going to fall in love with. 15. Interesting use of music with ""The Shins,"" the way it casually introduces a great band that no one knew about at the time. There's something cool about being introduced to an unknown band. 16. Little visual jokes like the doctor's certificate on the sealing. 17. Portman's family does a great job of creating that crazy, cluttered, hectic, irreverent, yet perfectly homey family that everyone wishes they had. 18. The dialog moves in a random but natural way so it feels very real, but also heightened because the dialog is so interesting and insightful and strong. 19. The whole movie manages to be both ""emo"" to the kids that are emo because of the strong and real emotions involved, and not emo in the way that it doesn't seem to be over the top by earning it's laughs and tears. 20. It spends plenty of time on the characters talking so we really get a strong sense of who they are and why they are. 21. Braff chooses great little shots where nothing needs to be said, and the idea has been communicated visually, like when everyone is staring at him in the pool. 22. They do a really great job revealing the deep dark sad stories of their lives, without it feeling like these people are constantly talking about deep and personal things. 23. It creates new iconic images-the three main characters on the motorcycle. 24. We really take it seriously with someone like Ian Holm in a strong supporting role. It gives the film credibility to movie critics and buffs. His character is well written and extremely well played. 25. It has an ending that is traditional in that it's optimistic and romantic, while also being understated and not too gooeyaccentuated by the perfect music."
"CarsonTrent","9","0","1","21 December 2007"," Had at least one moment
","Plot keywords: dysfunctional family, coming home...well, that's about enough to get my attention when it comes to a movie. Beside the obvious reason for enjoying this let's call it genre, I have noticed that this is one of the very few subjects where almost no compromise is being made on the art, because it doesn't pay, commercially. <br/><br/>I read some of the comments on this one, and, although I enjoyed it a lot, I have to say it's not quite all that. First, every generation identifies with some rebellious statement in art, although further in life one might notice that the substance of rebellion is pretty much the same regardless of generation, and second, this one, aside a brilliant moment of ""pure originality"", is not all that original as a whole. The movie relies on atmosphere, thus the title, but somehow avoids going any deeper.<br/><br/>On the upside, there is an enough subtle positive message to have made me smile on occasion. Braf proves much more versatile behind camera than in front. Ian Holm. And Natalie Portman.<br/><br/>For whom enjoyed this one, I recommend two titles which I believe have a bit more substance: ""Home for the Holidays"", with Holly Hunter, and ""Beautiful Girls"", with Timothy Hutton and coincidently Natalie Portman, which have been made more than a decade ago, but haven't lost their universal validity."
"Eaglegrafix","6","0","1","8 December 2007"," Almost Great but Only Good because of a deleted scene.
","I wanted so much to just love this film. I wanted to give it a 9 or even 10 but I can't. After watching it the first time on a DVD I liked so much about every character except good old ""Dad"". By now you know what the story line is and how the plot develops so I'll dispense and get right to what makes this a ""should see"" movie but not a ""must see"". If you have not seen the movie or only saw it in the theater, then get the DVD and view at least one of the deleted scenes - between Andrew and Dad. (see recommendation at end of comment)<br/><br/>**CAUTION - NECESSARY SPOILERS AHEAD ** <br/><br/>I'm a strong fan of Zach Braff. He directed himself so well in this movie it would not be noticeable unless I knew if from the DVD cover. He is a master of subtle comedy. So why does Braff develop all the characters in the movie so well only to leave dear old dad a shell of a character? Sure we learn about how Andrew Largeman at nine years old pushed his mom causing her to fall back trip over the open dishwasher door and hit her head on the counter top which put her in a wheel chair the rest of her life. When we learn that, we safely assume that her death at the beginning of the movie was a suicide not an accident or murder. We can assume that is why Andrew and Dad are estranged. We can assume that for some reason the family rejected Andrew and sent him to a boarding school from which he never returned until his mom dies. We have learned over the course of the movie that Andrew has been in a drug induced state from just about every anti-depressant, anti-psychotic, anti-anxiety drug that has been released to the public. So we can assume that there was something unnatural and wrong and he suffered mental illness.<br/><br/>The problem is, that's too much assuming. And it's all because Braff decided to cut the one scene that gives understanding of Andrew and his Dad. In the bonus material and the DVD Braff comments on how hard it was to cut it from the movie. I believe he never should have. It's a crucial scene that helps us understand that Cranky Dad had issues and some unresolved ones at that. He takes it out on his son. The missing Scene is powerful and should have been left in. It is long, it is talky but it is powerfully played , especially by Ian Holm (Dad) and without it you do not understand the final conversation the two have. In the missing Scene, Andrew is standing over the bath tub where his mother took her life by drowning her self. He dad enters and they ""talk"". They very thing Andrew earlier promises to do but we never see because it was taken out.<br/><br/>Ian Holm plays the dad with such finesse and you can not appreciate it without this scene. All the questions that I was left with about Andrew and his relationship with his dad are answered if you see this scene.<br/><br/>My recommendation, get a DVD, watch the movie until you see Andrew try to stop a drip on the tub faucet. Then stop the movie, go to the Special Features and find the missing scene with Dad. Watch the scene without commentary and then go back to the movie. Braff - you're so good, this was one where your instinct let you down."

Then when I got home I put it in my DVD and I couldn't to see this movie and was very even though I had not seen a trailer. This film from the start was great nut had a slow start and then you met Sam and this film just becomes a masterpiece. Usully a great film has a great screenplay so I will start with that. The screenplay has very deep story and very original story that should had gotten the Oscar. The acting is just superb and just like the screenplay no Oscars which Zach Braff, Natalie Portman and Peter Sarsgaard deserve it. The direction was just great by Zach Braff and had a lot of talent that I can't wait to see his next movie."

It succeeds in making laughter and confusion, chaos and that warm feeling in your stomach. Inspiration and power follows a night of doing ecstasy. A most excellent soundtrack adds appeal.<br/><br/>Watch this film in the dark, at night, when you are tired. One can easily be drawn into the numbness Andrew feels.

","This movie was a true masterpiece. I loved everything about it. Zach Braff has done a remarkable job. He made such a good picture from what I thought not so much of a story. I guy comes home to his mom's funeral and stays in his hometown for about a week. There are so many scenes that are so good and that I've watched over and over again. Both Zach Braff and Natalie Portman plays their characters very, very well. Everything in the film is so well-done, every little detail. I think the reason that I loved it is that the story is quite ordinary. It doesn't change the world, which I think is good, 'cause I've seen to many ""world-changing"" films lately. Both the script and the directing is wonderful.<br/><br/>Another thing I loved about the picture is the soundtrack. Especially in the beginning when the airplane is crashing and Zach Braff just sits as calm as the see and there's some kind of Asian music I think.<br/><br/>I just hope that the next picture Braff is directing, (Open Hearts) is as good as this one. P.S. Have indulgence with this comment, it's the first I've ever written."

","A friend of mine recommended me this movie after I told him I liked Wristcutters (in theaters Oct. 19, go and see it) and I gave it a shot. I was however deeply disappointed in how bland and senseless this movie was, and I use senseless in the context of the movie being devoid of any sensitivity or feelings. <br/><br/>The story was a throwaway love story, lifted out of the infamous 'How to Make a Hollywood Movie: Everyones doin' it!' (This book simply must exist), that centered around the troubled guy finding a unrealistically upbeat girl who changes his life. This story was immersed in the subplot of coming back home to your hometown. Neither of these stories were interesting or made me want to know more about anything connected to them.<br/><br/>On top of this the characters were just, as hinted to earlier, copied from trusted and true standards. Zraffs (or whatever his name is) character (whatever the character was named) didn't do much, he mostly just stood or sat around looking non-plussed, this didn't arouse any interest in me since the guy never did or said anything interesting. And when he finally started opening up and becoming more human because of the love interest Sam this was hardly noticeable and to much of the story had already progressed by this point to save the character.<br/><br/>Sam on the other hand showed to much emotion all the time, making her unbelievable. Her behavior was explained by her being ""crazy"" although this was never elaborated on and therefore lacks creditability with the audience. Her craziness was further furthered by her family, which consisted of a overly lovable single mom, an African who's reason for being there was never satisfactorily explained, two rottweilers, and an unknown number of goldfish/hamsters/mice/other cuddly animals. Now lets pause for a second, what kind of 'animal lovers' keep cuddly animals within close proximity of rottweilers? It felt as thou her whole family was made as weird as possible to promote her being a very different girl indeed. This made her, and her family, completely unbelievable.<br/><br/>The other characters thrown into the background where stereotypes of people you find in your hometown when you return, and all where dramatically underdeveloped. You were simply supposed to assign them a slot as soon as you saw them and then keep them there for the rest of the movie. There came times when I wanted to know more about a certain character but this pleasure was me denied in the interest of moving the boring story forward.<br/><br/>On the plus side the directing was not that bad, with interesting use of slow motion/fast motion filming. The characters filled their assigned space without ever becoming interesting, which I guess shows that the director got them to do exactly what he wanted, taking into consideration the director also wrote the script. <br/><br/>These are my sensible comments on the film, and in all honesty they are spot on (I wrote them didn't I?). Sorry Zhraff but your movie isn't subtle, beautiful, artsy, deep, philosophical, imaginative, groundbreaking, or even interesting. Back to the writing board for you, or alternatively go and make 10 more seasons of Scrubs, which is a show I enjoy.<br/><br/>PS. I suggest IMDb add rottweilers in their dictionary."

","This pleasant and inoffensive movie touches on themes common in US art house cinema. The angst of twenty somethings as they struggle to build careers from dead end jobs, the quirkiness of small town America, estrangement from friends and family. <br/><br/>This movie is clearly influenced by such films as The Graduate and the Good Girl. However it is terminally slow moving and never rises close to either of those two movies. It has its moments spread thinly amongst endless scenes of is Zach Braff looking wan and Natalie Portman talking funny. <br/><br/>The central theme of father-son estrangement is continually put off in favour of some blackly comic asides. For me the humour was more dead than dead-pan. The quirky details are nice enough by themselves, but you can't build an entire movie out of this and the central plots, estranged father-son relationship and finding true love have been done so many times before and better. Ian Holm's talents were barely stretched. Some of the scenes touch on controversial subjects but are only peripheral to the storyline and don't add much bite to the plot. The big reveal was not so big and the ending in particular was a great big howling romantic cinema cliché."

","I've found that a lot of the hate generated at this film is in direct retaliation to the films praise it is getting. Garden State does not deserve neither the extreme hate or the extreme praise. Many people dislike the film for trying to pass itself off as deeper than it is and trying to mask its fairly unoriginal story with Wes Anderson style quirkiness. This is true to an extent, however this did not stop me from enjoying the film and getting something out of it. <br/><br/>Essentialy the film is a typical 'lost boy finds love and changes his way' movie but it is pulled off greatly with some great scenes, funny moments, good acting and a likable love interest. The film is wrongly held as a masterpiece by Braff fan-girls/boys who really have not seen any of the films that Garden State is trying to emulate and therefore hail it as something amazingly and overwhelmingly original when it really isn't.

I am glad I did. Garden State is one of the best films I've seen in my entire life.<br/><br/>It's not a fast past action film, it's not a comedy where people fall on their asses all the time, it's not a romantic comedy where there's another guy ruining the others chances. It's realistic, almost scary. Andrew is the guy who you pity. you feel bad for him. And in another way, you can see yourself in him. He faces real problems. In the beginning of the film, you see just how much medication he is really on. I've had family members like that, and that's the exact numb way they act.<br/><br/>It isn't made more sweet for viewers like many films do, and that's something I am truly happy about. Maybe it's why it's never been a famous movie, but It's more thought-out than any movie ever made. It's a dry comedy that will keep you laughing and crying the whole way.

Ladies and gentleman never let your father be your shrink.<br/><br/>I was quite taken with Natalie Portman who plays Sam who turns out to be Large's true love, and such a kinky, quirky, beautiful true love she is. Portman eschews beauty in every scene but manages to be cute and sweet and very emotionally evolved, which I liked. She is of course beautiful and brilliant as everybody knows, but here she tries something different. She strives to be ordinary and slight but with great emotive power. Nice performance.<br/><br/>The sound track which reminded this old guy of something from Simon and Garfunkel, and in fact there is a Simon and Garfunkel tune on it, was the sort of sweet, nostalgia-producing, alternative rock kind of sweet angst sound that lets you know that this is what youth is all about.<br/><br/>Largeman, wanna-be and somewhat successful/somewhat failed actor out on loan, comes home from the big city to rural New Jersey because his mother has died, unaccountable in a bathtub--which can happen if you are a paraplegic. He deals with a childhood tragedy and acquired guilt, meets his old buds, including Mark (Peter Sarsgaard) who is a full time slacker and part time dreamer and consummate doper. Largeman unveils his sidecar mobile--the only thing willed from his grandfather's estate--with its white star on combat green, and tools around town, parties a little and meets quirky Samantha who likes to tell lies as a kind of way to deal with the world. I knew a girl like that, only she only knew when she was lying--if somebody caught her. Sam figures it's a tick like Tourette's, and anyway her lies are harmless.<br/><br/>The movie is sweet and mildly comedic with some original shtick, and at times a bit of a tear-jerker. More than anything it's a touching love story, which I can never resist. And, yes, it's very New Jersey like Bruce Springsteen and Bon Jovi, although no songs by them on the track. Oh, and Elizabeth Shue classmate of Braff's in high school.<br/><br/>See this for Zach Braff who put a lot of his emotional life into the film and deserves the accolades he's received."
"DICK STEEL","9","0","1","3 June 2007"," A Nutshell Review: Garden State
","Garden State marks Zach Braff's feature film directorial debut, based upon a story written by him, and starring himself, Natalie Portman and Peter Sarsgaard. His later work The Last Kiss might have struck a chord in me with his characters looking at life entering the 30s, while this one's more about a younger man seeking some meaning and direction in his aimless life.<br/><br/>Looking at it, Cameron Crowe's Elizabethtown might have some similarities, with the lead character leaving the city to return to the town he grew up in, when a death in the family occurs. Here, Braff's Andrew Largeman is a struggling actor in LA, going home upon hearing news of his mother's death. Back in town, and hooking up with old acquaintances like Mark (Sarsgaard), he planned to stay for only 4 days, but found time hard to pass by especially when much of it involves drugs and booze, until he met the girl who would change his life forever - Samantha (Portman).<br/><br/>Portman really lights up the screen with her effervescent performance as a serial liar. Meeting Andrew in a psychiatric clinic, their banter in that scene is to die for (complete with humping dog), as is their banter through the first half of the movie, bringing to mind the irrelevance of the conversational pieces ala Richard Linklater's Before Sunrise, but little of that sexual overtones. Like Kirsten Dunst's character in Elizabethtown, she provides reason and is the beacon of light at the end of the lead male character's fuzzy tunnel. Smart, sassy, everything a guy would want in a girl really.<br/><br/>There are plenty of quirky moments in the movie that all but makes the movie seem like little short skits put together, but that's what makes the movie appealing, in that it doesn't stick to the usual narrative formula. It clearly stems from Braff's vision of translating most of his life's experiences into the movie. And the build up to the finale (see, I still can't stop seeing those similarities) involves a road trip of sorts, and though it doesn't cross state lines, they do make some visits, and have that feel good end to it all.<br/><br/>I'll always like any movie so long as it has a scene which touches me, for reasons of my own, and here, Garden State has one which endeared itself to me. It's that scene which involves a hug and the notion of finding a safe-house, a home. I've been there and I know that feeling, and here, it gets translated perfectly. Coupled with an excellent soundtrack throughout the story, this is one heartwarming tale that doesn't deserve to be missed.<br/><br/>Life's always complex, but it all boils down to how you want to deal with it. There are no clear answers, but lucky is the person if you have someone to walk those winding road ahead with."
"Sylviastel","9","0","1","26 May 2007"," A New Jersey State of Mind!
","Garden State is the state motto. Zach Braff was born, raised, and lived in South Orange, New Jersey which is home to celebrities like Kelly Bishop and Andre Braugher. South Orange is an upscale suburb of New York City and neighboring Newark, New Jersey. Zach Braff is perfect as the director, writer, and leading actor in this film which I heard about when he hosted Saturday Night Live. His loving homage to his home state makes you wonder what really goes on in New Jersey. There are multiple sides to life in New Jersey. I just couldn't believe that he got the wonderful Sir Ian Holm to play his father. Natalie Portman is truly believable as the girl of his dreams. Jean Smart is unforgettable as Carol, one of his friend's unconventional mothers. Life in New Jersey varies from the very rich to the very poor, rural, suburban, and urban. His story begins with a phone call from his father informing him that his invalid mother drowned in the bathtub. He returns home to New Jersey for the funeral and reunites with old friends. His character is an aspiring Hollywood heterosexual actor who works as a waiter in a Vietnamese restaurant until he gets another acting job. In Hollywood, he's one of thousands aspiring actors out there. I love how he compares Natalie's family to his own."

","i first saw this movie last night, and a sat and thought about it for a while....and it just hit me....it was great!!! i sincerely loved it, because it really touched a nerve....i think it might be one of the best movies i have ever seen. i especially liked Jelly's funeral because Sam took it very seriously although it was just a pet...anyway, maybe this wasn't the best part, but it will remain in my memory.i recommend it without any second thoughts. Zack Braff played his part very very well, and i liked him very much. However, since i am a girl, i related very much to the character played by Natalie Portman, and besides, i think she is a doll, she is a great actress. There was chemistry between them, and i for one, waited that kiss for a very long time, and i thought it was very very touching, as well as the scene when she is crying in the phone booth....i guess i would have done the same....it was the only thing that i saw in this particular film: feeling, real feeling, something with which you can relate. IT'S THE BEST."

","It took me a while, but finally i got round to watching this movie. The DVD had been waiting on my shelf for quite some time and i'm not sure why it took me such a long time to actually put it in the DVD-player. I guess the fact that several people i've spoken to call it one of their favorite movies. That always raises my expectations, which is a dangerous thing. But the danger of disappointment can't keep me away forever.<br/><br/>Zach Braff is far from one of my favorite actors. I do enjoy ""Scrubs"" somewhat, but mostly because of John C. McGinley. And mentioning ""Scrubs"" i think that's the only place i've ever seen Zach Braff before. Or well, i might have seen him in other movies too but not so much that i would remember him. And that in itself says quite a lot.<br/><br/>While i find Braffs performance in ""Scrubs"" to be quite mediocre, he's a lot better in ""Garden State"". His almost childish looks and rather shy and meek delivery fits perfectly here. He's the man who left his hometown as a boy, who's had psychological (real or imagined) problems ever since he was a child, and who now gets the chance to make peace with his past. His cautious personality is easily explained by a life spent on mind-altering drugs. The cast surrounding Braff is solid though not spectacular. Sarsgaard and Portman perform well. The one that steals the show though is Ian Holm who dominates every scene that he's in, although those are few and quite far between.<br/><br/>The story itself in ""Garden State"" is not spectacular either. I guess that's part of the movies charm. It's a rather unpretentious drama with quite a lot of humor thrown in. The thing that i found most disturbing (and that lowered the grade by one point) is the ending. Someone wrote that it feels like the movie takes a different turn at the end, like the ending and the movie don't fit together properly. That's a good description because that was my feeling as well. Somehow the movie leaves the unpretentious past and tries to be some sort of ""large-than-life""-drama in the last ten minutes. It doesn't go down well. Since it was entertaining until then i'm going to let it pass, but the ending was nevertheless a disappointment.<br/><br/>I rate this 7/10."

","I like how realistic the characters are. Sam, for example, frequently stumbles over her words and generally has something odd to say. It didn't make me feel inadequate for not being able to catch witty remarks. There are also awkward moments of silence, which I personally do not feel the world sees enough of in movies.I think to actually enjoy this movie, though, one might have to have some personal experience. Zach Braff tends to be a bit of a typecast actor, so if you like his other work, you'll probably like this as well. Although the movie is technically a drama, it contains a lot of his pathetic-situation humor. It's a good movie if you're looking for something with a little reality."

It seems to show a motivating lesson on the different swings life takes at you. While the movie itself, was never really a huge box-office slam dunk, I highly recommend watching it and seeing for yourself how amazing this independent film is. Even the soundtrack is a unique blend of music from various artists from The Shins, a band of today's generation, to Simon and Garfunkel, classic artists.

","Garden State is an emotional shattering ride which is worth several repeat views, in my honest little opinion. The few characters in the film display numerous personality flaws we all carry inside ourselves in some form or another: the guy who can't express his feelings, the girl who can't stop lying, the dude looking for excitements while working at a funeral home. Yet somehow, during their journey, these young characters (all in their mid 20's) manage to find perfection, love and new found strength in the weirdest of places. Kudos go to Zach Braff and Natalie Portman for their convincing portrayals, that succeeded in moving me in a time and place I really needed it. Now, if you drop into this equation a whisker of fine pop music and some dramatic climaxes, you've got the grasp of troubled youth in the 2000's on the silver screen. Bravo!"

The quirky location with the guy in the boat is just the kooky sort of thing that you would expect to be the thing that makes your home town feel different from anywhere else, and the hamster run is simply out of this world. Really I just enjoy sitting back and kind of letting this film wash over me, oh, and it makes me look forward to finding my home with my family. The characters may not be the most believable but that is the sort of funny thing that makes it seem all the more real.

"Lee-107","9","0","1","6 January 2007"," Adam meets Eve in Garden State and they fall in love...
","I had been meaning to watch Garden State for the longest time... finally rented the DVD last week. Natalie Portman and Zach Braff look great together! Few on screen couples look ""real"" but these guys do ;) Some of their intimate scenes together especially in the end are really well done... their emotional closeness is very heartrending... this film is essentially another boy-meets-girl kind of story, but it's done in such an unassuming unaffected manner... not with the overbearing consciousness or awareness that oh, the boy meets THE girl and now they're going to fall in love... which you kind of feel while watching most movies... I think a huge credit for that goes to Braff for writing a character like Sam - quirky, uninhibited and just radiating so much positivity. Natalie Portman is amazing as Sam...but then she's amazing whatever role she plays...! <br/><br/>After I saw the film, I sat through the entire audio commentary by Zach Braff and Natalie Portman... I do this for almost all the films I rent on DVD... I enjoy listening to the director's commentary as it brings new insights into the film and how the whole thing came about... To this end, I found the director's commentary of GS a bit wanting... one main thing which I found lacking is Zach Braff's lack of comments on his choice of actors... When Peter Sarsgaard appears on screen, I want to know why he chose Peter for the role, especially since he plays such an important part in the film. The same goes for Iam Holm and even Natalie Portman... especially Natalie Portman... So what if Portman is giving the commentary with him? I still want to why he cast her and not someone else... I read somewhere that Braff chose Natalie because he'd been a great fan of hers as she's an actress with great depth etc... but I want to know why... Braff talks about Jean Smart's casting and that of other minor characters who appear in the film as friends, but not of the main supporting cast... I wish he'd done that... Braff is very generous with his comments on Judy Becker's production design for the film and indeed it is one of the features of this film that really enhances it's overall impact on the viewer and makes it memorable... <br/><br/>Garden State is a really commendable attempt for a first-time director like Zach Braff. He is, I read, directing a film called 'Open Hearts'. Hope it's as good or probably better...!"
"robhastings1000","9","0","1","4 January 2007"," It's romantic, it's a comedy, but it's not just another rom-com
","If, at the end of a romantic comedy, you leave the cinema both thinking that life is wonderful and also wishing your cheeks didn't ache from laughing so much, you can't really ask for anything more. Garden State easily fits into this category, and in ambitiously taking on the jobs of writer, director and star, Zach Braff, of 'Scrubbs' fame, has succeeded with aplomb in creating a film that is both heart-warming and hilarious.<br/><br/>Although this is a romantic comedy, thankfully there's no room for the kind of schmoozing Julia Roberts and her collagen-fed pink pet slugs normally get up to, and in this respect Garden State is much more in the mould of the similarly excellent Lost In Translation. Meanwhile, Braff's comedy is very direct, so if you're not into simply smiling knowingly for two hours, don't worry  after all, you can't get much more direct than a guide dog humping someone's leg Along with Braff and his script, another reason to see this film and adore it is Natalie Portman. While playing the endlessly energetic and self-sure Sam, Portman also still manages to portray real sweetness and vulnerability, in perhaps the most polished performance of her career so far. Just how she was nominated for an Oscar for her role in Closer rather than for this comic masterpiece is a strange one.<br/><br/>Despite sometimes dealing with tricky issues, this is a truly excellent feel good film, which never feels contrived. While the ending may be a little sentimental, this for once doesn't seem too bad a thing, after the characters have earned your genuine affection. With the acting, the screenplay, and also the soundtrack all being of top quality, there is no reason not to see this film. So see it!"

The development of the creative character of the young man, was ably assisted by the young girl who was, clearly, the most honest thing to come into his life...Ironically, she claimed herself to be a liar from the first. The development of the relationship of Zach and Natalie, built to a point where it could not be abandoned. Thus the very fitting conclusion. I always feel very satisfied by a story that is well constructed and gives me a feeling of completion. Such is the case with Garden State."

Occasionally it's a little too obvious (you just couldn't resist adding Simon and Garfunkel to the soundtrack could you?) But for the most part the film is enjoyable enough to look past the similarities. The absurd imagery sprinkled throughout the film is extremely clever and adds a unique visual component. This is the signature that sets it apart from other films (including ""The Graduate."") There a couple of weak spots. In one scene Braff's character speaks to his father with a clarity and emotional maturity that would realistically have been beyond him, given his history.

All the characters have their own realistic idiosyncrasies, which makes them easy to love. The dialouge is heartfelt and well-written. You really believe that these people exist. You feel as if you are there, with them. It is truly a cinematic experience.<br/><br/>All in all, I would recommend ""Garden State"" to you and your loved ones any day."
"Cocacolaguy912-2","8","0","1","11 September 2006"," Wonderful acting and soundtrack make up for slightly shaky direction.
","'Garden State' is a simple movie about a young, mentally and emotionally unstable man returning to his home in New Jersey for his mother's funeral, and finds love during his visit.<br/><br/>Garden State is quite a good movie. On the surface it is a simple story, but as most movies like this are, it is deeper then that.<br/><br/>One of the problems it has is it's direction. The plots and sub plots are shaky. The movie is short, and I was not exactly sure where the plot was going until the end, where most of the material seemed to quickly explained. Then again, maybe that is intentional sense it left me thinking when it was over.<br/><br/>However, that is made up for by the wonderful acting, particularly by Natalie Portman and Peter Sarsgaard.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is also awesome. Simple, great music that help to illustrate the emotions at hand perfectly.<br/><br/>If you are looking for a simple, relatively light movie and are open to some directional flaws by first timer Zach Braff, looking for some great acting, and maybe even some songs to add to your MP3 player or ipod, then Garden State is your match.<br/><br/>8/10."

","Zach Braffs romantic drama is better than most films of this genre. I thought hte actor actually even surpassed Edward Norton's directorial achievement with the light film ""keeping the faith"". Zach braff's Garden State is a great film, its almost as good as Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind without the science fiction aspect and is definitely nothing short of critically acclaimed films such as Sofia Coppola's Lost in Translation. Here both Portman and braff are very good while Ian Holm and Peter Sarsgaard are good in supporting roles. The film is written well and has great cinematography from Lawrence Sher. I liked where Braff went with this one and am eager to see how his next project turns out. --- IMDb Rating: 8.0, my rating: 9/10"

","This might be the other side of Zach that people didn't quite know about. Even though this is his debut directorial movie, he does seem to have a talent for it, maybe a little more than his acting skill.<br/><br/>Garden State follows the life of a quietly depress young man as he return home to his mother funeral after estrange his family for 9 years, there he met up with his old friend and a girl that give the new meaning to his life.<br/><br/>What I like about this movie is the characters in this movie are pretty rich and the storyline is quite solid though predictable. This movie might not be to everybody liking since it quite lengthy and the pace is quite slow. Sam portrait by Natalie Portman is one of my favorite characters. She does a brilliant job here. Zach does also deliver a better performance than what normally seen on Scrub. And I also got to praise him on his direction, which has been done brilliantly for the newbie. The only problem is the ending, which is not being wrap up properly.<br/><br/>Recommendation: Natalie Portman Fan Will Love This Movie.<br/><br/>Rating: 7.5/10 (Grade: B) Thank you for reading."

","Reading through the user comments, I am impressed and encouraged that this movie connected significantly with so many people in their 20's. Okay, so maybe that's not a huge surprise; the film was written and directed by a bright and talented fellow when he was in his late teens and 20's.<br/><br/>But here's what I mean. It's not nothing to identify with a character who makes the transition from living a muffled life to engaging with life. Sure, it touches a longing in everyone with a pulse, the desire to drop every one of our defenses and feel. But there are plenty of forces at work in this culture that stand to benefit from the younger crowd not engaging in a intelligent and courageous fashion.<br/><br/>And Andrew, our protagonist, is mostly rewarded for engaging. He stumbles into a connection with Natalie Portman's Sam (and allow me to make the obligatory observation that history will be kind to Natalie Portman, even if she leaves acting for public office or private practice or finds that being a full-time mom is a delightful way to spend many years). The spark of life and healing that result from that relationship give him the courage and clarity to confront his father. And not just his father, but the internal voice of guilt and darkness that has clouded his young life, and it's a doozy of a cloud, I will clue you.<br/><br/>Zach is not punished for engaging, for experimenting with dropping his defenses. And while that is no one's real experience, it makes for a very good story and film. We need precisely what this film offers, the reminder of hope. I am an old guy, 47 this year, and this movie rang some deep bells inside. Like many guys from my generation, I grew up muffled, completely unaware of the things that frightened me, and had the great blessing of friends who loved me and were patient with me as I slowly grew up well into my 30's.<br/><br/>I don't know. But I do know that it is the most normal thing for people to shut down before they keep their heads out in the real air long enough to get a deep whiff off all the smells out here. And we only get one shot at this thing. Thanks, Zach Braff and hard working cast and crew. You did very well."

"Donatien3","9","0","1","18 August 2006"," An enjoyable journey down Garden State.
","As a major fan of 'Scrubs', I was mainly interested in 'Garden State' for Zach Braff. I was pleasantly surprised by this engaging comedy/drama. <br/><br/>Braff (who also writes and directs) plays Andrew Largeman, an aspiring actor who goes back to his hometown of Jersey after his paraplegic mother dies. Andrew's life is a mess; he works as a waiter in a Vietnamese restaurant, and has been taking various forms of medication since he was a young boy, which have left him emotionally numb. <br/><br/>Not surprisingly, Braff plays it much straighter as Andrew as he does with his 'Scrubs' character J.D. After the funeral, he catches up with all his friends at a party, and finds they've all settled in different ways: one's a grave-digger, while another one invented ""silent velcro"", and is content to live off his riches. The next morning Andrew visits a local doctor for his lightningnheadaches. While in the waiting room, he meets Sam (Natalie Portman). A former ice skater, she turns out to be just as unbalanced as he is, (if a little more kookier) and they hit it off immediately.<br/><br/>From there the movie follows Andrew's final few days in Jersey, as he bonds with Sam, with his ""best"" friend Mark (Peter Sarsgard) tagging along, and tries to repair his tattered relationship with his psychiatrist father (Ian Holm). This movie is essentially a ""journey down the road of life"" film, which takes a more relaxed pace by bending the traditional three-act story structure. Andrew and Sam are both flawed, but also have endearing personalities (Sam has bad luck keeping family pets alive), and by the end, you're left with a feeling that there's hope for them yet.<br/><br/>Overall, this is an enjoyable movie about reconnecting with lives left behind in order to forge new ones."

I don't feel like I have to say anything about Zach Braff because his performance was awesome, directing was awesome, so obviously his writing was awesome.

"shanfloyd","9","0","1","12 August 2006"," A wonderful film that speaks of a generation.
","""Garden State"" is simply a beautiful movie, an example of the versatile genius as a writer and director of Mr. Zach Braff. The originality of its story, its dialogues and its characters are unique. And as a twenty-something sitting in this 2006, I surely felt this personal connection to this film. It speaks of my generation, in a way few other films could.<br/><br/>Mr. Braff must have written the characters Andrew, Sam and Mark out of personal experience... otherwise the standard of their originality is really hard to achieve. Sam, as free-spirited as she could be, captures the audience from her very first appearance with the brilliant line: ""Are you really retarded?"". And Mark with his 'I-don't-give-a-shit-to-this-life' attitude is also a character to relate to. But surely Andrew Largeman is the strangest character. Many of his traits are quite obvious, predictable, natural... still there are some depths we cannot measure and that makes him so unique, so like all of us yet so different.<br/><br/>As an actor, Zach Braff does a fair job, but couldn't get entirely out of his ""Scrubs"" persona. Peter SarsgaÃ¥rd also brings a nice touch to the character of Mark. But it's Natalie Portman who steals the show as Sam. She brings out Sam's eccentricity as the most natural thing on earth, her sudden changes of emotion flow in her so easily. I must say this is one of her finest performances to date.<br/><br/>One last thing I must talk about as few other reviewers did and that's the soundtrack. It is wonderfully compiled according to the film's mood, featuring all of my favorite musicians and all the songs are used in totally right moments... what can I say? From Coldplay's ""Don't Panic"" in the very beginning to Paul Simon's ""The only living boy in New York"" to Frou Frou's ""Let Go"" in the end, the film is a magical journey of real good music.<br/><br/>""Garden State"" is one of the best movies that came out in 2004... but to those who can personally relate to this film, it's much more."

I believe this is because they do not really put their heart into it. People who cannot empathize with the main character will probably walk away seeing it as boring, or pointless. Watching his journey through the movie is the whole point behind it. Andrew's journey is the heart of the story and of the message. This movie is pegged as a comedy, but it is a far cry from slapstick. I walked away with a new point of view on my life and on how to live. The statement it makes is strong and heartfelt. In the midst of the movies that are all about glitz and glamour, this one digs deep to something below all of that. Something that applies to all of us-- how to feel. A lot of the time, we forget."

"ingo_schwarze","6","0","1","14 July 2006"," Absurd theater in the 21st century
","Let's call this a post-nihilist film: All the young characters are already used to the Pinter-ish feeling that life makes no sense, the world cannot be understood, communication and empathy are impossible, caring for any one else or trying to do anything meaningful is utterly futile. They do not expect anything from life, they do not even try to wait for Godot any more. They see modern poverty, richness, inequality, alienation, injustice at the side of their roads, taking all of it for granted, failing to understand whether it has anything to do with their own misery. They do not even suffer; if they ever heard about Sisyphe, which seems rather unlikely, they just don't care. They simply vegetate, doing absurd things - working as a policeman, being on drugs, being rich, living on the verge of mental disorders - whatever, it simply makes no difference.<br/><br/>Suddenly and unexpectedly, Godot arrives in their quiet city: A young man who fled his loveless father a decade ago and returns for his mother's funeral. In several ways, this guy fits perfectly into ubiquitous absurdity: He is as far from knowing anything about himself as any one else, and he is doing as little as any one else. Yet, his appearance does make a difference; in a way, it is utterly disturbing: He arouses genuine curiosity. Curiosity is what slowly makes tiny bits of empathy creep into all that ocean of indifference and absurdity. No wonder this leads to a love story - but this love story is not the whole point: Even though absurdity mostly prevails, some of the other characters slowly start acting in slightly more human ways, too. Watch out for it!<br/><br/>Lots of other comments blame the incoherence of the film, the incredibility of its characters, the many clichés. Right, true. But maybe part of that was even done on purpose. After all, what kind of coherence, philosophical depth and fine art do you expect in a film about post-modern absurdity? Probably some of the film's jokes will seem silly to you, perhaps you will enjoy others, perhaps you will even enjoy the ironical way some of the silly ones are presented...<br/><br/>There has been absurd theater before this film, so showing absurdity is certainly nothing new. Proposing empathy and love as a remedy to absurdity is not exactly original, either - yet, in spite of the film's many shortcomings, the way this idea is presented does not seem disgraceful or artless to me. There is some charm about it.<br/><br/>And i feel there is at least one idea shown in this film that hadn't occurred to me before. It's in the last sentence spoken in the film. I can't tell any more about it, or I would have to mark this as a spoiler. When you heard this last sentence, re-read my previous paragraph. Taking the film alone, the conclusion you will arrive at is frightfully credible."

"Flagrant-Baronessa","3","0","1","10 July 2006"," This is Zach Braff at his Zach Braffiest.
","While I worship him on Scrubs for the comedy God that he is and the perfection with which he delivers his lines as J.D., none of this comes through in Garden State. Even as the main character, Braff is an untapped source in this film because his comedic skills aren't used in the right way or at all--and comedy is the only thing that could save it from being fundamentally flawed movie. I didn't like it at all for the reason that it is one of those films that are desperately quirky. You feel just how hard it tries in every scene. It's almost depressing. Garden State presupposes that every person in the world is a misfit and treats all characters accordingly. It projects hopelessness of the average person, and it does it without humour or cleverness.<br/><br/>So, Zach Braff is Andrew Largeman--an out-of-touch actor with emo tendencies who's on meds. He returns to his family home in New Jersey (for his mother's funeral) after a decade of absence spent in Los Angeles. This self-journey in the Garden State is meant, in the film, to get Andrew back in touch with reality. Of course, he conveniently finds a girl too--a quirky girl that can save him from his sedated mental state and get him back on track. Wow, such originality. This girl is none other than the prissy, talentless Natalie Portman. It angers me that Garden State goes to such lengths to tell you that a relationship between two misfits is ""OK"" and just what is needed. We already knew that. There was never a problem or conflict to begin with. It is absolutely unnecessary to build a story on a plot like that.<br/><br/>From the choice of wallpaper, dialogue, puzzling detours and choice of music, Garden State tries to convince the viewer that it is a quirky, original film. In fact, it almost pounds it in your head toward the end. This is cool and all, but it needs much more humour to function. Unlike smart dramas of the same nature and purpose as Garden State, like Ghost World, it simply is not funny. I cannot remember laughing once. I barely smiled as it tediously played on with its ""sensitive"" music (not that I don't love The Postal Service)."
"dlturner","7","0","1","5 July 2006"," Speaks for a specific generation?

However, it's an old way of doing things...but it's a great musical set up for each sequence.<br/><br/>The critique that this story is the film of the 80's generation is knee jerk; it's a great film....I hope Zach can repeat this success. However, the selection of music is not unlike Simon & Garfunkel or Cat Stevens; folk music of that rolls along with each theme sequence that's about the same tempo/pace of the story line. There's no obnoxious music or obnoxious roles here....just a great little tale that Zach moved from paper to screen."

A generation that was drugged to the gills, whether it be with prescription medications or freely chosen street drugs.<br/><br/>The numbness and tranquility of the first part of the movie perfectly reflects what life is like for those on a multitude of prescriptions, having completely forgotten what it's like to experience life un-modulated.<br/><br/>As the movie goes on, life seems to gain more color, and stop moving so slowly for Andrew, as he wakes up from his drug induced haze and starts experiencing life. Life as it really is, raw, and at times painful, but also full of joy and love that one is unable to experience when one's emotions are so tightly controlled by medication.<br/><br/>It's truly THE movie that speaks to this generation, and will always remind us of how it was.<br/><br/>I just can't understand how anyone can say it was a bad movie.

","*May contain spoilers* I didn't feel it would be fair to hold a grudge against Garden State until I watched it twice, so after a fair amount of distance I gave it a second try. Okay, returns are in. I'm still frustrated by it. <br/><br/>It's such a shame, this could have been a great movie. A lot of interesting themes to work with - guilt, medication, self discovery, forgiveness, being withdrawn from your past, or indifferent to it. Some of the humor is well-spotted and fits (the mom who's set on doing the real estate tapes, for example), but there's so much over-the-top shite - humping dogs, the retarded quarterback joke that's told over and over. <br/><br/>The long scene that ends in the quarry (""good luck in the infinite abyss"") is contrived and poorly written, and the final scene in the airport is kinda trite as well.

","This is one of my favorite movies of all time and I watch it at least once a week. Braff's characters are brilliantly developed and you can relate to each and every one of them. One of the first things I realized when I was watching this movie was how each of the characters reminded me of one of my friends. Andrew Largeman (Braff), the main character is an emotionally numb struggling actor who comes to New Jersey after 9 years after his mother dies. After being on antidepressant drugs his entire life large goes on an odyssey all over New Jersey to find himself. Natalie Portman shines in the role of Sam, the compulsive liar love interest of Largeman. Peter Sarsgaard and Armando Riesco are great as High School friends Mark and Jesse who really haven't matured since Largeman left. For a first effort, Braff's Garden State is incredible. <br/><br/>The coming of age of Largeman, Sam and Mark is so easy to relate to and well written that you will want to watch this movie over and over.

"czarnobog","10","0","1","1 July 2006"," Charming and Intelligent Delight -- Outstanding American Film
","While the Hollywood studios churn out their endless stream of crappy love stories featuring big stars, all the ""correct"" story beats, and half-an-ounce of heart, Zach Braff found one investor with the brains and balls to bankroll this wonderfully quirky and entertaining film about two misfits who stumble into each others lives.<br/><br/>The story begins in a daze of imagery appropriate to the main character's mindset, befogged on a slew of legal drugs which have held him in thrall for most of his sorry life. Braff is perfectly charming in the lead role. Part of that charm is his vulnerability. Like Peter Sellers' Chauncey Gardiner in ""Being There,"" he's an observer of life rather than a participant. But while Chauncey viewed life through the innocent eyes of a simpleton, Braff's Andrew Largeman filters it through a drug-induced haze, prescribed by his psychiatrist father.<br/><br/>Leaving L.A. to attend his mother's funeral in NJ, he gets swept into the tidal pool of his long lost buddies from high school, an assortment of realistic oddballs and dubiously moral characters. He also meets a girl who is just as weird and insecure as he is, a performance which showcases Natalie Portman at her very best.<br/><br/>While directors of similar films (like The Station Agent, another good off-the-wall romance set in New Jersey) may do a commendable job with their meager budgets, Braff has done wonders with his. A good part of the production value lies in his use of locations and the slick and artful cinematography, which give the film an expansive feel not often found in small personal dramas.<br/><br/>Too often ""quirky"" means self-indulgently goofy. Almost every frame of this film is smart and polished and original. It's ten times more entertaining than your average studio comedy.<br/><br/>This film was so good it reminded me that the oft-abused state of New Jersey has produced an inordinate number of great talents and huge stars, from Jack Nicholson to Tom Cruise, Danny Devito, Martha and John Stewart, Bon Jovi, Sinatra, Springsteen, Spacey etc etc all starting with Thomas Edison in Menlo Park. ""Garden State"" is a fitting tribute to this wellspring of talent, and Zach Braff is as talented as anyone listed above."

He's a guy I should see more of (shockingly, I haven't seen much of scrubs, even though I laugh every time I manage to catch an episode). It's actually very hard for me to laugh at a movie nowadays, but this movie had me laughing from the very start. I just found the movie touching, thoughtfully written and directed, and has dynamite performances in the end. Well, actually, let me back up, it somewhat loses itself in the end, but that is a minor picky point. This movie is not for everyone (I actually gave it to my work buddy after watching it, and she couldn't stand it).

","Garden State, to me, was one of the best films i have ever seen. The beauty of it, was that it did not need special effects, or violence, or far-fetched story lines ... instead, Braff chose to deal with life-like situations, which everybody can relate to, and for that, he is a genius in my mind.<br/><br/>One of the very first shots shown, was the one in where Andrew Largeman is lying in his bed, white sheets, white pillow, white curtains, white walls, a phone by his side, and he is tucked in so tightly. From this very first scene i was automatically amazed at Braff's ability to convey the message of Andrew's ""numb"" life, without any colour or spark in it. <br/><br/>Braff then does even better with the introduction of Sam, (Natalie Portman ... STAR WARS RULES!!!) who introduces Andrew to the joys of life. Her colour and spark, is magnificent, and works so well in contrast to the bleak character of Andrew.<br/><br/>But perhaps what really spoke out to me was the fact that this film was so like real life. Where do we go? What do we do? The film so clearly expressed the never-ending struggles of life, loneliness, love, wanting to please, drugs, .. all things which we can so easily relate to <br/><br/>Zach Braff has made a film which i think will live on through the ages as one of the greatest films ever which speak of the truths about life.

She's both funny and endearing.<br/><br/>I found the songs in Garden State fitting with the likes of Coldplay, Zero 7, Frou Frou and oh, be prepared to be a fan of The Shins.<br/><br/>The themes of this movie seem to be live life without regrets and to embrace your emotions and most importantly to be original and disregard others opinions.<br/><br/>I'd recommend this film to anyone who is looking for a film with just that and oh, I forgot to mention this film is also very funny so if you're looking for a laugh this movie is right up your alley and is one of my personal favourites.<br/><br/>9/10"

","The exact scene that hit home with me is where he is in the Doctors office talking to him about the prescribed medicine he is on. Through the conversation, it is made clear by Andrew that he believes nothing was ever wrong with him; but rather they were given to him by the concern of his father. Who unrealistically is his psychiatrist, but is done on purpose just to make it evident to the viewer of the situation at hand. While watching the scene flashbacks ensued in my head like Andrews headaches, like a lighting flash then gone. Week after week, month after month visiting some psychiatrist evaluating my ""mind-set"". While my parents sitting at home hoping they prescribe me a drug that will ""make me feel happy"". It's as-if I could put myself on the screen an replace Andrew an the only differences would be location, name an age.(Oh and of course the obvious fact of my Dad not being my psychiatrist). Sometimes I wonder if years of my youth were numbed because of these drugs and the situation I was in. To say that I related to Garden State is an understatement, I lived it."

","I must confess that I really despise New Jersey as a whole, so any film named ""Garden State"" has two strikes before it comes to bat. I'm sure you readers here already understand the plot, so I won't bore you with rehashing the details. Baiscally, he seeks forgiveness and finds that and love in a trip back home for his mother's funeral; leaving his little failed actor world in LA. Some people have compared it to the ""Graduate"" as a generation defining movie. It does have that potential: over medicated on psychotropic drugs, isolated from reality, his old buddies are stay at home wastrels. But the triteness of it all, capped off on the ""it only happens in the movies"" love relation with Natalie Portman and the effortless psyche healing via love and banal psycho-babble clichés, makes me wonder what all the sophistos at Sundance saw in this film, where it cleaned up at that festival. I won't trash this film and Braff does have potential, but it is an easily forgettable film that aims high but belly flops."

","Okay, so I went to see this movie with my mom after a very powerful blow to my already-crumbling relationship with my now ex-boyfriend. It was just what I needed not to completely swear off ever dating anyone again. It's a charming love story. Though it may be corny at times, it would be completely cold and unbelievable without the cheese factor. Let's face it - sometimes people - especially people walking that shaky bridge from childhood to adulthood - are cheesy. However, this movie manages to portray that melodramatic period in the human life span without the usual condescending vapidness that's usually oozing from the silver screen at this type of affair. Furthermore, its simply a beautiful film. The ordinary looks lovely and your life could fit someone into this wonderful story. It's not untouchable. Rather, its something completely tangible and familiar."

","Garden State has really surprised me. For me, this is almost a master-piece. The film bring us such subtility, care and simplicity for subjects that are so hard for us, in all parts of our lifes. The things that happen, the themes, the way that the film deals about all those things, with such knowledgement and simplicity, provide us laughs and tears at the same time. All the symbolism and metaphors behind the film are so magic that everyone who sees it start enjoying it. The film is subtle, charming and happily human at the same time. <br/><br/>Garden Sate show us the fears that we have when we talk about happiness and how those fears can simply paralyze us, ours feelings and dreams. It make us think and reflect about the individualistic life that ""we take"" in the current contemporary society. The human been, always ""linked""/close to the material values, forgot that before the ""have"", has the ""been"". This relation is fundamental for the psychological and physic formation of everybody. The film show us exactly that, that we must have a""structure"", a family to live well, to have feelings and dreams. <br/><br/>Andrew Largeman (Zach Braff) is not some guy who lives, he only survive. He preferred to scape from his tragedies and emotions, to not have to confront them, living in a ""induced coma"", free of any feeling, because of the anti-depressives. The film, basically, inquires us if it worth living without feeling. <br/><br/>Other ""strong point"" of the film is the performances and the characters. Natalie Portman is firm and light, strong and weak, sad and happy at the same time. This mix of feelings made her performance so brilliant and magic that we can't stop looking and appreciating her. Her character (Sam) is very important, because she show us that the beauty of life isn't in the ""value things"", but in the little and simple things of our lifes. Zach Braff it's also brilliant. His ""timing"", his tone, his simplicity, all mixed up, provide us a simple but strong and charming performance. Congratulations for him: Besides being such a great actor, he proved that he is also a great director and writer.<br/><br/>For me, that's a magnificent, brilliant, wonderful, beautiful, simple and strong film. You can not miss it. It will, at least, make difference in your life, give you hope and, who knows, transform your life."

","before i make my initial statement, id like to comment on one of the reasons why Garden State became such an amazing film. Zach Braff wrote it, Zach Braff Directed it. Zach Braff knew what he was doing, he had a perfect vision of this film while he wrote its script and shot its film. same applies to 'The butterfly Effect' and its creators Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber, who had to sell one of their earlier scripts to make up the budget for the Butterfly Effect.<br/><br/>Garden State is a wonderful production, the consistency of wide angles, centralized figures & props in solidarity with the dialog and the music, bring in sturdy significance and add weight and magnitude to the story line.<br/><br/>Zach Braff has potential to dominate the Hollywood scene and take it by storm with his remarkable script writing, his innovative directing skills and illustrious acting."

There is nothing that I could say to express how unbelievable these actors are, so I will Just leave it at that. Last but not least, the music that Zack Braff picked for the film has opened our generation to new artist in the indie era, and has so far inspired me to make an mix on I-tunes titled""Garden State - Six Degree's of Separation"".

","I was pleasantly pleased with Garden State. The writing was excellent. Great story line and plot. Every turn in the story delivers with a kind of smoothness not expected for a first time director. Zach Braff does a wonderful job balancing acting and directing in his directing debut for the big screen. Natalie Portman is so lovable playing an insecure, compulsive lier (and also a great ice skater!).<br/><br/>The story is based on Largeman (Braff) coming home for his mother's funeral and catching up with old friends. The group of friends, centered around his best friend turned grave digger and inventor turned millionaire friend that has more money than he knows what to do with, makes the movie. Portman's innocence throws a nice balance to the group. (The CAT Scan scene makes my sides hurt every time!) Overall, a great movie with a wonderful ending. Very light hearted and quirky but ultimately sincere.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: Great movie, written by, directed by, and starring a very funny and talented person, Zach Braff."

It's dark comedy is perfection, one minute you're laughing, the next you're crying. It's a roller-coaster of emotion just like life. Zach Braff's speech about home touched every part of me. We spend forever looking for the home we lost as a child. He is so in tune with everything it's amazing, he's a true credit to the film industry and should be recognised for it!!<br/><br/>The end scene, set to Frou Frou!!, was just spine-tingling. The fact that he is recognising it could all go wrong but he just can't spend any more of his life without her in it is truly beautiful!! Everyone should take the plunge in that way with relationships.

","Its hard to believe that a 27 year old man could write a film which seems like it had been written by a writer who had a Kubrick like experience.<br/><br/>Before i watched garden state i was weary that it was going to be like ""Lost in translation"". A film i found boring and unfunny yet received much critical acclaim. But i was pleasantly surprised. There is no real basic plot to the movie but the foundations of it are that a B list actor called Andrew (Zach Braff) has come back from L.A to his home town in New Jersey for the first time in nearly a decade to attend his mothers funeral. Are first view on Andrew is that he is very depressed, so depressed that he doesn't even cry at his mothers funeral, and attends a party after it with his old school friends. At home things don't get much better for him as it is obvious he doesn't have a good relationship with his father, and Andrews stay seems pointless until at a doctors check up he meets Sam (Natalie Portman). Who is a hyperactive down to earth girl who has problems of her own. The pair hit it off straight away and soon they are over her house and she is meeting Andrews friends. As Andrews stay draws to an end his best friend says he is going to get him a going away present but they must have a little adventure to get it.<br/><br/>At the start of the film Andrew is shown having to take pills for his obvious illness. but uses this journey as a time to come of them and in meeting Sam and discussing his childhood involving his mother who was always depressed and how Sam changes his life in a few short days. This is were the film got me. On realising that i too have had to deal with depression in the family and seeing that the character Andrew is portraying is obvious that it has come from Zach Braffs own life and the personality is almost the same as my own. And just being able to see this mans short stay with his friends and newly found girlfriend really touched me in a way that no film has ever done.<br/><br/>The film does have a lot to its name. Comedy, relationship and drug issues and of course romance and friendship and a brilliant soundtrack. It truly is a thing of beauty but it does suffer from quite a hollow plot and an ending that i didn't rely like."

","I love the slow, dreamy style of the opening sequence. It immediately draws us into the main character's state of mind. <br/><br/>This film is beautifully and lyrically shot. But it isn't just for style's sake - the unique visuals are essential to the story. It was so cool when I realized that; I couldn't wait to see the movie again! <br/><br/>We see the world through the eyes of a guy who has been over-medicated by his psychiatrist father since he was a kid. The rest of the movie is his awakening from the numbness of a lifetime on anti-depressants. He is just discovering what it is to SEE and FEEL life without the dulling effects of Rx. <br/><br/>It is through this SLOW AWAKENING POV that we experience the world around him. The filmmakers use the unique images and slow lyric pace of the opening sequence to get us inside his POV. Slowly the Rx fog of his medicated existence is peeled away. As the character ""awakens"" from years of numbness we see the ordinary world through a fresh perspective. <br/><br/>The movie is full of quirky and original characters. I love the off-beat witty humor and unique visuals. So many scenes lingered in my mind - for days after I saw this movie.<br/><br/>Simple moments shine with magic. Scenes are shot in common everyday settings - yet in the hands of the director and cinematographer the ordinary world is beautiful and magical. Shot after shot after shot. <br/><br/>I SO ENJOYED seeing a movie where the director and crew remembered film is a VISUAL MEDIUM. They used every frame beautifully! So many lovely and subtle moments for your eyes to feast on. No talking heads or generic Hollywood sets in this movie. As the studios crank out more and more visually dull formula movies, that just seem to plop the camera down anywhere, I was beginning to think Hollywood had forgotten that film can be an artist's canvas for imagery. <br/><br/>GARDEN STATE reminded me why I feel in love with movies as a child - that moment when the curtains part and the studio fanfare music swells. You get excited about the possibilities. <br/><br/>Garden State starts with fantastic images. It gives you that feeling of anticipation. And you start to worry - will it last beyond the opening sequences?...But then it just keeps getting better and better. I loved the fun, quirky story, unique characters, lines to quote and memorable images. <br/><br/>I loved every frame of this movie. The opening sequence itself is wall-to-wall with poster-worthy frames and images. <br/><br/>BRAVO!! <br/><br/>I am looking forward to watching the careers of the writer/director and the cinematographer. Can't wait for next release.<br/><br/>A FEW OF MY FAVORITE VISUALS / SHOTS: <br/><br/>The main character walks past a ROW of SINKS in a public bathroom and the motion activated sensors turn the faucets on one by one. <br/><br/>Guy and girl on motorcycle (with sidecar! - okay just that is unique) waiting at stop sign for SCHOOL KIDS to CROSS THE STREET. Visually, the kids reminded me of a row of ducklings following their mother. <br/><br/>Main character waking up to sound of answering machine in his ALL WHITE ROOM- tucked tightly into his bedsheets. Visually it is a wonderful metaphor for a STRAIGHT JAKCET. Well done! <br/><br/>Waiter's POV of demanding diners in a snobby restaurant and the behind the scenes activities in the restaurant kitchen where all servers are actors with HEADSHOTS.<br/><br/>The love interest brings him to her house - an embarrassing clutter of small-town decor, which has been taken over by the winding HABI-TRAIL of plastic HAMSTER tunnels.<br/><br/>The Girl's adopted brother (and Criminal Justice Student) is DUSTING for FINGER PRINTS on the families dusty TELEVISION...And later, the love interest's mom shows an embarrassing childhood video of her, which they watch on the TV that still shows DUSTED FINGERPRINTS.<br/><br/>The main Character wakes up on the couch at his FRIEND'S HOUSE and sees in the morning light, a guy in KNIGHT'S ARMOR clunking around in the kitchen holding a gallon of milk.<br/><br/>The 3 main characters running around in MAKE-SHIFT TRASHBAG RAIN PONCHOS when unexpectedly caught in downpour.<br/><br/>The ARK BOAT, that the caretaker lives in, down at the bottom of the ABYSS. <br/><br/>MISTY FOG and LIGHT of swimming pool at night. <br/><br/>I could go on and on..."

","Touching, sentimental, obviously very humorous and romantic this movie has everything .Specially superb performance by Natalie is just like cherry on top of the cake. Zach who is the director, writer and the lead actor of the movie has made this movie so superbly that it is just too good and one of the reason is that it is young it shows the story of mid twenty guy who hasn't felt life for a long time maybe since the time of his birth who longs for love, home. A story about a lonely guy who feels guilty for his moms death and is a complete stranger to his own dad .true not an unusual story but the way it has been made and the performance gives this movie freshness and make you feel that it is different and wonderful .I wonder how he came up with such a wonderful meaningful young story and direction. He will go sky high if he keeps on doing such great jobs you know. I wouldn't say that Zach has done the best acting ever but his character is so good and how he fits in the role makes people love him very much .Specially the chemistry between Sam and large it is so good it not sexy or vulgar or something like I will bring the stars for you but instead it is very real, sweet, sensible and caring. The last scene where large comes back for Sam when he finally realizes where his home is very very brilliant .Natalie she is always great, simply great .She fits in the character so well that it is very hard to even think the movie without her she gives Sam sweetness to her character by her mesmerizing performance . After you watch this one you won't believe it is the same Natalie who did closer or vendetta. She is superb. The other supporting cast also has quite a good job but the movie completely belongs to Zach for his brilliant directorial debut and Natalie for her astounding performance. And the songs of this movie deserve to be mentioned they have chosen the best songs which can elaborate the scene and will really be liked by the viewer especially by young people. I have watched it twice and I intend to watch it again because it is just too good."
"yourmartyr","4","0","4","10 April 2006"," Catchy one-liners try to fill gaps of cohesion
","When Garden State first came out, I'd heard more rave reviews of it than any other movie in a long time. Out of sheer coincidence, I had not gotten the chance to see it until it was out of theaters. Nevertheless, from what I'd heard, this was a stand-alone movie that could move even the hardest heart no matter where it is shown. Unfortunately, a big screen and booming sound certainly would have helped conceal the script.<br/><br/>A little philosophy goes a long way, but a lot of it is like getting hit with a truck, and I suppose there are a lot of masochists out there. Don't get me wrong - I thirst for a good idealistic romp through life, but when I tilted my head and opened my mouth for what Garden State had to offer, it drowned me in a gallon of detached philosophy. I say detached because that's the best way to describe 100 catchy quotes without any substance other than their 'feel-good' value.<br/><br/>A good, deep discussion about life can be invaluable when called for, but when our characters are placed in situation after situation of lengthy musings about the philosophies of being alive... can't they have realistic dialog for just two seconds? Perhaps if the plot were less realistic, the fickle proverbs could be taken for what they are: one-liners. But under the expectation of realistic characters in real-life situations (no matter how unique), Garden State's philosophy has all he subtlety of a sledgehammer to the face.<br/><br/>The movie's theme is a strong one, however. A lost young man in the prime of his life, is faced with daunting obstacles that block his path to self-discovery and thus paradise. Only can a journey through the unfamiliar and threatening world around him bring peace to his soul. If the plot is still refreshing, you may not be familiar with Dante's trilogy: Inferno, Purgatorio, and Paradiso. This new remake on the classic Divine Comedy is well adapted, but perhaps it should have also adapted today's standards of writing. Dante wrote for politics and societal commentary; movies must also entertain, and without any substance behind the pseudo-intellectualism, I'd rather visit academia myself.<br/><br/>Garden State is a well produced movie, with fantastic acting and a refreshing story to fuel its intentions. It could just have delivered its message in an envelope, rather than jumping out of a cake."
"Buddy-51","9","0","1","2 April 2006"," scintillating indie comedy
","""Garden State"" is anything but a garden variety romantic comedy. Brilliantly written and directed by Zack Braff (who also plays the lead role), this quirky indie triumph is one of the most delightful and disarming little films to come our way in a long long time.<br/><br/>The ironically named Andrew Largeman is a bit like Holden Caulfield, but without all the articulation about his alienation and angst. In fact, for Andrew, the angst is buried so deep within his psyche that he is completely unable to verbalize what it is that is bothering him. All he knows is that he isn't happy with either his life or himself as a person. Andrew confesses that for most of his time here on earth all he has been able to feel is ""numb."" As the movie begins, we meet Andrew as a struggling actor living in Los Angeles, having fled his hometown in New Jersey years earlier. Virtually estranged from his parents, Andrew receives the shocking news that his paraplegic mother has died suddenly in a drowning ""accident,"" thus precipitating Andrew's first trip home in ages. As with many literary and cinematic characters, Andrew learns a great deal about himself and about others by making that return trek back to the place of his roots.<br/><br/>It's hard to convey in words just how charming and lovable an experience ""Garden State"" turns out to be. It is a movie filled with originality, humor, warmth, poignancy and a sly comprehension about life and how best to live it. As Andrew reconnects with his childhood buddies, he learns that not much has changed in their lives either and that they are no closer to finding true happiness than he is. So even though fleeing the town may not have been the answer, staying there certainly wasn't the answer either - or at least so he believes until he meets an idiosyncratic young woman named Sam, delightfully played by Natalie Portman. The two hit it off almost instantly, finding common ground in their peculiarities and eccentricities. What's impressive about Braff's work here is that he never overdoes the quirkiness as so many other filmmakers do. He allows it to filter through his tale in such a way that we find ourselves laughing with the people rather than at them. The folks in this town may not be the smartest or most ambitious people we will ever meet, but somehow they have managed to make life work for them and have remained generally positive and upbeat in the process.<br/><br/>Braff, looking a little like a young Ray Romano, perfectly captures the befuddlement, fear and almost crippling self-consciousness that lay at the root of Andrew's unhappiness, while at the same time conveying the good-naturedness and capacity for loving that provide him with the hope that, against all odds, he will someday achieve fulfillment. He and Portman make such an endearing romantic couple that we just know they will wind up making it in the end. In addition, there are strong supporting performances from Ian Holm, Peter Sarsgaard, Ron Leibman and a whole host of other talented performers.<br/><br/>""Garden State"" provides a subtle little homage to ""The Graduate"" in its closing line - a fitting tribute from a film that captures the offbeat vision and youthful spirit of that earlier classic of anarchic cinema. But ""Garden State"" is a visionary film in its own right as well."

Maybe I just can't relate to the characters and their stories, but if someone had just confessed to me that he pushed his mother down the stairs and crippled her for life, the last thing I would do is hug and accept him. And for all you cinema fanatics who think Natalie Portman stole this movie -- NO! Natalie Portman is one of the most overrated young actresses in the business today. I have yet to see her play a character that didn't come across as the eternally simple teenager. (But I haven't seen ""V for Vendetta"" yet!) You want proof? Bust out your nerd collection and compare Natalie Portman as a princess in the Star Wars prequels to Carrie Fisher as a princess in the original trilogy. There's only one actress who comes across as someone who could actually lead a rebellion, and it ain't Portman! She's cute! Oh my god is Natalie Portman cute! And that's why everyone thinks she's a great actress. No harm in that, Hollywood is more about looks than acting. Just please don't tell me that Portman reached new levels with this character because it feels like everyone one of her previous roles. You want to see an actress kick some butt as the immature young adult discovering life's realities? Go rent ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" instead and check out Kate Winslet's performance."

","You won't be offended, in the least, by this film. It's very pleasant to watch and the story line doesn't require much dissection. Unfortunately, it doesn't offer much more either. It tries to be deeper than it is. The story's been told a million times before and better. Natalie Portman is the surprise here but her character starts to dull down by the end. And some of the love dialog gets pretty pretentious and trite. I might have given it a 6 had it not been for the annoying and unnecessary(and sometimes bombastic)addition of too many pop songs that seemed to be crammed into the film to fill gaps in action or dialog. It sometimes sounded like a commercial for VH1. The last scene was far too predictable for words."
"sofiavicu","5","0","1","14 February 2006"," A not so fertile garden
","I waited to see Garden State for three reasons: The incredibly good trailer, I'm a ""Scrubs"" fan and the soundtrack contains my favorite artists.<br/><br/>When I finally got to see it I was a bit let down. The second scene where we get to see Andrew on his bed felt too obvious and frankly, a little fake. Even if you're completely numb your bed isn't straight and wrinkle-free after you get in it, and I really don't think the character had the presence of mind to fix it after he got under the covers. I think the medical cabinet scene illustrated much better this man's life.<br/><br/>Some of the characters struck me as fake after their first appearances, with the exception of Peter Sarsgaard (why isn't this guy the most sought out actor in Hollywood?) and Ian Holm. Natalie Portman was good, too, but she seemed a little stiff while delivering some lines, ""Great job, man"" sounded stiff and too scripted to me. Other than that detail she was great.<br/><br/>It's pretty obvious the screenplay was written by a man. A woman would never write a character like Sam because we've seen far too many characters under the label of ""quirky-cute-girl-next-door"" that suddenly change our lives, but Portman managed to keep us wanting more of her character. But one detail still haunts me: what does Sam see in Large? It's easy to see why he falls for her, but what about the girl? Why is she so interested in this guy? Is it the old 'opposites attract' formula? Is it because he doesn't question her? Is it because she likes the idea of saving people? Ron Liebman makes a good job as Dr. Cohen, and he's always a pleasure to watch. But it also felt like Ian Holm was making a cameo. After his first real talk with his son he seemed to have so much repressed anger I thought his eyes could kill, and I definitely wanted to see more of that. Unfortunately the rest of his scenes came out as 'let's remember he has a father,' and the final ""confrontation"" scene could've been so much more if Holm had been allowed to talk. Instead his son blurts out everything he feels and the psychiatrist father just listens to him, looking like a million thoughts were racing in his mind. What were those thoughts? Why didn't we get more from this character? The direction was purely Braff. I've seen the episodes he's directed on ""Scrubs"" and recognized some resources such as the use of speed, cameras disappearing into the sky/the bottom of the quarry while still framing the characters, and the camera in motion, like in the reception of the funeral scene.<br/><br/>There are a few visual gags that really work but others seem a little too forced, like the dog pleasuring himself at Sam's house. What is it with this movie and horny dogs? Apparently Andrew brings that out on them, because there always seem to be a dog humping his leg, jumping him or masturbating in front of him. The scene when he gets out of his car to get to work and sees the gas thing on his car seemed a little extra. We know this character is numb, we saw it on his dream, on his bed, on his medical cabinet, on his lack of reaction after finding out his mother is dead. The pills were a good idea but never fully developed, and Andrew 'Large' Largeman reminds us at least 3 or 4 times why he's so numb: the medical cabinet scene, at his consultation with Dr. Cohen, on the fireplace scene and when he finally talks to his father. They may seem necessary, but it was almost as if he was feeding the viewer into details we already know but some characters didn't. It's understandable why Samantha didn't know, but his high school friends must have noticed this before.<br/><br/>I had a big problem with the ending. It seemed contradictory. The movie is supposed to be about finally taking control of life by embracing our realities, yet the whole ""what do we do"" thing (and the fact that he repeated that line) seemed out of context, along with the fact that for some reason Sam was in luggage check-out. I could interpret that as ""taking your luggage and go do what you came here to do"" but it had a problem that is the Golden rule of film-making: keep it real. It also seemed to fall under the Hollywood system, something the movie had avoided until the last scenes.<br/><br/>Braff intended this to be a modern version of the Noah's Ark story, when you gather everything you need to start a new life, but he didn't seem to gather enough to start over. He just got started, and that's not Noah's Ark, that's just making up your mind.<br/><br/>I can see why some people compare this to ""The Graduate"", but it's far from being it's new fresh version. Braff is no Dustin Hoffman and no Mike Nichols. The main difference is that Nichols can do a masterful job at portraying human behavior while Braff leaves the characters at being quirky just for the sake of making a funny off-beat movie. But hey, it's his first big feature and he did a good job. Yet some of the sequences came out as Braff mouth-feeding the audience.<br/><br/>I expected the music to be better used, but it seemed to be there just for the sake of using it, except for the orgy and the airport scene. And I definitely like The Postal Service's original version of 'Such Great Heights' which was used in one of the trailers, but that's just a matter of taste. The movie is easy on the eyes (perhaps too easy) but it lacked development in many areas. Still, it'll leave you thinking about some issues."

It perfectly defines this generation for kids like me and some others.<br/><br/>What makes Garden State so special? Well, for example, we can relate to several characters in Garden State and it is seldom that we get character driven and dialogue driven film all in one, which is very unique. Think of Before Sunrise but Garden State has a plot. Zach Braff make amazing debut as director with this film and he must be given kudos for that.<br/><br/>Zach Braff's character Andrew Largeman represented, maybe, all of us because we can feel the empty and void all in ourselves but soon or later we will be redeem by someone who is similar to Natalie Portman's character Samantha. Perhaps, this is Portman's finest work as an actress besides The Professional. I never saw any of Braff's works before but he did superb job in Garden State. Someone in Braff's position would try to have steal and hogging whole the film to themselves but that's not case with Braff. He simply allows the storyline developing and let his actors shine in their roles.<br/><br/>Nobody in Garden State outperforming each other and that's smart thing. Everyone in Garden State is perfect with content in their roles and for that, it is amazing independent film. Its very reality based film but it treat us an intelligent audience because it allows us to pondering for ourselves instead of being bombarded with explosions and car chases every five minutes.<br/><br/>Its 102 minutes of pure character interaction film, which is pretty rare among modern films these days but I'm hoping that it can stand the time of test because the theme in Garden State is universal and I think everyone can really relate to it, no matter what their experiences are.<br/><br/>I would recommend this film to everyone and it's one of the precious few modern films that I actually like."

","""Garden State"", which incidentally could have happened in any other state and not just New Jersey, starts like Camus' ""Outsider"", rolls along for a little while like ""The Graduate"", than takes on a life all of its own. The story of the character Andrew Largeman (written, directed and played by Zach Braff) starting with his homecoming to mother's funeral is very different from the two aforementioned pieces of work. Rather than general alienation from the world, Andrew has a specific psychological scar that goes deep and far back. But the story is even more about discovery of love with newly met Samantha (Natalie Portman), another human being with some problems of her own.<br/><br/>The one thing that strikes me most about this movie is the way it continuously starts a scene with an absurdity, which later turns out to be perfectly explainable. For example, when Andrew wakes up in a friend's place one morning with a hangover (that one not just from alcohol) and ""Balls"" written on his forehead, he finds someone walking around in the kitchen in shinning amours, complete with helmet, it turns out to be only a friend who happens have just got off work from Medieval Times.<br/><br/>The movie is also rich in a daily life sort of sense of humour that comes from a keen observation and playful imagination. Consider the scene when Sam's family shows Andrew home video of her skating performance as a kid (dressed up as a crocodile, as a matter of fact). When they all clapped in the end, all the lights go out. In the split second when you wonder what caused the power failure, Samantha's brother claps again and the light goes back on. You'll find that sort of ticklish humour in abundance throughout the movie.<br/><br/>The love story is so sweet and innocent that it could have come from the fifties or sixties, quite pleasantly updated. It all happens in Andrew's short stay after the funeral and before flying back to L.A. to continue his existence and actor-cum-waiter. It is one of those stories in which nothing really happens (except for boy meeting girl and boy falling in love with girl). But then, there are a few supporting characters that you'll enjoy watching. Ian Holm (""Bilbo"" in LOTR) plays the psychologist father who believes that he has all the solution to his son's problem. Peter Sarsgaard is Andrew's slightly eccentric friend who takes him (and Sam) on some interesting expeditions. Sarsgaard won acting awards with this movie in some minor film festivals. I think one day, given the right script, he will win big.<br/><br/>Some critics fault this movie for being too light (implying I guess that it does not fully realise its potentials). I think it's going into the realm of personal taste and personally I do not see anything wrong with making this movie into a bittersweet comedy. A lot of people don't like the ""happy ending"" and here I tend to agree that it does look a little out of place. If it is a standard Hollywood production (and I don't know if it is), the answer would be obvious, as every such production goes through the process of test screening to a random sample of the mass audience. People who have invested money would do anything to the movie based on what the result of the post-screening survey tells them that would help the box office. But I believe that ""Garden State"" is an independent movie and if that is the case, I don't really understand why. But regardless, this movie offers some fresh angels (both literally and otherwise) as it is well written and skilfully shot. There's also top notch acting."

The effective scenes rank up there with Indy's best, while some of the ineffective scenes do just a little too much damage. This ain't great, but its damn close.

Sam (Portman) is simply the most beautiful character I have come across in a long time. She makes everything OK. Sam feels the emotion which many suppress, and this provides the audience an outlet of their own.<br/><br/>One of the final scenes in which Sam and Andrew are sitting on the airport stairs makes my chest hurt- Sam's face as she turns away and silently begins to cry is so powerful- at least to me- something which anyone who has ever been in love will probably find heart breaking.<br/><br/>Regardless- if you haven't yet seen this film- see it now- you won't be sorry- even if it ends up being the soundtrack which hooks you."

No text (filmic, literary, etc) could ever achieve such a mammoth task. But this film does mark a nice rethinking of what it means to make a 'love story' or a 'slice of life' drama, just as 'Lost in Translation' also did in 2004. <br/><br/>I really enjoyed the chemistry between Braff and Portman.

I wasn't quite sure if I should laugh or cry during many of the scenes--when Andrew explains matter-of-factly that his mother drowned in the bathtub after being paralysed by a dishwasher, for example, or later when he and Sam sit in the very same bathtub where his mother met her demise, or the whole idea of romance between an epileptic compulsive-liar and a drugged-up guy with a bizarre home life blossoming during the funeral of a guinea pig named Jelly... I could go on. It is the irony and absurdity of the situations in this film that make me laugh while at the same time I am able to relate.<br/><br/>This movie manages to deal with very dark subject matter while sitting directly on the line dividing comedy from drama, and it is this willingness to laugh at the absurdity of life's problems while still being sensitive to the pain they cause that allows this film to rise above the masses of quirky romantic comedies and self-important coming-of-age tales."

","Garden State Writer, director, and star Zach Braff puts a unique and compelling spin on the often retold tale of self-discovery in ""Garden State."" The movie starts with Andrew Largeman (Zach Braff) returning to his New Jersey home to pay his respects at his mother's funeral. He has been estranged from his family, friends, and New Jersey for nine years. The return to the Garden State sparks Andrew Largeman (Zach Braff) to take a vacation from sleepwalking through life in a numbness caused by lithium. The reason why Andrew Largeman was prescribed lithium and disappeared for nine years was because of a tragic accident that happened between his mother and him when he was a young boy. On the second day of being in New Jersey, Andrew meets Sam (Natalie Portman) over an unfortunate incident with a German Sheppard and they become fast friends. Throughout the rest of the movie bizarre incidences occur with old friends and Sam as Andrew rediscovers himself and the world without lithium.<br/><br/>The beginning of ""Garden State"" seems slow, because the plot and characters take a prolonged time to develop. For the first couple of minutes of the movie the main character, Andrew Largeman (Zach Braff), seems to be uncaringly going throughout his day and his character seems one dimensional. However, later on the viewer realizes that the development of Andrew Largeman (Zach Braff) is postponed until he is lithium free and returns to New Jersey. The character of Sam (Natalie Portman) is one of the most distinctive and exceptional characters I have seen in a movie recently. Sam's sense of unique adventure and lack of inhibitions presents her to seem as if she is a ten year old girl trapped in a twenty-some year old body. There is a great deal of chemistry between Sam and Andrew. The awkwardness of Sam and Andrew getting to know each other is extremely realistic, and shows how self-conscious people can be when they let a new person into their life. For example, when Andrew visits Sam's house for the first time, Sam keeps saying, ""Wow you are like totally freaked out right now. You are like just running for the door. It's okay you can leave,"" because Sam thinks that her living situation is so bizarre. Additionally, the character of Andrew's dad is very underdeveloped and boring, and he only shows up to talk about Andrew's health. Nevertheless, the rest of the characters are oddly fascinating, spending their days digging graves, being a fast food knight, and inventing silent Velcro. Overall, the characters of ""Garden State"" bring humor to the movie with their quirkiness and unpredictability.<br/><br/>""Garden State"" is often being praised for the wonderful compilation of songs that comprise its soundtrack. These songs are not only intrinsically excellent; additionally they fit the mood of the movie perfectly. For instance, at the beginning of the movie when Andrew Largeman is still sleepwalking miserably through life ""Don't Panic"" by Coldplay is playing. The overall sound of the music is fitting and the lyrics coupled with the events in the movie create a sense of irony. Chris Martin, the lead singer of Coldplay, is singing, ""We live in a beautiful world"" as Andrew Largeman (Zach Braff) is stuck in L.A. traffic, drives away from the gas pump with the handle still in his car, all while under lithium in a state of numbness that matches the melodic aspect of the song. The soundtrack is intrinsically fabulous, but when combined with the scenes of the movie it is a perfect match.<br/><br/>The characters and the plot of ""Garden State"" are extremely unique, and the music flows with the movie perfectly. ""Garden State"" puts a different twist on the traditional self-discovery tale for the age when many people are highly medicated on prescriptions like Zoloft, and Paxal, and lack their self-defining characteristics. However, through its different twist on the self-discovery tale ""Garden State"" still has mass relate ability, even for those non-medicated, because it is still simply a story of finding one's self. ""Garden State"" is worth the money and time it takes to watch it."

This is a unique movie, not because it has scenes or techniques or characters that have never been seen before, or because it's true to life (I doubt, by the way, this was Braff's intention), or because it portrays people in their twenties, or a place, or the effects of lithium. It doesn't portray anything but what Braff wanted to see happen on a screen, and to some (me included) it's an enjoyable experience. I didn't relate to this movie (or maybe I did and I find it hard to admit it) but it's not the point whether you relate.

","Fresh, tender, quirky and genuine, the adjectives just want to pour forth to describe this marvelous romantic comedy/coming-of-age story. First time writer-director Zach Braff also stars as Andrew, a 25 year old, marginally employed actor in LA who returns home to New Jersey for his mother's funeral.<br/><br/>Andrew hasn't been around his old friends or seen much of his father since he was sent off to boarding school at 16. Several disparate forces move Andrew now to rethink his life. The film concerns these developments that will reshape his future. The first, of course, is the death of Andrew's mother. We never meet her but learn that she had been rendered paraplegic years earlier, when she fell in the kitchen, after being pushed by an angry 9 year old Andrew.<br/><br/>Plagued by poorly controlled emotions after that (what kid wouldn't be?), Andrew was placed on medications to blunt his moods by his psychiatrist father (Ian Holm, in a minor role), and had remained emotionally numbed by meds for the past 15 years. He was dispatched to boarding school for the same reason, we also learn, to decompress the emotional angst in the family household. Amazingly, we are informed of Andrew's past without resort to a single flashback.<br/><br/>Dissatisfied with the course of his career and life in LA, Andrew decides to stop taking his mood stabilizing medication upon learning of his mother's death. Back in the suburb where he grew up, reunions with old chums now contribute to Andrew's unfolding self reappraisal.<br/><br/>More importantly, he meets Samantha  Sam (Natalie Portman), an inquisitive young woman who seems to care about and accept him from the getgo. In the end it is the budding romance with Sam that catalyses Andrew's resolve to change his life. But this could not have occurred without him freeing himself of the enormous burden of guilt for causing his mother's paralysis, a burden only made worse by his father's misguided ""treatment"" of Andrew's non-existent mood disorder and his virtual banishment from the family. He confronts his father about these matters in one of the film's more moving scenes.<br/><br/>Among several reasons why this film works so well, perhaps the most important is the lack of schmaltz. There is not a single note of over-the-top melodrama or pathos here. No shouting or screaming. We are never insulted by any belaboring of the obvious psychological nuances in play. <br/><br/>Braff writes with respect for the intelligence of his audience. Many little scenes and plot twists delight because they are unexpected gifts. The off key pop solo sung by Andrew's aunt at Mother's funeral. Various people living in odd circumstances. <br/><br/>One old buddy got rich selling his invention of soundless Velcro and now trundles down the corridors of his unfurnished McMansion in a golf cart. Another buddy, Mark (Peter Sarsgaard), sells jewelry he acquires in a highly unusual manner. Braff also writes simple yet refreshing dialogue, with plenty of offbeat humor, yet none of it is strained, nothing is played self-consciously for laughs.<br/><br/>Braff himself has a warm, easy-to-watch screen presence. He can say nothing during the lull in a conversation, while the camera remains focused on his face, and it feels right. Portman and Sarsgaard are also genuine, each wonderfully relaxed in their roles. Production design is superb: details in every scene are arranged well, and the photography, by Lawrence Sher, is - like the story and the acting  unpretentious, never distracting, tricky or cute. <br/><br/>This film never seems to manipulate us; instead it engages us, arouses our curiosity and amusement, bids us gently to care about Andrew and Sam and even Mark, leaving us entertained in the best sense. This movie is as confident, as secure in itself, as comforting, as a well worn pair of house slippers or your favorite reading chair. A splendid film. My rating: 8.5/10 (A-). (Seen on 09/09/04).

In all, a wonderfully moody, emotional, yet matter-of-fact take on the stuff that'll kill us if we let it.

","Garden State was a decent movie but didn't live up to the hype as being ""a voice for our generation"" or ""a modern version of The Graduate"" (as written by popular critics on RottenTomatoes). Garden State is one of those films you can either relate with or not. From reading other comments, if you can relate to Garden State, you'll find the most torturous and trivial reason(s) to like it.<br/><br/>I have several complaints about Garden State. First, the ending was too simplistic and commercialized; your typical ""chick flick"" tie-all-loose-ends happy ending. In addition, the romance between the main characters seemed to have materalized suddenly from thin air. Perhaps both were psychotic and similarity bred attraction. But using craziness to justify human behavior is often a short cut to avoid substance. And finally, there was a constant whine about psychological afflictions and dysfunctional families. Sure, these concepts were the engines that drove the human drama and conflicts in Garden State. But the film grasped and lingered to it far too long and often.<br/><br/>Still, Zach Braff should be commended for creating a very moody and uniquely emotional ambiance.

","Garden State is a movie that I have to watch again. Not because I like it so much, it's just that I can relate to this film. Zach Braff is great in this film. Personally, I think he should have been nominated for a Golden Globe. He's very funny and sad at the same time. When his mother passes away, he goes back to his hometown. There, he trys to talk to his dad, get to know his friends all over again and as a bonus, he meets a girl. That's the pin-point of the movie. When he meets Sam(Natile Portman), he first thinks this girl is out of her mind. But, as the film progresses, he starts to love her, and they become the best of friends. I can relate to Garden State all the way. The music in the film is great also. You have that felling of, your watching a documentary, because it seems so real. I'm going to rent this next week. If you want to watch a great film, Garden State is the film."

","The screenplay to this movie was so real I felt like someone had been listening in on my life. While the plot and cinematography was pleasantly artsy and out-there, all the dialog was breathtaking real and down to Earth. Zach Braff and Natalie Portman had good chemistry and their scenes' language was only topped by their amazing eye-contact. With a fabulous soundtrack that is my favorite CD of the year, this movie receives a 10. Well worth watching. If you liked Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind, you should see Garden State, and if you liked Garden State, definitely watch Eternal Sunshine. I'd heard mixed reviews about Garden State and wasn't sure I wanted to see it but I was so connected immediately into the movie by the interesting imagery, and very intriguing beginning. At one point I actually started crying, even though the movie isn't very sad, just because I felt like a movie had finally captured how most people feel and can never express."

I find it a touching story, and the characters really are well played. I think the beginning is a tad bit slow, but the movie gains ones interest as it goes on rather quickly. I found the end to be a little played out, that Largeman finds that he can not live without Sam before it's too late, but it doesn't ruin the movie too much. The soundtrack I think is absolutely perfect for the film, in a way you haven't really seen since the Brat Pack movies of the eighties. I gave it only a nine instead of a ten for the slow beginning and somewhat cliché end. Otherwise, it is quite perfect."

To be honest, I seriously thought the movie would be lousy when I first rented it, because of Braff's young age and writing/directing inexperience. But I could never have been more wrong. This is on of the best movies, if not THE best movie of the year. It's very refreshing, funny, and thoughtful. Garden State is a great film, that everyone should take the opportunity to view.

","I loved this film. There are so many different themes in it - romance, comedy, introspection, nature vs nurture, friendship, 'pick the rosebuds while ye may' - yet it does not come across as overly complicated. It definitely has a lot to offer those who like to watch cinema which makes them think, yet no-brainers can also enjoy it on a lighter level. It's certainly not high action or particularly fast moving, but if you like witty, funny, clever films then I can't recommend this highly enough.<br/><br/>SPOILERS HERE AFTER The scene where Sam tugs on her ear after running from the flaming arrows made me laugh so much I cried, and I was still laughing about it hours later. The morning after scene waking up to see the guy dressed in Knights Armour was another one which left me sore in the stomach with laughter. Then the touching scenes with his father and with Sam at the airport were so beautiful, and who hasn't felt at some point that they just want to scream into a great abyss?? I have bought the DVD and highly recommend watching the film at some point with Zach and Natalie's commentary playing. Not only is their conversation highly entertaining, but Zach shares a multitude of information about incidents in his life where the ideas came from for certain scenes as well as the usual 'how we made it' info."

I know that in the past 15 years we have been numbing minds with antidepressants and ritalin, but other than that, this person's standing on the edge of the abyss of adulthood, dealing with his past, his friends who never grew up and a kooky free spirited love interest is not very original. The music, very cool, but I am sick to death already with the scoring of movies with pop songs to tell you what the script is lacking. Why not just have maroon 5 write your script and get it over with?? And the catch phrases...ugh. ""Good luck exploring the infinite abyss"" rain, scream, kiss, cut.

","I'm frankly astounded that so many people on IMDb have given ""Garden State"" this high a rating. It was not widely distributed, and it is decidedly not mainstream. It's difficult to describe as ""fun"" a film in which the principal character, played by Zach Braff (who is also the author/director), is addicted to anti-depressants; has the weirdest set of friends to be encountered anywhere this side of an asylum; has come home to bury his mother and eventually to have a heart-to-heart with his psychiatrist father; and who doesn't begin to recover his footing until he comes into contact with another strange little creature played by Natalie Portman and eventually falls in love with her and she with him. So I won't say the movie is ""fun"" or even ""endearing,"" a phrase someone else applied. What I'd call it is an engaging, odd-angled take on the road to maturity taken by a damaged young man and a lovely, if slightly deranged young woman. Braff is very good as the young man and Natalie Portman is ""adorable."" I use that word advisedly because it suggests that she's kind of a soft and cuddly little doll who you could easily imagine loving if you were the age of Braff's character. I wish, however, that some director would take the trouble to teach Natalie Portman to enunciate clearly enough so that she can be understood at all times. She tends to swallow words and even whole sentences so that they are unintelligible. Her ""adorableness"" has made her a star and she will survive on her adorableness for a time; but if she hopes to become an actress some day, she needs to concentrate on the words she's supposed to be saying."
"badrash9284","8","0","1","23 October 2005"," Near Perfect
","""Garden State"" is the kind of near-perfect treasure of a movie that you want to hug and never let go. Not only is there unmeasured poignancy in the journey Large goes through to reclaim a hold on his life, and a transcendent love story between Large and Sam, and a wholly unpredictable plot trajectory to what occurs, and how things happen, but, technically speaking, one would never be able to guess this is a low-budget independent feature. The use of songs, much like 2004's ""The Girl Next Door,"" are a vital character in and of themselves, with choice tracks by such important artists as Nick Drake, Coldplay, The Shins, and Frou Frou, the latter of whom's ""Let Go"" masterfully underscores the sublime final scene. Likewise, the resplendent, classy cinematography by Lawrence Shin (2004's ""Club Dread"") attracts and fulfills through its meticulous use of long shots and different film speeds; each one evokes a different mood, and each mood aids in putting the viewer right alongside the characters in their various surroundings. ""Garden State"" is a beaming, unforgettable little masterpiece, creatively alive and emotionally intimate at the same time. For Zach Braff, this is just the first of what now promises to be an encouraging film-making career, and for 2004, this is easily one of the year's finest motion pictures."

","When I look through the other comments on this movie, I find one REALLY REALLY negative one for fifteen REALLY REALLY positive ones. The truth is, the movie in its entirety is neither that good nor that bad. It's just unusual in that it's REALLY REALLY good for the first 1-1 1/2 hours, and then it takes a sharp turn for REALLY REALLY bad. The majority of ""Garden State"" is exactly what a great movie should be - visually stunning, a wonderful blend of the surreal and the ironically humorous, great characters, believable and touching. However, the last twenty minutes or so it becomes such sniveling slop that it can, and has ruined the whole movie for some, (not me, I actually own the movie and just disregard all the melodramatic crap). If you think that you're a person that can appreciate seeing Natalie Portman slobber all over herself as she's crying for the last three minutes of the movie and the super-dramatic moment at the very end when Zach Braff returns to her without getting on a plane back to California, if you think you can endure the rambling speech about him feeling something or other and not knowing what's going to happen next, but looking forward to it, then by all means, watch the movie to the end. If you are not a person who likes clichés and melodrama, then turn the movie off just as they are getting to the Bottomless Abyss, you'll miss the scene when Largeman says to the keeper of the hole in the ground, ""Good luck exploring the Bottomless Abyss,"" and the keeper, full of pathos, replies, ""HEY!... You too..."""

","Andrew Largeman (Zack)is a man that just simply exist and does not live. Ever since a rather substantial happening in his childhood he has been on medication and estranged from his family. When his mother dies he ventures home and suddenly finds himself back in the places and time frame he left. It is here that he meets Sam (Portman). She is a utterly charming and quirky character. They get drawn towards each other and start to unravel their purpose and meaning of life. Zack Braff has written a really good story, but I feel that he should not have cast himself as the lead. Fair enough that apathy is a big part of his character but he is out shown by the other actors in all regards. Especially by Natalie Portman that is truly awesome and aspiring. Watch it, and if you want to see an adult view on relationship check out the stunning ""Closer"" also featuring Ms.Portman."

It has the best soundtracks I have ever heard of so far!! One more thing that makes this movie different from others movie is that it shows with great finesse that it is not an obligation that that should be some sexual scene just because there is a leading actress and actor!

I am amazed that Zach Brach wrote and directed it. I find him to be amazing. He is calculated in all his moves which makes his somewhat odd features attractive.He has his own style that is distinctly him. <br/><br/>I listened to the writers comments after the movie (you can do that with DVD's) and he said that his mother, whom he is close with, (another reason I like him) is a psychologist. Maybe that is where he gets the mind he has to write as he did. He did not make the movie for just entertaining, he put real life into it. I was also impressed about something else too. The girl he made the movie with (forget her real name__my friend mean Natalie Portman-for sure she is better than in ""Closer"") wanted to do the bedroom scene with details. She kept begging him to do a sex scene but, he did not want to.(Bet he was tempted to!) He wanted it just as he had it where the camera pans in on them after the fact as they are covered in the sheets sleeping. He felt that sex scenes take the viewer out of the story and he wanted to avoid that.Give that man a medal!! He will never get the right recognition for that, but I think that was very beautiful and sensitive and of a higher creativity to choose what he did. He was so ""Not typical.""<br/><br/>I like the fact that the they got intimate with their hearts first.

","Garden State is Zach Braff's (J.D. on the NBC show ""Scrubs"") directorial debut, and I must say, he did a wonderful job of creating what we think is a silly pointless comedy, but then blossoms into a great romance story with the quirkiest of characters.<br/><br/>Braff plays Andrew Largeman, who takes more medication than I thought legally possible, and due to this, Andrew is ultimately incapable of emotion. In fact, in one part, he says that he hasn't cried in 9 years. After his mother's death, Andrew returns to his New Jersey hometown (hence ""Garden State"") for her funeral. His father, Gideon, (Ian Holm) is also his psychiatrist, meaning his father is the reason Andrew has been on umpteen million meds since he was 9 years old. He reunites with his old high school buddy Mark (Peter Sarsgaard), who is ironically a gravedigger/graverobber who is burying Andrew's mother. The day after the funeral (the scene about the night before is funny as hell), Andrew heads to another doctor, and decides to get his recent series of headaches checked out. While waiting, he meets a young girl named Sam (Natalie Portman), who is by far the quirkiest girl I've ever seen. They begin to talk, and then after the appointment, (another hilarious scene in which the supporting character owns) Andrew gives her a lift home (in one of the funniest looking motorbikes ever). As the movie goes on, Andrew and Sam become friends, and Mark is involved in making sure Andrew doesn't lose his bad side. The ending, in which Andrew cries for the first time in a while, is very sweet that should make anyone's heart melt. This is definitely a movie to see with your girlfriend or boyfriend, or husband or wife. The acting is great. Zach Braff portrays his character to the highest level, making him numb, funny, and sweet (three very opposite words). Natalie Portman is at her best playing the quirky, yet well intentioned Sam, and Peter Sarsgaard is very likable as comic relief. Easily a classic.<br/><br/>10/10"

","I watched this on the recommendation of a friend and was blown away by the talent exhibited by Zach Braff in his first ever film in which he writes, directs and stars. <br/><br/>I was caught by how well he depicted the life of a drugged out depressive, untouching and untouchable. Andrew Largeman, played by Braff, is a lost soul indeed, blamed for the paralysis of his mother years earlier in a freak accident and burdened with an unemotional, distant psychiatrist father, beautifully played by Ian Holm. <br/><br/>Natalie Portman plays the love interest Sam, herself a little set back from the world and wrestling with her own demons. How these two connect is the crux of the story but along the way we meet the grave-digging (and robbing) Mark played by Peter Sarsgaard and many more interesting side stories and characters, too many to mention here.<br/><br/>If there were any faults to find it would be in the quick recovery Andrew has from the huge amounts of prescribed drugs he ingests (he goes cold turkey from them, it seems) and in the unfortunate tacked on ending. <br/><br/>The original ending, which felt better, must not have fared well in tester audiences. We do love our soppy endings. A lovely movie overall. <br/><br/>I look forward to more from Meister Braff. 8 out of 10."

","I am worthy to give Garden State my applause and my two thumbs up. Zach Braff delicately wrote and directed this film in such away that parallels the lining of both comic realism and dramatic intensity- he doesn't bore you, but however, convinces you into the film- now, tell me what many comedies can do that? <br/><br/>Although this film proves that indie-comedy (Lost In Translation,Royal Tenenbaums,Eternal Sunshine, American Beauty,The Life Aquatic,Sideways, Napoleon Dynamite, Secretary...etc)is much ahead of the mega-hits that dominate the box office charts annually,because of their golden classic touch and millennium appeal; Garden State has proved not only that it has surpassed other films that have failed incessantly to speak to our generation (Igby Goes Down, American Pie) but it has also shaped a linear way for low rated comedies to come out of the corner and into the light just as The Graduate, did for the comedies of the 60's and Annie Hall did for Comedies of the 70's .Although this film didn't garner any Oscar nominations, it did page a way for comedy to be more considered of an Art instead of as an illicit Hollywood machine to garner audience appeal.I mean this film takes the Sofia Coppola/Charlie Kauffman image of light comedic portrayal and blows it on a full dial in order to detail this sincere motion picture into something of an opus. <br/><br/>All i can say is, that if you are a fan of the subtle-comic scene in which Maggie Gyllenhaal,Scarlet Johansson and Zooey Deschanel are fighting for the homecoming crown, and where Bill Murray happens to be the Geology Teacher (taking you underwater and to Tokyo)then vote for Zach Braff to be Homecoming King(Dustin Hoffman, you're free to go)- because he'll turn high school into something somewhat of, well, a Garden State.

A narrative, wrapped around a 26 year old Jewish actor returning home to his family and town to attend his mother's funeral, wallows in the depths of the infinite abyss on the edge of existentialism. Existentialism, in which each unique individual defines their own meaning for life, or meaning for existence in a cold uncaring world, becomes the back-drop to this yarn. Yet where The Graduate was suspenseful and culturally taboo, Garden State is, in contrast,tame and subdued. I write this review right after my first viewing of this feature. Maybe GS grows on the audience. Maybe its domesticity is an intentional mirroring of the bland and blah'se. Maybe I am getting old. Maybe I see too much of myself in the protagonist. The question I kept asking myself was, ""do I really care about these people, this character?"" I kept thinking, ""man, i heard so much goodness about this film. there's got to be something here."" I recalled advertisements of the scene in the quarry, and when they finally arrived there i thought, ""oh, another setting born within the story like recurring swear words and non-orthogonal visuals."" Yes there is some cleverness here. Yes there is a soundtrack here. Yes Natalie Portman is here and swearing and looking very cute. Do we need Soderbergh slow-mos of our crew en-route to ""the piece?"" finally the last moments of the film take us back to the beginning (from which we woke from); but now at the payphone, and ""what do we do now?"" My guess is Zach Braff has more in store for the western world. The young actor/writer/director combo is quite rare, though this film is no Citizen Kane. Joshua Miller's ""Mao Game"" comes to mind and may have been more successful. I think this film more than accomplished the inferred goal of saying, ""hey Hollywood, your films are not so great, i'm young and i'm gonna make a film, and exercise my talent, and maybe make some money, and this is what it was like growing up in new jersey, and doesn't queen amidala look so nice without all that make-up and costuming...(ellipsis)"" Yet I didn't notice where a nuance was, if there was one intended. In the meantime,like the state of a garden, I'll let it grow on me.<br/><br/>p.s. from the second scene through the end i kept thinking this was what ferris buellers day off may have been like for alan ruck without broderick hip-mate. food for thought"

My best friend and i watched it on a Saturday night while eating pizza and giggling over some of the nicest scenes we've seen in a movie in so long.

","The beauty of this film is that it's stylish without being slick, managing to deal with heavy themes without leaving you feeling submerged.<br/><br/>The main character is Andrew Largeman, played by Zach Braff. Andrew has the potential to have a great life. He's attractive and he's gained modest success as an actor. Yet he lives a dull, loveless L.A. existence working at a menial job while waiting for his next big role.<br/><br/>Sound grim? Like this movie itself shows us, it's not the situation but how we look at it. When his mother suddenly dies, Andrew has to face an awkward situation where the thing he dreads most,emotion,threatens to overwhelm him. He's forced to return to his hometown for her funeral, which he hasn't visited in ten years. He avoids his father in favor of reconnecting with past friends, the personalities of which range from zany to sterile. Most outstanding to Andrew is a love interest named Samantha, or Sam, who helps him confront his fears and awaken to new possibilities.The dialogue and actions of the cast provide some of the most rewarding comic moments I've seen since There's Something About Mary. Yet this is no farce. This movie is thick with meaning, but it's served on the side instead of square on the plate. <br/><br/>As with any movie that's true to the contemporary Hollywood and slacker lifestyle, as explored in this movie, there are a few clichés. These include some drugs and a hot, unconventional leading-female. Director and writer Zach Braff (of TV's Scrubs) embrace these elements with original angles to keep us from getting deja vu while watching it. This film is best suited to Gen-X and Y'ers who can still see things from new perspectives."
"ajrocks13","10","0","1","2 September 2005"," A down to earth masterpiece, from a truly great film maker
","Garden State tells the story of Andrew 'Large' Largeman, an aspiring actor in L.A, who returns to his hometown in New Jersey for his mums funeral. Returning home means confronting his father, the main reason for his 9 year absence. As long as he can remember he has been on medication, which practically numbs him of any real emotion, for the first time, on the trip home, he goes without, and with the help of old friends(Sarsgaard), and quirky character Sam (Portman) he opens himself to life's experiences.<br/><br/>Zach Braff did an outstanding job in creating what, for me, was the best cult film of the year and possibly the decade. Forget slap stick humour, hugely melodramatic romance scenes or unbelievable special effects. This movie is about people, the way we effect each other and can change. The great thing is that it is so easy to relate to these characters, particularly Andrew(Braff). It is so often that we watch movies where we simply look at the characters, in Garden state we become part, we go through the struggles and experiences with Braff's character. The chemistry between Braff and Portman's characters is pleasing to watch and the script makes for an enjoyable, funny and real experience. Zach Braff wrote, directed and starred in Garden state and performed amazingly on all counts.<br/><br/>The movie is supported by an amazing soundtrack, also compiled by Braff, including great songs by The Shins, Zero 7 and Colin Hay. If you haven't seen this film and you enjoy any type of romance, drama or comedy, this is one to watch. An official selection at the Sundance Film Festival and a definite addition to my DVD collection."

","OK, it sounds really cheesy, but the movie made such a great an impression on me that I decided for the first time ever to leave a review on IMDb. Just saw the movie and I am under the spell. So simple and yet so powerful. It is actually hard to put a finger on what makes this movie so unique. If you summarize the plot it doesn't sound that impressive: a guy returning to his hometown after many years of absence tries to reconcile with his family, fight the inner demons and find love. Sounds a bit trivial, no? But the movie is captivating from the very first shots. Somehow the director (I really have to check this guys out!) managed to keep the story so fresh, so honest, so authentic, that it leaves you breathless. You feel like you live through those few days that the main character spends in the town yourself. Unbelievable soundtrack - captivating, haunting, especially the first song by Coldplay. Amazing performances by the lead actors contribute to the wholesomeness of the picture (have to add, though, that Portman's character annoyed me a bit in the beginning)."

The begging of the film starts off exciting, and as you get into it, you experience all these different emotions like - happiness, sadness, pity, joy, etc. Zach did a great job directing this film, i hope i see more of his work in the near future.

However, it does not impede the flow of the movie, and the on-screen chemistry between Zach Braff and Natalie Portman is amazing. Though not your typical coming-of-age or love-at-first-sight story, the viewer will definitely find as many scenes hilarious as they find scenes very strange.<br/><br/>In the end, the viewer is left with a favorable viewpoint on life, I guess you can call this movie an unlikely uplifting tale. I've now seen the film twice, and it was much better the second time that I saw it.

","This is such a spectacular movie. Zach Braff is a creative genius. The writing, directing, and acting are all phenomenal. Natalie Portman does an excellent job of making you fall in love with her. It is an amazing combination of comedy and romance. Often when movies try to do both, the transition between the two is jolting and just doesn't work at all. Not so for Garden State. The writing flows seamlessly throughout the entire thing, and you just get the feeling that every line is exactly perfect for that point in the movie. The film truly captures the essence of the mid-20s, indie music, Prozac-nation culture. Speaking of music, the soundtrack alone is amazing, and coupled with the movie, the experience is just intense. I cannot gush enough about this film. If you have not yet seen this film, you must do so now. Put this as your top priority. Seriously."
"mraseelak-1","9","0","2","22 August 2005"," Wasting my time in the waiting line...
","This line from the song ""In the waiting line"" by Zero 7 pretty much sums up what the young generation is feeling, and this is what Zach Braff has managed to capture in his debut film, Garden State. The protagonist, Andrew Largeman (played by Zach Braff) has spent almost all his life under the mind numbing effects of lithium. When he comes home for his mother's funeral he decides to take a vacation from his old life in all sense, from his crummy job as a waiter and from his lithium induced fog. Along the way he meets Sam, played brilliantly by Natalie Portman, who breathes life into him.<br/><br/>What makes this movie work is the fact that all emotions are understated, no explosions of rage, or slapstick comedy. Everything is subtle... like the scene where he wears the shirt made by his aunt that matches his bathroom wall, or where he describes love to Sam sitting in the bathtub.<br/><br/>Another thing about this movie is the music, its like a mixed tape someone would make, having all his favorite songs of different moods...<br/><br/>All in all I give it a nine because it was kind of slow in the beginning. May be Zach Braff wanted to show how detached Andrew Largeman was from his life in the beginning but i felt that it was too slow. even after this little bit of nitpicking I would recommend it to anyone in a heart beat..."
"luludavis","10","0","2","20 August 2005"," Great writing, directing and acting!
","This film is great in its scope of subjects that it touches upon. This film is very similar to Harold and Maude, Ice Storm and Six Feet Under(among others) in its treatment of so-called ""bad"" or ""dark"" themes like death, suicide, accidents and insanity. Its also funny which keeps it from being totally morbid. Zach Braff is a young genius in his ability to write and direct a film that assembles such a great story that has so many moments of mystery and revelation to it. The sense of place(home), location(New Jersey) as well as the use of an awesome soundtrack. The emotions of these characters are honest and raw. It is a film for this current generation like The Big Chill, The Breakfast Club and Less Than Zero were for past generations. The cast is superb. Natalie Portman shows that she is the best actor in her age group. Peter Sargaard shows that he is perfect in roles allow him to be engaging and frightening simultaneously (see Shattered Glass). Anne Dowd is good in the supporting role of the bizarre head of a bizarre family. And Ian Holm is brilliant as usual. This film stands out in sharp contrast to any film made in the last few years. I highly recommend watching this movie, renting it and owning the DVD."

","I liked the trailer. A few days later we were standing in front of the cinema, and having narrowed down the choice to two titles that did not entirely scare us off, flipped a coin. In retrospect, I am glad the coin did not land on the Star Wars side that day, but instead sent us to watch Garden State. We watched Star Wars anyway the next evening, but would we have returned for Garden State, a film we'd never really heard anything about?<br/><br/>Consequently, we did not expect much of this film. We went to see it with only a faint idea of what to expect. Maybe this is partly why I loved the film so much. I was positively surprised. Who'd have expected to find such a pleasant film, suddenly and unannounced? I enjoyed it, it made me feel good and in the end I left the cinema thinking that I'd be getting the DVD for sure.<br/><br/>Maybe there are clichés in there. I don't care. I don't watch a lot of movies like that. I don't switch off as soon as I encounter a cliché. As long as the film makes sense in itself, all is well. And Garden State did just that. Maybe some people find such main characters, who consider their lives empty and who don't know what's important anymore, to be annoying. I guess I kind of agree. It only really annoys me, though, if the idea is executed poorly. In Garden State, I didn't mind. The main character seemed believable and likable to me - and who cares if his problems aren't 100% unique? Are real persons' worries always 100% unique? This is as unique as it gets. Andrew Largeman's story is complex enough without becoming too unlikely.<br/><br/>Garden State did what really very little films managed. It came from nowhere and jumped straight onto my list of favourite movies, despite me not caring about the genre at all.<br/><br/>We went the cinema impressed, also, by the actors' performances. Especially Natalie Portman had fascinated us. Her uninteresting role in Star Wars, which we watched the next day, made us appreciate Garden State even more. Star Wars could have fooled me, but Garden State made me realize Natalie Portman is a great actress. <br/><br/>Give this film a chance, definitely."

Garden State is a travel in small, small things that linked together bring the movie's characters closer and closer to happiness.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman is absolutely amazing in this movie.

","Admitted: I love 'Scrubs', which was the main reason I bought this movie. I wasn't disappointed. But, boy, was I surprised and a little shocked by the calm acceptance of the drugging going on amidst 20 somethings of all socio-economic classes. The drug party, at which Zaff takes an Ecstasy pill with a happy face on it, really alarmed me. Perhaps it's because my youth involved high octane acid and heroin trips for many who never came back from them, physically and/or mentally. I therefore have a real repugnance for the pills, prescribed such as Zaff had been on since childhood (ZOLOFF, Valium, etc.) or illegal such as he and others partied on (Ecstacy, pot, cocaine). Whether he meant to make the point or not, the segue from legal to illegal pills wasn't hard to make. Uncle Sam makes money off one, not from the other.....all lethal.<br/><br/>I suppose the airplane disaster we saw in the beginning with people screaming and airbags coming down from the ceiling was supposed to contrast with the quite calm scene of people preparing for take-off in the last scenes......showing Zaff's progress from zombied pill-taker to someone facing life unmedicated.<br/><br/>I couldn't help compare the grave-diggers, one stealing jewelry from a coffin, with the gravedigger in 'Hamlet'. This guy was also very philosophical, living his Bonged loser life, but hoping to cash in on his investment of 'Persian Gulf' playing cards.<br/><br/>The three mothers in this movie also played interesting roles: one a druggie along with her son, going to AA meetings stoned; another the wonderfully wacky and compassionate mother of Sam who had adopted one of Sally Struther's orphans in the 70s, who now lives with them while attending Dartmouth (in a lower-class house, complete with pet cemetery), and of course, the dead mother of Zaff. Was it suicide in the bathtub? I still don't know.<br/><br/>I loved the movie, and especially enjoyed the emphasis by several of the characters (Sam, and the custodian of the 'eternal abyss') on being unique, doing unique things, making life something more than corporate robothood, which so many of us have endured for far too long.<br/><br/>Of course, listening to the commentary by Zaff and Portman on the DVD made it even more enjoyable. Now I still have to go see the scenes they cut out, and the commentary by others involved in the movie with more film-making experience, to get their take. I think this guy's a genius. With 2 sets of parents, 3 of whom are psychologists, he has a unique perspective with which to view our much-therapied, over-medicated society. Is that where society's conscience has gone?"

","Garden State is excellent. It's funny in a mature kind of way. The scene with the dog in the doctor's office is classic. It's not distasteful, just very funny because it could happen to anybody. Sam lights up the screen from the very beginning with her silly giggle while the dog is trying to take care of business on Andrew's leg. Clever, for instance Sam ""swears"" she thought Andrew was retarded... She's great! <br/><br/>Genuinely a very well written story, script along with an excellent cast for today's likings. Kudos Zach, you have a lot of talent that I hope takes you far in the film industry. Andrew Largeman is just a normal guy but isn't too sure about himself, as he's pretty aware of his surroundings. Natalie Portman is a gem and she is as adorable as ever. Peter Sarsgaard is always calm, cool & collected. Or just always stoned? <br/><br/>Garden State is definitely one of my favorites.

From the beginning dive into Largeman's (Braff) mind, the audience is presented with a glimpse of the movie's unique style. There are not enough movies out there with this sort of intellectual depth. Not only is it well written, but it is also well acted, and executed. The soundtrack also mirrors the movies profound direction, and statement. The movie can simply trigger something n one's mind that is overly calming and ultimately enlightening. I have watched the film numerous times, and the subtle tragedy and humor contrast with each other.

Then there are the cheaply made gems that no one wants to make, they some how sneak through the filter of Hollywood and make it to our screens. Last year was a golden year because there were two brilliant ones, Napoleon Dynamite and Garden state. Both of them had exceptional un-orthodox scripts, brilliant comedy and unforgettable scenes. Movies I could watch over and over again. Garden state is a movie any self respecting 20 something person should see, and for the rest of you, if you like irony and sarcasm with no comic book characters this is the place to go. It's so refreshing to see a young film maker use his own un orthodox script.

","My wife thought she enjoyed the film. Then she changed her mind after talking to me. I was absolutely bored out of my mind. I haven't the faintest idea what people got out of this movie, or why it is in the top 250??? Being a huge film buff and watching everything from action and comedy, to dramatic, foreign and independent films, covering almost every decade of the last century, I feel like I have seen enough movies to know what makes a great movie: if I can watch a film over and over again and always experience the same level of enjoyment (I call it rewatchability), superb acting, unique or solid story line, script with crisp and witty dialog, and if the film sparks any emotion inside of me at all. I feel like critics are now being bribed by Hollywood in order to help their industry, especially when rating films like this so highly. The highest bidder gets The best critic (hint:he wears glasses) or a major critic, 2nd place gets a major paper, third gets a TV critic, etc. If you can pay the minimum $20,000, you can get an online magazine or radio show to give you a stellar review (watch a commercial for a film that's about to be released and see how many radio shows and online critics give these films great reviews. Sometimes they use 2-3 quotes from the same critic). Due to the gross amount of overrated films I regret wasting my time watching lately because of the rave reviews critics are giving terrible films, I'd rather take Helen Keller's opinion than modern day critics.<br/><br/>Whatever's happening, its definitely convinced our movie going society and the Academy's voters to lower its expectations dramatically (not in most cases, but in the last few years, you have to agree that some people who took home statues have been so undeserving), and it irritates me to no end. I can't find a single reason why I would want to watch this film again. Granted, there were some funny moments, like waking up after the party and seeing a fully dressed knight, or shooting arrows straight into the air with your rich friend who can't furnish a house to save his life. But I wasn't interested in the main story at anytime.<br/><br/>The acting was completely lacking of passion and felt forced. I think Natalie Portman is the most overrated actress in Hollywood. A darling, beautiful, talented woman, but she hasn't made too many good movies since Leon aka the Professional. And wow! Talk about Method Man's cameo! Academy award winning stuff right there! I'm glad his TV show on Fox is doing well. And Ian Holm turns in what could be the only performance where his main motivation must have been ""act boring."" And the director, writer and star should stick to just acting. His ""vision"" was clouded and it seemed to be a-typical directing, nothing out of the ordinary or exciting. I didn't feel anything for any of the characters (except for maybe the hamster or guinea pig that died). Could someone please explain to me why you thought the film was so spectacular? Or let me suggest this, try watching this film and others like it without Prozac. Sound like an idea?"
"scarlettmines","6","0","3","27 July 2005"," Alright for a debut, but lacking a lot.
","This movie has a lot of hype surrounding it and has fast become a favourite amongst the young adults. I can see why this is. Zach Braff has used popular music from indie bands and has written a story that is very appealing to young audiences.<br/><br/>But when it comes to actually looking at the film in terms of directing, acting, script- writing and whatever other ingredients are needed to make a good movie- the film just manages to make it over the line.<br/><br/>Firstly, the directing is extremely mediocre, but that is understandable considering Braff's experience and this being his first film. There are some scenes (in particular one in which Braff is sitting on a couch as the night passes by him) which seem like they are only there to make it look like he can direct, as if to say ""this is a creative way of filming a scene, look at my talent!!"" Secondly, the acting is as great as it is made out to be. But as least Zach Braff can admit that about himself. When it comes to Natalie Portman she does not give her best performance. Her voice is whiny and she over acts a lot. Ian Holm is ordinary and his talent could be used in finer movies. Peter Sarsgaard is pretty good, bringing about a lively spirit to the film.<br/><br/>Then comes the story and the script. The story basically follows the life of Andrew Largeman (Braff) as he goes back to his hometown for a funeral and he sees how his friends have changed and how the town has changed.. boy meets girl.. you know the rest. Personally, I didn't find the story that riveting, it was alright but the fact that I didn't really like the characters much brought down the film a lot. The script isn't all that wonderful either. Characters come into the film and you never see them again. Even though that is breaking the boundaries of usual script writing (which I like) it is annoying when you are introduced to someone and you never see them again.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie is something that you see once and forget. It's not as brilliant as it's made out to be (and really does not deserve the 8 star rating it has on IMDb!). It's an average movie that might be worth seeing if you are a fan of indie bands, the actors involved, or just something to fill time."

","""Garden State"" is one of those films that you see on a whim, and immediately recognize as something meant exactly for you. As a twenty-something disaffected youth, Zach Braff's bittersweet portrayal of a homecoming for a troubled character spoke to me probably more than it might someone older. I was genuinely surprised how good this movie was.<br/><br/>But why is it a ""failure"", you ask? It's not that the film fails to convey its message of acceptance and angst. It's just that I'm not sure the message was the right one.<br/><br/>Andrew Largeman returns home to attend the funeral of his mother, whose paralysis he reportedly caused while still a young child. Feared as a danger by his father, he has been on various drugs since he was ten years old. Now back in town after a brief glimpse of his unsuccessful life in LA as a struggling actor, Largeman finds himself in the midst of old friends whose lives have turned out even worse, and a new one whose life connects with his own.<br/><br/>The movie works in spite of some very ""film student"" moments (such as the final scene between Largeman and his father, a very understated Ian Holm) because you start to care for Andrew as his fog is lifted and he finally begins a real life. The romance with Sam (Natalie Portman) is never predictable. You knew it was coming if you saw the poster for the movie, but you don't know the way in which they react to one another. A previous commentator remarked how Portman finally gets to show off the charm that she possessed in earlier roles, and I concur. You can't tell me you wouldn't fall in love with a girl like Sam if you just randomly met her.<br/><br/>The failure is in the message of the film, which either seems to be rebelling against the funk that most of the characters find themselves in, or casually accepting it. I couldn't really tell which version Braff was trying to convey. There's a sense that he's being honest to what most twenty-somethings do when trapped in a small-town existence. I know myself people like the ones in the film, people whose lives revolve around the next party or the next opportunity to get high. In a small town, drugs are pretty much a crutch which keeps you from trying for a real life, imho. Braff manages to convey that disconnect from reality most effectively in a montage of speeded-up partying.<br/><br/>I think most of the characters stumble around in a chemical fog much like Largeman's, a point that I missed the first time around. It doesn't hurt that he takes an interest in the very lovely Natalie Portman.<br/><br/>Overall, the film has many faults, but it works on charm enough to make it a repeat viewing staple for disillusioned youth. I think Braff does go a little overboard in the styles he tries to incorporate, but he manages to make a good film despite it. And the soundtrack is a standalone masterpiece in and of itself. I don't know that this will attain ""The Graduate"" status, but it certainly has a good start as a cult flick worth discussing long into the night."
"cherold","7","0","1","22 July 2005"," sharply observed and funny
","Zach Braff's first feature is quite impressive, funny, original and surely directed. The film is especially impressive in the early scenes that establish Ancrew's distanced isolation from the rest of the world. The movie manages to shift from comedy to drama easily. And Portman gives one of her patented charming performances as one of those sweet, quirky but only mildly neurotic girls who are so much easier to find in movies than in real life.<br/><br/>But while it is a very good movie, I felt it lost emotional resonance towards the end. This is most striking in the final scene between Andrew and his dad, which should feel like a summation of emotional themes in the movie but instead feels like something that just wasn't sufficiently set up. The problem may be that I liked Andrew but never felt that strongly invested in his life. I can't really point to anything specific and say, this should have been done different, I just should have felt more in the last 15 minutes of this movie than I did. Still, well worth watching."

"jmille42","9","0","1","16 July 2005"," one of my favorite films of 2004
","In one of my favorite films of 2004, Zach Braff (Televisions Scrubs) writes, directs and stars in Garden State. Braff is Andrew Largeman, an unsuccessful actor who returns home to New Jersey for his mother's funeral. A childhood accident, in which he paralyzed his mother, has his psychiatrist father (Ian Holm) keep him heavily medicated. An emotionally closed off young man, he reunites with childhood friends and family as he takes a ""vacation"" from the sedated and secluded life he leads in Hollywood.<br/><br/>Braff shows great promise as one of the up and coming storytellers in the business today. He has a great eye for symbolism which can be easily compared to legendary Mike Nichols, whose projects include The Graduate and Closer.<br/><br/>This ""dramedy"" has so many scenes that can either bring a smile to your face or a tear to your eye. With the aid of an all-star cast, which includes Natalie Portman and Peter Sarsgaard, Braff pulls off a low budget success that will bring back memories of Benjamin Braddock from The Graduate. Putting so much on line, primarily his name, Braff shows great versatility which pays off in this funny drama."
"George-441","9","0","1","13 July 2005"," Deep Inspiring Coming of Age Movie
","Many ""coming of age"" movies follow trite formulaic plots. Immature male or female is portrayed as misunderstood or depressed in a frequently obnoxious environment with uncaring or uncomprehending parents. Through a series of events the young person meets disillusionment, loses his or her innocence and gains maturity. This plot is true of everything from Risky Business to Porky's.<br/><br/>All the more remarkable then that a young actor/director should have the maturity, perspective and creative vision to put out a remarkable film, entertaining for people who are long past ""coming of age"" ( like 45 year olds for instance) and are slipping towards the other age- old.<br/><br/>This film has Natalie Portman in a truly wonderful performance as an eccentric and alive young woman who pulls the main character ""Large"" out of the catatonic stupor he has been in. In the process she comes to terms with her own feelings of inadequacy and strangeness.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is great and the setting of the Garden State ""New Jersey"" shows the state as it really is, not like the caricature of the state in the opening credits of the Sopranos.<br/><br/>A film worth seeing again."

","I had heard a lot of stuff about this movie before I went to see it, and lucky me the outdoor cinema in my city showed this piece about a week ago. I'm a great fan of Zach Braff and his acting in the 'Scrubs' series, and he didn't disappoint me this time either. Worthy to mention is his acting, who is quite different here and I perceive his role as a bit complex. But he completes his task well here, no doubt about it. Natalie Portman is great as well, and that in combination with Zach just makes this piece really good. The tension and atmosphere throughout the whole movie seemed a bit weird to me, but in a good and very original way.<br/><br/># START OF POSSIBLE SPOILER # <br/><br/>I was a bit confused though, that the movie is, at least to me - pointless. But this is nothing that ruins the movie, oh no, but this is just not the everyday Hollywood movie (the guy loses the chick, makes everything to get her back and despite his foolish acts he succeeds in the end - then kissing screen and then the credits roll). The ending is sort of neat after all, but it's more of the kind that has to grow onto you and you have to let it melt in order to fully appreciate the piece and to complete the deep dive into the 'Garden State'.<br/><br/># END OF POSSIBLE SPOILER # <br/><br/>Great movie, see this if you get the chance to!"
"superwarfish","9","0","1","11 July 2005"," Different, and very good because of it.
","For starters, let's just admit that this film will not be everyone's cup of tea. True, there has yet to be a film made that appeals to every demographic, and Garden State itself does not tick every box. For example, if you are the type of person who rates a film by 1) the number of explosions, 2) the death count and 3) just how many witticisms Big Arnie can crack off in between, this film is not for you. If however, you can take to a film that has an unarmed protagonist then you may just be in for a very enjoyable couple of hours. Garden State is one of those fantastic films that, by blockbuster standards, seem to be driven by a whole lot of nothing. There is no comet hurtling toward earth, no serial killer on the loose, and no super villains in underground lairs. What there is is a story about real people. Garden State is the type of film that I wish was the rule toward American film production, rather than the exception. It is telling that this film was unable to find financial backing among the big studios despite the star leverage of writer/ director/star Zach Braff and Danny DeVito (picking up Executive Producer credit). Thank God then for Gary Gilbert who saved the picture with $2.5 million of his own cash. Thank God indeed that he did then, or probably one of the best films of 2004 would not have been made. The storyline is a standard boy meets girl romance, altered by the imaginative supporting cast into more of an ensemble comedy with a romantic heart. This supporting cast, both animal and human and encompassing such varied beings as a masturbating dog and rap loving, beat - boxing cop lifts this movie out of being a standard (and probably forgettable) coming home/falling in love story. It is to Braffs credit that he is able to weave all of this co - existence into one straight story. Garden State is an excellent film, not suffering for it's tiny budget but rather made charming by it. It is obvious that this is a work of love by not only Braff but also the entire production crew. See this film to remind yourself that film can still be a medium of magic, should it ever be released from the cold grip of pure commercialism a'la mainstream Hollywood. Oh, and not to forget Natalie Portman, the only reason I watched this film originally. And yes, she retains her crown as the world's cutest (and most talented) actress. Peace. And for God's sake - WATCH THIS FILM!"
"bilweeler","Null","0","1","3 July 2005"," Garden State: A state of mind.
","This is a love story done right. A quiet little film that carries a substantial emotional punch, Braff is excellent as s drifting, aimless, 20 something with a huge amount of emotional baggage. Portman is the quirky, perky, flirty love interest who lights up every scene like a torch in the dark.<br/><br/>Braff's character, Andrew Largeman, is an understated, over medicated, and depressed career failure. He's drifting, and one would think nearly suicidal. Portman, an epileptic with a tendency to chronic lying, at least has a means to center herself. When things start getting difficult, she does something unique. Anything unique. And she's very good at it. There's a lesson here for all of us.<br/><br/>I can't help but compare this to ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind."" For all it's brilliance, ""Spotless Mind"" was very difficult to watch. ""Garden State"" deals with similar issues, and makes them highly watchable in the process.<br/><br/>The film looks pretty depressing at first, but Portman changes everything for Andrew and for us. Every once in a while, it's important to think about who you are, who you love, and why. It's an absolute pleasure to watch it happen here. The payoff for the viewer is realize that it may be time to take stock of his or her own life. As Largeman learns, this is it; this is life. Live it, don't observe it.<br/><br/>If there's a flaw here (and there almost always is at least one), it's the ending. I won't give it away, but suffice it to say that they were one more rewrite away from brilliance. That doesn't mean they didn't get 98% of this story dead on. They did."

Zach Braff did a outstanding job with writing, directing, and acting even for his first time.

But id have to say that my favorite scene is the one where Andrew first meets Sam and it shows her personality which at first is unlike Andrews, but as the film progresses, he starts opening up.

","Genre: Off-beat drama / subtle comedy.<br/><br/>This is my favourite film so far in life.<br/><br/>It was released in November last year (on limited release in the UK) which meant that not many people got to see it. However I did and it grabbed me in a way no other film ever has.<br/><br/>http://www2.foxsearchlight.com/gardenstate I recommend you load this web-site first and have the music from it play in the background. Full surround-sound experience yo.<br/><br/>Written and directed by Zach Braff (J.D in 'Scrubs') is a story about protagonist Andrew Largeman or 'Large' (played by Braff) and the few days he spends at home after making a decision to stop taking Lithium (for which he was prescribed to help cure depression which he was diagnosed at age 9).<br/><br/>He returns to his home town after 9 years for his mother's funeral and decides to stop taking the drug as he feels it is doing him no good being 'mentally numb'. Soon he meets 'Sam' (Natalie Portman) and begins to find in her what he's always been looking for. To me, Sam is a very insightful and interesting character and an absolute characteristic contrast to Largeman.<br/><br/>I love the fact that they got a beautiful girl to play this character. Sure it's Natalie Portman and therefore there's a large fan base there (big box-office bonus), but it also shows how everybody (no matter their appearance) is allowed to be an amazing person and not some 'bimbo' as is so commonly portrayed in modern-day media.<br/><br/>Another parallel storyline is the friction between Large and his father (played by Ian Holm - aka Bilbo in Lord of the Rings). Although this may not be the primary theme, it plays a massive part in the film's aim of portraying real human life and how rubbish / beautiful it can be.<br/><br/>The acting is top quality, especially from such a young cast. Within is the best performance I've seen from Natalie Portman and Zach Braff does amazingly in the task of shedding of the 'silly fool' type-cast he's been given by his role in Scrubs.<br/><br/>Basically this film really touched me.<br/><br/>So simplistic yet amazingly profound. I can imagine many would consider it 'boring' as there are only a few special effects (there's one, but it's breathtaking I assure you) and there's no Bruce Willis running round half naked trying to kill baddies. But if that's what you need to enjoy a film then your life is probably quite boring and lacking in depth.<br/><br/>I recommend it to everyone. But if it's guidelines you need then it is similar to films such as: 'Sideways', 'Philadelphia', 'Million Dollar Baby' (also amazing), 'Ghost World', 'Rainman', 'Born on the Fourth of July' and 'Closer'.<br/><br/>Basically films that tackle human problems in a poignant, emotional and sensitive way.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is almost equally as good. Acoustic, subtle, enlightening and beautiful, just like the film. I bought the CD when I got the DVD and absolutely adore it. It features Coldplay, Simon and Garfunkel, Zero 7 (- In the Waiting Line. You'll know it if you hear it) amongst many others.<br/><br/>I made my Mum watch it and she loved it. If my Mum likes it, it's damn good. She even bought a Shins album because she loves the soundtrack so much."

Natalie Portman and Peter Sarsgaard are two of the premier actors in Hollywood and have retreated back to what film-making is all about...making a good film. One can definitely see that the cast and crew did not do this for the money...it was for the potential to make a moving and changing event. True, the plot and themes aren't all that original, but the dialogue and characters more than enough make up for that.

A lot of my friends didn't get that, but I thought it was brilliant. Natalie Portman was really awesome in this movie. I find that she is an actress that is completely believable, you know i mean she can be anything and she is so good that you are willing to bet that this is who she actually is.

But that's beside the point. <br/><br/>This is a good movie. <br/><br/>And in spite of the cheesy ending, this movie is less about love, romance and other demons, than about understanding/inventing oneself, about coming to terms with the self, and about dreams that we all carry within ourselves, dreams that - more often than not - do not turn into reality. <br/><br/>This movie is also about friendship....but the most interesting aspect of this movie is that its characters are humane, and not superhuman reel personae.<br/><br/>I strongly recommend this movie to all my fellow losers!"

The second time around, however, I could really relate to the characters, and ended up being really emotional and loving the movie. One of the things I loved about this movie was the theme of just living your life and realizing that it might not always go as you plan but that's okay. It's quite realistic and doesn't sugar-coat the pain that normal people experience, without overemphasizing it. The soundtrack is also wonderful; I bought it right after I watched the movie and it's barely been shut off since. I am captivated by Zach Braff, Natalie Portman, and the entire cast.

"mobilavenue","9","0","2","31 May 2005"," The Artwork Of A Lost Generation
","It is a common misconception that the majority of growth from childhood to adulthood happens during one's teenage years. Rather, it can only truly begin to happen through a separation from the comfort of home and a solitary exploration of the infinite 'abyss' of life. Right now an entire generation of American college students and young adults are being bombarded with ideas and solutions to life's most imminent question- ""What can I do to make myself happy?"" Garden State is a beautiful piece of artwork that flawlessly captures the sentiment of this lost generation, and speaks out for the silent and forgotten in today's family-oriented society.<br/><br/>We are introduced to our protagonist, Andrew Largeman, through a dream he has of himself on a crashing plane. Immediately we see how detached he is from the world, as he struggles to stay awake in his chair through the calamity happening around him. Lifeless and heavily medicated, he returns home for his mother's funeral where he encounters his domineering psychiatrist father and some old friends from high school. The world his friends live in is one of sex, drugs, and sensualism as an escape from everything that is reality. As shown in a very well filmed party scene, Largeman's numbness separates him not only from feeling reality, but from feeling the pseudo-reality that his unscrupulous friends enjoy. Empty and lost, avoiding an inevitable confrontation with his father, Largeman then meets the girl that changes his life.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman puts forth a breathtaking performance as Sam, who from the get-go is full of beauty, laughter, energy, quirkiness, and endearing imperfections that make her everything that Largeman desires and lacks. Beneath the strange surface of this unique character lie the simple wants and needs of any girl- as evidenced by her innocent plea to her dead hamster of ""I hope that you liked me."" She is in touch with her emotions, unspoiled by today's demeaning culture, and readily able to laugh at her own mishaps- simply put she is the girl of my dreams. As their relationship develops and Largeman discovers freedom from his sedating medicine, an exploration of life commences and the growth he has been lacking since childhood finally begins.<br/><br/>The crazy journey that Largeman undergoes during the four days that this film documents is not a groundbreaking story in itself, but it is wholly real and comically genius. Zach Braff also uses metaphors quite overtly to enhance this piece of artwork, such as the running metaphor of Noah's Ark that almost warranted naming the film ""Large's Ark."" Visually, this is represented by an abundance of animals and water in certain scenes, but more importantly it serves as a framework for the death and rebirth that Largeman experiences and the setting of the emotional climax of the film. Braff makes no attempt to be subtle or surprising in this film, but simply tries to reach the soul and heart of our generation- and in this he succeeds, convincingly.<br/><br/>Garden State answers the question of ""What would make me happy"" by showing that finding where you belong and knowing that you are at home provide the comfort and peace we are all searching for. It shows that we can't find it in the sensual pleasures of this world, or by hiding reality behind a mask of unreality, or even by returning to our childhood home. The place we belong is a place we are searching for, and lies somewhere unseen in the unchartered territory we must gain the courage to explore. When we find it, the life that has been on hold for the transitional period may resume once again, and we find our place as an adult- we find our home.<br/><br/>If you feel disappointed after watching this movie or don't understand what all the hype is about, then that's fine- this movie wasn't made for you. However, if you were lucky enough to let this movie pierce your heart and if you felt like this movie was so perfect that it could have been made just for you- know that you are in good company. You are not alone in your journey, and this feeling of familiarity is what makes this film into artwork that has changed lives.<br/><br/>Personally, no film has ever hit me as hard as Garden State did when I watched it. It kept me laughing, and I'll admit to even crying during this film because nothing compares to the reality of my own emotions being laid out in front of me in the form of artwork. The soundtrack is simply unrivaled, and this film brought me to the theatre four times, each viewing bringing a unique and fresh aspect to light. I echo the thanks that thousands have given to Zach Braff for creating what can only be described as the film of our generation."
"jpschapira","7","0","2","30 May 2005"," ""What do we do""?
","Tons of mixed sensations and feelings were going through my mind as I watched this film, that even if it's not great, it's something that should clearly not be missed. The feelings about my own life and things I'm willing to do, as sensations about all these other movies of this type that have seemed so great to me.<br/><br/>It's just something that takes a lot of courage; what Zach Braff has done with this film. To write, without thinking about anything else than fulfilling his most precious illusions no matter whatI imagine what crossed his mind while he was doing it, and he might have thought it as something impossibleAn actor with the little time in the business as him, looking for a shot It's gratefully amazing there are still some brave producers out there, who look for these things. Dan Halsted, Pamela Abdy and all the others involved in this project's productionYour courage has made some dreams come true.<br/><br/>This is the part where I get emotional and inside personal stuff, but I needed to explain because I imagine what must have been for Zach Braff, being worried if people would like what he loved. Because he could have laughed harder than anyone in his set with the scenes, and those scenes would be shown months later to millions of persons around the world. And what if it wasn't funny for them? I can't say I had a blast with the movie, but I let go because of his situation; trying to figure out what was that anything he saw that probably the rest wouldn't I felt alleviated when the images where coming through. I've always wanted to write a script; primary objectives being writing about real life situations, with no starting or ending point, creating thought-provoking words that don't seem faked or manipulativeThese things are all in this script, somehow. Beautifully written words involving characters making reflections about the moment they're living in their lives. Sometimes the characters talk too much and they seem like nonsense but you can't tell if they're stoned or drunk since they could easily be; because everybody is always in that state. They're saying words most screenwriters are afraid of writing. Yes, Braff's screenplay is a little too profound, and not very spontaneous; but it doesn't matter because you've probably never heard those things before. I think two people can fall in love in less than a week timeHe is sure that can happen too.<br/><br/>Braff has even put his own little preferences in there, like little moments when he does crazy or metaphoric stuff that you realize it can only come from the writer and director, and not from anyone else. Little mentions of actors and movies, probably his favorites (or not), hidden in there (Robert De Niro, ""Serpico"")The freedom he took, of doing another thing I've always dreamed of, that is putting the music and songs he knew were perfect for each moment. Without problems, he put those songs in the adequate places and they all fit perfectly. Those songs and other little things that probably had a lot to do with his own life, and didn't prevent him of realizing a film that is not worried about time and structure and it's living the moment. Just as Braff's characters say constantly, and then you can get what he's saying: ""This is life, that's how it is"". ""This is the moment"". And, in the most revealing part, the question I wrote at the top and we always end asking at some point: ""What do we do?"" I always end up enjoying this type of films, because they're similar, not maybe only in plot or story, but in ways they arrived to their realization. ""Love, Liza"" is the story of a man who looses his wife because she commits suicide, and leaves him a letter. The script was written by Gordy Hoffman, and it took his brother Phillip Seymour to get involved there so the movie was made. ""Igby Goes Down"", the story of an adolescent that stays away because of the events that happen in his family. A totally unknown Burr Steers turned what he thought as a novel to a written and directed movie coming directly from his hands. ""Garden State"" involves a guy whom his mom dies and his life in his home town for a few days after the funeral. This involves encounters with old friendships, plenty of talks and some romance. How do we compare these films? The first one is the life of a grown man that continues after an event; the second one is the same, but involving an adolescent; the third one involves a man in his 20's.<br/><br/>Pro casting director Avy Kaufman achieves another excellent ensemble, which involved some of the director's preferences too. It's said Braff wrote Sam's role thinking of Natalie Portman. He has a good eye, because Portman achieves a wonderful job, looking beautiful and going crazy periodically. Peter Sarsgaard (Mark) comes from somewhere I can't imagine, to save his natural gifts as an actor and deliver greatly. Ian Holm is mayor words in the father's role, teaching acting lessons and shining in the minority. The rest of the cast is perfect, wherever they came from, they did their job right. And Braff, well, it was his whole project as a writer and director, and he did this film with a lot of passion. But he is also an actor, and puts a lot of passion into that too."

","I have been a avid user of this site for quite some time now but never really thought of registering on it because i never felt like giving my comment about a specific movie, but after seeing Garden State i was so impressed by it that i just had to say this is one best movies i've seen in a while, OK i understand why some people hate it, but this is really one of those love or hate movies, either you get completely involved by the story or its really boring. For me, it was just a story that really caught my attention from the start, i liked the fact that it was sort of journey of a man trying to feel something, anything, trying to get out of the state of numbness he was in, it felt like something new, something i had not seen before in a movie, at least not from the angle it is presented here, something that could be the actual story of someone.<br/><br/>I thought that both Zach Braff and Natalie Portman were great in their parts and never thought the guy from scrubs could direct such a good movie, i expect great things from both of them in the future"

I heard comments about the movie been boring. But those who say that weren't really seeing nor understanding. Thats most of our stories. We live numb but not by medications but by so many things. And sometimes we need a Sam to wake us up and teach us what life. Zach made an amazing job. Acting, writing and directing as well. And Natalie Portman keep impressing me movie after movie. I really think she is big and she is gonna go far! She was radiant!

","Garden State is a movie that makes you leave the theater with a very comfortable feeling. Every single scene of the movie is so sincere, honest and pleasant, that you want this movie to go on and on forever. Braff's acting is absolutely breathtaking. His facial expression and his gesture are gripping in a way that you feel every emotion of the main character. The other actor's acting are brilliant ,too. Above all Natalie Portman, she embodies the impulsive and capricious Sam with such an intensity but at the same time gaily, that you have to love her. Another great aspect of the movie is the music. It perfectly fits every scene and underlines the atmosphere and mood of the characters.The soundtrack consists of braff's favorite songs, which are melancholic, sad , bright and calm just like the movie itself.<br/><br/>One cannot even say, that this movie is only for people in their twenties.

","With big-budget blockbusters filling theatres with mindless sex, violence, and clichéd issues, rarely does a film along with a breath of fresh air. Have you ever seen a film so delightfully wonderful, you actually felt like a different person after watching it? If not, I suggest you watch Garden State, one of the best, most original film's I've seen this decade.<br/><br/>What I love about this film is that it displays the late teenage-twentysomething crowd as real people. With myself in that age group, I often find it insulting that so many films portray us as sex crazed potheads, in trouble with the law, while disrespecting ourselves. Garden State tackles all those generalizations to the mud showing us that we're people who just want to know who the heck we are. It's all about finding out who you're supposed to be while living a confused life and facing your demons. All of this is brought to life in the film with great acting, a superb screenplay, and direction that can only be described as perfection. <br/><br/>The film has immediately been put on my top 10 list for a good reason. I just hope Hollywood listens up because these are the kind of films people want to see."

","This is a movie that makes a good try at being ""deep meaning"" with a little humor thrown in but falls short. Zach Braff plays a displaced New Jersey young man who has moved to California and when he is not playing part-time actor he is wearing ""Charlie Chan"" make-up in a pretentious Vietnamese restaurant.<br/><br/>Zach gets a call from his father to return home to New Jersey because his mother has drowned in a bathtub accident. The dreamy, kind of insensitive Zach feels it is his duty to go. He kind of day dreams through the ceremony at the cemetery and then goes out partying with heavy drugs with his friends.<br/><br/>Zach complains to his father about sharp headaches and his father sends him to a neurologist to get checked out. While there, two significant things happen. First he meets Natalie Portman who is kind of spaced out herself and then he learns that his problems are probably related to the drugs his psychiatrist father has been proscribing for him.<br/><br/>Zach happens on Natalie later on and the two start hanging out together. There relationship slowly blooms and as there relationship improves they both realize that they are not really losers. Zach's problems relate to both the drugs he was taking and the guilt he had been carrying from a childhood incident involving his mother.<br/><br/>The movie has some really hilarious parts and I understand that Zach was the actual writer/director. Not a lot of action but an enjoyable and very different type of movie."

The soundtrack is incredible, as is the acting, The characters were so realistic, and I thought that the honesty of the events of their lives and how they deal with them was so true to life. It was clear that Zack Braff was not only from NJ, but drew from his own life experience to write the movie. I am sure that many writers do that, but this seemed to come out unfiltered. The message of the movie came out being that even though life can be difficult and uncertain, it can be a positive experience.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman (who could NOT be cuter, by the way) was incredible and she and Braff worked so well off each other. It was just obvious by watching this movie that Braff was truly married to the film, loved it, and considered every detail.

"joemystery2004","8","0","1","1 May 2005"," Flawed but Beautiful Movie
","Zach Braff's directorial debut ""Garden State"" is a flawed, yet beautiful and entertaining character study that tugs at the heart strings. The movie centers around Andrew Largeman (Braff) an emotionally numb struggling actor who returns to New Jersey after nine years for his mother's funeral. He has been on some form of medication since he was a child that leaves him in somewhat of a stupor or a waking sleep. Andrew decides to leave his medication behind and try to go to New Jersey without it for a few days. The film is essentially about how being off his meds opens his eyes to the world around him. In this world are his friends from high school, his father with whom he is estranged (Ian Holm) and a quirky young woman named Sam (Natalie Portman) who bewitches him.<br/><br/>I have heard a lot of talk about how this movie is pretentious, art house drivel. This comes from the same people who loved ""Lost in Translation"" yet can't for the life of them explain why. That isn't a knock at ""Lost in Translation"" by the way. I didn't love ""Lost in Translation"" nor do I love ""Garden State."" They are both entertaining in their own ways and I appreciate both. I appreciate ""Lost in Translation"" for the beauty it conveys about being lost in a strange world and finding someone else who is also lost to share in the desolation.<br/><br/>However, I was much more entertained and touched by ""Garden State,"" and am not afraid or ashamed to say so. It seems that Braff was coming from a very personal place when he wrote this movie. His portrayal of Andrew is one of quiet absurdity. He is fascinated and a bit put off by the world he lives in, but he has no right to be. Braff plays this off beautifully, hitting every note with precision and sad humor. Portman's Sam is a delightful force of nature and although many people found her performance to be somewhat annoying, I thought it was wonderfully endearing. Peter Sarsgaard is top notch as always playing Andrew's loose cannon friend who drinks too much, does too much drugs and doesn't seem to care. Only Sarsgaard could pull off lines such as ""Don't tease me about my habits. I don't tease you about being an asshole."" <br/><br/>There are places where the movie is clearly trying to be quirky and funny, which it is. For instance, the scene in which Braff models a shirt made for him by his aunt out of the same material as the wallpaper. That image is one likely to become a famous association with the film, such as Dustin Hoffman being viewed through Anne Bancroft's leg in ""The Graduate."" Does it contribute to the film as a whole? Not really. In fact, there are several unnecessary scenes in ""Garden State"", but they are presented in such a way that you couldn't imagine the film without them. Somehow, Braff makes it work. Braff makes everything work invthis film that shouldn't work. He has proved to be a great writer and a VERY GOOD director. He has a clear style and it'll be interesting if he becomes an auteuristic director like Kubrick or even Hitchcock. I pray he doesn't stop here. I am so intrigued.<br/><br/>In the end, Braff has written and directed a film that, love it or hate it, will be talked about for years to come and will likely go down in history as a cult classic, gathering a following comparable to that of ""Reality Bites"" and dare I say ""Lost in Translation."""

It's a fine first step for Braff as the director.

","If there's one thing likely to turn the stomach's of most men, it's the prospect of having to sit through a romantic comedy. The sickly-sweet musings of some flighty young girl yearning after a floppy-haired fop, usually played by Hugh Grant, seem all too much for their stout hearts. I'd like to think Garden State is different. Whilst there is still an underlying love story as two people who just met begin to learn they have certain feelings and desires for each other, this is mixed with a cocktail of death, drugs and lives filled with bizarre and colourful characters. Andrew Largeman (writer, director and star, Zach Braff) is living out in Los Angeles trying to scrape by as a part-time actor, full-time waiter. When he learns of his mother's death he returns home to find disappointment from his estranged father, and a collection of friends who seem to have done very little for the past decade besides party and take drugs. The one saving grace which makes his trip worthwhile comes when he meets Sam (Natalie Portman) whilst waiting in a doctor's surgery. Their quirky friendship soon takes off and soon, as in all love stories, they fall for each other, although unusually, there is always the feeling that these two people are together as friends first; lover's second. The film also shows their love as secondary to the story itself, giving the impression these could be two real people, living their lives and falling in love, instead of the hugely passionate mumbo-jumbo we often get from this type of movie. I was completely taken aback by this film. As with most, it's not going to be everyone's cup of tea, but for me it's the best romantic comedy I have seen in a long time, and comes highly recommended."

Natalie impressed me in Leon..shocked me in Closer..and now Garden State..two movies in such a short period of time..in Closer you want her badly..in Garden you want to love her in a pure way, well more or less..she really has transformed this part, just as she did with her career, into something you try to relate to..and more than once you can relate not only to her but to the entire movie. another plus: music..cold-play as soundtrack..that should impress anyone..every song marks an essential moment..I think it's one of the best soundtracks I've heard lately.."

","Garden State is a quirky little love story written, directed, and starring Zach Braff; the atypical residential intern of NBC's Sitcom Scrubs.<br/><br/>The film centers around Andrew Largeman (Braff), a two-bit actor just scraping by in Hollywood. At the beginning of the film, Largeman receives a call from his father (played by Ian Holm) to return home because his mother has died by drowning. Largeman returns home as the conquering hero, resting mostly on the laurels of his made-for-TV movie, in which he played a handicapped individual.<br/><br/>Largeman quickly reacquaints himself who his childhood oddball friends, which include: a kleptomaniac gravedigger, a knight's-of-the-round table dinner theater waiter, and a guy who has invented ""no-sound"" Velcro (which also made him rich).<br/><br/>As the story progresses, we learn that Largeman has been away from home for quite so time due to a childhood accident in which he permanently paralyzed his mother. His psychiatrist father has had him under medication since the age of 9, and has never quite gotten over blaming Largeman for the incident. Largeman has also decided to use his mother's death, as justification to discontinue his medication.<br/><br/>Along the way, Largeman meets Sam (played by Natalie Portman), who is everything that he's not; and a relationship is formed. With Sam's help, Largeman is finally able to face his demons, his father, and start living his life coherently.<br/><br/>Garden State is bizarre at times; however, always genuine. It's a cute little film worth looking for."

"benihana83","8","0","2","19 April 2005"," Braffs screenplay deserves merit..
","In 2004, Zach Braff emerged as one of the year's best success stories. Braff, a star on NBC's TV sitcom Scrubs, found distribution for his pet project Garden State, which he wrote, directed and starred in.<br/><br/>In Garden State, Andrew Largeman (Braff) returns home to bury his mother in New Jersey after 10 years of living on the west coast as a struggling actor. He has been held down his entire life by anti-depression medications. On this trip back to his roots, he leaves behind the medication and his reservations. With the help of a few friends and a girl named Samantha, played by Natalie Portman, Andrew embarks on a journey to rediscover happiness and himself.<br/><br/>The screenplay for Garden State might not satisfy those who are looking for action and excitement. But, like Lost in Translation in 2003, Garden State is certainly a solid movie. No, nothing explodes, but if you're looking for engaging dialogue about self-discovery and an appealing story about a young man returning to his roots, this is the movie for you. Braff's screenplay is clever and witty and his characters have many layers.<br/><br/>The best thing about Garden State, as I've said before, is its intelligent look at life. One scene in particular illustrates this notion the best. When Andrew downs an ecstasy tablet at a party, he begins to observe the things going on around him. Things move quickly, then slowly, and back and forth, in and out as people go about their business. In his heightened state, Andrew begins to see things in perspective. As he sits on the couch, partygoers pass him by at lightning-speed; much like life passes us by as we sit and watch, oblivious to the fact.<br/><br/>It's these kinds of indirect metaphors that make Braff's script so incredible. Watch the pool scene, figure it out and you'll see why.<br/><br/>The acting is also high-level. Braff brings the perfect pitch to the character of Andrew, someone just recently freed of the medications that bound him for so many years. And although she'll dive back into Star Wars this spring, Portman helps to shed her ""Queen Amidala"" image with a quirky performance as Samantha. With mature and complex roles in 2004 films like Garden State and Closer, she shouldn't be in danger of being typecast."

","This movie feels right. The plot is interesting but doesn't get in the way of the film-making. In a context in which so many movies are plot-driven, it's quite refreshing to have one that isn't. In fact, had read much of the plot and knowing what would happen didn't seem to take much of the pleasure of the movie. Oh, it's not necessarily mind-bogglingly new, original, innovative, and edgy. But that doesn't seem to be the point. It's not a revolution in film-making but it's a specific style. Which can be compared to different things depending on people's own references. Much of it must have to do with Zach Braff's age and level of experience. Somehow, the movie seems relatively unhindered by so many cinematic conventions. It's not about breaking rules and some details may look like a film student's first attempt, but it's about creating something the director would like to watch. A worthy goal. There are several ""ambiance movies"" these days. This one is quite subtle. Muted. Understated. Yes, the music is quite good. But it's made better through presentation. Part of it is great sound editing. Part of it is the connection between music and scene. Part of it is the additional music which sets the stage for the rest of the music. Part of it is just the feel of the music... The ambiance carries through much of the acting with a few exceptions. While there's a notion of some characters being more extreme than others, contrasts aren't abrupt or extreme. Most of the important lines are carried out in a casual manner. Nothing seemed to be meant as ""Oscar(tm)-grabbing look at my acting"" though everyone does at least a decent job. Would have expected more ""laugh out loud"" humor. Many lines, scenes, and references are funny enough, but it's not meant to give you cramps from laughing too hard. Some elements seem absurd enough but become so integrated in the movie as a whole that their effect is an overall feeling of ""magic dust"" as opposed to a whole magical universe or some strikingly new ideas. Would watch it again. Feels good. Like listening to a song a couple of times at the opportune moment."

","Garden State, the film debut of writer/director/actor Zach Braff (NBC's Scrubs), is about an actor who can't find any work in L.A. and is stuck working as a Vietnamese restaurant waiter. The actor, Largeman (Braff) one day receives news from his father (Ian Holm) that his mother (a paraplegic) has died. Largeman comes back to his home town in New Jersey to go to his mother's funeral (who he hasn't seen since he was 16), hook up with old friends, make a new friend and ultimately patch things up with his father.<br/><br/>Garden State stands as one of the best film debuts in years, it has it's flaws (like being overlong, and a bit boring it's first half hour) but it is great film. The acting is wonderful from the three leads. Zach Braff does as good a job on camera as he does behind the camera, Peter Sarsgaard is wonderful as always as Largeman's creepy grave digger friend, but the real standout is Natalie Portman as Largeman's love interest. Most of the film is saved by Natalie Portman who puts forth perhaps her finest screen performance to date. I'd recommend Garden State to anybody looking for an eye-popping indie. I'd also recommend picking up the incredible soundtrack. Grade: B+ (Screened at AMC Deer Valley 30, Phoenix Ariona, 9/03/04)<br/><br/>MADE MY TOP 300 LIST AT #205: (The 18th Best Film of 2004)"

","Zach Braff has yet astonished us with another piece of excellent eye candy. Not only could this film make you shed a few tears (No I myself didn't cry during it, my sister did!) but this film can also make you giggle. I watched this film at least twice, and both times I enjoyed it to the fullest. Natalie Portman gave an excellent performance as some hyper-crazed little girl trying to make it through life without noticing all the people laughing at her, not with her. Then you have Zach Braff, who not only directed this great film, but wrote it and acted in it as Andrew Largman! Talk about multi-talented. Anyway, this movie is fantastic, however watch out if you are watching it with your children who might be under the age of 14 - as there is a very brief but graphic sex scene. The movie in itself was good, however there were a bit plot fallouts and the ended could have been better. Eight stars for this movie!"

","""Garden State"" shows us the unique talent of Zach Braff. This film was a tour of many colorful characters and situations. Andrew Largeman's journey of awakening is both new and painful to him as he returns to his hometown in New Jersey. In addition, we see some very humorous moments that Andrew (Braff) must deal with.<br/><br/>This has a much deeper meaning than being a romantic comedy or drama. The story is really about knowing yourself and experiencing life. Andrew stumbles blindly into the path of a young woman, played by the brilliant Natalie Portman, and finds sobriety has rewards. His vulnerability coupled with his need to feel something real is what makes his connection with Sam (Natalie Portman) possible.<br/><br/>The acting in this film is unmatched by many recent films. Natalie Portman is captivating and charming and Peter Sarsgaard once again shows his range and versatility. Zach Braff is also very unforgettable as the hero of this personal tale.<br/><br/>The process of discovery that Andrew undertakes is what makes this film memorable and worthwhile.<br/><br/>This film is not perfect, but its faults are minuscule in the presence of the acting ability of the cast and a truly touching story that Braff creates for us."

","This is one hot film. It popped into IMDb's top 250 virtually overnight at number 187. Nearly one half of the eighteen thousand who voted for it gave it a perfect ten. I'll wager most of them were under 25 years of age. This is a film for the young at heart.<br/><br/>Because of its early release, this film earned no Oscar nominations. If the studio were to have their way, however, young Zach Braff would garner every award they could give, as his $2.5 million-budget film has grossed in excess of $25 million so far in relatively limited release, making Zach one of the most bankable actor/writer/directors in 'Hollywood'.<br/><br/>In the video ""The Making of Garden State"", 23-year old Natalie Portman said she enjoyed working on a film with other young people. I can add that I thoroughly enjoyed seeing a film that displayed so much young energy and enthusiasm for lifealbeit a bit skewed through Zach Braff's eyes.<br/><br/>Zach Braff was heavily influenced by Hal Ashby (""Harold and Maude"") and Woody Allen, and he certainly replaces Mr. Allen in the triple-hit category of writer/director/star.<br/><br/>We are no stranger to Zach Braff here in the UK, as the show ""Scrubs"" premiered on cable/satellite channel Sky One on 17 January 2002. It is a very popular show here.<br/><br/>Besides the wonderful work of Zach Braff as an actor, and the tremendous support provided by Natalie Portmanwho does not enter the film until the 28th minute and manages to steal every scene thereafter!Peter Sarsgaard (the crossbow killer in Unconditional Love) dreamily underplays Mark, modern-day grave robber, and Ian Holm (Bilbo Baggins of Lord of the Rings) plays the role of New Jersey father with tremendous poise, and a wonderful American accent.<br/><br/>In Jerry McGuire, Renée Zellweger as loyal secretary Dorothy Boyd says, 'You had me from hello.' I must say that Zach Braff's character Andrew captured my attention from the very first scenes of this film, wherein: a petrol nozzle is still stuck in his car as he arrives at the restaurant where he works in Los Angeles; his airplane is crashing and, whilst other passengers don their oxygen masks, Andrew merely adjusts the air conditioning above him; Andrew is ""saluted"" by the automatic faucets in the restroom as he walks past; his shirt metaphorically blends with the wallpaper in his mother's bathroom. I was laughing to the point of tears before an actor spoke a single word. Zach had me long before the first 'hello'.<br/><br/>This is the story of a boy coming home to New Jersey for his mother's funeral. Andrew Largeman has been living in Los Angeles, working as an actor/waiter because he likes being other people. Via a phone message from his father/psychiatrist (who has kept Andrew on drugs all his life), Andrew is informed that his mother has diedthat she in fact drowned in her own tub.<br/><br/>Who can miss the Allen-esque humour of the 'medicine cabinet' scene that followsnot just the face split by the mirror, but the immaculately neat rows of medication that line the shelves? Or the scene once he arrives home: a Jewish boy riding a German WWII motorcycle that his grandfather has left him? And while she doesn't speak the exact words from Annie Hall, 'You're what Grammy Hall would call a real Jew' after he has met compulsive liar Sam (Natalie Portman) and given her a ride home, she shows him her most prized possession (besides her dead hamster): Sam: This is Tickle (holding up a rag).<br/><br/>Andrew: What is tickle? <br/><br/>Sam: Tickle's my favourite thing in the whole world. It's all that's left of Nanny, my blanket.<br/><br/>Andrew: What happened? Hurricane? <br/><br/>Sam: Shut up! <br/><br/>Andrew: It's like a Wailing Wall.<br/><br/>Sam: What? <br/><br/>Andrew: The Wailing Wall is the most holy place for Jews to go and pray in Israel. It's all that's left of this enormous temple that was destroyed by the Romans.<br/><br/>Sam: So you're like really Jewish? You are! <br/><br/>Andrew: What? I don't do anything Jewish. I don't go to temple, or anything. I don't know any Jews who go to temple.<br/><br/>Like Woody Allen, always explaining away his Jewishness, Zach has his character Andrew fall for a shiksa, a non-Jewish girl.<br/><br/>By the way, Natalie Portman was Zach's first pick to play the role of Sam; and she seems to be the perfect shiksa for any Jewish boy, as she was born in Israel.<br/><br/>Andrew comes home to find his friends only a little changed; Mark is a gravedigger/grave robber at the Jewish cemetery, Kenny (the guy who once sniffed coke off a urinal) has become a cop, and Jesse is now a millionaire after ""the man"" bought his patent for silent Velcro.<br/><br/>""Garden State"" is a warm romance, punctuated with outrageous visualsa leg-humping seeing-eye dog, a masturbating terrier, a graveyard of pets, an armoured friend from Medieval Times Restaurant (He's just a fast-food knight) who's making it with Mark's mother (Jean Smart) Oh, and if you're a John Ritter fan, you will see that Zach brings John's face back to life every time he deadpans the camera.<br/><br/>Let me leave you with the line that I believe best sums up this charming film.<br/><br/>When Sam tells Andrew that she has to wear a funny helmet to work because she suffers from epilepsy, he asks, 'What part are we laughing about again?' Sam answers: 'If you can't laugh at yourself, life is going to seem a whole lot longer than you'd like.'"

","What a depressing movie! This is like ""Clueless"" with everybody ten years older and STILL without a hint. The question it seems to pose is, ""What kind of meaning in life can people find when they have no values and don't believe in anything at all?"" All the characters in this film, and that includes those of the parental generation, either never acquired the sense of purpose that leads individuals to make plans, take risks and engage in long-term life projects, or abandoned it long ago. So all they're left with as a motivator is sexual attraction, and even then they need drugs or alcohol to get them going. That places them on a moral and aesthetic level that is certainly sub-primate. What's going to happen when the lust fades? Fortunately the movie doesn't continue that far, else I expect we'd be even more depressed."

","After hearing lots of buzz about his flick, I decided to go all the way and purchase it at Best Buy just last week. Let me tell you, with all honesty, ""You must see this movie!"" What makes it so beautiful is the wonderful story development and the excellent characters. Zach Braff (from NBC's ""Scrubs"") has really stepped into something grand, and ""Garden State"" is his baby! Natalie Portman is especially marvelous in this flick as she steps back into a role more suitable for her, as opposed to being a stiffly-drawn, plain-speeched Senator Amidala in Lucas's epic. There are times when I found myself laughing my head off, other moments I was nearly in tears. And at one point, I was laughing so hard I did cry. In that respect, I don't want to ruin the pleasure of viewing the movie by giving away the whole plot.<br/><br/>In essence, Andrew ""Large"" Largeman (Braff) returns home after hearing of his mother's death following nine years of servitude as an actor in Hollywood. Estranged from his cold-hearted father, very well played by Ian Holm, he comes back in search of himself. He happens upon a young lady in a doctor's office by the name of Sam (Portman) and they hit it off from the beginning. Throughout, ""Large"" encounters high school friends Mark (Peter Sarsgaard) and an array of characters that are shady, wholesome, bizarre, and geeky.<br/><br/>I would recommend this movie to anyone that loves a great story full of romance, action, comedy, and drama!"
"chief_jim","9","0","2","15 March 2005"," Zach Braff is a prodigy
","The chief character, Braff's Andrew Largeman, returns after a decade from his semi-successful acting career in LA, to his home in New Jersey after receiving the news of his mother's recent death. The film follows his emotional reaction to the tragedy as well as to his homecoming. Largeman's distanced father has also been his psychiatrist since the age of 12; and for almost as long, Andrew has been under the prescription of a plethora of drugs following the accidental paralysis of his previously living mother. <br/><br/>During the days the film follows, he reunifies with a number of his old NewJersian high school friends; as well as meeting Natalie Portman's character, Sam. As it happens, returning to the place his has been away from for so long, yet he knows so well, gives him a completely new perspective of the world. Being back home with his old friends and spending time with the Sam, enables him to review his own life. He comes to terms with the truths of reality, and as a result, stops taking the medication that has rendered him 'numb' to pain and emotion for long enough. Zach Braff plays Largeman with an obvious exactness of how he envisioned the character to be. He gives him an enormous likability, and since the film follows his journey from new place to new place, we travel alongside him with an empathy and a fondness that would not be present had the script been weaker.<br/><br/>Largeman's meets his old best friend, Mark at his mother's funeral; Peter Sarsgaard portrays Mark as a complex individual who seems to have a lot of logic, but not the real-life confidence to move forward in life. He is soon reintroduced to the entire neighbourhood and we get to see, most amusingly, just what Largeman's friends are doing with their lives. The bizarre character types and bizarre instances he meets these people in give the audience the same experience Largeman has himself; one basically of having to take in all these new things and faces beings shoved in front of him and having to accept them get on with it and have a good time!<br/><br/>Natalie Portman's Sam gives the film most of its energy. Portman plays her with such an innocent and endearing quality that Sam, by far, becomes the most affable of all the highly affable characters. Whenever she's on screen we're affected by her charm, she is the root of much of the quirky humour the script provides; and indeed, when not present, Largeman's more sedate personality tends to slow the film down. However, this slowing is needed in order to contrast the more up-beat scenes and make them effective; as well the change in pace never makes one scene boring compared to another as it gives each the necessary tone and mood needed for it to accomplish what it needs to. It is this constantly changing tone that eases from one scene to the next - managing not to leave the audience behind with unanswered questions.<br/><br/>And each scene is in fact just as interesting and enjoyable as the next. The script provides hilarious situations and cool set-pieces. Along with the sheer degree of 'nice-factor' involved, Braff's style of humour is fresh and witty and keeps from ever sounding unnatural or unbelievable. I found myself still smiling from the film's charm even in the car on the way home from the cinema. <br/><br/>Braff's visual style is to mix shots of regular banality with inventive and distinguishable beauty. The excellent choice of music perfectly compliments the action, as well as the themes being shown. And although these themes have been shown on screen countless amounts of time, the script never once appears tacky or clichéd.<br/><br/>The script lacks slightly only in a few areas; certain parts of the story require a little more attention, and equally, other parts require less. For example, Largeman explains a discovery he has made to his father, one that he has previously mentioned earlier on in the film. The interaction between father and son doesn't seem authentic for their characters and as a result, the conversation doesn't seem to work; however, this minor negative point is less than negligible and has little or no impact on the overall experience. The film conveys all of its messages efficiently; without doing injustice to any of the important matters it deals with.<br/><br/>'Garden State' is the type of film that defines a generation; as 'Fight Club' has done before, and 'The Graduate' did before that, Garden State perfectly illustrates the trauma of being twenty-something for its own era. The fact that this film is so easy to relate to, proves that it is successful in its cause. <br/><br/>Considering 'Garden State' is Braff's first shot at writing, directing and starring in a feature film, it is an astounding attempt; one that I believe to be among the best debuts of all time. The mix of quality acting, hilarious situations, pathos, humour, apt music and inventive aesthetics brings the film together well, keeping it endlessly fresh and appealing throughout. Braff succeeds in having it show and do everything it needs to, and he succeeds with seemingly little effort. 'Garden State' has so much heart and modesty, it will not fail to prove that the 109 minutes you spend with the film, will not be wasted. I warmly look forward to seeing another of Braff's future productions.<br/><br/>However deep of shallow your passion is for films, Garden State is unmissable. Buy it, rent it, borrow it, download it Steal it if you have to; I strongly urge you to do whatever is necessary to check it out."

"shinyboots","7","0","2","11 March 2005"," Lots of appeal, but don't think about it too much.
","While watching Garden State, I got the sense that Zach Braff had trouble restraining his creativity. The very beginning had lots of ""look at me"" moments, and he always jumped at the chance to mimic the super-plussed cool of Wes Anderson. Not that you can blame him for the homage.<br/><br/>The character (or the acting, however you want to look at it) was natural and spunky. Braff's knack for character quirks made for some memorable moments, but really only Natalie's and Zach's, and to a lesser extent Peter's, characters had any depth. This only becomes a problem when, like in the scene with the Mother's locket and the storytelling by the hearth, a character is called upon to create an emotional atmosphere. In the former, it's difficult to see Peter's character as having such nostalgic or sentimental sensibilities as to create that whole set-up just to return a locket.<br/><br/>I could go on, but it would be like analyzing a Clancey novel for its lack of character empathy. Braff created a solid narrative and told it with precision and care. It was fun...just don't think about it too much."

","It was a very subtle and smoothly consistent movie. There were some interesting comedic moments throughout that didn't throw you off the balance of the movie. It all flowed very smoothly and it was extremely enjoyable to watch. A rare flower blooming among a field of fennel. The movie is about another guy out to find himself in a mass of listlessness, no real sense of direction or knowing what to do.. In short, he's a reflection of the same hopelessness that affects us all in some point or another in life.<br/><br/>The thing about this movie is that everything is subtle enough that nothing knocks you off kilter out of the movie, the setting and atmosphere are done beautifully, and it's slow pace really allows you completely immerse yourself in the plot, as if you were actually sitting right there facing similar situations yourself. After the film, you're left feeling completely the same as before, it didn't leave you unsatisfied, or excited. It carried out the same mellow tone out to real life. My only qualm is that it only gave hints to the other characters... and didn't go into enough depth out of the supporting characters when it seemed appropriate to take that turn or direction. Still, it did VERY well in subtly revealing the quirks and workings of the two main characters.<br/><br/>If you're not in the mood for another random cliché comedic / drama / horror storyline or complete cheesy and forced""heart-wrenching"" moments MADE to squeeze some emotion out of you.. This will be a great film to watch for the desensitized, or someone who's simply out there to see a good movie~"

","Garden State is a touching, realistic story about an actor who attempts to find himself after years of mind-numbing drug use. Andrew Largeman, played by Zach Braff, has had a tough childhood where he has had to cope with a terrible accident in which he is responsible for his mother's lifetime wheelchair confinement. His father, a psychologist, played by Ian Holm, prescribes Andrew to numbers of drugs including morphine to help him cope with his problem. When Andrew, after hearing of his mother's death, comes home for the first time in nine years to New Jersey, you guessed it, ""the garden state,"" he decides not to bring his drugs with him and face his painful past in a sober state. There he meets, Sam, played wonderfully by Nathalie Portman, who unknowingly will help him not only cope with his mother but also live a life without the superficial euphoria his drugs may have allowed him to coast along with. He also meets some of his old buddies namely, Mark, played by Peter Sarsgaard, and Kenny, who his a millionaire now for inventing a Velcro that makes no sound as you rip it apart. The main conflicts in this story that must be resolved are: Largeman's or ""Large"" as his friends call him, must come to terms with the guilt he is still carrying for his mothers accident. He must find a true relationship with his father other than that of patient/psychologist. He also must get over his drug addiction and find a way to live without them.<br/><br/>This films strong points are the writing, especially dialogue, the characters, the soundtrack, and the originality of the story. Although it does travel into trodden paths towards the end as it gets wrapped up a little too neatly. The acting is good all-around with a stellar performance from Nathalie Portman. Without her, the film could have been mediocre. Peter Sarsgaard also gives a fine performance as a blue collar, fiercely independent, mortician and friend to Largeman. Zach Braff is the only one here whose performance I thought lacked the special spark of the other two. Also, the chemistry between him and Portman is almost non-existent. As friends I can definitely see them but they had no chemistry as a couple. The soundtrack is superb and is truly worth all the hype. The one scene that could become etched in your mind as it has mine is where Andrew asks Sam what she is listening to and she tells him ""The Shins. You want to listen? This band could really change your life."" That might not be it verbatim but it is the gist of it. Then as he puts the headphones on we hear ""new slang."" As he looks at her that song is playing and it is wonderful, just wonderful. The rest of the soundtrack is also fantastic. If nothing else in this movie, Mr. Braff has proved he can choose a great soundtrack. The dialogue is also original and interesting. These are thoughts that perhaps everyone has had but no one has been able to capture them in a screenplay before. From, Sam's ""totally original movement"" to make herself feel good again to the conversations at Mark's drug party, there is a lot of great dialogue here that almost anyone can relate to. The originality of the story is another strong point. This is a film that speaks to my generation and I can relate to everything in it and I even felt like I knew some of the characters. Although the film is very good, I wouldn't go so far as to rate it a classic such as another similar sixties film, ""The Graduate."" However, it is a promising and welcomed debut from a potentially great director. I look forward to seeing another film of Braff's and I hope he can improve on this. Seven out of ten stars. I recommend it."

Also, when the guy in the trailer told Braff to enjoy exploring the infinite abyss...what the hell does that mean? Life isn't infinite, so it can't be that. Maybe he's referring to life's problems and how they never end. I don't know, but it doesn't seem to have anything to do with the fact that the main character needs something to feel and care about.<br/><br/>It's POINTLESS PHILOSOPHY!

I think everyone feels like that at some point in their lives. How we choose to work it out is a different story. I loved it! I liked all the characters and their flaws. I think Zach is great on Scrubs, but he did a great job on this movie. I think Hollywood has pretty much dictates that a movie has to have explosions and good looking half-naked people in it in order to be a blockbuster. It was so refreshing to see this move. There were no over the top scenes and it is not so far removed from the masses that it was easy to relate to. The soundtrack is awesome."

The story of a young man who has felt numb to everything since he was old enough to feel mature emotion runs directly parallel to every young person today. We are being pulled at from every angle to do this and do that and that we can change the world. AHHHHHH!! Our only choice for sanity is to block it all out and accept our numbness. But then again, as Andrew Largeman did, sooner or later we have to say ""Screw it!"" and put our anesthetic of numbness away and start living again. No matter the extent of the pain. This movie is as inspirational as it is true. I wish we all had the strength to say ""Here I am world. Give me your worst.""

","Hmmm, I saw Garden State last night just before bed. When I went to bed I was trying to decide if I liked it...And, furthermore, if it was a good movie so, it is a good movie concept that was executed between average and well. It wasn't executed to the point that this movie is epochal, but I didn't fast forward through any parts either. The beginning was slow. The middle was intriguing as hell, and the end was hard for me to believe. It was surprisingly funny. I didn't expect that from the previews. Natalie Portman plays a character somewhat similar to that played by Kate Winslett in Eternal Sunshine, but in a different way. Portman's character seems to be more innocent as well, and I don't think she played it as well. This movie is an outstanding concept with a script that was one or two revisions from complete.

","I went to see this mainly because I love Zach Braff and Natalie Portman. I wasn't disappointed, but at the time, the impression I formed was that this was a simple romance movie between two quirky characters. Well-acted, good lines, good soundtrack... but pretty average.<br/><br/>But the movie stuck in my head. It had an effect on me that I didn't initially anticipate. And I realized that ""Garden State"" only pretends to be simple. This is a movie that, like an onion, has layers that only can be peeled back over time. It stuck with me maybe because there was so much I could identify with - which may sound odd, given that my life is nothing like Andrew's or Sam's. But families are strange. Relationships are hard. Life can be difficult to face. And home is such an abstract concept, but it's so fundamentally real.<br/><br/>The best part about ""Garden State"" is that it makes you feel something, without being obvious about it. This is a change-your-life kind of movie - but quietly, subtly. It just alters your perception of the small, everyday aspects of life in such a small way it's hardly noticeable, but in such a major way as well.<br/><br/>Highly recommended."

","Is it just me or did anyone else notice the apparent ""water"" theme throughout the movie? At first when Andrew is in the bathroom at the airport, he walks by all the sinks and they each go off. His mother died by drowning. Andrew can't swim and jumps in the poll anyways. He also hadn't cried in years and Sam tries to save the tear, when they were in the bathtub. Also the rainstorm they get caught in. I've only seen it once but I thought there was a deeper meaning behind it. I believe that all this stuff having to do with water is very symbolic. The name of the movie is GARDEN state and gardens need water to grow. I believe that all the water in this movie was used as a metaphor. Andrew needed to change his life and grow, and going back to jersey and meeting Sam was the water that helped him grow."

","I enjoyed this film. It is solidly crafted, interesting throughout, and funny. And I really like Braff, who is brilliantly funny in Scrubs, and Portman, who is a great actress and has a great future in store.<br/><br/>However, I tend to think that the hype on this film is a bit excessive. This film obviously struck a chord with many people. I don't mean to offend fans of this film, but I cannot comprehend why. I understand that this is a very personal film for Zach Braff, but his character and the film style reminded me a bit of Scarlett Johansen's character in Lost in Translation from last year, kind of a stunned lost soul wandering around quirky New Jersey instead of quirky Tokyo. The Natalie Portman character reminded me a bit of the Ruth Gordon character in Harold and Maude.... a free-spirit who unlocks the main character's repressed emotions (right down to the spontaneous dance). Perhaps it is ""true"" to Zach's life, but it is too personal and eccentric for me to identify with, I guess. There is no really outstanding imagery in this film that stays with me. And, I don't think Garden State is a film that I would want to or need to see over and over (like the two films that I mentioned above). <br/><br/>Therefore by the criteria that I adjudge film art, I would give it a good, slightly better than average, rating, but I would not rave and recommend it as one of the best."

","I wanted to see this movie primarily because I enjoy Natalie Portman's performances. She once again shows that she is a very talented and charismatic actress.<br/><br/>I like plot and character-driven movies and this most certainly qualifies. I also like movies with quirky characters. Like ""American Spendor"" and ""Accidental Tourist"", this has quite a few. The plot is also original and compelling. The main character, played (and written and directed) by Zach Braff, at age 26, is spending his first time without psychotropic drugs. He gets to start living in a world where he feels his emotions. It would be easy to go over the top with that kind of plot idea, but this movie plays it out in a very subtle manner. It is well-written and all of the acting contributions are strong.<br/><br/>The only complaint, and it is minor, is that the pace of the movie was a little slow. There was probably a scene or two that could have been eliminated to get us through the movie a little quicker.<br/><br/>In all, this is a very enjoyable film.

"riverspipe","4","0","1","26 January 2005"," I can't believe this is in the top 250
","This film is so overrated, and I'm in my twenties so it isn't an age thing. Here's my review of it. I give it *1/2 out of **** or 4/10.<br/><br/>Amidst a series of outlandish characters, maudlin romance and a barrage of contemporary, suburban broken-heart songs sung by grown men that sound like babies, a few moments of clever cynicism and wit make Garden State slightly easier to endure. Copious reviews from twenty-something film critics on the internet call Garden State inspirational, funny, well written, romantic and even one of the best films of the year, and a troop of cranky older critics also acquiesce to its success, though not as fervently. Of course, a thrust of this acclaim is probably due to the rush of orgasmic pleasure most young men receive while observing Natalie Portman act unbearably, sickeningly cute. And it only follows, logically, that they may have identified themselves with Zach Braff's character -and his complete lack of personality- as a poster for drab slacks, sweatshirts and tennis shoes. You're suckers I say! <br/><br/>Aside from the fact that I am a cynical old codger, Garden State is not a special motion picture. Its premise- in which a young man returns to his hometown and reunites with his former buddies, and ultimately finds love- is not new. The relationship between Portman and Brahf seems forced, and the build-up (leading them to tearful love in just four days) is not convincing; perhaps this is why Portman's performance is so childishly exuberant and adorable- she is trying to make up for the rash bond of the screenplay, or it could very well be that most people fall in love this easily, in which case physical appearance and happenstance are the main criteria. Slowly, Garden State descends into a whirlpool of sappy troubadourian courtship; however the courtship is frenetic, and the final scene like caramel stuck on teeth.<br/><br/>Most irksome is the awkward creation of zany characters. They exist solely to convince the viewer that Garden State has a quirky distinctiveness, and they crop up everywhere, nearly every scene. If a middle aged mother having sex with her twenty something son's peers and smoking the bong, a retarded television quarterback, a grown adopted black man into a single-parent white family, and a girl who buries countless dead hamsters sound funny or 'fresh,' then Garden State might work for you. I, however, am getting tired of these outlandish ""odd-ball"" characters that are, just there; the same tactic Napoleon Dynamite attempted to mask as comedy. I am not saying strange characters detract from a film, but the approach is all wrong, and it's obvious they have been inserted here to feign originality. Ghost World would be an example of a film that does the zany character thing better.<br/><br/>If this isn't all bad enough, there are a few lines of juvenile philosophy parading as disquisitions of hardened experience that can't help but instigate a regretful roll of the eyes.<br/><br/>The positives: It moves fast enough, has a few moments of humor and and it moves fast."

","I don't write on here a lot, mainly because I don't know what to say. Now that Oscar nods are out, and they are like the Super Bowl for me, I gotta say I was kinda disappointed with the lack of credit given to Garden State. I don't wanna sound like a total turd, but this movie really meant a lot to me, (as I'm sure it did to like 50 million other people.) It definitely touched something inside of me and moved me. I related to that numb feeling and I hated that I could, because I hated being that way. Mine wasn't brought on by anything in particular such as being on medications, but rather many things in my life. Not to say I live a modern Greek Tragedy, but life had somewhat lost flavor to me, and I honestly became scared to live. I finally am getting over that and am obsessed with living life, but its hard not to switch right back to that safe feeling of numb. I'm only twenty-one so my life's journey may not be as interesting or intense as Andrew Largeman's or yours, but I saw myself in him, and I admit, it almost scared me to see it. But, oddly enough, I definitely saw myself in Sam. A contradiction I know, but that's what we all are anyway, isn't it? Well, this is definitely my favorite movie, and one for our generation, of desensitized kids. Life is beautiful because of the pain so many of us are afraid or refuse to feel. It makes those joys all the more worth it. So I just wanted to say thank you (to Zach Braff) for making this movie. It means a lot to everyone, and me.

","Zach Braff's directorial and writing debut with ""Garden State"" is an absolute masterstroke from a young man who, along with a talented supporting cast, has made ""Scrubs"" the premiere sitcom on TV today. This heartwarming and beautifully made film starts off a little slowly, but once it hits its stride, it soars high.<br/><br/>Mr. Braff stars as Andrew Largeman (Large to his friends), a struggling LA actor who's main claim to fame was starring as the ""retarded quarterback"" in a TV movie. Working at a Vietnamese restaurant and long estranged from his parents, Andrew receives a phone call one morning that forces him to confront his demons. His mother has passed away. He must now return home to New Jersey to not only bury his mother, but his estrangement from his father as well. Mr. Braff's vulnerability makes this role work, his innocent charm enhances it, and his increasingly hopeful delivery of the material sells it.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman (who was the first choice for the role, but Zach didn't think he could get her) graces us yet again with her timeless elegance, skill and beauty taking on the role of Sam. A once aspiring figure skater, her epilepsy and compulsive lying has led to a chance meeting and eventual romance with Andrew at a doctor's office. Such sweetness in this role, reminds me a lot of her ""Beautiful Girls"" character, only older. Once again, Natalie gives us a magnificent performance from the best actress of her generation.<br/><br/>Ian Holm plays Andrew's father, Gideon. Partially blaming Andrew for his wife's paralysis, Gideon has been trying to repair the 10 year rift between father and son. However, he has played Andrew's psychiatrist for so long, he seems to have forgotten how to talk to his son. Another well played, honest feeling role.<br/><br/>Peter Sarsgaard plays Mark, one of Andrew's childhood friends, Jean Smart plays his mother, the only two characters to offer much more to the proceedings, and both add wonderfully to the film.<br/><br/>""Garden State"" is a brilliant film debut, it's well written and thoughtful story about growing up and dealing with the sometimes harsh realities of life never rings false, and after a slow beginning, picks up steam once Andrew returns home and realizes that life is far too short to live numb.<br/><br/>4 ½ out of 5"

Zach Braff deserves an award for his acting and his directing (i don't know if he's got one for the film, but he ought to!) because this film makes you feel all the emotions of real life, cos it is real life. in a time when most people are thinking about how crap reality is, we should all watch this movie so that we can remember that reality really is wonderful."

What Garden State defines for me is the urge of the main character - a 26 y.o. young man - to be alive, to really feel even if that means to feel pain. He decides to feel pain as opposed to feel nothing, and this is what strikes me the most. In a world where anti-depressants are the new religion and more and more people depend on those pills to feel something at all (because they have a certain time of influence and after that you can go on being numb and safe without emotions) - choosing real life, real emotions, even if that means pain - is quite brave, and original... and sad for that matter. So, all you boys... and girls, who are scared to breathe in the pain of reality and to fill your lungs with it, it's time for you to watch this film and lose your virginity. The fun starts after you accept the fact that pain is just part of everything!"

","Garden State, one of the most dull movies I have ever seen. Nothing really happens except a small group of friends on the search for themselves. Just like many books we have read, ""Catcher in the Rye"" and newer version ""Perks of being a Wallflower"". With that said I do not take away anything from the two books or the movie, they're just very unexciting. I honestly fell in love with the movie as along with the books, for it is easy to relate to. I might be missing the whole freaking point of the movie, but for a person like me who is always running away from their problems, it shows there is still hope.....With that said, for you Natalie fanatics, I don't think she will ever top her performance she did in this movie."

I loved the stare when his friend was robbing the grave and knowing he was thinking about his mom and his friend knew it.<br/><br/>I thought his scenes with his characters father were great. Not overplayed, a bit unresolved, and honest. Natalie was a good casting decision.

"jwpappas","4","0","2","4 January 2005"," Derivative Cliché' Fest
","I was with this film for the first 25 minutes before the depressing reality that it was nothing but another ""slacker Sundance young director"" clone sank in. Zack Braff--from SCRUBS, the only sitcom that I watch--stars, writes & directs this painfully derivative flick about a bunch of aimless & quirky twentysomethings who stumble aimlessly through life while treacly awful alternative folk music is strummed & bleated from the soundtrack. Natalie Portman seems to be channeling her former costar Jar Jar Binks as the most annoying person in New Jersey (& NJ is a state that produced both Joe Piscopo & Jon Bon Jovi) while Peter Sarsgaard barely maintains his dignity in the well worn cliché of the wise, quick witted & jaded loser/stoner.<br/><br/>How many clinches can you jam into one movie? I stopped counting at 18 but that's only because I picked up a magazine & began reading it during the film's last 10 minutes. I just didn't care anymore what happened to these cartoon characters & only left the movie on in the vain hope that there would be another scene with Sarsgaard shirtless (there wasn't).<br/><br/>Jeezus, didn't they stop making movies like this back in the 1990s? Unfortunately this tepid crapola got some decent reviews, awards at Sundance & did OK box office (for an indie) so I guess we can all look forward to another slew of inoffensive, slice of life, twentysomething, slacker, disaffected, quirky, small town yarns with neo-folkie alterna ""rock"" cooing from the soundtrack.<br/><br/>Suddenly an Adam Sandler/Meg Ryan marathon doesn't seem so unendurable."

Was I surprised. First of all this has some good comedy moments but it isn't a comedy. It's a love/life story that's so believable that it touches your heart. The story is very very well written, it has some surprises and it feels very true. It has a meaning without being a ""soap-opera"" blockbuster comedy that only has a meaning to be ""nice"" (""love is good, love all"").<br/><br/>It's really a beautiful story but I believe the acting skills of Natalie Portman and Peter Sarsgaard really upgrades the writing to a whole new level! Zach Braff acting was also good but with some lows. Natalie smile is so, so, so cute and really adds a ""real"" touch to her character. To complete the bouquet, the soundtrack is good and it fits nicely in the plot. <br/><br/>When I came to IMDb after seeing it, I noticed the writer/director: Zach Braff. Wow, another big surprise to me... I really look forward for his next movies.<br/><br/>I had low hopes for this movie, but what a blow in the face... This is really a excellent movie.

"necredeye","8","0","1","3 January 2005"," Not the Must See of the year, but...
","Garden State was good. Especially as a first film for Zach Braff. The directing was simple but well enough. The writing was superior overall. Some parts were eh, but it was written very realistically (who didn't identify with at least one character, or know someone very like them?) and at times was utterly hilarious.<br/><br/>The times that didn't work well for me was when Braff started to go ""deep"" and it ended up sounding very phony. The comedy was brilliant, but not all of the deep moments translated well. These are simple mistakes by a first time writer. I would be very surprised if this was Braff's best film. I expect good things to come.<br/><br/>I rated this movie an 8. It isn't great, its not what everyone says, but there is something about it that makes you like it. Like i said, i expect Braff to improve. The reply value of this movie, for me, is about a 4/10. I'd watch it again, but I don't think I could watch it very often.<br/><br/>As others have said, Natalie Portman was awesome, especially in her beginning scenes. She was outstanding. If she was nominated for best supporting actress I would be OK with the nomination, but I don't think she deserves to win. It was good, but for the type of movie and character, I don't think it was Oscar worthy.<br/><br/>Good flick. Rent it."

Imagine writing a script, then directing and starring in it. One of the reasons I was so taken with this movie is because of the dialogue. It's just so real, I could really relate to some of the things that people said in this film because people really DO say things like that. I really hate movies like Mean Girls because no one really talks like that and no one really acts like that. Aside from that, the acting in this movie was phenomenal. Natalie Portman and Zach Braff have so much chemistry on-stage and all of the actors made this movie a pleasure to watch."

It is a great real-life story that unfolds as the main character is brought back to his high school antics of drugs and friends. I can't say I really connected with the whole drug aspect of the film, but it was easy to get into the storyline no problem. I'm just saying that you don't have to have had a life like the characters in this film to truly relate to its' ideas and messages of living life. It is a nice way to look at many different aspects of your life and the lives of other people that you may have known. I definitely recommend this movie to everyone.

","Garden State is a fun little movie where the characters are real which is what makes it funny. I grew up in New Jersey and still run into high school friends who, 18 years later, still haven't really changed. Garden State is touching and funny and cleverly written. Its is also well acted and the characters have depth beyond most characters in a comedy. The only problem I had with it is that Braff tries desperately not to make a ""hollywood"" film yet he ends up giving us an ending that is text book generic teen movie/romantic comedy. Not that the ending ruins the movie but its a bit annoying that this movie is hailed as a breakthrough change of pace but its ending is anything but. I sat there thinking ""in any other movie the ending will be this, I wonder how this one will end. Oh, the same way."""

"a_moral_imperative","Null","0","1","1 January 2005"," Could have been so much better
","A lot of people try to figure out whether or not the movie they saw was really good or really bad. It's either garbage or extremely misunderstood. To put in my own $0.02 i'd say this film is neither. It's an average drama with an interesting premise and a great soundtrack.<br/><br/>First the good stuff. The soundtrack is by far the best thing about the movie. How can you lose using anything from Nick Drake? Coldplay's ""Don't Panic"" never hurts, either. When I found out the main character had been on lithium I thought it would be an excellent thing to address in a film today. I don't feel there's enough said about kids on meds and how the current generation y is more a victim of this sadness than any other. I thought Zach Braff overall did a pretty believable portrayal of his character.<br/><br/>I had no expectations before seeing this film so i think what i feel isn't total b.s. I really think Natalie Portman's a pretty girl and there is something to be said about crying on cue, but this role just ain't hers. She just can't convince me she's anyone but Natalie Portman. Beautiful,just not a very good actress. And it's not *because she's a hot lady, see Naomi Watts and Milla Jovovich. She just overacts in a lot of her scenes and I don't think she thought more into putting much originality into it. It's a shame because there was potential there somewhere, but Natalie never seems to feel totally comfortable with letting loose. Even her screaming is uptight.<br/><br/>Another huge problem besides Natalie's acting are the supporting characters. Maybe I'm too sensitive about this because i'm a Wes An- derson fan and think that for every quirky thing a movie shamelessly adds to a supporting character they should equally add something important to the script or narrative. Not for inside jokes or laughs, but something adding to the theme. There is a theme to this film, but it's as if the director wanted to make this generation-defining film, and it was more important than making a great or original film.<br/><br/>From what I gather one of the themes, a very good one i admit, is that being sober and feeling pain is more important than numbing everything out. If there were any other themes in this movie, then i have to ask, did they apply to the character who works at Midevil Times? Or did Zach just think it would be funny to shoot a guy wearing a suit of armor? Did the fact that Zach's father was so stiff really make sense? I could understand he may have held resentment or anger at his son, but he seemed too reserved for having just lost a woman he was in love with for many years. <br/><br/>I almost think that the gratuitous sex scene in the movie theatre was so that the film could be rated r., thus making it an Oscar contender. That's sadly the way it goes, folks.<br/><br/>To sum it up i think Zach Braff is a talented guy. But this film at best targets a specific audience bracket to which this 25 year-old guy is just outside of. It's not that I didn't appreciate the premise and its theme, just that I have seen movies that have tried to make the audience care about the protagonist by throwing in as many eccentric characters as they can. Bottom line: it tried too hard and is just average."

","26 year old lithium-taking, depressed actor Braff, who has been detached from his family for years, receives word that his estranged mother has passed. He decides to take a small vacation to go back home to New Jersey and attend the funeral and reconcile with his psychiatrist father. Writer-Director Braff has some great ideas, many of which work but the film makes it's points early on and then repeats them throughout. This makes for a fairly whiny film at times. Also, the camera shots are often very centered which quickly becomes gimmicky and distracts the viewer. Luckily, there are enough good moments for it to overcome most of its faults. Subplot about reconnecting with father Holm never quite gels. Braff is charming in the lead, but Portman steals the show as the quirky compulsive-liar Sam.<br/><br/>**1/2 out of ****"
"silverocelot2001","Null","0","1","12 December 2004"," Zach Braff's directorial debut is a masterpiece!
","This film is brilliant. The acting is splendid. Braff conveys exceptional talent through acting so well, writing a screenplay worthy of an Academy Award and a Golden Globe. Sarsgaard and Portman match him ""line for line."" It is unlikely that Portman will win a major acting award for this film as most judges would probably rather favour her performance in ""Closer."" Still, she shows that she is capable of undertaking multi-layered acting roles and I am glad that she has not left her career to ""teen sex-romp comedies."" Sarsgaard ability to act through body language deserves an award of its own. Also every other character brings an element of twenty-something teenage generation X angst to the film.<br/><br/>The script is very well-crafted as Braff uses each nuance of character and plot detail in order to convey his message and say, social commentary on how commercialism has affected the lives of American Generation- Xers, which lie somewhere ""left"" of Bohemianism, amongst a sub-culture, that has been a part of my life too for many years. In fact, I was able to relate to the ""Klingon"" issue; my friend speaks ""Klingon."" I also used to collect trading cards and remember having friends who often preached as to the potential value of their collections. The dialogue is ingenious and the characters execute comic timing to perfection. Rarely do I deem a film hilarious but Garden State deserves such a title because of Braff's ability to merge original comedic moments with universal dramatic irritations seamlessly.<br/><br/>The cinematography is terrific. This is evident in the scene where Braff is on a couch amongst his ""repetitive"" drug-induced friends, where the ""passing of time effect,"" while he remains static is established beautifully. The soundtrack is also excellent and it is deserved of its proposed Grammy and Oscar nominations. Well done to Zach Braff, who at 26 has created a life-changing gem. Cheers. I need to catch-up on my Scrubs viewing and that film, ""The Broken Hearts' Club."""

","I've always viewed projects like Garden State, Eternal Sunshine, and Better Luck Tomorrow as films, not movies. <br/><br/>Movies are a way to escape our lives and kill a few hours. Films, on the other hand, are designed to make us reflect on our life, where we have been, where we are going, and who we choose to take along with us on our unique ride.<br/><br/>Garden State, as a film, is unique, unusual, and very bitter sweet. It's Hollywood-esque ending is the only thing holding this film back from the top 50.<br/><br/>Braff's incredible, and very touching view on reality is second to none, his characters and the situations that he presents are well though out, well written, and wonderfully acted.<br/><br/>The soundtrack, which serves as an art piece to hoist the film into the realm of greatness, serves its purpose with much disregaurd of the modern rules of pop culture (with the exception of Coldplay, still VERY enjoyable).<br/><br/>It's hard to tell everyone that they will love this movie, as I can see why some people don't; they don't like Braff, or ""the-day-my-life-changed"" style of films. Some people don't enjoy films at all, and would rather waste their time on big budge movies, no talent, horrific movies. <br/><br/>I'm a fan of the indie style, and I don't enjoy it when people call films like this cliché just because the characters were in the same age bracket and do drugs in a couple of scenes, which are very well done by the way.<br/><br/>Overall, your view on this film will change dependent on your trek throughout life, what problems your going through, and your perception of reality. For me; I found this to be the most enjoyable film since Eternal Sunshine and Better Luck Tomorrow. It's a great year in film, and it's good to finally see an amazing new face in cinema. Braff, whether he knows it or not, is one of the most amazing of fledgling talent springing from the heart of Hollywood. <br/><br/>Don't pass this amazing film up, it changed my view of reality and will make your perception of your life and relationships alter in ways you never thought possible. 10/10 and I cannot believe Braff has gone unheard from for so long."

"swmacleod06","9","0","1","25 November 2004"," Garden State Discourse
","Zach Braff (Scrubs fame) has essentially created a very simplistic romantic comedy, looking at the film at its core, however he has also successfully added layers of depth that makes the film stand out by focusing on issues of self-discovery, confronting the past, and the father -son relationship. <br/><br/>Braff, who wrote, directed, and starred in the film, plays the main character, Andrew Largeman, also known throughout the film as 'Large', a reasonably successful young actor who has spent his entire life hooked up on drugs prescribed to him by his demanding father, played by Ian Holm. When he finds out about his mother's death he takes a 'vacation' to his hometown that he hasn't visited in nine years. Large finds many of his old quirky friends still living in the town and attempts to escape confrontation with his father by spending time with them. By sheer luck he runs into a girl called Sam (Natalie Portman) who is unlike anyone he has ever met. Her free will and optimistic spirit allow Large to reveal the joys and heartache of his life. <br/><br/>Smart, witty, and offbeat humour is found throughout the film, but Braff is smart enough to keep his character true to itself. He achieves this by making other characters retort subtle and comical remarks at just the right moments and fails to fall in the trap of constructing humour purely for the sake of it. <br/><br/>The strong cast line-up provides absolutely superb acting, especially the instance chemistry that can be felt between Large and Sam from the get-go. Braff stays true to his character throughout the film and delivers a performance that shows his versatility and ability to know exactly how the character could be portrayed successfully. Portman is the highlight of the cast and supplies a performance that is almost Oscar-worthy as the self-confessed liar, Sam. Other minor characters, such as Holm as Large's controlling father and psychiatrist, Gideon, also perform admirably considering the quirky roles each were given.<br/><br/>Minor faults, such as Braff's attempt to attach unusual traits to all of his characters, that sometimes the drama seems too forced in certain scenes, and also the glorified happy ending are understandable and can be forgiven due to it being Braff's first effort. <br/><br/>The emotional connection established between the characters thanks to the intelligently well -written script combined with the brilliant soundtrack simply make it the best film of the year to date."

Every explanation I give (the airport scene, the ASTOUNDING quarry scene), makes it sound clichéd. But the great strength of this film is the fact that it is so real. All the characters are three-dimensional. It is so clear that Braff has moulded both the Garden State and its characters out of a great love. That love has not been diluted in making the film. The character of Sam breaks my heart and I feel such a bond with Large that it's hard to ignore. In the late '70s there was a period where year after year amazing films were put out - The Godfather 1 and 2, The Deer Hunter, Ordinary People (OK I know that's 1980) - this is the first film I have seen that reflects that power. It is a story with flesh, bones, blood and nerves. It is a living, breathing thing. It gets inside your head and resides there. I am a 23 year old male and I rarely cry in movies. But I have wept twice now when seeing this. Not because it is in anyway sad but because it is so beautiful. The hope that is latent in it is overwhelming. My medicated generation can be free!

Garden state is a movie that was meant to show internal hardship. We see the coming of emotions froma person who hasn't felt any for a long time. And we see this happening while falling in love, hanging out with old friends (self-demons) learning to understand his father, while dealing with the hardship of a dead mother. This movie wasn't about anything but being born again. Learning what life is, and separating yourself from the daily grind of waking up, going to work, and paying taxes, the life most people in this country seemly revel upon.

","It's interesting when a film receives critical praise and adulation from the masses (thus propelling it into the top rankings on IMDb) and yet so many focus their efforts to argue the point. Is it good or is it bad?<br/><br/>This is naturally a subjective art, but in a year where supposed great quirky films such as I HEART HUCKABEES serve only to disappoint, a film like GARDEN STATE really blew me away. This should garner an Oscar for best original screenplay simply because of the originality of the story and the excellent dialogue. It reminded me of a young-person's version of SIDEWAYS, which is a huge compliment. The fact that I'm in my mid-30's should tell you, however, that you don't have to be young to enjoy it.<br/><br/>Each character was perfect (especially Natalie Portman and Peter Saarsgard) but I would agree the mannerisms and voice of Zach Braff reminded me of a strange cross between Ray Romano and Mark Ruffalo. That didn't take away from his performance, but it just made it a little strange.<br/><br/>Perhaps the greatest strength of this film is the humor and how it is conveyed to the audience. Rather than setting up obvious pratfalls and quickly cutting away to reinforce the joke, this movie isn't afraid to pause and linger on the funny elements. It worked incredibly well and at this point of 2004 I'd have to rate it the funniest film I've seen all year.<br/><br/>For those who haven't seen this, I highly recommend that you check it out.<br/><br/>9/10<br/><br/>ebhp"

","Andrew Largeman comes home to New Jersey after nine years of estrangement from his family. He has been numbed by drugs that render him immune to all emotion, yet decided to purposely forget his medication for his mother's funeral. Life lessons ensue about finding yourself as well as making that one connection with the person you are desperately trying to find.<br/><br/>The film has a promising premise, and succeeds on many levels. For first time writer/director/star Zach Braff, this was an exceptional first outing. Having the talent to write and direct a film as involved as this is an achievement with the experience he has. His musical selections were wonderful, fitting each scene with the right amount of emotion, and enough zeal to be part of the scene, yet not distracting from the story.<br/><br/>That being said, the film is also less successful on other levels. Being a first time director, Braff must learn not to jump around from shot to shot so much for it ended up making the film feel very choppy. The ending scene to this film is one particular case, where the song sung by Frou frou holds the quick camera shots together, as they jump from one to another.<br/><br/>Braff had so much to take care of on this film as well, that he should have casted someone else for the part of Andrew Largeman. The emotion that he does eventually show comes off as fake anyway, and the audience is supposed to think he's finally experiencing some kind of emotion. But due to his still weak acting skills, you can aways tell that Braff is acting, or simply repeating the lines off of a screenplay he wrote.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman, the big name in the cast, was also unfortunately miscast int his film. To be in a film like this, there must be two ordinary people who make a connection and become something together. With this film, Portman's beauty distracts the people from the relationship between Samantha and Andy, not to mention the strange appeal there is of seeing Braff and Portman together as a screen couple. She does what she can, however, and turns in a decent performance as Samantha.<br/><br/>Braff truly has a career in the making with this film, however. Though not perfect, it is one step in the road to a hopefully successful career. With more improvement, Braff could indeed be one of the next top directors/writers in the business. Film recommended for the awesome music choices and intriguing story.<br/><br/>MJR"

","Zach Braff quickly became my hero after I watched this film. You rarely see a director/writer/actor that can make the awkwardness, laughter, and sadness seem so real. This film ia a brilliant representation of life, and the pain and joy that life can bring. The casting was great, and I could not help traveling to see this film again. As a hopeless romantic, I can only hope that I am half as open as the characters of this film. The emotional vulnerability brought about on screen is just awe inspiring, and I truly believe that is one of the hardest things to do. There is an attention to human life, and normal conversational dialouge that will leave you feeling the same awkwardness that you would fell in the characters shoes. Above all films in the last year, I can honestly say that this has become my favorite. I recommend that everyone see this film. Tell all of your friends, your family, and take your significant others to see this film. It will make you think, it will make you sad, and it will make you long for someone to love you.

It feels young and nostalgic at the same time. I must give Zach braff credit for making such a great debut. Well done.<br/><br/>The acting is very good, especially Natalie Portman, what a actress. She touched me greatly in ""Anywhere But Here"" with a subtle, emotional performance; and in ""Garden State"", she displayed a totally different (but just as intriguing) personality---the vibrant, quirky yet adorable Sam.<br/><br/>Peter Sarsgaard never disappoints me. Ian Holm is quite decent as well. Zach isn't all that brilliant as an actor, but he's still convincing.<br/><br/>To those who said ""people who like this movie need to grow up"": Don't be so silly and arrogant.

","When I first saw the commercials for Garden State on TV, I became immediately drawn to it. Even though there was a very vague account of what actually happens in the movie in the actual commercial, I kept wanting to see it. When I finally did, I was pleasantly surprised. Zach Braff has made his directorial debut for this film and it was, I have to say, quite a good job. The visual direction was amazing, adding to the plot line. The script was very well written, and when I actually saw it played out on screen it read like it was an actual story. There's a difference between real and fake and the conversations especially between Natalie Portman and Zach Braff seemed authentic, which also gained it points. Peter Sarsgaard and Ian Holm complimented the film nicely but it was the heartbreaking and sweet scenes between Natalie Portman and Zach Braff that really did it for me. Despite a typical ending, overall I recommend this movie to anyone who has ever felt mentally and emotionally lost in their lives and suddenly find a new direction to go on."

","This is the first time I've felt compelled to write comments for a movie on IMDb-and it is not for any good reasons. Garden State was watchable up until Natalie Portman entered the picture. The odd thing is that I usually enjoy Portman's performances. So what was the problem? The writing! Portman's character was so atrociously written: a cross between a cute bubble gum teenager and a young adult trying so hard to be interesting and far too sentimental. Everything else from then on was downhill. <br/><br/>Braff is a semi-decent director but is one of the worst writers ever. Even the shots that were intriguing, though, really owe little to Braff and more to Lawrence Sher. Braff attempts to cram in far too many idiosyncrasies, quirks, and melodramatic character traits. ***Spoilers*** Largeman (Braff) is an actor who paralyzed his recently deceased mother and has a father / psychiatrist who has overly medicated Largeman since boyhood. Then Sam (Portman) is an epileptic and compulsive liar who used to ice skate but now makes funny noises whenever she is nervous and buries pet hamsters in the pet cemetery in her backyard. When you actually write or say all of this out loud, it really sounds so absurd<br/><br/>Which is at the crux of the problem for Garden State-it is all so absurd, absurdly stylized and plotted, and nothing rings true to life. Like so many acts in Hollywood, whether it's a Coppola family tie or some other relation, it's obvious Braff was able to make this project happen simply because of his mediocre fame and heritage connections, which are all too obvious in a cast where it seems everyone is Jewish, and yet again we have the typical scripted scene in American cinema with a random spiel about what it's like to be in that 'God's People' religion. ----3/10"

","In a summer that proved to be a great disappointment(Van Helsing, Troy, etc), Garden State provides about two hours of relief. It's fresh, original, and full of odd yet brilliant humor. The movie succeeds mainly due to two factors: the writing and the performances. The movie stars Peter Saarsguard, Natalie Portman, and Zachary Braff. Personally, I've always been a big fan of Saarguard, especially after his appearances in the Salton Sea and Shattered Glass. He continues to shine in Garden State, and one can only hope that it will lead to more roles for the widely underrated talent. Natalie Portman steals the show, though, in a role that is far from her role in the latest Star Wars installments(thank god). She has the ability to make you laugh while secretly feeling your heart drop, and her chemistry with Zachary Braff is incredible. As far as Zachary Braff is concerned, his performance is also noteworthy(even if he looks like Ray Ramono), but its his writing that really impressed me. Who knows, maybe he'll join the ranks of Wes Anderson and Charlie Kauffman and continue to make comedies that are different from the rest. It's too early to tell, but for now, check out Garden State, because if it's any indication, Braff may be a force to be reckoned with in the future."

He's the weird character J.D. ""Scrubs,"" a great television show. The movie does a lot of things right: it explores how one childhood trauma can ruin your life, how you easily can become disillusioned with your parents (or embarrassed by them), and how there is a desire to get away from everything in your life - be it with drugs, moving to another state, or ignoring what bothers you most. I can identify with most of it - but that doesn't mean that I really wanted to watch it. There are some little funny vignettes but they are far apart. Portman is at her best though here - she definitely is the highlight of the movie and without her I don't know if I could have bared to watch.

"Pavel-8","7","0","1","31 August 2004"," Sometimes brilliant, but also flawed.
","**Minor Spoilers Ahead!!**<br/><br/>As the latest indie film phenomenon, ""Garden State"" echoes ""Good Will Hunting"" in content and approach. Both are set in New England; both are about a young man finding himself while interacting with a girl. Both have moments of revealing truth that will strike a chord with most anyone. Not coincidentally, both are penned by young men as their first screenplays. Therefore unsurprisingly, ""Garden State"" soars at times, but also stumbles at times, resulting in an uneven but ultimately worthwhile cinematic experience. <br/><br/>The film is the brainchild of 29-year old writer/director/star Zach Braff (NBC's ""Scrubs""), and it follows in the footsteps of last year's ""Lost in Translation"", gently telling a simple story of two people who find each other in a crazy world. Andrew (Braff), a L.A.-based actor, returns home to New Jersey (The Garden State...get it?) after a decade long absence. He reunites with his father and childhood buddies, and finds a new friend named Sam (Natalie Portman). As he explores those relationships and himself, he eventually discovers who he is and what he wants. <br/><br/>In many ways, it's a typical coming-of-age story, but it often supersedes the genre. Set to a mellow Simon & Garfunkel (etc.) soundtrack, the film purports to be a comedy, and over the first half, does provide several humorous incidents. Not slapstick comedy, but rather a low-key observational humor described well in a paraphrase of Sam (Natalie Portman), ""If you can't find the humor in life, you won't enjoy it much."" While this is of course true, ""Garden State"" tarries too long on Andrew's dissatisfaction with the people of his previous life. Some dysfunctional scenes are necessary to establish from whence Andrew came, but they overwhelm too much of the film. Credit Braff for firmly creating an unhappy world, but in a situation that is familiar to most viewers, such redundance soon becomes just that.<br/><br/>The supersession occurs in the moments. Quiet moments. Intimate moments. Moments of frighteningly frank dialogue between two people. Moments that, more than anything else, reflect sheer honesty about issues that haunt twenty-somethings. Stripping oneself naked about themes like family, love, and future. These are the moments Braff dazzles wearing all three hats. Through his actions and direction he radiates the earnestness of the words he wrote, believing them as perhaps no one else could. These are also the moments that Portman earns her paycheck. A number of young stars could have played the off-the-wall portions, but most could not have sat down on a fireplace or staircase and assiduously asked questions. These moments are at the warm core of ""Garden State"", even though many of them don't occur until the last thirty minutes. <br/><br/>That part of the problem with the film. While providing a few amusing incidents in the first half, ""Garden State"" meanders around for too long, heading loosely toward something, before finally veering onto the road and surging forward with purpose in the strong closing scenes. Of course, if the sometimes clumsy script had eliminated any number of gratuitous scenes, the running length would have been too short, but portions could have been added or extended as well. <br/><br/>One sequence in particular seemed to be blatantly missing a few pieces. Andrew realizes something upon leaving a boat, but the events on board don't properly stimulate such a reaction. I understand what was supposed to happen, and since such an epiphany was inevitable in this sort of movie, I have little trouble accepting the change, but the impetus is lacking. Something had to have been clipped, axed, or otherwise altered, and that lack deprives the audience of another potentially brilliant moment, a pivotal one that could have highlighted the entire film.<br/><br/>Being a twenty-something similarly searching for many of the same ideals as Andrew, I want to like this movie more; I want to rate it higher. But the flaws anchor down even a film with such remarkably resonant moments. In that way, ""Garden State"" is like the life it reflects. There are painful moments, but there are also glorious moments that crescendo the film to phenomenal heights. <br/><br/>Bottom Line: Call it 7 of 10, kicked up a notch for the younger crowd. This one will probably be higher than it should be on my year-end Top Ten list."

","Garden State was written and directed by the affable Zach Braff from the television show Scrubs. He now enters the feature film arena with an offering that is surprisingly confident and entertaining.<br/><br/>In the dramedy, Braff plays Andrew Largeman, a man who has returned to his hometown to attend the funeral of his mother. He hasn't been to his old stomping ground in quite some time, but finds that not much has changed. Sure, one of his old buddies has become a millionaire thanks to a clever invention, but this hasn't changed who he is in the slightest. Yes, everything is all too familiar, including some unresolved tension between he and his father (played by Ian Holm). Upon reconnecting with his old friends, Largeman makes a new acquaintance in the form of a young, tale-telling woman (played by Natalie Portman). Slowly, the two begin to fall for each other.<br/><br/>Braff plays Largeman with a good deal more restraint than his TV personae, and his dry sense of humor and deadpan delivery is on target much of the time. He isn't, however, always equal to the dramatic scenes, he has fashioned for himself. The big confrontational moments between him and Ian Holm aren't quite as affecting as they aspire to be. Still, Braff does have a natural screen presence and this is a side of him we haven't seen on Scrubs. <br/><br/>Natalie Portman is absolutely radiant as the young woman of Largeman's affection. She positively glows here in a turn that is energetic and sincere. Her character is a bit taxing in the early goings, but I completely warmed up to her, and by the end of the picture, it was clear that Portman had taken the concept of the love-interest and re-invented it."

There is only one major medical flaw in this film. Zach's character refers to an incident in his childhood when he accidentally pushed his mother down.

Braff's character, Andrew Largemen, is so well written, I thought it was written about everyone who wants out of small town America. The entire cast, soundtrack (which is phenomenal), and the crew did great work to make an American masterpiece here. Please, go see this film, you will feel better after doing so!"

She has this amazing charm to her that I find absolutely endearing. Every time she laughed that sweet goofy laugh of hers, I couldn't help but form a goofy laugh of my own.<br/><br/>I love good, intelligent, dark comedy...and that's what this was all the way. There were some great moments in this one..and the best were the random, off-the-wall ones that caught you out of left field.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this film. Finally, something new instead of the same recycled schlock. Granted, it's still a boy-meets-girl, falls in love, etc film...but it was done creatively and in such a manner that it engrossed you in the plot, and you can't ask for anything else out of a film.<br/><br/>I would go see this one again in the theater, and that's REALLY saying something for me. 10/10 Baby."
"sslcynic","10","0","1","3 September 2004"," The Best Film in a LONG Time
","Outstandingly well written, directed, produced, acted and perfectly cast - Garden State is without a doubt my favorite film in the past year, five years... ever?<br/><br/>Garden State speaks to me on a level that I cannot possibly describe in words. As another IMDb'er mentioned, this is THE movie that really defines our generation. Zach Braff's light-hearted, yet deeply moving film is EXACTLY what I have been looking for in a film for a long time. Most films sacrifice either humor or drama and depth for the other. Garden State is a winner on both counts, bringing just the right amount of laughs while developing a spectacular set of characters.<br/><br/>Until now, I haven't been especially impressed with Natalie Portman's talent as an actress. Not to say she didn't do a great job in the Professional at a young age, but I think she has found few roles in between that really make her stand out as the talented young woman that she is.<br/><br/>She found it in Garden State.<br/><br/>Her character just came alive. I couldn't believe how in love I was with Sam from the moment we met her . I haven't felt that kind of attachment to a film character in a long time, if ever. I just wanted that girl to be real. I have to admit I know a couple that are close, but not quite as neurotic. I also have to give props to Zach Braff for writing such an awesome part for her to play, along with his excellent acting job as Andrew.<br/><br/>Peter Sarsgaard was excellent as Mark, on par with Portman's performance. I loved his ability to express a down-and-out life with an awkwardly positive spin. It is the unique personalities of all the young actors playing within uniquely dysfunctional families just really makes this film a masterpiece for our generation.<br/><br/>Anyone in their late teens and early twenties can certainly find a little bit of themselves in Garden State.<br/><br/>My hat is off to you, Mr. Braff."
"amberncarrier","10","0","1","3 September 2004"," A spectacular, perfect movie
","This movie is amazing. The cinematography, the script and dialogue, the acting, everything about it is spectacular. Zach Braff really showed that he is a true master of the art of film, in more ways than one. Natalie Portman did the best acting I've ever seen her do, and all the characters seemed to come to life to me, and I cared about them at the end of the film.<br/><br/>This film paralleled my life in more ways than one, with the exception of the medication he was on and the domineering father. It was a brilliant movie, and I'd recommend it to anyone. The movie not only had great overtures and themes, but had a lot of subtle things that I picked up on that just tied every bit of it together into one realistic and thought provoking package. I give it an 11 out of 10."
"tatc1088","10","0","1","3 September 2004"," this movie is simply amazing
","Garden State is a moving, hilarious, heartwarming film that was simply amazing. this movie is about Andrew Largeman(Zach Braff), an early 20 year old actor from Los Angeles, and his return home for his mother's funeral. Largeman is emotionally drained from a life of medication and taking a break from his meds, he enjoys life and learns to love from Sam (Natalie Portman).<br/><br/>this film was so moving to me. I usually don't like art films or understand the metaphors, but i felt that this movie was simply perfect. I am a junior in high school, and for me to see and identify with characters is rare in a movie like this one, but this film had an effect on me that will last. i saw a review that said that high school kids would not understand this movie or appreciate. this review was incorrect and i would gladly go see this movie again."
"Sneaky_Pete_XXVI","10","0","1","3 September 2004"," Possibly the most heart-warming picture since Forrest Gump
","Garden State goes above and beyond my expectations. Truly, this film cannot get any better. Led by the exceptional acting by Natalie Portman and followed by Zach Braff, Peter Sarsgard, and Ian Holm, this film should be in any viewers top ten list. I cannot stress how uplifting this movie is; it possibly could be the most ""hopeful"" movie since Shawshank. Zach Braff does have the magic eye of a director and should be praised for this crowning achievement. The movie takes on a blend of Lost in Translation and Eternal Sunshine. The realization of one overcoming their ""numbness"" from drugs is portrayed perfectly by Zach Braff in both the direction and the writing. One of the best, if not the best film of the year."
"ortenzia","Null","0","1","23 August 2004"," 'i hope you liked me'
","I'm not quite sure what 'Garden State' is in terms of film. It's not your classic film about alienation, or about being young, or about dealing with death, or drugs, or love. Really, it's a film about one character trying to be anything other than numb and the rest of it is all in the little details.<br/><br/>I think it's probably better not to know what it's about because the whole film is shot so that the dialogue explains what the characters have been doing five minutes after they started acting it. Really though, although the story is decent, it's not one of the films better features due to the fact that the middle/endish fall into the traps of quick realization, connection, 'yoda-esque character which explains life to all' which go against the whole point of making a film which strives towards realism.<br/><br/>However, the film has some beautiful little details -- every couple of minutes the actors hit a point where they just do it up right (peter sarsgard, why aren't we paying more attention to his work?), or a line is brilliantly written (the main character tells a group of kids 'see you later' right before he's about to take a hit of ecstacy), or the move of a camera catches something beautifully (the light off of a pool taking the foreground of a shot making the whole frame celestial). Really, these snapshots were the film for me and there's a couple more that make this film worth seeing once, maybe twice. <br/><br/>Zach Braff really channels his inner auteur in this film, suggesting one day he's going to direct something far better once he gets past his fuzzy, pink cheeked youth self-consciousness as a filmmaker. Natalie Portman, although still suffering from her need to please big emotional moments over trying to capture a character, has great chemistry with Braff and hits her lines enough to get over her room for improvement. <br/><br/>Past that, the soundtrack is excellent (i recommend just buying the cd even if you don't plan on seeing the movie), this movie can be considered a love story and it can be considered a comedy, and I really don't understand why they're calling it 'this summers' Lost in Translation.' It has enough to separate itself from the suburban alienation lot (Ice Storm, Virgin Suicides, Ordinary People, Pieces of April)-- and despite the script problems, it really does stand on its own as a great, little film."
"eanderson-7","10","0","1","1 September 2004"," It's good to know someone's still making art
","The movie was incredible. Better than Lost in Translation, better than Eternal Sunshine, though somewhat reminiscent of both. Zach Braff is a rising star, obviously talented- funny, deep, artistic. The movie raised a poignant question about a cultural and generational crisis- pointed out the obvious and growing trend of anaesthesizing ourselves to life, which we seem to be turning a blind eye to. It was just beautiful. One of the best movies I've seen all year. Well worth seeing- refreshing, eye opening, breath taking, amazing. The sound track alone may have made the movie worth seeing. Do yourself a favor, go see it. And if its not playing in your city, preorder the DVD. It's that good. My only point of disagreement: redemption isn't found in people or in relationships--- but nothing's perfect.<br/><br/>In the words of Henry Miller, ""The aim of life is to live, and to live means to be aware, joyously, drunkenly, serenely, divinely aware."" Braff seems to get this and the moral of this story is a variation on the theme."
"jdgratz","10","0","1","28 August 2004"," I tend to go into movies with very high expectations.
","Many times, my expectations lead to a sub-par experience at some of the highest touted movies. I remember purchasing My Big Fat Greek Wedding on DVD without having ever gotten the chance to see it in the theater. Based on reviews from professionals and friends alike, I was sure I couldn't go wrong. That movie went right to the used-book and CD store the immediate next day.<br/><br/>So, being a huge fan of Scrubs, I allowed myself to label this movie as a possibility of being one of the best movies I had seen this year. Well, it's always a wonderful treat when my expectations are met or exceeded, and this was one of those instances.<br/><br/>Several things made this movie tremendous, but three aspects stand-out the most. <br/><br/>First, the writing. When I heard of this movie, I immediately thought that through Braff's ability to portray the character he conveys in Scrubs, that he would have a good mind for dialogue in his own right. He has always seemed to suggest that his character is contrived of his own fruition, which means that no other actor could satisfy the role quite the same.<br/><br/>Second, Natalie Portman. Wow! What an amazing way to grab a role and run with it. I have spent time as a counselor in a mental health facility, and probably more time being counseled. She hits this neuroses dead on. Clearly, the writing has a lot to do with her character, but the writing and the portrayal must blend together to form a cohesive role. Without the proper agreement, if you will, of casting and dialogue, a part, or entire movie, can fall by the wayside. I had my doubts about her abilities, until viewing this brilliant performance.<br/><br/>Finally, the cinematography. Having a friend who has recently began his career in this field, I've had the priveledge of gathering insight in to this somewhat unknown side of film-making. Granted, in this forum, it may not be so unknown, but to the layman, usually only the most bizarre of angles, lighting, and whatnot may grab attention to this side of film. In this film, I would go as far to say that if you turned the sound on mute and watched the entire film, it would still be intriguing enough to stick around until the very end. There are little touches and elements of, to create a new word, 'surreality', that make the movie have an almost inconceivable setting. But bring in the script and the acting, and the setting because impossible to deny.<br/><br/>Some points made me laugh. Some points made me cry. Some things kept me guessing. And some points made me wonder why. But, all in all, I have to say that barring the next couple of months, this movie ranks in my top 3 of this year, and it will be hard for many to contend."

","I wasn't expecting to like this film that much. Usually this weird, kind of off-beat movie is too . . . ummmm . . . off-beat, I guess, for my taste. I saw the preview for it and thought that Natalie Portman looked funny and quirky enough to maybe bring it up a notch. Boy was I wrong!!! I REALLY enjoyed this movie. It was still off-beat but it wasn't so much so that I had to rack my brain to figure it out. Basically, it's simple . . . sometimes you have to let people in to figure out who you are. You have to be able to laugh at yourself and be able to cry. Most of all, you need to find your ""home"",no matter where, who, or what that word means to you. There are parts of this movie that are just utterly . . . hopeful . . . and not in that fairy-tale, Disney kind of way. Don't get me wrong, there are still little annoying things in this film (isn't there something in every one) but it's nice to leave a theater feeling good about life,for once, no matter how screwed up it may be."

","While I absolutely loved this movie, I do not want to discount the opinions of those who did not. I am writing from the point of view of someone that understood exactly what Zach Braff's character was going through... <br/><br/>I have to disagree with the person that said that most people in their 20s aren't going through this. For those of us that just recently graduated from college and for those who maybe took a little longer to find their niche (my brother never went to college but took the round about way to finding what he wanted to do with his life), there is something about the journey that Largeman goes through that just rings true. His description of losing home was so perfect, I couldn't believe he hadn't read my mind before putting it in the movie.<br/><br/>In other commendations, the cinematography in this movie is stunning and the soundtrack is amazing. Natalie Portman is such an incredible actress and this film shows it. Zach Braff shows a new range that we hadn't seen from him and I think he did a great job both with acting and certainly with writing/directing this unique movie. It's now one of my favorite movies, as thought-provoking as American Beauty and quirky as Secretary. I recommend it for anyone who has ever questioned the way their life was headed and stopped to see the possibilities ahead."

Zach Braff has managed to maintain a balance between intense drama and natural humor. The result is the crazy feeling of love. Natalie Portman's overwhelming performance is a testament of that vision. The film had a quality that ran deep with ideas a young audience relates to. Carefully written, the core situations of the film are placed amidst specific settings that communicate his feelings and philosophies about his identity and the places that have shaped his life. This is the movie that filmmakers work their whole lives to make and it's amazing to see young Braff's first film succeed so wholeheartedly. This is the kind of work that was as fresh as real life, milking the medium of film for all its good worth.

I know this has all been said before... but Zach Braff is a real talent. What a REAL screenplay. People say that some lines felt ""scripted""... well, I disagree, cause I couldn't help but think of the way my friends and I communicate with one another, and there were so many lines or moments where I laughed and thought, ""Yep, been there!"" It truly felt like this movie was really speaking to me personally, and that's clearly why I love this movie. I just thought the characters were so real... and aside from all that, it was one of the most hilarious movies I've ever seen. I would take this over ANY comedy that's come out in the past 10 years... because the jokes in ""Garden State"" were subtle, and they were funny because they were REAL and not forced on you. So, in summation, I tip my hat to Zach Braff... for the past 10 years I've gone to the movies hundreds (if not thousands) of times, each time asking myself the same question: ""Will this be my new FAVORITE movie of all time?""

Zach Braff does an excellent job for his first directing effort and the script shows he really cared about the story.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman plays one of the most original characters in recent filmdom as Zach's love interest, Sam. Portman's acting makes the quirky Sam so natural and believable that it seems we are watching a home movie rather than a feature film.<br/><br/>Peter Sarsgaard, plays Zach's friend from his younger days, Mark. Although he is a grave digger, his character was just as natural and believable as Sam.<br/><br/>Braff, as Andew Largeman, who is estranged from his family, is summoned back to New Jersey after his mother pass away. To say he has issues is an understatement. He decides to take a vacation from the medications he has been on for years so he can reconnect with his family and home. He meets Sam at a Doctor's office one day and they hit it off.<br/><br/>Largeman's friends are still pretty much living the lives they lived when they were in high school as an early drug and sex party reveals. Andew can be seen as being out of place which would be common for someone who had been gone as long as he had been.<br/><br/>I thought that this movie would be a rip off of Zach's character from his TV show but I'm glad I was wrong. Although ""J.D."" does come out from time to time, this is Zach's movie.<br/><br/>Ian Holm plays Andrew's father but it seems Zach let this relationship and the confrontation that is hinted at disappear for no real reason. Jean Smart makes a great cameo as Mark's mother who still thinks she is a teenager and wants a hit off her son's bong. There is also a funny running bit involving all the various pets owned by the various people in the movie.<br/><br/>Although a great movie, besides the unresolved son/father issue, the film also dropped the issue with Mark robbing graves.

It turned out that the hype was the understatement of the year. I thought that this film was brilliant. The characters were so easy...so real, so tangible, and that made the arc of this film so much more visceral and beautiful. Natalie Portman has not been better since she starred in the Professional. It is alternately laugh-out-loud funny and tremendously heartwarming. As writer, director, and star, Braff astounds as Andrew Largeman, a troubled twenty-something who comes home to NJ to attend his mother's funeral. His relationship with his father, played by Ian Holm, is tenuous at best. They have not spoken since he left home almost ten years earlier. While home, Andrew reconnects with friends from his youth, meets Sam(Portman) and explores life in a way that is rarely captured on film.

","After wanting to see Garden State all summer, i finally got a chance to see it last week and was very satisfied. All of the ads are correct in that Zach Braff does have a very good filmakers eye and a rather witty sense of humor. Some of the shots and camera work were very original, for example, the shirt blending in with the wall and the mirror shot of him in the morning. It was also visible that he was truly passionate about exposing various memories of growing up. I also see room for improvement as this was his first movie. For example, he did try to get a little too cute in some scenes and was trying a little too hard, but for the most part this was a very well done film for a first time director. But he does not steal the show at all. Natalie Portman and Peter Sarsgard truly were the more talented actors here and really kept the movie going. I think that Natalie Portman should be considered for possible Academy Award or Golden GLobe nominations. Overall, i give this movie a 9/10."

","Maybe Tom Wolfe was right when he said that ""You can never go home again"", and perhaps Zach Braff has given us a new spin on this statement with his first film, ""Garden State"".<br/><br/>Braff plays an out-of-work, over-medicated actor/waiter living in Los Angeles.  The beginning of the film sees him called home to New Jersey to attend his mother's funeral.  Upon his arrival, he encounters high school friends and begins to discover what it means to feel after a lifetime of medicated numbness.<br/><br/>The thing that stands out in ""Garden State"" is the writing.  Braff has an incredible sense of specificity about his writing but is able to make it broad enough so that people of the college/post-collegiate generation can identify with it.  The interactions between Braff's character, ""Large"", and Natalie Portman's character, ""Sam"", serve not only as witty commentaries on life as someone in their mid-twenties, but also deep philosophical points about growing and maturing into adulthood.<br/><br/>While the writing is exemplary, the acting, direction, and cinematography do nothing to weigh down the material or lift it up to iconic standards.  I highly recommend ""Garden State"" for anyone in their twenties as you will inevitably learn something about your life and reflect on what it means to grow and move on into adulthood.<br/><br/>8/10"
"anhedonia","8","0","1","27 August 2004"," Portman sparkles in Braff's offbeat charmer
","[WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERS]<br/><br/>In a recent Washington Post online chat, writer/director/actor Zach Braff said Natalie Portman called her agent soon after meeting with Braff and announced she wanted to do this movie. After seeing it, I understand why.<br/><br/>This is Portman's finest adult role and her juiciest part since Marty in ""Beautiful Girls"" (1996). In ""Garden State,"" she enchants us with a performance that should, though likely won't, garner her a supporting actress Oscar nomination. Oh, if only she didn't make those wretched ""Star Wars"" movies.<br/><br/>Portman captures Sam's every nuance, turning her into a complex, intelligent, delightfully weird young woman. When Sam laughs, our world brightens; when she cries, our hearts shatter. Sam is the core of this film and Portman holds together the story and our attention with a gem of a performance. Watch Portman in just two scenes - in front of a fireplace and at the bottom of a flight of steps - and you'll see why this remarkable actress is in a wholly different class than her contemporaries.<br/><br/>Braff's Andrew ""Large"" Largeman is a far departure from his J.D. on TV's funniest sitcom, ""Scrubs."" Large's appeal comes from Braff wryly underplaying him, never allowing his scenes to become overwrought. Even an emotionally pivotal moment in a bathtub concludes beautifully with a clever comedic touch involving a paper cup.<br/><br/>Peter Sarsgaard gently transforms Large's friend Mark from somewhat of a jerk to a generous, real person. Sarsgaard's a gifted actor with an uncanny ability to give great depth to his characters with minute gestures and expressions.<br/><br/>Along with a bouncy soundtrack, the film boasts truly inspired moments. Despite working within the basic framework of romantic-comedies, Braff creates something oddly amusing and memorable in almost every situation, be it the opening shot of Large in bed, a lovely moment in Sam's backyard or a visit to a construction site. He also devises one of the more novel meet-cutes in a romantic-comedy and lets Portman's natural radiance make that moment shine.<br/><br/>As a writer and director, Braff finds a deft balance between quirky comedy and poignant drama. He never hurries his story and shows a splendid eye for detail. From a stuck gas pump nozzle to automatic faucets in an airport restroom to dusted fingerprints on the TV set in Sam's living room to Mark's mother's boyfriend, Braff smartly allows the moments' eccentricities play out without drawing attention to the details.<br/><br/>Not that ""Garden State"" is flawless. Braff occasionally tries too hard to be wacky and also loses his way in the last 10 minutes. The awfully conventional ending seems tacked on, like an afterthought, as if Braff suddenly felt the need to adhere to some screenwriting guru/hack's rules on how a movie should end. Given Large and Sam's budding relationship and states of mind, a less formulaic denouement would've been more convincing, fitted the tone of the film better. Braff, admittedly a Woody Allen fan, perhaps should have heeded Tracy's climactic words of wisdom in ""Manhattan"" - ""You have to have a little faith in people.""<br/><br/>There's little doubt Braff's a gifted storyteller. ""Garden State"" is one of the most assured directing debuts in years. Braff needs to learn how to tighten his stories a bit and have the courage to be slightly more atypical. But this is a sensationally good start to what should be a thoroughly promising and rewarding filmmaking career. I eagerly await his next work."

","I was actually not sure what to expect when I went to see this movie and was pleasantly surprised by it all. While it is not a perfect movie, it has characters and a story that are as complex as they are incredibly simple without making them into stereotypes of the silly female romantic lead or goofy stoner buddy. I usually like Natalie Portman because she makes most things she is in better than they actually are. I thought she was perfect as Sam, sweet but not overly goofy. For an actor that is pretty unknown outside of Scrubs, I thought Zach Braff just right without ever overdoing the apathy of being on all those prescription drugs and not acting like a crazy freed man once they left his system. Peter Sarsgaard was the first non-annoying stoner in the past decade and he had no stupid catchphrases...a first in Hollywood! He is always incredible anyways. Overall, I would give it an 8 because I really enjoyed the acting and some really great moments, but the story got me a little down, especially since I just moved home after being away for 5 years. I was surprised by some of the unexpected revelations made throughout the movie, and while I am not sure if anything gets resolved by the end of it, it is a movie for people who enjoy something different from the standard stuff that is out this summer."

The overriding theme of the movie (breaking away from your past and taking a chance on the future) is what I've been fighting in my own life for the last year or so, and it was so harrowing to see my entire thought process played out on screen.

"mmaapp","9","0","1","22 August 2004"," a great beginning...
","What a fabulous film. No, it wasn't flawless, but it had quite a bit going for it, much of which took me by surprise.<br/><br/>After the death of his mother, Andrew Largeman returns to his hometown after being away for 9 years. Putting on hold his ""numb"" existence as a struggling actor in LA, ""Large"" is confronted by his past. While his old friends have barely changed, Large can't reconnect with his old self, and starts to realize he really doesn't want to. After meeting Sam, an eccentric life-loving Natalie Portman, Large begins to understand what he has before him and how he has the ability to live his future without being anchored by his past. The themes of Large's story are universal, dissecting the ever-confusing emotions involving love, family, and friendship.<br/><br/>While this may be pinned instantly as a ""love story"", don't let it turn you off. Overall the dialogue is free of cliché romance conversation, however occasionally some one-liner about love and/or life stands out seeming too ""profound"" for the moment. Other than that, the dialogue is sharp and surprisingly comedic, poking fun at life's phoniness and various hypocrisies. <br/><br/>An engaging story, entertaining and funny, and screaming with symbolism, this is a great beginning for Zach Braff's directorial and writing career."
"presjerome7","8","0","1","22 August 2004"," I'll take it
","First and foremost, Braff is very good with his camera especially for a first time director. He has some beautiful shots that don't look like a freshman effort. Aside from this, he's an excellent quirky writer. The way he develops Largeman is well thought out and semi-brilliant. The same goes for Natalie Portman's character. You have a sense of understanding of these two characters that Braff orchestrated wonderfully. He does need to spend more time working on the supporting cast. Besides these two main characters, the rest is left for simple minded, walk-on roles that do not fit well with the others. Also he tends to focus on a few occurrences that are closer to meaningless than essential. I can overlook these few mistakes because the rest of the film holds water well. I loved his writing and his direction and am already looking forward to seeing a sophomore effort from Braff. ""Garden State"" truly is one of the better films of the summer even though it may be slightly flawed, but no one is perfect."

","Garden State was a great time capsule of the transition that young adults face when redefining themselves. I felt that the acting was superb, especially by Portman, Braft, and Sarsgaard. For a debut film I felt it had great continuity and possessed a genuine quality that most films lack and push for. Natalie Portman really does a fantastic job in this film, her ability to capture the simultaneous tearful laughter is reminiscent of of Checkov and his brilliant narrative. One of the great qualities of this movie was the acting, for only good acting can produce those moments when we know what the character is feeling with out obvious gesticulation and without the aid of lines to convey them.

"apergame","8","0","1","21 August 2004"," Beautiful and Sincere. Amazing.
","It blows my mind how a first time director in Zach Braff could muster such an effort to make this movie. The progression of cuts and scenes make the movie flow so well, and takes your perspective into the movie. Natalie Portman, in addition to being beautiful, does a great job, with subtleties that don't aim to be noticed, but add a sincere dimension to her character. I was really impressed by a scene where the camera has a close-up of her face, while she changes from a smile, to neutral, to a smile, which is hard to do sincerely. Zach Braff, though his acting is not up to par with Natalie Portman's, also does a great job making the character seem sincere. I felt myself not just drawn into his character, but as if I was having his experiences. Top all that off with a fantastic soundtrack, and you have a great movie."

But I was wrong, and the movie exceeded everything I imagined. As a writer, I firmly believe that good movies start with a great script. Garden State was written so well I actually forgot I was watching a movie. It was that fluid, everything down to the eerily real dialogue. Nothing seemed abrupt or out of place, even if it was completely abrupt and out of place. It was amazingly well shot, the camera angles and pans fit so well. The point of view and top hat shots added that extra something most movies miss. The mood was completely changed by the music, which didn't seem like a soundtrack as much as another character in the film. The cast was amazing. Zach Braff showed he doesn't have to be the funny guy, Natalie Portman's performance blew me away (which wasn't a surprise) and Peter Sarsgaard played the not-so-nice friend almost too well.<br/><br/>All of these elements (and quite a few more) combined to make an amazing movie. A movie that has heart, that can make you laugh, can make you cry. A movie that makes you think and gives you hope. A movie that is a completely original moment."
"gregsrants","8","0","1","22 August 2004"," One of the best of 2004
","I have never seen an entire episode of Scrubs. I couldn't even tell you what night it is on. I have seen snippets here and there as I flipped between likely inferior programming, but could I name a character or an actor that has donned a white coat on the NBC sitcom  no.<br/><br/>So when I heard that a new small budgeted film called Garden State was doing the festival circuit and was written/directed and starred Zach Braff the lead of the above mentioned sitcom, I was not exactly circling the release date on my desktop calendar. <br/><br/>But as the months went by since its premiere at Sundance, I could no longer ignore what critics were crowning as '..a hilarious and heartfelt ode to twentysomething angst' (Peter Travers  Rolling Stone), and a 'quirky sweet coming of age tale' (Boston Herald), I could ignore it no further.<br/><br/>Well, this reaffirms what critics are good for. They try and steer you from wasting your money on box office fodder and every once and a while, they use the power of print to help bring attention to a small gem that requires help to get recognized for what it deserves. <br/><br/>Garden State tells the story of Andrew Largeman (Zach Braff), a heavily medicated 26-year old that moved from Jersey to California to break into show business. Most known for playing a 'retard' in a football themed movie, Andrew comes back home after receiving a message that his mother has passed away in a freak drowning accident. <br/><br/>We don't know much about Andrew as he enters an environment he has shunned for 10 years, but like any good character driven story, the layers of the onion keep peeling and peeling revealing a very complex and tormented youth.<br/><br/>Most of the first quarter of the movie spends time with Andrew's re-introduction to old friends and family. They are about as quirky as they come without being too off the wall or unbelievable - barely. Mark (Peter Sarsgaard) is a gravedigger who steals jewelry from the dead before burial. Mark's mother is a mixed bag of nuts that is dating a knight from a dinner show production who wears his armor to breakfast, and Andrew's father is a doctor and psychiatrist that prescribed his son countless drugs in the ten years since their last encounter in efforts to stymie any emotion Andrew might feel from an unfortunate accident that occurred when he was nine. <br/><br/>As Andrew explores life off drugs and with his reacquainted friends, he is brought into a world of extremes where each experience is fascinating and revealing and where each newly introduced character is more eccentric than the last. Whether it is the rich former schoolmate who made a fortune selling his idea for silent Velcro or a couple that lives on a makeshift boat on the edge of a geological phenomena, not since The Royal Tenenbaums have there been such charismatic oddballs that are all so lovable and yet peculiar. <br/><br/>So when Andrew meets Sam (Natalie Portman) it is no surprise that she fits right into his world. Sam is an admitted liar who lives in a house as distinctive as her nature. The living room is like a scientific experiment gone awry with hamster tunnels erected like a full sized Lego castle. A Christmas tree still stands in the corner some three seasons removed from the holidays, and the backyard has a pet cemetery with countless makeshift headstones. But none of this seems out of place. Writer/Director Braff does a great job in his debut in keeping everything out of the ordinary almost, well, ordinary. Maybe it was the opening chapters where we see Andrew modeling a shirt made from leftover bathroom fabric or hearing a horrendous rendition of Three Times A Lady being sung at his mother's funeral. For whatever the situation, Braff uses dry humor and intelligent wit to keep us interested in people I can only hope not many of us can relate to. When Andrew awakens in a strange house to see a knight carrying a jug of milk, it is explained to us in reasonable terms without belaboring the point or trying to squeeze every last bit of humor from one cameo. <br/><br/>Maybe most surprising in his first attempt behind the big screen camera is how he developed and maintained great chemistry between Andrew and Sam. As he becomes more and more normal while recovering from his drug induced monotony, Sam becomes the complex character and we can understand why the two of them would find comfort and attraction in the other. <br/><br/>I don't know what Braff has next on his agenda, but like more seasoned directors Wes Anderson and Alexander Payne he has an incredible knack of bring a world that I can (thankfully) only appreciate in the confines of a crowded unlit room and his next film will undoubtedly be circled on my calendar as a 'what to watch for'. <br/><br/>In the meantime, I look forward to seeing Garden State again. It has quietly nosed its way into being one of the best of films of 2004 and I we shouldn't ignore the shoulder pushing we get from the critics headlines to go see it."

It makes fun of itself in the most liberating way; the public is not even allowed to reflect upon serious issues like death, parental negligence and what not; the minute a funeral scene is introduced you burst out laughing at some shocking picture, image or behavior, violently thrown out at you by the camera's angle.

This movie is incredible, not just for a first time director and writer, but for a film maker period. The range of emotion is incredible. Zach Braff does an incredible job on directing and creating a character that's lost and numb. It's something that everybody can relate to, to that time in life when feeling is lost when you're struggling just to stay conscious. Natalie Portman also does an incredible job and, as the line above says, is very original and will be remembered for a very long time for this role. You meet many people in this movie that you wish you could meet in real life. <br/><br/>The only thing or even possible complaint I could have about this movie is that the relationship between Andrew and his father wasn't explored enough. You get a sense of what they went through and how it's going to turn out but you never understand fully the background of their relationship or the nature of it. Besides that there's not a single thing I would have changed. The ending is incredible and leaves you filled with a feeling that you don't know what to do with, so you just sit there and listen and watch and take it in. <br/><br/>If you go to see movies to feel, to live, to experience, then there's nothing better this summer, this year, this whatever than Garden State.

"oshram-3","10","0","1","21 August 2004"," Wonderfully done film, just right
","Garden State, masterminded by young Zach Braff (you might know him from Scrubs), is everything that every indie movie aspires to but so very few achieve; it's warm, it's funny, it's quirky and ironic, it's sad and hopeful and touching all at once. It manages to poke fun at life without being disillusioned, it offers hope without being saccharine, and it manages to reach right off the screen and touch us. I'm not often emotionally engaged by films I see these days, but I certainly was with Garden State.<br/><br/>Much of the credit obviously has to go to Braff; since he wrote, starred in, and directed it, it pretty much only could be his fault if things went wrong. But Braff gives a flawless performance as Andrew Largeman, a 26-year old who has largely become disconnected from the world and has to fly home for his mother's funeral. The movie starts a little jerkily, though Braff is appealing from the start. But not long into the movie Andrew encounters Sam (Natalie Portman), and there the movie really finds its legs. Portman and Braff have an unusual and touching chemistry, and if anything, she's even sharper than he is, if that's possible. Portman has several scenes where she is so natural that it hardly feels like acting at all; and despite the fact that her notable features have been pasted all over the world from Star Wars, her Sam is so engaging and lively you forget that you're even watching anyone perform. In that Braff equals her, and they are a perfect match.<br/><br/>I won't get into much of the plot for fear of spoiling anything, because the movie is far too good for that. But Braff manages the right balance between irony and humor, and his warmth with Portman really shines through on the screen. As Andrew begins to come alive, the movie grows even stronger, and there are a few moments toward the end that are just pulled off perfectly. I especially liked the very end, which is always the hardest part of a film (or any story) to get right.<br/><br/>I know, I know, I'm overhyping it; but in fact, I'm not really doing the movie much justice at all. This is the most moved I've been by a film since Lost in Translation, and that's rare company indeed. I know Garden State isn't playing everywhere, but if it is showing near you, you might want to make an effort to see it; movies like this are a very rare bunch, that can touch us and maybe even change us a little. Don't wait to see it on DVD."

The story is really touching, beautiful, and moving as it encapsulates all the awkward and real and bizarre moments of those happily trapped in suburbia.

How love inspires you to improve yourself, have fun, and live in the present instead of ascribing all your hope to the future, and thus missing out on your entire life.

","Due to the absurd amount of hype built up around Garden State, I walked out of the theater relieved that I was only slightly disappointed. As many have noticed by now, the teaser for the film (teaser, not the full trailer) is just about the best teaser ever created. If you've not seen it yet, be prepared to waste a day or two sitting on Apple's trailer website playing the thing over and over. Well...after doing this for about three months the big day finally arrived for me yesterday. Here are my thoughts:<br/><br/>1. The film is beautiful. Make no mistake about it, Zach Braff painted us a stylish, aesthetically pleasing film. Shots that will (should) make you mumble ""ooohhhh, nice shot"" in the theater include: Largeman drugged up on a crashing airplane, Largeman sitting alone on the couch while they play spin the bottle, all of the shots at the house party immediately after the spin-the-bottle scene, all of the shots at the pool (great lighting), Natalie tap-dancing in front of the fireplace, and best of all: the shot where the camera fast-zooms out away from the ark, over the gorge. <br/><br/>2. The structure is fantastic. For a guy doing his first film, Braff nails the structure. One very cool tool he uses is bookending most scenes with the same song. He'll have one part of a song play as the ""scenery"" unfolds, and then end the scene with a different part of the same song. It works. For a movie without a traditional plot, you'll feel at ease allowing Braff to organize the film into a manageable clump of scenes. <br/><br/>3. Natalie Portman is not really a good actress. Can well all just admit this now? It's as if we all saw her amazing performances when she was 13-14 years old (The Professional, Beautiful Girls) and have been pretending that her awful performances since (Star Wars) aren't really happening. The first 25 minutes of Garden State are truly incredible. At one point I was saying to myself ""wow, this may be the best film I've seen since American Beauty"" (by the way, they both have the same ""feel"" to them), and then KAPOW! Natalie's character ""Sam"" is introduced. Sam is supposed to be an adorable, quirky, glass-is-half-full character that every 19-28 year-old male falls in love with. On paper this is great casting. Portman, however, forces it pretty badly. Her mannerisms are fine, and her ""crying scene"" is believable; everything else is overdone and makes you cringe. Maybe it's bad directing, but no one else in the movie seems to be having any trouble delivering believable dialogue.<br/><br/>4. Amy Ferguson is going to be a star. Yup, that's right, I'm talking about the girl who is in the film for five minutes playing Dana, a party-girl high on ecstasy who makes out with our main character. She is the blonde girl in a grey shirt. She barely has any lines, yet she nails this small role. She's absolutely stunning, which helps, but I'm serious here...it's a great 5 minute performance.<br/><br/>5. The ""Ark Theme"" is nice. Garden State was initially named ""Large's Ark."" The idea is this: Large's life becomes a big mess. His mom is dead, he indirectly contributed to her death, his father/psychiatrist is impossible, and he can not feel anything, good or bad. Finally, Large finds things that make him feel again. He finds Sam, he finds a couple old friends, and, as cheesy as it sounds, he finds himself. In the most important scene of the film, Large, Sam and Mark travel to an old ship. A huge rainstorm comes. Zach Finally feels liberated. He climbs up on the ""ship"", asks two things that mean ""the world"" to him to join him on the ship. In unison they scream out into the storm. It's a decent metaphor. <br/><br/>6. The ending is disappointing. I won't say anything else except this: for a film so loaded with uniqueness and freshness, the ending is awfully formulaic. I mean REALLY formulaic. Couldn't we have done a little better here?<br/><br/>Garden state is a very emotional journey through a beautiful, romantic movie-scape. If you are tenderhearted (as I am) Garden State will strike a number of chords in you. If you are a tough guy who can't handle a little bit of lovey-dovey stuff you will enjoy the comedy and the cinematography but need a good dose of MAXIM afterward to re-convince yourself that you don't care about emotions. All girls will like this movie. Let me repeat that: ALL GIRLS WILL LIKE THIS MOVIE."

","This was an impressive film. Shot very well, great direction and a beautiful script. You cared for these characters. You were interested in why they did the things they did and how they related to one another. Each and everyone had a battle to fight. I believe what filled these characters out came in the direction of the film. Each character was whole and well defined the moment they appeared on screen. This film used light very well enhancing the story and overall mood. It showcased Jersey in a way I've never seen before. Braff knows what he is doing...he's not just that goof from ""Scrubs"" anymore. I think film buffs can expect good things from this guy in the near future."

","O.K. five words! A BREATH OF FRESH AIR! It couldn't have been any better! I think about it all the time! Everything was just perfectly timed and wonderfully set up! I wanted the movie to keep going! It's a breath of fresh air! And a break from all of the dumb summer blockbusters (Catwoman)! Zach Braff was a genius! Also, Natalie Portman should win an Academy Award! She was brilliant! I was lucky to see this movie early, because now every time I see a preview I have a huge grin on my face! Everything was perfection! The music was especially moving and it seemed to fit every minute of the film! There was one scene where I could not stop laughing! (Actually most of the movie I was laughing). As my mom says, I got the giggles! When Large was trying to swim. LOL. I'm seriously laughing as I'm writing! Someone said he looked like a beaver! I almost p***ed my pants! So now that I've rambled on and on... I think I should make my point which is this movie is so real! I mean I never played a retarded quarterback or anything, although I have had seizures, but it's really nice to know that there's a chance for love anywhere and under any circumstance! And life and love aren't always easy but if your lucky you could find people to help you and help guide you through it! Oh... and if you couldn't tell I LOVED this movie!"
"dvmunchkin","10","0","1","8 August 2004"," great, but lacking
","In short, I really liked it. I thought the filming was well done. Beautiful cinematography. And the soundtrack was good and fitting, but I must say, I had a problem with the character development. Especially Sam, Natalie Portman. I really liked her character and the whole relationship started out really well, but towards the end, she was kinda just there. And they way she acted during the end didn't fit at all. She suddenly became so weak when she was the one who made Large strong again. I think the movie lacked building of the relationships. But other than that it was real good. It was hard to relate to the characters themselves, but I think we can all relate to the situation if we try."
"kinolieber","10","0","1","13 August 2004"," What was the original ending? **SPOILER**
","**SPOILERS AHEAD**<br/><br/>I loved the movie and have seen it twice. And yet I can't help feeling that the film is filled with a kind of melancholy foreboding that the ending seems to negate. I love a happy ending as much as anyone, and after adjusting to this one, it makes for a satisfying finale, especially with its Graduate-like intimation that they hardly know each other, really, and there may be some rocky times ahead for both of them. <br/><br/>But think about it: They meet at a neurologist's office and she lies about her condition. Over and over it seems the film is intimating that she is headed for some tragic end or is hiding some tragic secret. And the film opens with his own premonition of death by plane crash.<br/><br/>
So here's what I'm wondering: wouldn't it have made a more interesting and thought provoking film if his foolish departure from her resulted in his death in the plane crash he'd dreamed about? How fleeting are our opportunities for happiness, and how easily we can miss them if we don't recognize them. Not commercial, but I wonder if some such ending was originally conceived. Was it changed to the one we have now, a cliched sad ending tease/happy ending turnabout? One that will result in the film earning many more millions than it otherwise would have.<br/><br/>
I love the film, every minute of it. Natalie Portman is glorious. I love the film's humor and humanity, the music, and the sweet melancholy mood, so evocative of that period of our lives Braff calls the quarter-life crisis. But I think a stupid tragic denouement would have been more in keeping with the tone of the rest of the film."
"tccandler","10","0","1","13 August 2004"," Every now and then you find a song that hits all the right notes.
","Every now and then you find a song that hits all the right notes... ""Garden State"" is the movie equivalent of that wonderful sensation.<br/><br/>**********<br/><br/>Zach Braff brings to life a lovely story filled with wonderfully quirky and adorable characters in such a way that the quality of his directorial debut begs to be compared with Quentin Tarantino's ""Reservoir Dogs"" and Paul Thomas Anderson's ""Hard Eight"". Not to say that ""Garden State"" resembles those films at all... It is more reminiscent of the 1996 gem, ""Beautiful Girls"", also starring Natalie Portman. Braff proves, on his first time out, that he is a genuine filmmaker with a poetic eye and an absolute adoration for the characters he creates. This film will appeal to virtually everyone on some level. It is easily one of the best films of 2004.<br/><br/>Andrew Largeman (Braff) is a heavily medicated young man. He is a struggling actor, living in Los Angeles, whose only claim to fame is a role as a retarded quarterback in some lame TV movie. He lives in his medicated haze, far removed from his New Jersey family with whom he rarely speaks. But all that changes when he receives the call that his mother has passed away and he must return to pay his respects for a few days.<br/><br/>As I said earlier, this film bares a resemblance to ""Beautiful Girls"" in that it is about a man returning to a virtually unrecognizable home only to find old friends and new inspirations. The film also had me wistful for ""The Myth of Fingerprints"", a film that dealt with a young man's familial issues, most notably with his father.<br/><br/>""Garden State"" begins as a rather wry comedy filled with memorable scenes and images that will have you chuckling to yourself long after you leave the theatre. But its true power lies in the way it morphs into an awakening of sorts for the main character. That change is partly due to his medical sobriety but has more to do with Samantha (Portman), a charming and quirky girl who is an emotional torrent determined to open up Andrew in ways he seems incapable of.<br/><br/>I loved that this film abandons all tradition narrative arc and becomes a succession of bizarre encounters. It really feels like a ""real"" trip home. Braff captures the awkwardness of returning and the uncomfortably of seeing old friends who haven't changed as much as you think you have.<br/><br/>The screenplay may be the best of the year. Every scene feels authentic, as if Braff has lived them in his own life. Every character is developed with extreme care and you'll each have your own favorite.<br/><br/>The central relationship of the film forms between Andrew and Samantha. It is one of the most heartfelt and charming romances you'll ever have the pleasure of seeing. They share some of the funniest moments and some of the most romantic scenes in recent memory. This couple just feels right together.<br/><br/>Braff delivers a nuanced turn here, perfectly capturing the character's arc from comfortably numb to emotional full. He is instantly sympathetic on screen in a way that reminded me of Dustin Hoffman's role in ""The Graduate"". Natalie Portman gives her finest performance yet. Her Samantha is utterly lovable and charming... You'll find yourself wanting to give her the biggest hug imaginable. She is able to capture all the necessary emotions that she needs to give to Andrew so that he can feel whole again.<br/><br/>There are a number of nice turns in the supporting roles... Most notably from Ian Holm and Peter Sarsgaard. The entire cast deserves mention as one of the best ensembles of the year.<br/><br/>I also want to make special note of the soundtrack which may the best I've heard outside of a Tarantino or Cameron Crowe film. Songs like Coldplay's 'Don't Panic', The Shins' 'New Slang' & Frou Frou's 'Let Go' are an integral part of the movie and set the moods from scene to scene. You will almost assuredly want to add this to your music collection.<br/><br/>Every now and then you find a song that hits all the right notes... ""Garden State"" is the movie equivalent of that wonderful sensation. It will make you laugh hysterically. It will make your heart swell at the measure of its romanticism. It is the kind of film that will make you want to tell those closest to you that you love them dearly. And any film that can do all that is a masterpiece in my book."
"LBDallstar","Null","0","1","8 August 2004"," Garden State: Living up to expectations...
","OK, so we have been seeing the ads for Garden State for at least six months, possibly longer if we keep up with the online previews. It has been built and built as time went on, and I can tell you that my expectations were high. We have been pummeled by commercials on television, ads in magazines and newspapers, and the internet. So my expectations were extremely high.<br/><br/>The commercials alone made me want to see this movie. I had been waiting for opening day for quite some time here in Philadelphia, and it finally arrived. With all the hype the industry sent out, adding to this the excitement that grew inside me even when I first saw the online preview months ago, plus the fact that the soundtrack had many of my favorite bands in it, you may think my expectations were unusually high for this movie. And now that I've seen it, I can honestly say it lived up to those expectations.<br/><br/>The acting, the script, the cinematography, everything made this movie worthwhile. And, as I said, I loved the soundtrack as well. It only enhanced the film. Of course, I am a little prejudiced because I love the bands (The Shins, Coldplay, Frou Frou, etc...)<br/><br/>Zach Braff is a stupendous writer. The script, the dialogue, everything is well- written and he deserves some major credit for this film. And as for his acting, I honestly do not think anyone could have portrayed his main character better than he. It was obvious throughout the movie that Braff felt a major connection with this character, some of which was based on his early life. Natalie Portman was great in the film, although her character comes across a little too obnoxiously at first. But as the film goes on, the viewer can feel a certain connection between her and Braff's character, and she becomes lovable, just like all of the characters.<br/><br/>Overall, you may read this and think that I have told nothing of the actual plot, and that is absolutely correct. I have read many reviews of this film AFTER seeing it, and realized that most of the gave way too much of the storyline away. This film is well-written, interesting, has a great soundtrack, amazing characters you can connect with, and everything that the commercial promises. It was a great film, and I recommend it to anyone. Enjoy!"
"jdesando","Null","0","1","13 August 2004"," Enjoyable and Manipulative
","Like the parkway of the same name in New Jersey, `Garden State' is not as pretty as it sounds, not as much fun as a semi-stoner film could be, but it gets you to where director/writer/star Zach Braff (TV's `Scrubbs') wants you to be-in a funky state of awareness that our purpose in life is to accept who we are and love when possible.  Andrew Largeman (Braff), like his obvious counterpart Benjamin from `The Graduate,' is lost in L.A. as a would-be-actor (He did play a retarded quarterback for a cable-TV movie) and waiter in a Vietnamese restaurant. As in Benjamin's case, most people are willing to give him advice, mostly about his limitations, but his considerable medication demands, from his psychiatrist father, kept him from focusing and being aggressive. <br/><br/>Returning to the Garden State for his mother's funeral, Andrew meets his former life in the form of slacker high-school buddies and a father accusing him of crippling his mother.  Until he meets Sam (Natalie Portman, `Cold Mountain') nothing here makes sense either.  Then she releases, as Elaine did for Benjamin, feelings and insights foreign to him before this.  Sam is a free spirit with an out-there family, all of this just a bit too contrived to be authentic quirky, but amusingly quirky it is.  <br/><br/>When Andrew, Sam, and gravedigger friend Mark (Peter Sarsgaard, `Shattered Glass') visit an ark at the bottom of a quarry or deal with a rich buddy who invented `silent Velcro,' I was reminded of Harold visiting Maude's railroad car in `Harold and Maude,' another cult oldie aimed at renewing our love of life's oddities and life itself.<br/><br/>Director Braff laces the film with references to death such as the burial of Sam's gerbil, and, of course his mother but manages to keep the tone light, for example, when Andrew and friends smoke weed and play spin the bottle. That admixture makes `Garden State' enjoyable and manipulative at the same time.  Hearing Simon and Garfunkel on the soundtrack confirmed my suspicion that Andrew would ultimately rebel, if not just from himself. Like Benjamin, he would like his life to be `different.'  Braff successfully underlines the difference, which promises an interesting future for his protagonist. Benjamin does not hold the same promise.  As Wordsworth said, ` Like,--but oh how different.'"

","Natalie Portman is back! Emperor Lucas released her from the blue-screen purgatory to co-star with Zach Braff in this goofy character study, 'Garden State'. Braff pulls a Chaplin by also writing and directing, but his lovely co-star is the focus here. It took about 3 minutes for me to fall in love with her. She's a kook in the Kate Winslet 'Eternal Sunshine' mode, yet THAT'S the appeal. Portman & Winslet have given the 2 best female performances so far this year. I'll be strapping on my 'Garden State' cheerleading pom-poms when they start talking about 2004 award nominations.<br/><br/>Braff (from TV's ""Scrubs"") is Andrew ""Large"" Largeman, a struggling LA actor who's been zonked on prescribed meds for 17 years. When his pop (Ian Holm) phones to announce that dear old depressed mom has died, it's time to fly back to New Jersey. Once home, he renews long-ago acquaintances, kicks the pill habit, and meets the nutty-sweet Sam (Portman). The story is how these two oddballs fall in delirious love while dealing with their problematic lives. Sure, you've seen all that before, but everyone involved in this production makes it work beautifully. For a low-budget feature, it even looks quite good and the soundtrack is terrific.<br/><br/>The movie doesn't always succeed. There's a lengthy sequence towards the end with the dependable Peter Sarsgaard that takes its sweet time achieving anything. At least it leads to something climactic for the characters, whether or not that trip is as meaningful to us. There's plenty of bizarre humour in this very funny film, but they manage to make most of it sing. Luckily, the rampant zaniness isn't forced. Braff even underplays in the Dustin Hoffman 'Graduate' mode. He might be playing a psychiatrist's dream patient, but he's actually as normal a person as there is in the movie.<br/><br/>After the show was over, I found myself grinning like a happy fool. Good God, how I enjoyed this movie! I almost believed I could find my own Sam right there on the street corner. The last time a movie (and a character) warmed my black heart so much was 'In America'. 'Garden State' isn't nearly as fabulous as Jim Sheridan's masterpiece, but Braff's film is one I will see again & again, especially when a pick-me-up would hit the spot. The cinema was made for movies like this."

","Garden State puts Zach Braff beyond the funny man he plays on Scrubs. This heartfelt dramedy brings audiences into the inner workings of a human being.<br/><br/>Instead of only focusing on plot Braff is able to focus on the characters' listless lost place in life. They amble about New Jersey with an inner need for something they can't even distinguish no less find. This film can speak to anyone who has felt like they just live day to day seemingly without a purpose. Braff has captured insecurity and longing with Garden State, while staying realistic and even funny. Braff not only directs and writes but his ability to play low key just further exhibits his range as an actor. GO SEE THIS MOVIE. 9/10."

","This instantly goes up there with my favorite film, Royal Tenenbaums, which seems to be a love or hate deal. From other people's reviews, this appears to be a similar case. Being a fan of Braff's on Scrubs, I found familiar humor in Garden State- an awkward wittiness that also reminds me of Tenenbaums. For a first film, I think he did a superior job- by far the best movie I've seen this year. The soundtrack has got to be one of the best I've ever heard, and it goes hand in hand with the film's unique style and look. All around great performances- although the ending is a little too Hollywood-esque. I'd highly recommend the film to anyone. It spans over many human emotions, on both ends of the spectrum, and although it's not 'deep' it has many layers which make it an instant classic."

","There are moments in this film in which I bite my knuckles and open my eyes so wide because i cannot believe this was written and directed by the same young man playing ""JD"" on Scrubs. Not that that means the man shouldn't have any talent for working on a Must-See TV sitcom. From the musical pieces scattered throughout the soundtrack (Shins, Theivary Corporation, Remy Zero, Frou Frou), to the jokes-within-the-frame, it is such an amazing piece of cinema from a first time director. And actor. And writer.<br/><br/>I don't like exaggerations, but I could not believe the movie ended as quickly as it did. Maybe I enjoyed it so much that I wanted to see Andrew, Sam, Mark, Gideon, Kenny, Jesse one last time, chillin in that huge mansion. Maybe the ending felt a bit rushed. However, after rethinking and reimagining that scene, I now understand how those scenes never dwelled past their initial resonance nor lost its audience's attention. That's why this film seems perfectly in tune and on time in its visual gags, idiosyncratic jokes, and well-toned performances.<br/><br/>Everyone at some point in their lives, no matter how inane and empty one envisions it to be, can look so deep within themselves and find that one happy thought, that one reminder of how much love existed in their world, and persist through such misery, heartache and depression based solely on that one memory. There is redemption, and there is hope. No matter how much self-hatred and anger lies in your heart.<br/><br/>Thank you, Zach."

Well written, well directed, and well acted by all of the cast. Though I'de say quite different from the trailers, the film still was up to par. The film covers a spectrum of emotions, and I found myself laughing at some pretty random things. Braff has a big future if he continues in the directing/writing department. Portman puts up quite a performance, finally breaking away from her Queen Amadala role. (thank god) Music...awesome. The images...one can really relate to. so many times in this movie I found myself recalling a time when I was in Zach's shoes, facing the same issues he was dealing with. I can't wait to pick this one up on DVD, make a great one for the collection.

Two very pleased movie goers.<br/><br/>I know a lot of people are complaining about little things but I left excited at what Zach Braff brings to the table. This is his first movie and it was something to be proud of. From the get go I was into the movie. The characters were on point. I won't get into details because I wouldn't want to ruin it for anyone. By no means is this a perfect movie, but it is a damn good movie. A lot of the shots that Braff opted for stuck with me. Just beautiful imagery. Then there is Natalie Portman. Wow. She delivers in a big way in this movie. Disregard everything you've seen in the Star Wars films and watch her in this movie and you'll see this girl is good. She IS Sam. She's likable, she's funny and she's warm. She's real. I've heard complaints about her issues falling to the way side and not being focused on...but that is not what this film was about. <br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie.

The characters are very real and easy to relate to, I felt like I knew somebody who was or could be each character in the movie. The subtle comedic touches had everyone in the theatre laughing hysterically, while the emotional overtones and realistic, and at times, awkwardly brilliant character development had us wanting to learn more and more about what was going to happen to these people. I remember not wanting the movie to end, because I really felt attached to the characters. The soundtrack is very well-chosen, and the music is integrated very well into the movie, except for the couple of times there were about 5 seconds of music that seemed to get cut off a bit early. My only real complaint is that the ending may have been a bit abrupt, but it's really not bad enough to take anything away from this great film.<br/><br/>Aside from maybe one or two lines delivered a bit awkwardly by Zach Braff, the acting was really solid. Natalie Portman proved to us that she really doesn't suck at acting, and that the crazy, off-the-wall girl you were always afraid to talk to can be really enticing.<br/><br/>As a long-time Scrubs fan, I was afraid to see basically the same type of dramadey ""funny show that likes to be cool and have a message,"" but was pleasantly surprised to get something much more intriguing.

Two screenings is key if you're looking to fully enjoy this movie, three or four if you're looking to add it to your list of ""Top 20"".

There are moments of cinematic brilliance in the film as well as nearly-student-film-esque pieces that combine for a unique tinge of filmic glory.

"noralee","Null","0","1","7 August 2004"," Glory Days in NJ Can Still Come in the Future
","""Garden State"" is a wonderful debut for writer/director Zach Braff, visually and verbally.  <br/><br/>The camera's eye, in placement and Lawrence Sher's cinematography, beautifully support the sharp and truthful (and funny) dialogue.  And, no, as lead actor Braff's not just playing his ""Scrubs"" role.<br/><br/>
The directing and the acting, particularly backed by the expressive production design palette, well support the cross-country odyssey Braff's ""Andrew Largeman"" undergoes as he eschews his father's prescription emotion-controllers for first recreational enhancers and finally for the pain and potential happiness of human relationships.  <br/><br/>Every character has lies that are gradually and with clear eyes revealed, as each has to face up to who they have become, including Peter Sarsgaard's not so sympathetic stoner grave digger.  <br/><br/>Natalie Portman is a delight in what may be her best role so far.  She is simply irresistible and the camera falls in love with her liveliness, from her eyebrows to her akimbo limbs, as she breathes life into ""Large."" <br/><br/>
While Braff resisted using Johnny Cash's cover of Loudon Wainwright's original of ""The Man Who Couldn't Cry"" in a simply beautiful scene with a Dixie cup to capture a significant moment in ""Large""'s life, the excellent song selection is as critical to the film as Scorcese's or Tarantino's.  The released soundtrack is annoyingly incomplete, lacking Alexei Murdoch's ""Orange Sky"" and a closing song, among others.  The romantic use of The Shins' songs should certainly help sales of their CDs (the cuts on the soundtrack are both from their older ""Oh, Inverted World"" CD).<br/><br/>
The New Jersey settings are evocatively selected, with each house succinctly establishing the character's family setting.  The male camaraderie of ironically ""Glory Days"" high school chums is also well-captured. <br/><br/>
But this is at least the fourth movie/TV show I've seen this year with a mother somewhat inexplicably bedding a gangly youth their son's age, such that either some male writers have watched ""Summer of '42"" or even ""Harold and Maude"" too often, seen too much about Mary Kay Letourneau or there's some other kind of anger out there."

","Like most movie geeks, I too have been watching the trailer an incredible number of times. I've been anticipating this film with baited breath, in fact, since my boss returned from Sundance... Just so you know how biased I was ahead of time.<br/><br/>I went into the film with expectations in the area of 'Oscar Worthy', and somehow, I was not disappointed. I don't know that this will win such awards, as it really isn't that type of film, but I'd say strictly for the character depth, it deserves something. Braff, as far as I'm concerned, succeeded in every aspect that he was involved in. The direction, if a bit jumpy, was unique and, at times, simply beautiful. The writing was quirky and the dialogue was fresh, save maybe the final scene. I especially loved the dialogue between Largeman (Braff) and Sam (Portman) early on in the picture... it was absurd at times, but given the characters' idiosyncrasies, it was surprisingly genuine. And I think that summed up the entire film for me. <br/><br/>Really, the entire film pleased me. It was a beautiful romance, but while it sent our two main characters on their own life-affirming journeys together, it wasn't the type of romance where you went, ""Oh, if only it were that way for me."" It was real. It was far more realistic with two quirky quirky quirky characters than it was in most romantic comedies where our subjects are average and straightforward. Portman's character, in fact, was so layered and so independent of Braff's that it may have made the entire film. This wasn't an experience for only Largeman, it was one for Sam as well... they both needed each other, rather than the usual way of the main character needing the free-spirited supporting character. And in that respect, the acting was great. I loved how both revealed so much by saying and doing so little; Braff should make himself a star from this... I'd assume that if the same happened to Sofia Coppola in an inferior film. <br/><br/>I'm not going to go ahead and declare this as the best film of the year, because each movie has its own effect on each individual audience member. Some can relate to it, others can't. That's what a great film does. For me, I was able to connect with many aspects of it and it made for an incredible experience. I'll give it an A."

","Garden State is a good little movie. *** POSSIBLE SPOILERS*****<br/><br/>Braff is a very talented actor, he does a terrific job as a director and I'm sure he'll grow as a writer. The script is the main flaw - much of the writing is ""young"" - in fact I believe EVERY writer in the world has a short story, a play, something in a drawer about a dead Mom. It is such a tired little area but Braff does bring some new and dark, interesting insight into it. The film is full of great performances and Portman does a wonderful job playing a quirky, flawed girl who meets Braff's character at a doctor's office. The film is a bit slow in the beginning but I liked how it took it's time and there are scenes in the second half that just soar - really work with their humor and power."

","I think Braff is brilliant. This film has the perfect mesh of comedic and dramatic tone. The tandem of Braff, Portman, and Sarsgard work very well together. For a film to make you laugh and then have a good cry, you have to give it at least a eight. I'm very anxious to see what he comes up with next. Although, I am a big fan of his for his portrayal of JD on the television show Scrubs, this is a fabulous departure from that character. Besides the beautiful soundtrack and the outstanding performances, the thing I was most enamored with, was the cinematography. This is definitely one of my favorites of the year."
