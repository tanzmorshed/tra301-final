","John Huston's Victory has probably seen so much critical scorn it's mind boggling.  Is this movie Oscar material?  Certainly not, but it's a great film in many ways.<br/><br/>First of all, Bill Conti offers up a first rate uplifting musical score. It's outstanding work and you hear a bit of resemblence to the score he wrote for a 1982 film that received a little bit of notoriety -- The Right Stuff.<br/><br/>Next, the cinematography is simply gorgeous.  Soccer is not an easy sport to film and I think this film was done wonderfully.  I thought the choice of film stock, a certain amount of grain to make it almost like you're watching a documentary was a nice touch.  Some of the action shots and slow-mos are absolutely wonderful to behold.<br/><br/>Finally, we have a nice plot with a couple of surprises, a great cast, and an auteur director.  Certainly, Huston was in failing health and not at the top of his game by this time but his work on this film was still memorable. For me I will always remember the wonderful line with ""The Forger"" asking Hatch ""You don't want to get shot as a spy do you?""  And the quick reply, ""No, I don't want to get shot as anything.""  Simple one liner, uncomplicated, yet funny.<br/><br/>Victory is a great inspirational film, a sure hit for soccer fans (of course he wasn't offside - he was behind the ball when it was struck!) and a nice film for war buffs.  Just ignore Maltin et al and spend the time watching it, widescreen DVD recommended, you won't be sorry."

","The script of this unusual war/escape movie was nothing special, and neither was the acting. Not surprising about the latter since half the performers weren't actually experienced actors. However I loved every minute of it, and thought it was great fun and terrific entertainment. Of course there are those who won't quite see it that way and will dismiss it out of hand. And they'd be perfectly sane to do so. Everything about ""Victory"" (aka ""Escape to Victory"" in the UK) says it's one to leave well alone.<br/><br/>Even if you disregard the lack of aesthetic qualities, and tut-tut over the reality of it all, it's worth watching if only to see again a few of the great past-masters of what the Brits like to call ""the beautiful game"" (i.e. soccer). And Sylvester Stallone as a goalkeeper is something to behold. <br/><br/>As far as escape stories go this is about as original as they get, but even here it's possible to see plundering from other story lines, i.e ""The Great Escape"", ""The Password is Courage"", ""Albert RN"", to name but three, and as at least one reviewer has pointed out, the music is extremely reminiscent of the first one.<br/><br/>One of my favourites snippets is that of the Nazi sports commentator, portrayed by Anton Diffring, that stalwart of war movies, broadcasting his gramophone record of enthusiastic crowd applause, when in ""reality"" the whole stadium was as quiet as the grave.<br/><br/>I think this is one of those rare occasions, if taken in the right vein, when a bad movie can be a crowd pleaser. Forget the war pundits, the realists and the purists. Just enjoy the movie for what it is. Tremendous fun!"
"dantt777","10","55","63","27 April 2005"," Great movie
","This a great movie for any football fan. A great set of stars from the 70's, Pele and Stallone as a funny goalkeeper. This is one of my favorite soccer movies. The storyline is not the best, but it is catchy. Now the way the stadium was set up, the noise, it feel really real. I would love to see a similar movie remade. Maybe a victory 2 with todays's stars. Some people do not like the idea of sly as a football player, I disagree, I think he playing the ""football-ignorant""american is good. Now I also think that the way the soccer players acted was very realistic. In special Pele was good. I know many friends in many countries outside the USA who just love this film."
"mdiffey","10","30","34","30 October 2001"," Football + War = Masterpiece!
","Despite being universally derided by everyone I know, I still believe that Escape To Victory is possibly the greatest feelgood movie ever made.  For anyone who has a passion for football this is an absolute must see, if just for a chance to see legends such as Bobby Moore and Pele playing in the same team.<br/><br/>However, while the football is marvellous, the drama is on a similar level. Everyone always goes on about this film being cheesy, but I really believe it has some great dramatic moments: Caine telling Stallone ""I won't be responsible for your death"", the tragedy of the Eastern European prisoners, and of course the performance of Max von Sydow.<br/><br/>He really does make the film what it is with a hugely dignified portrayal of a man who has no interest in the war going on around him.  When he tells Caine ""if all the nations of the world could solve their problems on the football field, wouldn't that be something?"", it may be a hugely naive (and slightly corny) sentiment, but you honestly believe that he means it.<br/><br/>There are some minus points, however;  it's clear that Stallone has never played as a goalkeeper before (I should know because it's my position), some of the lines delivered by the footballers do sound enormously false (a problem similar to that with the musicians in The Blues Brothers, another classic), and many of the British and German officers are incredibly caricatured.  Also, as a war movie it's about as far removed from the terrible reality of war as it's possible to get.<br/><br/>However, to state that Escape to Victory is unrealistic is to miss the point entirely.  It's pure escapism.  As such, it can lay claim to being one of the few specifically male-oriented feelgood movies around.<br/><br/>
In conclusion, it surely deserves to be regarded as something of a modern classic."

","I was looking through the action collection at the video store and trying to find something that might interest my husband and myself, a daunting task. When I picked up Victory, I thought 'why not?' as it has Max Von Sydow who we both enjoy.  The fact that it had Michael Caine was an added bonus. Besides I wanted to know what kind of film could have those two AND Sylvester Stallone.  Somehow I couldn't picture Stallone playing football with the Europeans, at least not doing it well.  I was right.  Stallone couldn't play, but it didn't matter because that was part of the shtick for the character.  <br/><br/>I'll admit that there were a couple of places where the plot was rather predictable and places where I simply thought it was completely unbelievable.  However, all in all I would recommend this movie.  It's fun and, at times, touching."

","The film,Victory is a story about Allied prisoners football players. A team of Allied prisoners of war (POWs), coached and represented by Englishman Captain John Colby agree to play an exhibition match against a German team, only to find themselves involved in a German propaganda stunt.He is the captain and essentially the manager of the team and thus chooses his squad of players.American POW Hatch is not initially chosen, but eventually nags the reluctant Colby into letting him on the team.The superior officers repeatedly try to convince Colby to use the match as an opportunity for an escape attempt,but he refuses,fearing that such an attempt will only result in getting his players killed. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, Hatch has been planning an unrelated escape attempt,and Colby's superiors agree to help him, if he in return agrees to journey to Paris, make contact with the French Resistance, and try to convince them to help the soccer team escape.He succeeds in escaping the prison camp, traveling to Paris, and finding the Resistance, but the Resistance decides that the plan to help the soccer team escape is too risky; they not only refuse to help, but also convince Hatch to get re-captured, so he can pass information along back to the leading British officers at the prison camp.Fearing another escape attempt, the Germans initially refuse to allow Hatch to participate in the match, but Colby breaks the existing goalkeeper's arm as an excuse to get Hatch back onto the team.<br/><br/>The match officials being heavily biased towards the Germans, and the German team causing several deliberate injuries to the Allied players, a draw is achieved.Hatch plays goalkeeper, and makes excellent saves including one last save from a penalty kick as time expires to deny the Germans the win, drawing the game 4–4. Before the penalty kick the POWs had scored a goal which was disallowed by the referee for a dubious offside decision, making the score 5–4, prompting the crowd to shout ""VICTORY!!!""They manage to escape at the end of the game, amidst the confusion caused by the crowd storming the field after it ends in a draw.<br/><br/>Victory maybe a have all the elements of an underdog sports picture especially with a final match in the end,but it became a memorable one.One reason is that football happens to be arguably the most popular sport in the world.Also,the actors in the movie were well-known like Sylvester Stallone,who played Hatch;Michael Caine,who played Colby; and Max von Sydow.Finally,the film also has the participation of well-known football players like Bobby Moore, Osvaldo Ardiles, Kazimierz Deyna, Paul Van Himst, Mike Summerbee, Hallvar Thoresen and Pelé.John Huston's direction was also worth the mention.This is one excellent sports.A must-see for football fans and people who love the underdog.Also,it was one hell of an enjoyable and entertaining film."

","Any football fans out there? If you haven't seen Escape To Victory either at Christmas, when it is usually on at a ridiculous time of the morning, or hired/bought it on DVD then you are really missing out.<br/><br/>There is a fair amount of disbelief suspending that needs to take place before you settle down. But, if you can numb your brain to the idea of Micheal Caine playing professional football or indeed, Sylvester Stallone doing the same in goal, you're in for a treat. <br/><br/>As a football fan, it was a real thrill to see the great Bobby Moore kicking a ball in anger and, against the Germans too (remember what I said about suspending disbelief). <br/><br/>OK, it isn't the greatest film ever made. But it isn't supposed to be. It's a bit of bubblegum that is just supposed to kill a couple of hours. A feat the movie accomplishes handsomely. <br/><br/>I defy any football fan not to cheer when the goals go in or to curse when the Germans do well. Similarly, try and stifle your guffaws when you see Mr Caine trying to look like he knows what he's supposed to be doing. Is it just me or does he become more cockney when he tries to convey excitement in any of his roles?? Probably one of England's more one dimensional acting talents. <br/><br/>If you don't enjoy it, you're missing the point of it. Nobody will ever forget horror of war, it's ingrained. That isn't what this film is about although it does have a stab at giving the viewer a clue about the life of a POW in WWII. <br/><br/>No, the film is about entertainment. And, on that level, it's one of the good ones."

","Enjoyable warlike movie with memorable images and outstanding acting by well-known faces . It packs crisp performance , intrigue , stirring scenes , suspense ,soccer game , twists and turns . Set in World War II, a group of inmates (Michael Caine , Daniel Massey ,Tim Pigott-Smith , Maurice Roëves) imprisioned at a German concentration camp , there the Prisoners agree a spectacular escape by planning on using the football game as means of escape from the stadium . This is a decent film about a daring breakout from inescapable Nazi concentration camp , a barbed-wired and strongly controlled camp by using a soccer team playing at Paris stadium , being performed by all star cast and professionally directed by John Huston . It deals with Nazi officers (Max Von Sidow , Arthur Brauss ) who come up with a propaganda event in which an all star Nazi team will play a team composed of Allied Prisoners of War in a Soccer or Football game . Following the hard preparatives of a diverse group formed by rebel officers and soldiers mounting a dangerous getaway from a soccer match . Captain Robert Hatch (Sylvester Stallone comes off best among the familiar gallery of prisoners and Nazi stereotypes) is assigned the difficult mission to be in contact with the French freedom fighters . The most part of the film concerns on the elaborated process of scheming the escape ,it includes : secretly digging an underground tunnel to execute a great effort for the groundbreaking breakout throughout the sewers trying to make their bid to freedom . Later on , a football match is set up so that the players flee . As allied POWs prepare for a soccer game against the German National Team to be played in Nazi-occupied Paris, while the French Resistance (Amidou , Carole Laure) are making plans for help them escape through the sewer tunnels of Paris , of course , they want to finish the game first . Now is the time for heroes.Their goal was freedom...<br/><br/>This exciting story contains soccer sports , thrills, intrigue, tension, excitement galore, entertainment and lots of fun . However , being slightly unsatisfactory both for fans of star-studded prison escape sub-genre and for soccer buffs , the latter hoping to watch the best football scenes . This movie results to be a crossover between The great escape (1963) and The longest year (1974), and even Rocky (1976) , taking parts here and there . Although it holds heavily on the barely plausible notion of a squad of Pow soccer stars escaping from Paris stadium . Suspenseful WWII epic packs exceptional plethora of prestigious actors incarnating the motley group of POWs , giving good acting ,along with a great support cast . Stars Sylvester Stallone whose character , Captain Robert Hatch , remains today as charming in his long iconography . Along with the always great Michael Caine as a British official reluctant to participate in the masquerade . Secondary cast includes notorious actors as Carole Laure , Amidou , Arthur Brauss , Tim Pigott-Smith , Maurice Roëves , Anton Driffing ,Michael Wolf and the incombustible Max Von Sidow . In addition , the footballers carry out some cunningly devised games from Pele and his squad of internationals as half the Ipswich team , plus to Ardiles and Moore. For all of the soccer players who had acting parts in this movie, this picture has been their only ever theatrical film acting role.<br/><br/>Colorful, atmospheric cinematography by Gerry Fisher shot in Budapest, Hungary , Paris, France . Excellent production design and art direction with evocative sets by Dennis Washington . Rousing and lively soundtrack , nowadays a classic score , and being constantly reminded , by Bill Conti . The movie was scored by Bill Conti who had composed the Oscar nominated music score for Sylvester Stallone's Rocky (1976). Victory (1981) is one of around ten collaborations of the pair and one of just a handful of non-Rocky franchise films scored by Conti and starring Stallone with the others being F.I.S.T. (1978), Lock up (1989), and Paradise alley (1978).This Soccer/Concentration camp movie was well directed by the great John Huston at his best , its tense filmmaking makes this crackerjack entertainment , being shot over a period of five weeks. The picture was made in a good time of the 60s , 70s and 80s when Huston resurged as a director of quality films with Fat City, (1972), The man who would be king (1975) and Wise blood (1979). He ended his career on a high note with Under volcano (1984), the afore-mentioned Honor of Prizzi (1985) and Dublineses (1987). Rating : 7/10 . Above average , as the intrigue is entertaining on its own , this is one of John Huston's best films , a model of his kind , definitely a must see if you are aficionado to WWII movies . Huston broke a new ground with this landmark movie , providing classic scenes and agreeable dialogs . Two thumbs up , essential and indispensable watching , a real must see."

","WARNING---MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS---WARNING <br/><br/>First of all, I have heard people, obviously Yanks, say this rips off the Longest Yard. Those of you that think so need to get educated properly. It rips off a Hungarian film about Dynamo Kiev. Those of you that say it ripped off The Great Escape, because of Sylvester Stallone, you are wrong as The Great Escape is a serious war film whereas this one is a football film set in World War 2. How else do you think they would get all those multinational football stars playing AGAINST the Germans on one team and yet still make the plot make sense? <br/><br/>Second of all, this film is not meant to be a serious war film, therefore there is no reason for it to be accurate or to show a soldier with his guts hanging out crying for his mother so you think twice about war. It is a football film that involves football in wartime, nothing else. This also means that there is no reason this film has to contain a scene where the Germans torch or gas a Jew. To see the latter, watch The Pianist or Schindler's List.<br/><br/>Last of all, this film is the first real football film therefore it deserves credit for this alone. The whole film is just a gap filler until the match comes along. This is when the film shows its true colours, a brilliantly executed, acted and shot football film.<br/><br/>A brilliant and fantastic film all round."

As a War film it is only average, but as a Football spectacle it is very interesting. The fact that the makers used real life footballers, including the great man himself ""Pele"" is original. We are actually seeing first class football players do their stuff in a controlled Movie enviroment... Heck some of them even try to act!<br/><br/>I think Michael Caine and Sly would have enjoyed making this Movie.<br/><br/>The message from the Movie is that Football is a game which is understood by everyone and will always be played under any circumstances.

Enough reason alone to see the film. Stallone plays the loud-mouth American who is only interested in literally 'tackling' players, but who turns out to be a very good goalkeeper.<br/><br/>Real-life players, led by Pele, do their part to support the script, but the film really comes into its own in the final match scene, which still moves me after all these years.<br/><br/>Very stirring stuff."

"hitchcockthelegend","8","8","9","25 June 2010"," Arguably one of the most unfairly derided boys own movies out there?
","World War II and the Nazi officers have come up with a propaganda driven idea for the German national football team to play a team composed of Allied Prisoners of War. Led by Capt. John Colby (Michael Caine) the prisoners agree, but there's more than just propaganda at stake here.<br/><br/>Directed by John Huston in the twilight of his career, Escape To Victory, in spite of it being a perennial Bank Holiday staple viewing in the UK, is a film that's often used as a kicking post by stuffy critics. It's hard to understand why such a fun and harmless piece can cause such derision in cinematic circles. It can't be expectation because when you read the plot and see that Sylvester Stallone is playing as the goalkeeper, and that a tubby 48 year old Caine is the captain of this soccer team, well surely you know this film isn't all about about cranial depth encompassing the propaganda machinations of the Nazi regime.<br/><br/>Using real footballers (notably Pelé, Bobby Moore and Osvaldo Ardilies) is what makes Escape To Victory work as entertainment for so many people in the UK. Huston, much like Stallone, hadn't got a clue how to make a football based movie. In stepped the footballers to choreograph the film's football sequences - sequences that give the film some truly memorable moments (Pelé overhead kick, Ardiles rainbow flick, and erm, a Stallone penalty save). They couldn't act for toffee, none of them, but that's where Caine comes in. Guiding them through their scenes, Caine was highly thought of on the set by the players, a sort of father figure by all accounts, and not just on the set, but in the bar as well. Stallone excepted (he was off doing his own thing most of the time), it was a happy shoot, and this shines bright in the movie, with the non actors growing in confidence as the movie progresses. So while the film ultimately deals in escapist fun, it's not without moments of poignancy too. A sacrificial break for the war effort induces winces across the board, whilst the arrival of the Eastern Block players from the work camps demands our utmost heartfelt thoughts.<br/><br/>So is Escape To Victory a great film? No, of course not. But it is a darn good one. A film that's easy to lose oneself in during the holiday periods. With Caine flicking the eff off Vs, Max Von Sydow being classy as usual and some legendary footballers strutting their stuff, what's not to enjoy? Really? 7.5/10"
"jcanettis","7","16","21","22 October 2005"," Decent Movie Featuring Terrific Football
","If the part where the football match takes place was omitted, ""Victory"" would be a ""5 stars out of 10"" film. The reason is that although it features two very good actors (Michael Caine - Max von Sydow), there is not much to stand out: A rather incredulous WW2 plot, an average acting (what could you expect from professional footballers or from Stallone?), and a simply decent direction, produce an average result. Thankfully, there is more than that, as I will explain in more detail later.<br/><br/>""Victory"" is about some inmates in a WW2 prison camp, who have a passion for soccer. Captain J. Colby (Caine), a former footballer, is the leading figure in the camp matches that take place. One day, he is spotted by football-fan Major Steiner (Max von Sydow) who proposes him the idea of organizing a match between allied POWs vs. Germans. Colby agrees, as he believes this will be a great morale-booster and a chance for better prison conditions for those involved; however, more senior inmates are skeptical, as they believe this will be a propaganda stunt for the Germans. In the end, they also concur but only after they have convinced the team's goalie Capt. Hatch (Stallone) to arrange the team's escape during the match. The difficulty is that both Colby and his team are more interested in this game than in their freedom, so they are hesitant on what they should finally do...<br/><br/>As I said, the movie is just watchable during its first part. And yet, when we start to watch the Allied - Germans match, things get much better: We watch terrific football from stars such as Pele, Ardiles, and Bobby Moore, with scenes such as Pele's goal being memorable to all sports fans. Of course, if you are not into soccer, then perhaps you won't get that excited (although the spectacle can be exciting for non-fans, too). But if you like the King of Sports, then you will certainly enjoy this film. 7/10."

Best scene by far in the movie is Pele's jaw-dropping upside-down kick, followed by Max Von Sydow's sportsmanlike and awestruck applause, followed by glares of hatred from his German brethren. I can guarantee you that that scene is worth the price of the admission(video rental) alone.

","Victory (1981)<br/><br/>A slow beginning leads not to a typical sports movie but to a parallel of a heist film. That is, this group of prisoners has to think of an unusual way to pull off a job— their escape from a Nazi prison camp. The method? A soccer match. It's ludicrous I suppose but it's fun, and there are enough turns of plot to keep you going whether you like light-hearted WWII films or sports films.<br/><br/>If Pele is the surprise star here, don't expect much of him on any level, as an actor or as a player. His screen time is brief and generally dull, oddly, though still fun. But Michael Caine is his usual dependable excellent self, here as a once-great soccer player now leading a team of prisoners. He is given permission to get the best players he can find in all the Nazi prisons, assembling a kind of uber-team of stragglers and has-beens.<br/><br/>The other actor of fame, Sylvester Stallone, plays what is almost a caricature—the American who won't fit in because he is so rebellious and righteous. And right, we hope. He eventually becomes a last-minute goalkeeper, and it's kind of hilarious and impressive (he's young but already ripped). His character is obviously more familiar with American football than the other kind, but don't let that stop an ambitious young fellow.<br/><br/>The movie is an odd mix of acting styles and it's a bumbling kind of plot at first, but it steadily builds itself into something to cheer about. The end will be a surprise, by the way, and is maybe the one shining moment where the film, as a bit of movie-making, steps out of the box. <br/><br/>The reviews on this site are all over the map here. My impression is that soccer fans have an automatic win-win on this one, and that the game is seen as fresh and heroic in a good way. If you don't like soccer in particular, the sport is just a lively device to work the larger plot. As a prison film or escape film this is way out of its league, sure it is, but it's still solid and inventive in its own small ways. When it gets so unlikely you have to groan, don't worry, there is a sense of beating the odds to every aspect of the plot, so why not?<br/><br/>As you can see, it's easy to enjoy this movie even if it's nothing to write home about. Fair enough."

However as word of the match spreads, the German high command seize on it as a chance to publicly show the strength of the Germans to the world, while the escape committee within the POW camp start planning for a major escape to humiliate the Germans on their big day.<br/><br/>Well worth seeing simply because of the range of `famous' footballers in the cast and the fact that it is one of a select few films that is based around football.  That is not to mean it is any good  because of course it simply isn't.  The film is a strange mix of POW movie and sports movie.  The POW side of it is full of cliché and rip offs of better films, the music itself sounds like a watered down version of The Great Escape.  The football action itself is saved for the final third.  I think the film would have worked better if it had focused more on training (al la Dirty Dozen) rather than opening up the stuff around Hatch's escape.  As it stands the game is actually quite enjoyable, of course it doesn't really play out like a real football match, but it's very hard to get that in a film.<br/><br/>For all those who say that coming back from 4-1 down at halftime is unrealistic and laughable, I say HA!  A few seasons ago I watched Man United win 5-3 over Spurs despite losing 3-0 at halftime.  Even in the past 3 weeks I have seen both Wolves and West Brom come back from a 3-0 halftime loss to win 4-3 against Leicester and West Ham respectively.  Of course the long midfield runs etc are a little unrealistic but the game itself is the more enjoyable aspect of the film.<br/><br/>The cast are not that great.  Caine does almost nothing and seems to have just been interested in playing football alongside Pele and Moore (who wouldn't!).  Pele, Moore and the other footballers all do OK and seem happy to play (but have major problems with delivering their lines without sounding a little wooden).  However, Stallone is probably the best of the cast.  For the most part his performance is pretty weak and he is forced to be a strong chin in an escape plot, however he also does well with some comic stuff and seems to enjoy being a footballer!<br/><br/>Overall the film is a very strange hybrid, none of which really works very well.  It is best viewed as a bit of fantasy football where the `Brits' beat the Germans at football (and everything else) mainly worth watching because they can't do it in real life!  The sub-par rip offs of other films keep reminding us that this is not as good as it's peers, but it is worth seeing if you are a football fan  even if it's a pretty poor product as a film."

","When this film came out everyone I know was showering praises on it. I am a fan of John Huston but my appreciation of this great man plummeted when I saw that there was no mention in the credits of the original work in Hungarian ""Két félidö a pokolban"" or ""Two half times in hell.""<br/><br/>I was lucky to have been invited to visit Hungary in 1981 as an Indian film critic to interview the director of the Hungarian film, the late Zoltan Fabri, who I had come to adore after viewing his ""The Fifth Seal."" With remorse Fabri had told me that all that he expected was a mention of his work--nothing more--among the credits of Huston's film. Hollywood and John Huston had thrown modern day Intellectual Property Rights to the wind.<br/><br/>Huston's film is good, but the Hungarian original is far superior. Fabri was a gentleman and a great director. Huston would have stood taller had he acknowledged the original work of the then unknown Fabri."

Pelé, Ardiles, Bob Moore... No football fan can miss this movie. Is it any good? I don't think it's very good, but this is one of those movies that really made part of my life and i can never forget it. Until today - i haven't seen the movie in several years - i can recall many of the dialogs, and a lot of the situations of the game. Brazil was eliminated in 1982's world cup after an epic game against Italy - one of the most profound traumas in Brazilian football history, an event that made Brazil to change it's game style - the art football - to a more pragmatic and tactical style. Somehow this movie reminds me of that golden period of Brazilian football."

","Excellent film. Even though I am not a football fan, I do like my war movies and this is one of my favourites. Don't ask me why - I just think that it is a very good feelgood movie because in the end, the Allies win and they still end up free. Unfortunately, not so for the people who the movie was based on - they won and were executed. However, the football is well choreographed and interesting to watch, plus it has quite a few good lines in it too."
"Kegsy","10","4","5","21 September 1998"," Great War time movie with a sporting twist.
","Escape to Victory is a movie that would be loved by any person that loves the game of soccer or enjoys a good war time movie. Set in a Prisoner of War Camp in World War 2 the movie has brought together some of the finest soccer players of all time including Pele, Bobby Moore and Ossie Ardiles (to mention a few) along with 2 of the best Actors of all time Sylvester Stallone and Michael Caine.<br/><br/>The movie is a classic of the Allies versus the Germans. The aim is for the Allies to somehow Escape from the POW camp (as the movie title may suggest).<br/><br/>A very young Sylvester Stallone and Michael Caine play excellent roles along the way to having a number of prisoners (mainly extremely well- known soccer stars) form a soccer team to have a friendly game against the Camp guards. Along the way this becomes blown out in the sense of a friendly game and becomes a matter of typical World War 2 propaganda.<br/><br/>With the soccer stars in this movie as you would expect a soccer match develops with interesting results.<br/><br/>The movie has interesting twists and keeps you poised until the end.<br/><br/>If you know anything about soccer and something of the legends of the game or you enjoy a good war time movie - then get this video. It is a 10 out of 10."
"Anonymous_Maxine","8","5","7","28 April 2005"," Stallone's take on the Great Escape.
","So I'm no expert on World War II, but the idea of some German prison officers being even remotely interested in a game of soccer between themselves and their prisoners seems pretty ludicrous to me. Nonetheless, this movie does a good job of justifying that idea, presenting it as a huge propaganda event, something that would not have been too much of a stretch coming from Nazi Germany. <br/><br/>The similarities to Steve McQueen's Great Escape are extensive, of course, but mostly in theme. i.e. the prisoners are duty-bound to constantly attempt to escape, and there are not a lot of different plot options that can come out of that duty other than a lot of officers planning tunnels and a lot of Germans trying to figure out what escape plans are being hatched under their noses.<br/><br/>In the movie's defense, even though the pairing of soccer with WWII prison camps is an uncomfortable match, the movie certainly does create tension and the ending is very, very good, I must say. When Stallone is first asked to return to the prison camp after having escaped, it was almost a mirror image of what Steve McQueen did for his fellow inmates in the 1963 version, but what unfolds in the rest of the movie is fairly original. The half time ""escape"" scene was very good as well. Having already returned once, Robert Hatch (Stallone) is faced with a choice that is much, much deeper than is commonly found in movies as low grade as many people are sure to judge this one. <br/><br/>The closing scene is by far my favorite. You may have seen it coming a mile away, but I have to admit that it didn't even occur to me and, while I was kicking myself for not having seen it coming sooner, it's one of those things where it seems perfectly natural that the events were leading there all along. And having an ending that seems perfectly natural and yet is not completely predictable is one of the more difficult balancing acts that need to be pulled off in screen-writing. For my part, I was impressed, it's just a matter of getting over that hump of accepting the basic premise. I was sure able to."

","I loved this film as a kid because I am such a huge fan of the sport and more so because it used real life footballers. I often wonder and hope with the popularity of the sport today and the level of talent why hasn't anyone tried rebooting or remaking this film. Could you imagine a film with Messi, Rinaldo, Neymar, Rooney, Suárez, etc? I would definitely recommend it be a period piece film again during WW2 and you could use some of Germany's current day greats like Klose, Mueller, Lahm, Ozil, etc. This film will always be a timeless classic for me personally."
"SimonJack","7","2","2","10 April 2017"," POWs have a ball in this WW II escape film
","Many movies made about World War II are complete fiction. The stories are totally fabricated but set within the context of the war. Most, but not all, are based on novels. Some of the better action and intriguing war films fit in this category. And, some books and movies are based on certain theaters and aspects of the war. These include battles and campaigns, the underground and resistance, POW camps and escape stories. ""Victory"" is one such movie. <br/><br/>It was based on a 1962 Hungarian film that itself was inspired by a mythical football (soccer) match between a Kiev team and the German occupation forces in the Ukraine during WW II. While there wasn't such a match, three matches did take place between a Kiev soccer club and a team of the occupying Germans. The Ukrainians won all three, and after the last match, the Kiev players were arrested and sent to concentration camps. Many other matches apparently were held between Ukrainian clubs and German Army teams – about 150 total, with the Ukrainians winning a ratio of 6-3.5-1.5. See ""The Death March"" under Wikipedia for a detailed account and more background.<br/><br/>This film is set in Germany and France, and involves British and American POWs, as well as a collection of Allied prisoners from other countries. So, ""Victory,"" aka, ""Escape to Victory"" outside America, is a combination POW, soccer competition, underground resistance, and escape film. It also fits in the category of very late films made about WW II. <br/><br/>All the players are good. But, Sylvester Stalone, as U.S. Army Capt. Robert Hatch, has some hammy lines when he is with the French girl, Renee (played by Carole Laure) in the Paris underground. Producer Freddie Fields assembled an impressive cast beyond Stalone. Michael Caine shares the lead with Stalone, as British Capt. John Colby. And, Max von Sydow plays German Major Karl Von Steiner. A coup for the film is Pele, the famous Brazilian soccer player, and several other professional soccer players for both the POW and German teams. The Allied assortment is explained by POWs who played soccer being transferred in from other prisons. <br/><br/>The film makes a clear statement about the German treatment of East Europeans, compared to prisoners from other countries. Caine's Colby insists that the soccer prisoners from Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and other Eastern countries be included. When five of them show up, they appear to be undernourished shells of former athletes. None would be able to recuperate for a long time, but Colby keeps them for the team rather than send them back. <br/><br/>The pro soccer players in the film were from teams that had won national and/or world championships. They came from Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, Denmark, England, Germany, Holland, Ireland, Norway, Poland and Scotland. The movie was filmed in Hungary and France. Because Paris had changed so much, with modern buildings in the 35 years since the end of WW II, they couldn't shoot the soccer match there. Instead, Fields found a stadium in Budapest, the ""Paris of the East.""<br/><br/>This movie is a lighter account of Allied POWs during WW II. It has none of the drama or trauma of other films about the reality of wartime POW camps. But, it is entertaining and a fun film with some good scenes of soccer play. The French underground escape by the Allied team doesn't come off as planned. The team couldn't leave at half-time with the Jerry's in the lead. To the delight of the fans – mostly thousands of French civilians hustled into the stadium to make a crowd (Hungarian extras in Budapest), the Allies rally and the game ends a tie (a legitimate Allied goal having been denied earlier). And, the excitement of the crowd turns into a spontaneous mass movement onto the field and dispersion of the Allied soccer players among the fans as they leave the stadium. <br/><br/>The ending is priceless and caps an entertaining fictional film that most members of the family should enjoy."
"slightlymad22","8","2","2","23 December 2015"," Historically Inaccurate, But A Lot Of Fun
","Continuing my plan to watch every Sly Stallone movie in order, I come to the sorts/war drama Escape To Victory. <br/><br/>Plot In A Paragraph: In World War II, a group of Nazi officers come up with a propaganda event in which an all star Nazi team will play a team composed of Allied Prisoners of War in a Football game. The Prisoners agree, planning on using the game as a means of escape from the camp.<br/><br/>Whilst every male of a certain generation loves this movie, it's a shame the movie was ignored upon its release, as Stallone gives one of the more enthusiastic performances of his career. Michael Caine and Max Von Sydow are as reliable as always, and the professional footballers are all adequate actors when needed, and are a joy to watch during the main match. <br/><br/>Once again Bill Conti delivers a triumphant score to a Sly Stallone movie. You can see why he is a favourite composer of the actor.<br/><br/>It's horribly inaccurate, given a Hollywood ending. Reportedly, once again Stallone meddled with the script and insisted that his character score the game-winning goal in the film, as he felt he was the biggest star in the film. The non-American crew was finally able to convince him of the absurdity of the goalkeeper scoring the winning goal, and the penalty shot was specifically written to keep him happy."
"rick-520-6264","7","2","2","7 January 2015"," Contrived and cheesy, but massively enjoyable
","*MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS* Having read some of the other reviews on here, it is clear that a few people may not have watched this film properly or simply fail to understand its premise.<br/><br/>It is not an historical drama, but an attempt to combine two ""boy's own"" stories - in short, an exercise in enjoyment. If you read Commando war comics as a kid, you will surely enjoy this film as I did, and if you are a football fan, just double that. Given that most of the then Ipswich Town squad were on show and featured on both sides - including ""German"" goalkeeper Laurie Sivell - I loved Escape to Victory from the time I first saw it in the early 1980s.<br/><br/>Some of the reviews here are simplistic and seem to suggest that the POW camp was full of star footballers. Not so. Steiner's (Max von Sydow's) initial idea is to have Colby's (Michael Caine's) guys knocking the ball about in the yard take on a local Wehrmacht team, but after being turned into a propaganda exercise the entire camp system is scoured for footballers - including the work camps in Eastern Europe which presents one of the more worthy moments in this otherwise light-hearted romp.<br/><br/>The senior camp officers are against the game being played, but Colby pushes for it for the sake of the Eastern Europeans, who would otherwise just be sent back to the hard labour camps.<br/><br/>The escape of Hatch (Sylvester Stallone) is an interesting sub-plot and his speaking French is comedy gold, and the paunchy Michael Caine does cut a strange figure as the team captain. As for his age however, it was not uncommon for players back then to be playing well into late thirties and early forties. Stanley Matthews played top level football until retiring at the age of forty-six.<br/><br/>As for the match itself, it is well put together for its time. Of course, we are not going to see a 2-0 win for the Germans here, and rather than scoff at the Allies coming back from 4-1 down it would be best just to enjoy it and revel in Stallone's attempts to emulate Gordon Banks - ""where do I stand for a corner kick?"" Pele's overhead kick is overcooked, yes - but this moment stirs Steiner to applaud, signifying that his love of the game of football is powerful enough to overcome his position as a German officer. His standing up to applaud has been cited by some reviewers here as strange, but in the context of the film it is realistic. His being a Wehrmacht officer is forgotten, at that moment he is simply a football fan.<br/><br/>Yes, the escape and crowd scene is cringeworthy. Big collars and bigger hair, flared trousers and the complete ignorance of the fact that the players would have been lugging themselves around in heavy football boots. But hey, just enjoy it for what it is.<br/><br/>Some more earnest reviewers have pulled up the fact that the players would have escaped at half-time, and yes - this is probably what most people would have done. But had that been the case, we would not have had the comeback to beat Liverpool's feat against Milan in 2005. In any case, Pelé clearly wins the day with his negotiating skills.<br/><br/>As for Pelé even being there, there were plenty of black Allied soldiers in German POW camps, and contrary to popular myth they were treated equally by the guards and not shipped off elsewhere. Some non-white soldiers, such as Indians opposed to the British empire, were even persuaded to fight for the Germans. Pelé is portrayed as a Jamaican corporal in the film, which doesn't stretch the boundaries that much.<br/><br/>In all, this film remains enjoyable now just as it was more than thirty years ago, in an era when Ipswich Town were pushing for the treble."
"Maziun","5","2","2","4 August 2013"," The best movie about football/soccer ?
","To enjoy ""Victory"" or ""Escape to victory"" (as it was called in some countries) you should watch it as a lighthearted war comedy. As a serious drama this movie fails . ""Victory"" is actually based on real story (see the IMDb trivia for this movie) . The authors of this movie originally wanted to make it a serious drama and a sad movie . To be honest I would love to see the serious version of this story . In the end they decided to make the light version . Maybe they felt the 80's were coming ? If this was made in the 70's it would be as serious movie. Every dramatic conflict that appears here is emotionally flat and the whole movie just shouldn't be treated as a serious one.<br/><br/>Anyway , I like what we got here . The movie feels like a mix between ""Rocky"" and ""The great escape "" . It gives the whole picture a sense of freshness . It's also probably the best movie with/about football/soccer (depends from where you are from) I've seen.<br/><br/>The characters here are rather empty . Michael Caine , Sylvester Stallone and Max von Sydow are the only actors who have got something to play for . They made their one dimensional characters enjoyable. Caine is a smart leader , Stallone is a wise guy and von Sydow is a gentleman. Other characters are truly instrumental . The football/soccer fans will be delighted to see many legends as the prisoners , including Pele and Bobby Moore . I'm proud that Poland here is represented by Kazimierz Deyna.<br/><br/>Bill Conti gives the movie very fun and uplifting music score . The football match itself feels very natural . It's well photographed, realistic and emotional . It has something that other football movies failed to capture – the beauty of this sport. The last fifteen minutes of the match is indeed done in real life time.<br/><br/>There are two really great movie scenes here – one with the radio and the second with von Sydow standing up. Yes , in the end the movie becomes a little kitschy , still it works a sort of fairytale to make you feel better. It has certain charm and is quite well directed by famous director John Huston (""Maltanese falcon"").<br/><br/>If you're in a mood for some lighthearted entertainment and you like football or Stallone (or both ) this is not a bad way to spend your time. I give it 5/10."

","Victory is one of those movies that you see sort of half-assed as a child but for some reason parts of it stick in your brain and you recall them vividly even a few decades later. I always remembered a move starring Michael Cain and Sylvester Stallone that had something to do with WW II and soccer, but I could never remember the name of it. Fortunately I stumbled across it in the ""favorites"" section at Family Video and I snatched it up, eager to see the film I had long recalled but never truly remembered. I was not disappointed. The movie felt like a classic war movie, A Bridge Too Far, The Great Escape, and Patton all came to mind. It had the classic cinema feel to it that seemed to bring it to life, and I am convinced that Sylvester Stallone could have been a serious actor had he stuck with films like Victory, rather than the action garbage like Cobra, and Rambo: First Blood Part 2.<br/><br/>The Movie centers around a friendly game of soccer between the local German team and the allied prisoners of war. The planned game catches the attention of German propaganda officers and takes on a life of its own. Instead of a friendly local scrimmage, the game becomes an international showcase of the mighty German national team against the best allied prisoners of war in all of occupied Europe. I won't give away the ending, but I can say that it is not the typical Hollywood ending, it's more clever than that. I heartily recommend this movie to all fans of cinema."

","Michael Cain plays a British POW who was a football star before the war, and with fellow POWs is kicking the ball around the nazi camp awaiting the end of the WW2. Max von Sydow, a high rank nazi official comes up to him and proposes a football match between Nazis and POWs. This movie showcases Sylvester Stallone's attempt to break out of action genre, even though his career as an action star didn't take off yet, as it was pre-Rambo. He plays a sly American POW who's only goal is to escape the nazi camp. So he makes it a priority to join the POW team, but he can't play football to save his life, because he only knows ""American football"". So they make him a goalkeeper, since only his hands are of any use to the cause. Victory is populated with football stars of the past, Pele being the most famous one. The tone of this film is very very light - it's basically ""Mean Machine"" for kids, only kids wouldn't want to watch it, because it's pretty low on twists and a generally unengaging picture."

Yes, many might view it as over the top cheesy and not very realistic, but let's not forget it's fiction. If I wanted total believability I'd read a history book not watch a Stallone movie. I think he played the perfect irreverent American to the oh so proper Brits. It also contains a few sympathetic Germans of which I'm sure there were many in reality.

","This is a good movie - for people who do and do not like football alike. It shows why people actually like football all over the world - it is about sportsmanship, dignity, team work and courage in the face of unsurmountable obstacles. But one thing should not be forgotten but the movie goers everywhere - what is depicted in the movie has its roots in historical fact. In 1941 a team of former Dynamo Kiev players challenged the might of German Wermacht to a series of matches, which, astonishingly, they have all won convincingly. And then, when it became obvious that wins in the stadium can and will inspire uprisings everywhere in occupied Ukraine, the team members were imprisoned by Gestapo. A week later on 16 August, Start defeated Rukh again, this time 8-0. Soon after that, a number of the FC Start players were arrested and tortured by the Gestapo, allegedly for being NKVD members (as Dynamo was a police-funded club). One of the arrested players Mykola Korotkykh died under torture. The rest were sent to the Syrets labour camp, where Ivan Kuzmenko, Oleksey Klimenko, and the goalkeeper Mykola Trusevich were later killed in February 1943. No escapes to Victory for these brave Ukranians. Check this link for more info - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Death_Match Whenever I watch this movie I always remember FC Start."

Very corny, but harmless enough and I always find myself watching it everytime its on TV!!"
"Ricky_Roma__","Null","3","4","20 December 2005"," Crap, but greatif you know what I mean (spoilers)
","Looking at it objectively, Escape to Victory is a lousy film. Its got bad acting, the story is hackneyed, the characters are cardboard cut outs and the sporting element contains every cliché and follows every convention of the genre. But entirely because of that, it's also one of the most enjoyable bad films ever made.<br/><br/>You know reality means nothing in this film when we're asked to believe that Michael Caine is a football star. Here's a man with two left feet, who has a spare tire around his waste and who looks unfamiliar with the concept of running. He looks more out of shape than Tomas Brolin after a thirty-day bender at the local kebab shop. But no mind, the film desperately needs acting talent, so he's it. And he does a jolly good job of just shouting his way through the film.<br/><br/>The only other capable actor is demon-slayer and Jesus himself, Max von Sydow. He's the 'good' Nazi who wants to put a game together between the German national team and the POWs. But while he can act, he too looks uncomfortable around a football (he's supposed to be a former international). Just look at the scene where he flicks the ball up with his big boots and passes it to Caine. It's obvious it's his double.<br/><br/>Other than those two, though, and aside from a few of the British officer chaps, the acting talent on display is meagre to say the least. Not only do you have to suffer the agony of Pelé, Bobby Moore, John Wark and Mike Summerbee sharing a scene with actual dialogue (the exchange further confirmed my atheism), but you also have to watch Sylvester Stallone pretending to be French. And in one scene he even fools a German soldier into believing he's a French native, despite his not-so French accent. No wonder they lost the war.<br/><br/>Further evidence of Nazi stupidity is when they're fooled by Bobby Moore's Hatch doll. Honestly, there's a scene, after Hatch escapes to contact the French Resistance, where the World Cup winner walks about with a big Hatch doll to fool his captors. It should make me hate the film, but it's so silly it's brilliant.<br/><br/>That's a sentiment that runs throughout the whole of the film. Brilliant stupidity. I mean, why does Hatch, when he becomes the trainer and is talking about possible ailments the players might suffer from, almost immediately mention anal bleeding? What are these players up to? But I like the relationship between Caine and Stallone during the training sequences. If Caine is Graham Taylor, Stallone is Phil Neal. Hatch repeats everything his boss says like a parrot.<br/><br/>But even better than that is the tracksuit moment. The entire team emerges from a hut in red uniform only to be greeted by jeers and wolf-whistles. It's sheer poetry  the Caine mince, the pugnacious 'V' sign and the defiant ""Up yours!"" Beautiful. I also like it when Caine breaks his goalkeeper's arms so that Hatch can join the team and help the escape. It's the most stiff-lipped arm breaking scene I've ever scenewhich is something to applaud.<br/><br/>But all this stuff is nothing compared to the game. This is where things get really good/bad/bloody brilliant. I mean, just take the traitorous Nazi commentator. He's English, but he's loving his fascist uniform and he adores the Fatherland. He's an evil propagandist. But he does give me an idea for a possible remake. If they ever do decide to take another stab at making the film his part should be filled by another fashion-conscious, nonsense-speaking Nazi  Ron Atkinson.<br/><br/>Once the game starts, the Allies are almost immediately losing thanks to Hatch's goalkeeping. He's like David James; he's afraid of crosses. Plus he has a curious habit of tackling strikers with two-footed challenges. Unusual technique to say the least. But I love how clueless Hatch is. Not only does he have to ask where to stand for a corner kick, but he has to ask Caine about what happens during a penalty. ""I'm supposed to stop it?"" ""Yeah, you're the goalie."" Genius.<br/><br/>But the cheating Germans crock Co Prins and then do Pelé in  two players hack him at once. However, Bobby Moore scores and at half-time they're only losing 4-1. But damn Hatch wants to escape. But then Pelé appeals to him. ""Hatch, if we run now, we loose more than a game."" You see, if they'd escaped, the Allies would have been humiliated and the occupied people would have lost heart. The Queen Mother didn't win us the war; the Allied football team did. Look it up in your history books; it's true.<br/><br/>""The Allies are playing above themselves"", says Ron when the Allies make it 4-2. Traitorous idiot! But then it's 4-3. But then the cheating ref disallows a perfectly good goal. But then Pelé comes back on (""I feel good. I feel better."") and nets the second best overhead kick in the history of the world (Trevor Sinclair's against Barnsley was better). No, actually, he nets it about fifty times, because Max von Sydow sees it in his minds eye again and again and again in slow-motion and with twinkly music. Then he leaps up and applauds, just like Gorbachev in Rocky IV (want to break a totalitarian regime? Make them watch Stallone play sports). You see, football unites the world. No violence occurs because of it. It fosters nothing but feelings of love and harmony.<br/><br/>Although I do have to say that the big 'V' for Victory that flashes up at the end of the film makes me want to give Herr Fritz a big Caine-style ""Up yours!"" <br/><br/>Oh yeah, and the dumb American saves a last minute penalty and the players escape by wearing big coats and peasant hats. Can you get to Switzerland in football boots?"

","Despite its big name cast, to include Michael Caine and Max von Sydow, Victory leaves one feeling flat. Something like what is envisioned here simply could not have happened during WWII because allied soldiers would have never put themselves in the position of even remotely offering the Germans a chance at a propaganda coup. The plot basically revolves around former English soccer player Michael Caine, now a POW, having a chance encounter in a prison camp with German officer von Sydow. The two basically hatch the plan of a soccer game between allied prisoners and the German national team. This is where the plot starts to unravel. Caine makes numerous demands such as excellent food, housing, uniforms, etc. and gets them all...very unlikely! The game it is decided, will be held in Paris. Again wouldn't the Germans be more apt to choose Berlin where they could exert total control over the goings on, rather than risk some fiasco in occupied but still hostile Paris? Of course the ending is no surprise as is typical in war movies of this kind. It's all been seen before, not even Bill Conti's brilliant score, probably the best thing about this movie, can save it."

There was little attempt to change the players' distinctive hairstyles of that era to match the period in which the film was set. The original script called for a winning goal to be scored, but this was changed to a heroic save. As a result, the film was nicknamed ""Escape to a High Scoring Draw"".<br/><br/>It was evident that none of the actors were footballers and none of the footballers were actors, but it was fairly entertaining at the time.

","The story is one of the unique tales to be based on World War II, The basic premise departs from the love of the game of football in both the sides of Allies and Axis, despite there's a war between them. The added weight of having the Nazi will be very tempted to use the game as a great propaganda against the rest of the world and the Allied POW will be tempted to use the game as a cover to escape makes the story more interesting. However, the story develops rather unpredictably weird, having Hatch willing to go back inside to convey the info to Colby, and having the mob rush in without the Nazi shooting a single bullet. There's also all the little hiccups here and there such as the alarm didn't sound when the light hit Hatch's face when he's escaping, and also the football game rather played stupidly despite being designed by Pele. The acting is surely an average one, despite the big names of Stallone, Caine, and Von Sydow here. From all the roles, I only see Michael Caine delivers a quite convincing acting, although is also refuted by the sheer weirdness of how the story unfolds."

When a major Nazi officer (Max Von Sydow) also loves the game of soccer, he asked Colby if he could form a team to play against all-star German players. The major wants the game to be played in Paris, France to attract people from all over Europe. An ambitious American Soldier Robert Hatch (Sylvester Stallone) wants to be in the team but he wants to escape as well by one of the inmates making him an good looking fake passport.

Now Hatch and the others have to plan to escape during the high profile game in Paris.<br/><br/>Directed by John Huston (The African Queen, The Maltese Falcon, Moby Dick) made an entertaining, old-fashioned adventure that is loosely based on a true story. Caine and Von Sydow certainly add class to this movie. Stallone does his best with his role but some viewers might find it unintentionally hilarious to see Stallone being a soccer goaler is certainly one of the film's least realistic moments. Although an box office disappointment, ""Victory"" has become an cult favorite for years.<br/><br/>DVD has an good anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer (also in Pan & Scan) and an decent Dolby 2.0 Mono Sound.

""Victory"" does has some good moments, especially when Pelé shows up on screen and there's some good camera work by Cinematographer:Gerry Fisher (The Exorcist 3, The Ninth Configuration, Wolfen).

","Yes, the ending is implausible. Yes, Stallone is insufferable. Yes, Bill Conti ripped off the Shostakovich Fifth. Still, while I would grow weary of watching VICTORY every month, I get a kick out of it (sorry!) every other year or so.<br/><br/>I'm a Yank who generally finds soccer ... uh, futbol about as interesting as Andy Warhol's EMPIRE. When VICTORY first came out in 1981, soccer was starting to boom as an amateur youth sport in the United States, and I really thought this rather benign and likable film would be more popular than it was. But subsequent viewings do reveal the film's strengths, including the excellent football scenes in the finale, and the solid on-screen presences of Caine and Von Sydow (despite the limitations of the script). And, let's face it, you want the Good Guys (and they were definitely the Good Guys) to kick ass on those arrogant, cheatin' Nazi bastards. (I'm anti-Nazi, not anti-German.) Maybe I've seen too many World War II movies, but when the spectators break out in the ""Marseillaise,"" and storm the field yelling ""Victoire!,"" my eyes grow moist.<br/><br/>I was not aware until I read IMDb that VICTORY was based on the 1961 Hungarian film TWO HALF TIMES IN HELL, which itself was based on the legendary ""Death Match"" involving the Ukranian FC Start team against a Luftwaffe eleven in 1942. (See ""The Death Match"" in Wikipedia.com). Sounds like the real thing would make a better film. But VICTORY, for all it's fairy-tale believability, is enjoyable enough."

I mean, who would have ever thought to do a movie where the prisoners in a German POW camp play a German team in front of a crowd of 100,000,015 French and German fans would be a good idea?! Especially, since the Germans were a little bit preoccupied with other things to undertake such a meaningless match (such as taking over Europe, conducting the Holocaust, hiding from Allied bombings, etc.). What a brainless idea and a sick way of dismissing the evil that was WWII. I wasn't surprised that Sylvester Stallone did such a movie (after all, he made OVER THE TOP and RHINESTONE), but Michael Caine, Pelé and Max Von Sydow all agreed to make this mess?!

The ""Goal"" trilogy, ""Kicking & Screaming"", ""The Damned United"", ""Mean Machine"" or ""Bend It Like Beckham"" are some of the examples of feature films about soccer. Possibly the most remembered is Victory, which dates back to 1981, one of the last projects of the double Oscar winner, John Huston (1906-1987), one of the best directors in film history (""The Maltese Falcon"", ""The African Queen"") at a time in his life when he was filming whatever he wanted, hence he dared with the psychological thriller ""Phobia"" (1980), the musical ""Annie"" (1982), and in between with this light sports tape which worked, unsurprisingly, better in Europe than in the USA.<br/><br/>Striking is the cast of ""Victory"", it features a budding American star -Sylvester Stallone-, reputed players -Michael Caine, Max Von Sydow - and retired professional soccer players - Pelé (Brazil), Bobby Moore (England), Osvaldo Ardiles (Argentina), Paul Van Himst (Belgium), Kazimierz Deyna (Poland), among others.<br/><br/>A Nazi prisoner of war camp, the place where Major Karl Von Steiner (Sydow) arrives, looking at the detail of the prisoners' control of the ball. He has an occurrence as the coach incarnates Michael Caine, a football match between the German national team and a combined ally of players who find themselves as prisoners of war. To the Germans the party serves as propaganda, to the allied selection as a possible escape route. By the way, for those who are interested, Stallone is the goalkeeper of the team.<br/><br/>The Great Escape + Rocky + Soccer = Victory. From the first he takes the entire plot and copies the music - from Bill Conti - from the second he has the main actor and an exciting sporting event on which the entire film revolves. The result is a first-rate diversion, a simple story, well told, with a familiar and certainly childish touch - the Nazis are not very bad to say, nor do I know anyone in their right mind who prefers to play the second part of a game football before escaping from a prison camp.<br/><br/>The game, which at the end of the day is what justifies the viewing, belongs to those impossible feats in which everything goes against - the result, the referee -, based on overcoming and teamwork to turn the scoreboard and come out as victorious as can be expected. Achieved, vibrant and well captured by the camera, the rest is the technique and talent of Pelé - great! - and company. Of the worst cast, Sylvester Stallone's footballing skills.<br/><br/>As a curiosity, although it is more a tragedy, Victory is a real fact that has no happy ending at all like the one on the film, quite the contrary, in 1942 part of the Dynamo Kiev team was executed for not letting themselves win against the German team."

If they threw the game then they would all be removed from the battlefield and be able to serve the rest of their time playing soccer matches across east Asia.<br/><br/>In this movie, soccer again takes center stage during a war. Except now it's the allied forces playing against Germany during WWII. The soccer game for some is a chance to beat the Germans even though they may be losing the war and for others it was a chance to escape.<br/><br/>I generally like underdog movies as most people do. The underdogs here are playing for a lot. The war won't be decided by the soccer match, but its implications and its significance is still tremendous. I'm not a soccer fan by any means, but I'll watch the World Cup because I'm a fan of major events. The soccer game in Victory was about as major as you can get without an actual title being at stake.

Based on a story about a soccer match - yes, football in the rest of the world - between German soldiers and Ukranian POW's during World War II, it's also the inspiration for The Longest Yard. The major difference is that the Nazis kill all of the good guys in Fabri's version of this story.<br/><br/>In truth, the so-called Death Match - in which FC Dynamo Kyiv defeated German soldiers - probably never happened. The team did actually play several matches against German teams and won all of them before they were sent to prison camps where at least four were killed long after the games were played.<br/><br/>Escape to Victory, as this movie is also known, features plenty of major soccer stars of ist era, including Bobby Moore, Osvaldo Ardiles, Kazimierz Deyna, Paul Van Himst, Mike Summerbee, Hallvar Thoresen, Werner Roth and perhaps the best player of all time, Pele.<br/><br/>A team of Allied POW's - who are coached by English Captain and former West Ham United star John Colby (Michael Caine) agree to play an exhibition match against a German team. However, they soon learn that this is all a publicity stunt.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Robert Hatch (Sylvester Stallone), an American who served with the Canadian Army, nags Colby into joining the team, which is a cover for an escape attempt. However, the coach worries that this will get his team killed.<br/><br/>Hatch escapes to Paris and facilitates an escape plan with the French resistance and allows himself to be recaptured so that he can send messages from British High Command to officers who are inside the camp. To get Hatch on the team, Colby has to break his goalkeeper's arm and then trains the American on how to play.<br/><br/>At halftime, the team is down 4-1 thanks to bad officiating, despite the star power of Luis Fernandez (Pele), Carlos Rey (Osvaldo Ardiles) and Terry Brady (Bobby Moore). Hatch shows that he can play goal and the team rallies back to deny a German win and escape anyway as the crowd shouts victory.<br/><br/>George Mikell continues his multiple roles as a German soldier (he also plays one in The Guns of Navarone and The Great Escape) and he's joined by Max von Sydow as Major Karl von Steiner. It's all directed by John Huston, whose career goes from the highs of The Maltese Falcon to the lows of acting in films like The VIsitor (which I love, but...man, night and day).<br/><br/>Sylvester Stallone started soccer training while filming Nighthawks under England's World Cup-winning goalkeeper, Gordon Banks. After a dislocated shoulder and breaking one of his ribs, Stallone said that soccer been harder than fighting in the Rocky movies. Apocryphically, it's said that he wanted to score the winning goal at the end of the film and it had to be explained that goalies don't get to do that, so the penalty kick scene was added in.<br/><br/>Maybe Sly was right! Since this movie was made, goalkeepers have abandoned the net and gone forward for a last-minute set-piece such as a corner, adding to the team's numbers in the area near the goal. As a yinzer, I can only assume that this is like pulling the goalie in hockey. Manchester United Peter Schmeichel actually scored a goal in 1997 under these conditions."

The German Major who used to be a great footballer before the war, and sportily admires his ex-opponents on football fields, thinks that conflicts should rather be settled on the pitch rather than on a war field, but the Nazis just want to use his efforts for their war propaganda. A great war film and football-soccer film!"

","'Victory' - sometimes known as 'Escape to Victory' - the plot of this sports drama has Nazi officers challenge their POWs to a soccer match for propaganda purposes; conflict comes as the Allied players find themselves torn between training for the game and plotting a daring escape during the game. The film is nicely shot by Gerry Fischer, with some excellent gliding nighttime shots, and the performances are very decent, especially those of co-stars Sylvester Stallone and Michael Caine with all the US versus UK contempt and animosity between them. The rest of the characters are highly interchangeable though with the film's energy coming to a near standstill in the scenes without Caine or Stallone. The basic story is also feels incredibly unrealistic, especially with the Nazis never really seeming to consider to wide opportunities for escape that they are granting the POWs. With enough suspension of disbelief though, the film can be enjoyed. A neat touch is how initially Caine never seems interested in anything but the soccer match and initially Stallone never seems interested in anything other than escaping, but as the film plods along the pair begin to see a little more eye-to-eye. 'Victory' is not quite as potent as 'Stalag 17', 'The Great Escape', 'Danger Within' and other POW escape films since the soccer game plays a very large focus, but it is refreshingly different for sure."

","Victory is unique in that star football players pretty much play themselves in a World War 2 setting, up against the ruthless efficiency of the Nazi football machine. Pele is for me one of the recognizable superstars, and you see others from Western Europe (sans Germany of course) that constitute the Allies.<br/><br/>One stomach churning scene was when one of the players allowed his arm to be broken by his fellow teammates, so Sylvester ""Rocky"" Stallone's character could return to the team. The sound effect for the arm breaking scene is something I'll never forget.<br/><br/>If Victory is remade, they've got a whole suite of stars from Europe and Asia to join a stellar cast. As for the German/Nazi team, if the German football players aren't available (for fear of offending their fan base I guess), then they can get the British and American actors who portrayed the Nazis in Valkyrie."

","I just couldn't buy the basic premise of this movie. I thought it was a passable piece of entertainment - not stellar, but good enough. But the basic premise lost me. The Nazis were masters of propaganda, and this was a truly no win scenario for them. The story has a soccer team from the German Army taking on a team made up of Allied prisoners who in peacetime had (mostly) been well known soccer players. My mind couldn't grasp how the Germans were going to milk any positive propaganda out of this. If they won - so, they beat a bunch of POWs; if they lost - WHOA! They lost to a bunch of POWS! I just couldn't buy it.<br/><br/>But set aside the unbelievable premise and this was an all right movie. The soccer angle aside, what you had was an interesting reflection on the duty of prisoners of war to escape if possible. Hatch (played by Sylvester Stallone) was a repeat escaper, who latched on to the soccer team (first as manager and then, somewhat improbably, as the goalkeeper) because it represented another chance to escape. Colby (Michael Caine) was the Allied team's captain and manager - a former star with West Ham United who now just wants to play soccer rather than escape. What started as a small affair, organized by a German officer (Max von Sydow) ended up as this huge propaganda effort, with the game played in Paris.<br/><br/>Yes it was unbelievabe that Hatch would end up as the goalkeeper. Yes it was unbelievable that Hatch would have been allowed on the team after his attempts at escape. Yes it was unbelievable that he would be put back on the team after escaping again. Yes it was unbelievable in so many ways. But it wasn't unenjoyable. Stallone's performance was pretty good, and there was a funny (to me anyway) nod to his work as Rocky Balboa as he stared down the German who was about to take the last second penalty kick. The last scenes, as the crowd stormed the field and seemed to help the prisoners escape was pretty dramatic. And the movie featured Pele - who showed no great acting talent, but offered up his famous scissors kick a couple of times.<br/><br/>Sure it was implausible - and that's generous. But very watchable, and for the most part enjoyable. (6/10)"

","In a WWII POW camp, an allied prisoner attempting escape is met with bullets. Capt. Robert Hatch (Sylvester Stallone) presents a naked plan to the escape committee. English Captain John Colby (Michael Caine) is one of the prisoners and a former professional footballer for West Ham United. Maj. Karl von Steiner (Max von Sydow) challenges him to a game. Colby accepts the challenge and starts building a team but he rejects any escape attempts. He doesn't want to get his men killed and would rather wait for the war's end. Hatch is desperate to escape and Colby reluctantly allows him to join. The Germans see the propaganda potential and set the game in Paris. Real football players are included in the movie starting with Pelé.<br/><br/>It's a rather standard POW film. The actors are solid. Stallone does not embarrass himself as the brash American. There is no equal to Max von Sydow. John Huston is doing yeoman's work but not much more. The soccer stars would be appealing to fans but I don't recognize anybody other than Pelé. I'm surprised at his natural charisma coming through the screen. He's very effective at being Pelé. Tension isn't that high. The main problem could be the Nazis. The movie needs scary Nazis to elevate the intensity and they don't mistreat their prisoners enough. As for the soccer game, I'm sure it's appealing to see these great athletes on the pitch and the bicycle kick is beautiful but it has no drama. The drama is the escape and therefore, the score is actually meaningless. The game has no rooting value. The only way to make it meaningful is to play it in Berlin in front of Hitler with no chance of escape. The stakes becomes pride but the stakes here is escape. Overall, it's not boring but it could be better. I like the final escape which has a fun element. However, it is yet another example of the lack of ruthlessness by the Nazis."

","This film mixes sports with ideology, meaning that the game (football in this case) stands for moral and human issues. The one who wins the game, proves the righteousness of his attitudes. Nazis against the allies, the Nazis cheat. Apart from some ambiguity in von Sydow's character, there are no concessions to the evilness of the Nazis. They is no possibility for redemption among them, no worthy character. So, for the way it handles the public's perspective of nazi Germany (not the top hierarchies but the others) this moves nothing forward when compared to, say, Casablanca. It's a matter of pride winning over evilness, justice prevailing over cheating.<br/><br/>The film starts with the scheduling of a football game, and ends with that game, so the whole film is a preparation for it. The game is a staged event, it takes place in Paris so we can have the audience supporting the ""right"" side. In terms of drama, this has the same effect as if the event would have been a theatre performance, or a public speech (it's as if the final allie victory in the game was the equivalent to Chaplin's speech in Great Dictator). So why does this fail where both Casablanca and The Great Dictator worked? Well, simply because this is made in 1981, the war is long over, the Soviet regime was living its final true years, and the context is totally different. It no longer mattered to have desperate declarations of honour against a by than historical regime. I don't think ww2 related films is a dead theme, we still get them today, renewed and fresh. But this is a straightforward simplistic approach that was only justifiable during the war, when the nazi horror was still being perpetrated. This one, where it stands and how it is shaped is as simplistic and ordinary as a propaganda film.<br/><br/>The film depicts football. I think football is as hard to film as dancing. But football has been less used, so we have (even) less interesting solutions to film it. The thing is, both dancing and football implied movement, the most graceful football players are themselves dancers, entangling the ball, the direct opponent, and the general situation in the field. To capture this movement interestingly you have to rely on a certain fluidity of the camera. It can be done two ways: -still framing, where the player's movement has to be worth the shot (safe and boring option); -the camera plays with the player, and the other elements, and thus enters the ""dance"". Frankly, i've never seen the second option done well. This film misses an incredible opportunity to try it. That's because it casts one of the more graceful players ever. Someone who danced like no one before or since, not as fluid as Maradona (or Messi), but eventually more thrilling in the ""one on one"" moments. He does some nice tricks for the camera, but none is properly used by the camera, and they are lost in the general boredom of the film. I wish this would be properly done some day.<br/><br/>This would be only a minor disappointment, but the thing is this film was directed by someone who used to think about cinema, besides merely directing. Huston made important things. But than again, his insight was on the narrative side, in how the story is shaped, and how it is told. Also, it is reported that by the end of his career he was sometimes only a worker collecting the pay check. Pity.<br/><br/>My opinion: 2/5 <br/><br/>http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com"

It's just a game, after all.<br/><br/>But there seems to be something about what Americans call soccer that really gets the testosterone flowing. There have been several riots over the last decade or two in soccer stadiums, some with fatalities. And in 1968, shortly after a three-game series between El Salvador and Honduras, we had the so-called soccer war between the two impoverished Central American countries. The armed forces were engaged. A C-47 flew over the enemy's lines, rolling 50 gallon drums and other ammunition out the door, hoping some of it might somehow explode. It would have been comic had not 2,000 people died, 8,000 been wounded, and perhaps 50,000 displaced. <br/><br/>John Huston must have made this kind of movie for that kind of audience. It's one of his minor works and we don't get to see the director having any real fun putting it together. It's about a rag tag team of POWs thrown against a Nazi team and passing up their opportunity to escape in order to finish the game. (Guess who wins.) I gather that our team is made up of real-life soccer heroes. Even a provincial American has heard of Pele. Except for Rocky Balboa, who is the world's heavyweight boxing champion. Oh, and Michael Caine, whose paycheck couldn't have been of sufficient magnitude to compensate him for the waste of his natural acting talent in this movie. It's really not much more than a big soccer game climax grafted onto a standard POW escape movie.<br/><br/>You ought to hear the Shastakovich-like heroic music when one of the teams wins. I'll bet that gets the old testosterone flowing, but I think I'll stick with those lines of wooden figures that kick a ball bearing back and forth on a table top.

The script isn't very good. The prison drama stuff just kinds of happens without the viewer ever getting too involved or emotionally attached to the plot, and none of the characters have a great deal of sympathy, either.<br/><br/>Perhaps it's one of those movies where there are so many characters, we don't have time to care about them. So we get Michael Caine as the token movie-star hero, Max Von Sydow as the token sympathetic Nazi, Sly Stallone as the token macho American idol, and a bunch of real footballers like Pele and Bobby Moore doing their bit on the pitch.<br/><br/>The football scenes themselves are great. They're portrayed humorously, with maximum drama and skill. The final few minutes of the final match are truly nail-biting, and all this is from a guy who typically hates football. But other than pride, what's the film all about? The prison escape drama strives to be on the same level as the one in THE GREAT ESCAPE, but I never cared about whether the characters made it or not.

","We are introduced to Captain Robert Hatch and Captain John Colby, an American and a British officer stuck in a German prison camp in World War II. Colby was once a famous football (soccer) star back before the war. He holds a mutual admiration for Major Karl von Steiner, a former player, and now a German officer. Steiner sees a possible propaganda victory in a soccer team run by Colby, and challenges him to a friendly match. Colby agrees, while the officers around him try and convince him to escape sometime during the game.<br/><br/>It is after Hatch escapes and returns with the knowledge of a way out of the change room during halftime, Colby agrees to get him, and his ragtag team of soccer stars, out. But can they leave victorious as well...<br/><br/>My first thought when I heard of Victory was, ""Wow, that sounds campy."" After I saw it, I though ""Wow, that was campy."" As soon as you see Michael Caine and Max von Sydow as two former soccer stars, you can pretty much give up all hope for a serious film. Although that doesn't mean Huston doesn't try. Or at least he appears to try. Everyone involved takes it so seriously, it's actually kind of funny. There are points where you just start laughing at the absolute absurdity of the situation.<br/><br/>I mean really...a soccer game? The fate of World War Two depends on a soccer game? Well, according to this film it does. And the soccer game is so bad, it's actually entertaining. Don't get me wrong, I am not a huge fan of soccer, but I know that no soccer game can have as many absurd kicks and slow motion goalkeeping while someone yells ""Victory!"" in the background. The soccer game is so cheesy, that it instantly becomes memorable. That is not to say that the film proceeding it hasn't the same absurd perks.<br/><br/>The opening hour is pretty much just a setup for the big game, with Michael Caine doing a lot of running and shouting while Sylvester Stallone breaks out of prison from the shower. I mean, really... And I'm not even going to mention the ending, which is so implausible that even a six year old could have said ""That's impossible!"" Stallone could be considered to be the main character, I guess (he is billed first). He does an adequate job, but I have trouble believing that the bulky Stallone and the potbellied Caine are starving POW's. Stallone gets the bulk of the film's most dramatic scenes, which isn't a bad decision, but this is an action film.<br/><br/>At times it appears that Stallone is having a hard time deciding what his character is all about, while reading his lines in the same tone. He can really dive for a ball in slow motion though... Caine, when contrasted with Stallone seems like he's doing Shakespeare. He gives the best performance of the film (meaning he doesn't suck), while actually giving, gasp!, depth to his performance. Caine has always been a great actor, but he still didn't catch onto the campiness of the film, so he plays it straight. This makes it even cheesier, thus making it more entertaining.<br/><br/>There is another actor involved who gives an average performance, Max von Sydow. Von Sydow has always been a great actor, and he may have been the only actor in on the joke. He also portrays the nicest doggone Nazi I've ever seen. He just isn't threatening, but he is entertaining. After Pele gives a slow motion bicycle kick, he stands up and claps with absolute reverence. Oh, and Pele plays for the opposite team than the one he is supposed to cheer for. Just thinking about that moment has me in stitches.<br/><br/>Speaking of Pele, most of the cast is made up of famous soccer players. Besides Pele, who is largely considered one of the greatest soccer players of all time, the film also features Bobby Moore, Osvaldo Ardiles and so on. They all perform greatly on the field, as they do a lot of kicking, and yelling at Germans. The script is an absolute mess, yet it is such an entertaining mess! It walks the thin line between bad and average skillfully.<br/><br/>The cinematography is nothing to write home about, but I must pay tribute to Bill Conti's bombastic score. It is overly patriotic in the best way possible, in someways foreshadowing his terrific score to The Right Stuff. Also bombastic are the sets, particularly the stadium where the pivotal game is played, and contribute to the over the top nature of the film.<br/><br/>And that about brings me to Huston's direction. I know that he was nearing the end of his life, but this film is so lifeless, so devoid of direction, that you could have literally changed the directorial credit to anyone else, and I would have believed it. I do not mean to harp on the same point in every one of these reviews, but it is so frustrating that the film is so languid and relaxed direction wise, it gets me every time. Overall, this film is so bad, it is incredibly entertaining. In a campy sort of way, you could call it a success, but as a film it is definitely lacking.<br/><br/>Oh, and by the way, at one point Sylvester Stallone speaks french.

I even believe it gives me the right to smirk at some of the cheesier moments with ease because when all is said and done I am still very fond of this presentation and always will be. Right. Happy? So where shall we start. Well how about John Huston? One of the most legendary cinematic monoliths ever to come out of Hollywood, ends up directing a movie about football or, as Huston would have said at the time, 'so-ccer'. It's akin to Martin Scorcese directing a Tom And Jerry episode or Clint Eastwood appearing in Celebrity Big Brother. Quite how much 'direction' Huston had over the football scenes is highly debatable, but that is the first shock over with. The plot is utterly ludicrous of course. An allied Prisoner of War camp just happens to house some of the worlds most infamous footballing legends, and they put together a team to play a German side, with much of the outcome designed to further progress Nazi propaganda. Inevitably, the Germans punch, kick and cheat their way through the game whilst 'our boys' look on helplessly. The sub plot here is that during half time, the Allies will make a daring bid to escape and not return for the second half. But you guessed it, whilst still believing the game can be won, the English led team decide not to take an ideal opportunity to escape from a POW camp and instead return to the field for the honour of a football match. Given that they entertain the crowd so much with their football that it sparks a pitch invasion at the end which precipitates their escape anyway, this gives the wafer thin plot even more ridicule. But do you know what? I don't care. This is how football movies should be made. I don't care that 'we' have Sylvester Stallone in goal. I don't care if a pushing-fifty year old Michael Caine mixes it with the football heavyweights like Booby Moore and Pele. I don't care if every sporting cliché is visited shamelessly to great effect. We even get 'Nazi' softie Max Von Sydow eventually applauding the breathtaking football skills of the Allies to the evident brow furrowing of his superiors. It's just a good romp through a genre we've seen so many times before. In fact, giving a war film a footballing theme could be seen as being dynamic and ahead of its time. Actually, I've just thought of an idea - how about a war film set in a POW camp that gets visited by ruthless aliens? Steady on now, I'm in full flow. This is popcorn cinema at its best - nothing to take very seriously and all good fun. Yes, that seems ridiculous even now when you consider the backdrop the movie is set against, but it is the case that nothing more preposterous yet at the same time compelling came out of Hollywood in the eighties. Then again, there's always The Hand."

","I don't know who first said that,but it has become a bit of a truism,and,like most truisms,it has a kernel of truth. No other position in the field of play is so exposed.One error can live with you for ever.You've got to get down among the flying boots and up among the flying elbows.You've got to judge speed,angles,flight of the ball and organise your defence.In fact you've got to be crazy to want to be a goalkeeper.Mr S.Stallone fits the bill in ""Escape to Victory"". His antics reminded me of Rene Higuita of ""Scorpion kick"" fame the Colombian international goalie who served time for his connection to the Medellin cartel. I'm not sure who the movie was aimed at.Stallone to attract the Yanks? Pele to attract the Brazilians?The great Bobby Moore to keep us Brits happy? Many of Mr Huston's later films were not exactly fireworks at the Box - Office but I guess video and now DVD saved this one. A bit like ""The Great Ecape"" - everybody knows what happens and it is impossible to criticise seriously because it's just a bit of trivia that the Old Man knocked out between the things he really wanted to do. Just go with the flow and you'll be O.K."
"bkoganbing","6","0","3","13 June 2010"," What Is The Goal?
","This was a strange project that John Huston chose late in his career for a film. Victory is a weird combination of The Longest Yard, The Great Escape and Bridge On The River Kwai when it comes to Michael Caine's concern for his man overriding all.<br/><br/>Not that the Germans were treating the POWs like the Japanese were. The German brutality was reserved for concentration camp inmates. Still when German commandant Max Von Sydow sees a pickup soccer game, he suggests a match between the prisoners and the German Army. Of course the German Army has some really good pre-war soccer players, but among the prisoners there are some good ones as well, including one of the best ones ever in Pele. The rest of the cast also includes some first class soccer players of 1981 playing roles.<br/><br/>Michael Caine sees a way away from labor camps and the Germans see good propaganda value in a match where the Nazis play with brutality like they do everything else. <br/><br/>Playing the Steve McQueen role of the non-conformist is Sylvester Stallone who has escape uppermost in his mind. Still Caine and Stallone do come to an accommodation of sorts and you have to see the film to see how it all plays out.<br/><br/>Victory is not going to rank with The Maltese Falcon or Moulin Rouge two of Huston's greatest films in my humble opinion. Still it's a nice male camaraderie film with a wartime setting though it is way too far-fetched for me."

","I saw this in it's original theatrical release. Not a great movie in my book. Just OK. I understand and accept the premise that an American POW would know nothing of the game but could be a goalie. American sports (especially at that time) did not use the feet for anything except running. Ours used the hands (""foot""ball, basketball, baseball) so it is logical that this character could be a good goalie. Stallone???? Miscast in my opinion.<br/><br/>On the whole, a feel-good movie that could have been better with some gritty realism.<br/><br/>Now, I distinctly recall in the last scene, the Michael Caine character, as he was running off the field, raising his hand to the Germans and giving them the reverse-V sign. That is, the first two fingers of the hand split in a ""V"" but the back of the hand towards the recipient. The English version of our middle finger flip off. I have never seen this again in any subsequent viewing of the movie. Did he manage to slip one by the studio for a time?"

","There are some movies, few in number, which start off as turkeys in the public consciousness and acquire greatness over time. Some achieve notoriety rather than fame. Some are so awful they fascinate the viewer - a bit like seeing a huge naked woman climb out of the bath (or a huge naked guy if you're a female).<br/><br/>Escape to Victory is a bit of all of these - it's a wonderful movie for trivia buffs (boys night out). Just the concept of Michael Caine, Sylvester Stallone, Max Von Sydow and Pele in the same movie is almost incomprehensible.<br/><br/>This is 'The Great Escape' meets 'Match of the Day' and a bit like 'Godzilla meeting King Kong'. What saves it is the football - the action sequences are generally really well done.<br/><br/>I suspect that 99% of blokes secretly like this movie and 95% of women hate it - another reason for it being a classic of its type.<br/><br/>It came on TV late one night about three months ago. As it was announced my brain went 'Oh No'! I watched it all the way through and thoroughly enjoyed it.<br/><br/>Oscar Wilde said of the death of Little Nell - 'You would have to have a heart of stone not to laugh'. Esacpe to Victory is a bit like that - its conceptual awfulness is so far outweighed by the sheer exuberance and camaraderie of the action."

","I really like POW war films, e.g. The Great Escape, The Bridge on the River Kwai, and this one from director John Huston (The African Queen) is quite an alright one. It is World War II, and the Nazi officers are sure they could win a football (soccer for Americans) against the many prisoners, and they accept the challenge. The prisoners/players in the team include leader English John Colby (Sir Michael Caine), American Robert Hatch (Sylvester Stallone), Trinidad's Luis Fernandez (Pelé), English Terry Brady (Bobby Moore), Argentina's Carlos Rey (Osvaldo Ardiles), Belguim Michel Fileu (Paul Van Himst), Polish Paul Wolchek (Kazimierz Deyna), Norway's Gunnar Hilsson (Hallvar Thorensen), English Sid Harmor (Mike Summerbee), Holland's Pieter Van Beck (Co Prins), English Doug Clure (Russell Osman), Scotland's Arthur Hayes (John Wark), Denmark' Erik Borge (Søren Lindsted) and Irish Tony Lewis (Kevin O'Calloghan). The opposition (all Germans) includes Major Karl Von Steiner (Max Von Sydow), Coach Mueller (Gary Waldhorn) and Team captain Baumann (Werner Roth). The prisoners see this game as a getaway, i.e. with a hole in the locker/shower room, but in the end they still carry on and defeat the Nazis, and as far as I could make out, escaped in the charging crowd. Also starring Daniel Massey as Colonel Waldron, Tim Pigott-Smith as Rose, Julian Curry as Sherlock, Clive Merrison as Forger, Maurice Roëves as Pyrie and Anton Diffring as the German Commentator. The POW camp moments are good, the one or two escape attempts (including one by Stallone) are good, and the game is engaging. Worth watching!"
"canadiancinderella","Null","0","2","13 February 2008"," Just Okay
","This movie wasn't very good but I thought it would be a lot worse than it was. It was far from terrible. It's about a soccer game to be played in Paris while Paris was still occupied by the Nazis. The game would have the German National Team play against (and the Nazis obviously think they will easily crash them) a team of allied prisoners of war. But the allied prisoners have other plans and they intend to use the game as an opportunity to escape from the Nazis. Sylvester Stallone is an American officer and the hero of the movie. Michael Caine is the English officer. It's pretty easy to guess how the movie goes and what happens in the end, at least we thought so. All in all an okay movie and a decent waste of time but I would recommend waiting to see it on TV. It's not worth buying or renting."

It's a feel good sports movie with a typical happy ending - you know the score: Slo-mo goal, Nazi's defeated, allies escape, football is the answer to all life's problems. Whilst it is most definitely a huge slice of Camembert it made me get one of those ""I love you guys"" moments when they escape.

","To the comment below, yes the Germans took black prisoners of war.  See for example the book ""Trail of the Fox"" which describes the Afrika Korps capturing black South Africans fighting with the British in North Africa (and General Rommel's refusal to honor white South African POW's request to segregate them!  Ironic indeed!).  Also, the Germans captured any number of African American GI's, and in Belgium some years back, I learned that some were massacred during the Battle of the Bulge.<br/><br/>As for the movie, the soccer (football to non-Americans) scenes are well done, but the plot is absurd.  The prisoners' reaction to their chance to escape at halftime stretches credulity, to say the least.  Certainly worse movies have been made, but this one is a major disappointment."
"barnabyrudge","Null","0","3","15 January 2003"," Unusual but only partially successful
","Victory (a.k.a Escape to Victory) is an unusual film, combining a wartime setting with a story about a football match. It sounds like a lot of fun, but is actually pretty boring for a good deal of the running time. However, at the end it livens up considerably with a well staged and exciting sequence in which the football match takes place.<br/><br/>It is a miscast film for sure. Sylvester Stallone as the goalkeeper, Michael Caine as an ex-England and West Ham player and Max von Sydow as a sympathetic Nazi are less than convincing choices. The story hinges on a less than believable scenarion that the PoWs persuade the German government to let them play an exhibition match against a professional German team. The PoWs use the match as a cover for an escape attempt, while the Germans use it as a publicity stunt to emphasise German superiority. On the whole, the story is hard to take seriously and it's probably best if you don't. Just sit back and try to enjoy it. As dull as the opening scenes are, they are probably just about worth enduring for the final match."

","The film that inspired a million overhead kicks and also lead to thousands of youngsters believing they could play in goal after watching Sly Stallone's woefully pathetic attempt in between the sticks. This sporting 'Great Escape' mixed the stars of film and soccer (mainly Ipswich's Europe conquering side but also Pele and Ardiles) and produced a satisfactory effort. The acting is better than I am sure they hoped and the cast looked like they were enjoying themselves. The subject matter was serious though and you would come away with either a sense of triumph and enthusiasm for the human of spirit or, at the very least, the appreciation that Saturday's big game isn't against a crack team of army players!"

There is no way the Germans would have allowed such a large gathering in any occupied city, let alone Paris, for just what happens at the end of the movie; the fans riot.

","WARNING: REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS<br/><br/>
Never mind Schindler's List, what about von Steiner's football team? It's the silliest-ever premise for a movie: did you know that Michael Caine and Sylvester Stallone played a football match against the Nazis in World War II? What makes it even dafter is that real football players make up their team. Seeing Caine shouting ""leave it, it's mine"" to PelÃ© and Bobby Moore is amusing, though despite the patently ridiculous plot all concerned play it with remarkable conviction.<br/><br/>Stallone, to his credit, manages not to disgrace himself against assured performances from Caine and Max von Sydow, and even gets to do a ""bloodied, staying in the match as the final minutes tick away and his vision blurs in slow motion"" bit a la Rocky. In fact, when a Nazi General starts clapping the victorious (actually it's a draw which is a weird outcome) Allied team, it may even have inspired him to make Rocky IV.<br/><br/>John Huston, the director of such variable projects as the classic Maltese Falcon, the so-so African Queen and the abysmal Casino Royale, manages to bring some dignity to proceedings. The whole thing is quite offensive when given a great deal of thought. The idea that the deaths of men in concentration camps have been laid to celluloid as kindly Nazis just wanting a bit of a kick-about is a dubious form of entertainment.<br/><br/>At a 110 minutes it's at least 20 minutes too long, though the final third with the actual match does generate sufficient interest. And of course, when an escape committee tunnel through into the Allies' changing room at half-time, you know that the team will insist on playing on. Stupid, but compelling..."
