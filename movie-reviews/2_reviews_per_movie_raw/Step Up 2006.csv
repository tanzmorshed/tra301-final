"jemps918","9","56","69","11 November 2006"," Step Up does justice to its genre by not pulling any stops in delivering a truly enjoyable movie
","Choreographer and now director Anne Fletcher hits the mother lode with this gem of a dance flick! Having painfully seen similar dance-themed teen movies in the past (Take the Lead, Save the Last Dance, etc.), Step Up does justice to its genre by not pulling any stops in delivering a truly enjoyable movie. Hindi nagtipid sa pasikat.<br/><br/>Unlike similar movies where the audience agonizingly waits through scene after scene of boredom for a grand dance finale (which usually fails to enthrall anyway), Step Up treats the audience to several impressive, memorable sequences thoughtfully scattered throughout the movie. Finally, we are entertained by a dance flick where the leads (Jenna Dewan and Channing Tatum) are both beautiful to watch, have good chemistry (enough to sustain the kilig factor) and can really deliver the moves.<br/><br/>Dewan is a superb dancer; she has a fabulously fit body, not the anorexic ballerina type, and she dons her outfits exceptionally well for someone who's only 5'3"". It was also amazing to watch such a tall, gorgeous man like Tatum move the way he does (it must help that the boy knows his Kung Fu!). His deadpan facial expression makes his line deliveries unexpectedly funny. The supporting cast also amply sustains the rest of the story. Step Up churns out enough high points that you pardon its hiccuppy subplots and scene-stealing extras."

","people keep talking about how awful ""step up"" was, or how it was such a waste of money. but now here are my two cents. it was, in fact, a good movie. the dancing was FABULOUS, and even though the acting could have improved, this movie was nothing short of amazing. the music was catchy and hot, and there was just enough romance in it to make it cute but not gross or sleazy. it had literally EVERYTHING you could ask for in a movie: romance, drama, comedy, and it was even slightly scary at some parts, too. Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan did a great job. their dancing, along with everyone else's, was phenomenal. when i left the movie, i was actually inspired to be a dancer (even though i never will be.) the main reason people are turning down this movie is because of the acting. sure, the acting could have been better, but this movie was focusing on the DANCING. obviously you have to be a good actor to be in a movie, but the dancing was the main focus of this film. and i personally think the dancing was great. i couldn't ask for it to be better. this movie is definitely worth seeing, whether you're into hip-hop or not."

","In Baltimore, the troublemaker and street dancer Tyler Gage (Channing Tatum) lives with his foster parents in an Afro-American lower class neighborhood. His best friends are Mac Carter (Damaine Radcliff) and his little brother Skinny Carter (De'Shawn Washington) and they use to hang around together, going to parties and stealing cars. After being expelled of a party, the trio breaks in the Maryland School of Arts and commits vandalism, destroying the stage. Tyler is arrested and sentenced to 200 hours of community service in the school and Director Gordon (Rachel Griffiths) assigns him to help the janitor cleaning the place. One afternoon, the ballet dancer Nora Clark (Jenna Dewan) sees Tyler dancing in the parking area and when her partner Andrew (Tim Lacatena) has a strain and Tyler offers to help her in the choreography, she accepts the offer; they rehearsal and become close to each other while Tyler becomes friend of the students Miles Darby (Mario) and Lucy Avila (Drew Sidora). When Andrew returns, Tyler that is known for quitting everything he starts gives up dancing and leaves Nora alone. After an incident, Tyler has to decide to follow his dream or return to his life of rebel loser. <br/><br/>""Step Up"" was a wonderful and delightful surprise for me. The heartwarming romantic story shows a perfect chemistry between Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan, supported by a magnificent cast and awesome songs and choreographies of dance. There are also drama and tragedy, funny moments and I recalled Alan Parker's ""Fame"" and ""Center Stage"" with the students following their dreams in an art school. The characters are nice, the actors and actresses are excellent and I have really loved this movie. My vote is eight.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Ela Dança, Eu Danço"" (""She Dances, I Dance"")"
"Kylah","8","81","117","19 August 2006"," An enjoyable movie!
","I thought this movie was really good. I'll admit the acting may not have been to it's full potential.. but I still thought it was pretty good. The movie is based on dancing and overall I thought the technique was very good. The talent displayed in this movie is extraordinary. The movie has romance, comedy, tragedy, and nearly everything else you would want in a good movie. The music in this movie is also really good. I would say this movie is well worth the money I spent. Step Up is inspirational and was everything I was expecting it to be. I'd highly recommend seeing it. If you enjoyed the movie Save The Last Dance this is probably a good movie for you. I found this movie to be very uplifting."
"bball_442001","6","43","62","12 August 2006"," Save the Last Dirty Dancing, but overall a treat
","While several portions of this movie were textbook cliché, I thoroughly enjoyed every second of it. Usually I don't bother with mainstream, commercial movies that are so obviously and unabashedly manufactured to sell to a teenage audience, but I had seen Channing Tatum in She's the Man (another movie that I was hesitant to see, but didn't regret it afterward), and thought he was absolutely gorgeous! Step Up would not have been as good as it was without him. He made even some of the more awkward lines of the script sound original and I really enjoyed watching him bust a move. Several parts were genuinely amusing and heart-warming despite the well-worn story of a bad boy from the wrong side of the tracks who falls in love with the uptight rich dancer. Overall, it was pure fluffy entertainment, like Save the Last Dirty Dancing. Just don't go in expecting much or analyze it too deeply and you'll enjoy it as much as I did."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","33","47","12 November 2006"," Love the dance (and music), forget the story
","You've seen it all  feel-good story of deprived, delinquent kid finding the meaning of life, dedicated effort culminating in an upbeat dance finale, rich-girl-poor-guy routine, and a whole bunch of familiar situations. But, if the dance and music are good, you'll tend to forget the improbable, unlikely, illogical, contrived story and plot. Given the lame script, top choreographer Anne Fletcher's first crack at directing didn't come off too badly, partly because of the wise use of very short scenes. As to the dance routines, with her credentials, you wouldn't expect anything less than good, and the movie does deliver in that department. The stimulating fusion of hip hop and ballet is well synchronized with fusion in the music. While the attention would obviously be on the showcase number that the protagonists are developing, I also like one particular scene at a gig, when the two sidekicks sing on stage while the two leads do their thing on the dance floor. This scene has the beauty of exciting spontaneity not seen elsewhere in the movie."

","What a wonderful surprise to find such a terrific film of dance and music in STEP UP and the actors/dancers were out of this world. Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan are magic on the screen and the music is sensational. My friend, Alia, from UCLA, had raved about this film and wanted me to see it, and I am so glad that I did. I found not only the music and dancing, but the story set in the jungle of a big city of young black men and a young white man struggling to survive and come up with fulfilling lives, to be a journey that is true to the lives of so many young men and women today in metropolitan cities in the USA.<br/><br/>Duane Adler and Melissa Rosenberg have created a film in STEP UP that just hits your heart and soul with the character development created through the actors music and dance, and the sets and costumes which fit each character. I didn't want this film to end, but the last scene is just the one you wanted to see and feel. With STEP UP, you have a strong story, incredible music, wonderful young actors in a diverse world, and the hope that now their young lives can really begin. Loved this film."
"Kryzak","4","31","47","29 January 2007"," Good Dancing, ignore the plot
","Going into the movie with the right expectations, I somewhat liked this movie. Like most reviewers who have seen this movie, I fully agree that the plot was razor thin, clichéd, and I could predict every plot twist from the very beginning of the movie. But, the dancing sequences were VERY well done, and I really enjoyed the fusion of classical and hip-hop dance (both which I enjoy watching). The music/soundtrack of the movie was also very good, which made the ""drama"" scenes more bearable. The leads (Jenna Dewan and Channing Tatum) were OK as actors, but their dancing throughout the movie was impressive and mesmerizing.<br/><br/>All in all, a movie worth watching if you like to watch good dance sequences, and this movie is MUCH MUCH MUCH better than ""You Got Served"" in terms of the plot and drama. Then again, that doesn't say much, does it? =P"
"wrlang","4","31","52","1 January 2007"," following in others footsteps
","Step Up is a fair dance film about some kids that get their big performance break. The film is average in every way with little more for the viewer. A jock fights external prejudices to become a dancer with an accomplished partner and a teach who sees something special. The acting was fine, but the dialog and directing had little to add to overcoming a predictable story. None the less you still feel quite good about the outcome of the film. There were some dark scenes and some typical generalizations about dancers that went a little overboard. This is a class B+ film with moderate continuity errors and dialog mishaps. The scenery was good and the characters held true to life. It is worth the watch if you like that kind of film."

","This movie couldn't make me feel better. The actors brought it alive, and it was good overall. The songs made me feel like I was in the movie. It must've been really fun to make this and then watch your progress at the end. I've never taken dance or anything, but watching this movie inspired me. I'd love to take that kind of dance. It's modern ballet right? Well anyways, if you haven't seen this yet, you should. It'll bring you alive. I was just talking about seeing it before but now.. I wanna try it. It seems like you can make anything happen with a friend by your side and somebody to guide you through. Oh and by the way, I give props to the actors. They were greatt."

","My cousin heather wanted to go to this movie, so she took me with her. I thought the movie was going to suck, but it ended up...that it was one of the best movies i seen all year. I really recommend that you watch this movie. The movie was based on two people, both from their own worlds. The world of break dancing, and the world of ballet. Comes together and falls in love. When Tyler is ditching his friends for Nora, they got mad at him. But they grow closer when ""skinny"" gets shot by a gang. With the loss of skinny behind them both...they go on again...but he doesn't forget his friends. So again...from a guy who is not sensitive..i recommend step up."

","'Take Fame' and 'You've Got Served' and roughly jam them together and what do you got? This God awful movie custom made for dull-normal adolescents. The plot very closely follows 'You've Got Served.' Three ghetto afro-teeners, this time living in John Water's Baltimorenot far from 'Peckers' homespend their time getting failing grades in high school and dancing in dilapidated 100-year-old buildings with hoochy-mamas. To finance their expensive baggy hip-hop clothing tastes, they steal cars and deliver them to the local chop shopnot unlike John (Tony Manaro) Travolta who worked in a Brooklyn paint store so he could purchase his polyester disco clothes.<br/><br/>Tyler Gage, one of the black three musketeers, gets caught trashing the local Fame High School and is forced to perform janitorial duties. He meets Nora Clark, a 26-year-old white high school student and discovers he's Irish-American, much to the chagrin of his black buddies Mac and Skinny.<br/><br/>As in 'You've Got Served' crime doesn't pay and Skinny, the youngest member of the trio gets shot by a Bad Bad Leroy Brown typebut that doesn't stop the musicand heart-stopping finale."

","I honestly don't know what I was thinking going to this movie on opening night. Oh yeah... because the trailers were incredibly misleading. It was like an entirely different film. My motivation was pretty much based on that fine white boy from Coach Carter... who now has a new name ; Spaz McNoact. That boy should just not open his pretty mouth.<br/><br/>Let me sum up the entirety of the film. Take the acting from you got served, add the dancing from the rejects on So You Think You Can Dance, and add the plot holes from... lets say... The Jacket. If you don't commit to a role, then you come off as a phony. That doesn't even begin to describe the cast of this Jem. It was uninspired, extremely forced to a point where I became uncomfortable, and topped off with lazy, lazy acting. The filmmaker tried to squeeze every possible storyline into the film without making any sort of believable or understandable connection. Conflict and drama were produced out of thin air leading to a rushed and calculated ending. <br/><br/>I wasn't expecting a masterpiece, but i honestly feel cheated. I sat there wondering if I was hallucinating this entire film and was thinking up ways to get my money back. People aren't that thick. Filmmakers should give them a little more credit than this.

","the actors cannot act. all dialoague was plagued with bad accents and loss of character. Channing Tatum never moves his lips or changes his facial expression... EVER.<br/><br/>the story is nothing new at all. some kid from the street gets involved in a professional world of dance and it turns his life around. that coupled with the whole incident involving the little kid is taken straight from You Got Served and Save the Last Dance (I'm not saying that those movies were any good either, but that is to say that this movie brought nothing new to the table).<br/><br/>and the dancing... THERE WERE ONLY 3 DANCE SEQUENCES IN THE ENTIRE MOVIE AND 2 OF THEM WERE TAKEN STRAIGHT FROM THE COMMERCIAL. perhaps i'm being overly critical because i am a dancer, but maybe thats what needs to be heard. Channing Tatum is NOT by any means a b-boy. his little solo in the parking lot had little style, technique, or any wow factor, all of which are part of a street dancer's criteria. All of the jazz and ballet in the movie had nothing to offer except bad technique and a few acceptable twirls, but nothing more. the grande finale left me thinking ""... OK, now they're gonna get serious"" all the way through the end when i realized it never was going to happen.<br/><br/>i'll admit that im sure it is difficult to make a good dance movie, but Step up is no exception to the rule. You Got Served, with the exception of its inconsistencies with street dance culture at least had the dance aspect. Save the Last Dance was garbage, and so was just about any musical from the past 10 years (although i was impressed with Moulin Rouge)... look to Center Stage for Ballet, look to Beat Street for Hip-Hop"

","If you are looking for another ""Save the Last Dance"" type of movie, save your money. I'm a professional dancer of 20 years who can never pass up a dance movie, however this one didn't deliver the goods. I was disappointed in the lack of a story that held no depth you can chew on. The story follows a similar theme: Boy is a great b boy dancer who happens to be poor. Girl goes to prestigious art school and is a ballerina. Their worlds clash. They dance together. The end. The story line is very base and boring. The art school director's character is beyond unbelievable. I think her entire character consisted of frowning at b boy dancer as a punctuation to each scene that included him, up until the end. The two leads hardly look young enough to be in high school. Jenna Dewan looks like a 25 year old chain smoker, rather than a fit and healthy dancer. She tried her best to whine and produce teenage angst toward her mother, who was just as boring to watch as she was. Jenna's friend in the movie gets cheated on by her boyfriend, an aspiring singer. Predictable. The music was dull and uninspiring. Personally I couldn't wait to leave. I wanted to walk out on the film, yet at the same time wanted to give it a chance. If you truly want to see this film, wait until the last 15 minutes of it, walk in and sit down to see the ""senior recital"", where girl and b boy boyfriend get on the stage and do a decent production number, but then it's over. This was about the only interesting part of the entire 98 minutes."

","hello folks. i saw this movie. yeah, i can't believe it either. i REALLY didn't want to see it but i had to fulfill a promise (i said i'd go with my friend, who had a part as an extra in it), so there I was at the theater on a Friday morning, waiting for ""Step Up"" to begin. i gotta say i should have bought eight tickets, and reserved all seats in a 360 degree radius of myself, that way no one would have been affected by the splash damage of my vomit. this movie was audacious. granted, my opinion of the movie was low from the start, but i can assure you if you DID NOT like what you saw in the advertisements, you need to ESPECIALLY stay far away. the story is bad enough (this has all been done before, especially in ""save the last dance""), and it's made even worse by the terrible actors. What's with all the hype for Channing Tatum? He wasn't very good in ""coach carter"", and he's downright terrible in this (i'm looking for a deleted scene where he cuts his arm and you can see his robotic circuitry underneath). Jenna Dewam is not a good leading lady, she makes no strides to prove she has any acting chops at all. I've seen scarface do better lines than her. A large portion of my problems rest with the cast, they must've picked these guys up from the trash bin outside the set of Dawson's Creek or something, because everything they say oozes of coy, bipolar emotive, over-the-top yet completely nonsensical dialogue. seriously this movie is like a soundboard, where random phrases are strewn together to make a somewhat coherent, but awkward dialogue. the actors don't deliver but a lot of the blame also goes to the writers, who wrote this crap? if someone tells me ""you don't know what you're getting yourself into..."" i think of more serious things associated with that phrase, like joining the yakuza or Scientology, but not a warning to the tribulations of learning how to friggin' dance! and speaking of dancing, for those people who are solely seeing this movie for that very aspect, you can find more exciting stuff elsewhere. the footwork is very mundane, and not as thrilling as the ads play it out to be. i'd stick with MTV. All in all, this movie was just plain bad. Not ""uwe boll so bad it's good"" kinda bad, but ""tricking the teens/pre-teens/dates into paying for a big steaming turd"" bad. I don't know if Hollywood is doing some kind of science experiment to see if they can get people to see their terrible movies by baiting it with popular music, cool slang, and ""fresh young talent"", but I implore you guys to not see this waste of celluloid. Things like this and John Tucker Must Die aren't even of the same pedigree of the ""stupid but semi-fun"" teen movies that were trouncing around 5 or 6 years ago... this movie needs to STEP DOWN.<br/><br/>and to top it off, my friend's scene didn't even make the cut."

But no - that isn't a licence to forgive it's drawbacks. Was there anyone who watched this who after 10 mins wasn't certain of the plot and final outcome? Boy from wrong side of the sticks meets middle-class girl. One is an untrained but talented street dancer, the other a formally trained ballerina. They get together - and end up assisting each other to make the 'step up'. And it all culminates in a big show that blends together the two styles and catapults both up the greasy dance pole (so to speak). Now how long did that story take to work out? I was made to see this on a very uncomfortable flight from Frankfurt to Osaka. At the time - I didn't imagine the flight could get any worse - I was so very very wrong.....It made me want to step 'out' - not up."

It just felt like one is always aware of the falseness of it all and my expectations were low, just hoping for some pleasant entertainment, but there was little that was either pleasing or entertaining and sitting through the rest was too much to get to the energy of some of the dances. The director appears to know about staging and filming a dance but little else about the art of film.

I really regret it because now they think they can get away with sucky movies like this and make a crap-load of money. But the acting. Whoa! The acting stunk big time. It was flat and I didn't feel anything real coming off the characters. The actors looked so self-conscious that they gave the kind of performance a first grader would give in their first play. Then again you can't look very good when the script is as predictable as time. Analogy: 4:29 is to 4:30 as Tyler and friend warning Skinny is to Skinny getting shot. I called that one. We see the Escalade and my friend goes ""I betcha anything he steals that car."" And wudya know he did. And when they said, ""Yo dat's PJ's truck"" I said, ""I bet my cell phone that he gets shot and killed within 1 minute. And wudya know? He did! And all the drama parts in this movie totally sucked.

","Step Up was quite honestly painful to watch. The movie perhaps one of the most cliché and predictable and boring story lines i have ever seen (some awkward cross between Fame, Save the Last Dance, with an extra helping of teen angst and of course more cliché). Even some plot sequences seemed not to be plausible or were completely inconsequential to the story line. In addition, the performances by the actors were by all means not their best performances (aided by a particularly terse screenplay). To round out the picture, the directing and cinematography was at times quite distracting from film. Sure it was a dance movie, but if you want to see good dancing it would be well worth your time to watch for something else watch something else."

","When I saw the previews for this movie, it looked amazing, and I couldn't wait to go see it. I bought tickets to the matinée, and couldn't wait to see it. It took a little while to get started up, but then it just bored me to death. I almost couldn't wait to get out of the theater. It was just a boring dance movie. I don't even think that it was really the guy dancing! They probably either hired a stunt double or just payed a ton of cash to get these people dance lessons, for a movie that wasn't even that good. Don't be fooled by the advertisements! It's really not that good. It is also very confusing. Take The Lead was a better movie, by far. The actors and actresses actually knew what they were doing! Save your money!"
"panditopia","1","13","25","12 August 2006"," Excessive boring scenes.
","I'm not a total fan about the whole gangster deal, but I thought that there were excessive scenes about the ""hood"", where Tyler(Channing Tatum) lived. <br/><br/>Especially that scene when Skinny got shot from stealing an Escalade and there was barely any grieving. Honestly, people don't just move on eith their lives that easily, but besides the fact that it was odd how his brother Mac went on with life, Skinny's death was totally not needed.<br/><br/>There were also so many moments where I just felt like falling asleep. Most of those scenes could have been cut and would have barely make a difference in the movie, except made it better. The trailer made it seem to have more excitement than the movie itself really had. *Yawn."

","I wanted this movie to be good, in fact, before I went to even see it I prayed that it would be good. Why? Because, in my heart I knew that the actors would be pathetic and that the hype, was only hype,but I wanted it to be good for the actor's sake. It was very disappointing. I almost felt bad for Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan. Jenna is an undeniably talented dancer, she has skills, and I will give that to her. However, maybe she should just stick to dancing because, as this movie exemplifies, she has no acting skills. Channing Tatum falters completely. His dancing is okay, but I am so tired of the whole white boy wanting to be black complex, its over played. Although he is extremely handsome, maybe he should stick to modeling, he can do that. The movie had huge potential but with terrible plot lines, clichés, and overall bad acting, this movie fails completely. I give it two stars because I feel bad for these kids, they need better agents."
"jlshoe-1","8","15","30","26 August 2006"," Good movie for teens
","I enjoyed watching this movie with my four teens. I showed how teens can turn their life around no matter what type of situation that they are in. It also showed how different classes in society can come together and help one another. The inner city kids tend to get a bad wrap a lot of the time, and it was good to see some of them come out on top. It was also AWESOME to see how the music and art program in the middle of a busy town can help redirect a youth's focus. We need more schools of the arts in our cities. I wish that congress would grab a hold of this concept and stop cutting our education budget for our children. Because the children of our generation and the ones to come are the future, and by the looks of it we are going to be in trouble."
"Crazi-LEE","9","7","12","7 December 2006"," My thoughts..
","I think that Step Up was a really good movie, even though most of the things were predictable. Maybe i am a bit bias but, i think all dance movies are really good and entertaining to watch. For example, Honey, Take The Lead, Save The Last Dance.. they were really good, the concepts for all dance movies are practically all the same, with only a few adjustments to each one. Those people who rate it too low aren't just being fair enough, I'm pretty sure they have seen many dance movies, but if Step Up was their first dance movie they watched, then i'm pretty sure that they would give it a much higher rating than what it is getting now."

Its about hardships and coming through on top...something that many people don't thin can happen. Though it is more or less a chick flick, i honestly think that some guys would really enjoy this movie. Its got some awesome dancing and Channing really surprised me with his dance moves.

"RCWjr","6","9","22","13 August 2006"," Definitely not a step down, but not a huge step up either
","The movie has the cliché's all over it. It is a tried and true formula of a down and out urban kid meeting up with the privileged kid and each learning something from the other. There is awkwardness in the beginning and the story hurdles are conveniently resolved quickly. But, you know, this still is one fun movie. The music is infectious and the leads are both good looking, likable and relate able.<br/><br/>The store is one that we have seen before, but there is no real harm done here. It is a movie that can actually be shown to church youth groups without fear of having to edit out swear words or nude scenes. In fact, the film for the most part is free of all that and yet still remains entertaining! Imagine that.<br/><br/>As my summary states; this is hardly a step down, it definitely isn't a ""step up"", but you know, it does a great side step that will entertain you enough not to mind the cost of a matinée ticket. It isn't an after 6pm movie by no means, but still, worth at least one glance in the theater."
"ambala-blogspot","1","3","5","20 March 2011"," horrid horrid
","This has to be one of the worst films I've ever watched. A huge dance amateur I was expecting good dance routines and great music. Needless to say both are very mediocre. The plot is ridiculous and so cliché you know how the film will end before it begins, the same goes for endless boring scenes. Acting is on the level of a porn clip. Channing has basically one single (!!) expression the whole film through and even that one is fake. He looks utterly stupid and the fact that he really cannot move to music does not help his pathetic excuse for acting. Bottom like he looks like a Shrek or a jarhead that wants to dance. The rest of the cast is, alas, not much better. Jena Dewan does not convince us that she's a rich girl trying to follow her dancing dreams. One of the reason for that failure is that the lady cannot dance to save her life. One of the most disturbing flaws in the script are the things with obvious homophobia and the notion that jazz and ballet are boring and stuck up and that one needs a thug from the slums to bring some life into the dancing. The scenes are too long and too boring, there's NO chemistry between the protagonists and the film as a whole is just simply flat (even the murder scene leaves us uninvolved to say the least). Avoid it and spend your hour 43min better!"
"Ali_John_Catterall","1","3","5","12 November 2009"," Step Down
","Step Up might be described as 'Saturday Night Fever' meets 'Take The Lead' meets '8 Mile' meets 'You Got Served' meets 'Good Will Hunting' meets 'Dirty Dancing' meets 'Fame'; there's more meets here than a well-laden charcuterie platter. The end result, however, is likely to leave one ravenous for something more substantial.<br/><br/>Ghetto kid Tyler meets privileged ballerina Nora at Maryland School of the Arts, Baltimore. (Incidentally, an attempt has been made to prettify Baltimore, heroin capital of the States. You won't find drug dealers loitering on corners in Step Up, just fresh-faced dancers and basketball players. Nevertheless, the filmmakers can't mask that drab, industrial backdrop).<br/><br/>Nora doesn't immediately warm to Tyler; she's already got a boyfriend, a dorkish Justin Timberlake wannabe with Daniel Beddingfield stylings. Oh, and the fact that Tyler's working there as a janitor as part of his community service for vandalising the school. (Good thinking - give the guy who trashed it the virtual run of the place. And what happened to the regular janitor he replaced? Was he paid off? Did he go quietly?) Tyler's smitten when he sees Nora dancing, his reptilian eyes plucking the leotard off her lithe little frame. Later, he catches her studying him from an upper storey window as he backflips outside college for his black pals Mac and Skinny. <br/><br/>In the first of many plot contrivances Nora's dance partner breaks his leg - ""But don't worry, you can find someone else to rehearse with"". Whoever could that be? Initially, Nora's suspicious Tyler's using her to ""get out of cleaning windows"" but is soon convinced by his raw talent. (Says who His ""street"" moves seem utterly artless). Nora's trapped, too. If she fails to get a job in the performing arts after her showcase, her snooty mum (her status indicated by her long dinner table) will pack her off to Cornel. Soon, Tyler and Nora are exchanging sob stories by the harbour, which Tyler exclaims has an amazing view (it doesn't).<br/><br/>They indulge in choreographed 'spontaneous' dance routines down the local club - a club filled with bright young things singing and dancing all night long (Baltimore, there), as Nora incorporates Tyler's hip-hop attitude into her ""stiff and boring"" repertoire. ""I think this is very risky, Nora,"" says principal Gordon (Rachel Griffiths, who can't be doing this for love), and who obviously recognises a genre convention when she sees one, hurtling down the street like an out-of-control tram.<br/><br/>Nora dumps her boyfriend after he gets signed and he dumps his black musical partner Miles in turn. He tells a disgusted Nora of Tyler, ""Just remember, that loser's heading nowhere fast and you know it."" Yes, he actually says that. You can write the rest yourself, but don't forget to add the climactic showcase, a hip-hop-flavoured set-piece infused with classical noodlings.<br/><br/>You might want to include a crusty old janitor, nursing a broken-heart who takes Tyler under his wing and gleefully punches the air from the gods at the end. Or a revelation that principal Gordon once loved a boy from the wrong side of town who took a heroin overdose. None of this is actually in the plot, but you might find it passes the time to stir in some genre conventions of your own. However, you might balk at making one of the villains of the piece an English Jamie Cullum lookalike called Colin, as this one does.<br/><br/>There is hardly a single second of Step Up that has not been 'sampled' from another movie. The film's shadowy figure Omar (played by Heavy D) is a car-breaker, and it's entirely apposite; this is a movie welded together from pilfered parts. Omar also endorses the film's central contrivance, when inverted snob and unrepentant wastrel Mac expresses surprise that Miles is an art student (why? Because Miles is black? Have you seen how he dresses? In tweeds and a satchel?). ""What the hell's an art student supposed to look like?"" admonishes Omar. ""Miles Davis, Mobb Deep - those cats went to art school too!"" No, despite his tweeds, Miles is automatically accepted into the gang as he's got a G4 in his satchel, programmed with naff R 'n' B.<br/><br/>The whole point of Step Up is about going after what you want, as exemplified by principal Gordon's heavy-handed speech (a lift from Fame) to an understandably bemused Tyler, who just popped in to wipe the office shelves. However, there's so little genuine pathos and total lack of chemistry between the leads that everyone involved does indeed look like an unconscionable user; even Tyler wants to use the showcase as his ticket into art school.<br/><br/>Much of this is down to the vastly contracted nature of the screenplay. As if correctly ashamed of itself, this is a film that can't wait to end, as evinced by a rushed funeral scene (Skinny buys the farm, prompting Mac to re-evaluate his own future) and Nora's mother's sudden and inexplicable change of heart concerning her daughter's future. The best and sweetest scene in the movie - Tyler exchanging dance moves with his kid sister in his backyard - works so well because it has nothing to do with the rest of the plot, entirely lacking its cynicism and cliché-studded dialogue. But it's all too brief.<br/><br/>Just once, it would be great to discover a film for 13-year-old girls that isn't the equivalent of a cellophane-wrapped lunchable; that doesn't patronise them or treat them like idiots; something that shakes them up a bit, makes them think. Step Up is so turgidly unoriginal it's tempting to subvert it every inch of the way; cut the sound, edit it, add a voice-over. Make principal Gordon a predatory power lesbian. Let Nora get mixed up with a bunch of murderous Knights Templars. Have Tyler run off with Nora's mum and spawn conjoined twins who grow up to be amazing tap-dancers. Just anything but this utter rubbish."

","Saw this movie in a sneak preview last night. It was so full of dance movie clichés that I thought for a moment it was made by the same guys that do the Scary Movie series. I ran a mental checklist in my mind and it hit nearly every single one I could think of. But, in the end, it was cute and actually had a few laugh out loud lines or moments. The dancing was fun. One particular dance scene when all the Performing Arts students let loose at a party was exhilarating. I wanted to be in that group having a good time. At any time when there's no dancing going on, the movie slides into mediocrity and sub-par acting. Watch the extras in the background. Man, do they overdo it!

","OK, so all the reviews of this movie are bad. I didn't think it was nearly as horrible as everyone is saying. It was very realistic and showed the good and bad sides of life. Having a brother myself, I laughed at several things because teen guys can be so like that. This story had a few plots going on at once, though bothersome at times, it was more interesting that way. I really like the dancing, it made me wish I could dance! Channing not only can dance but made his character very real, some of the actors were great whereas others didn't make their character so believable. Another thing is that it didn't have hardly any language and there was no sex, so that's good. It was a lot about following your dream and making something out of your life, which I think most of us can relate to, we all want to become something or somebody, don't we? But then there were somethings that were totally pointless, some parts I wondered why in the world they were on there. Overall, it had it's good and bad just like any movie."

","Funny jokes. Handsome actors. Pretty actresses. A good soundtrack. Add dancing, and voilà, another hit teen movie full of romance, tragedy, and drama. Although predictable, Sep Up is a beautifully choreographed movie with an upbeat soundtrack that brings even more fun to the theater.<br/><br/>Tyler (Channing Tatum) is not a bad kid. No, he just lives in a foster home in the poor, tough section of the city of Baltimore. Tyler becomes caught up in a bad situation and must complete 200 hours of community service at the scene of the crime, The Maryland School of the Arts. During his time washing windows and cleaning clarinets, Tyler notices Nora. Nora Clark (Jenna Diwam), an accomplished dance from the school, is practicing for her senior showcase. A problem arises when her dance partner breaks his leg and cannot practice with her anymore. Tyler, eyeing up his chance to talk with Nora and not wanting to see his opportunity go out the window he is washing, puts on his shining armor and mounts his white horse. When Nora rejects his proposal to help her at practice, Tyler is hurt (who wouldn't want to leap blindly into the arms of the kid who trashed you school's stage, your temple?). Finally, after realizing that her situation called for desperate measures, and after spying on Tyler and seeing him dance hip-hop outside the school with his friends, Nora decides to employ his help. The romance that sparks between Tyler and Nora during the long hours of practice after school is predictable and stale. However, the amazing dancing and upbeat music makes a predictable ending acceptable.<br/><br/>When I sat down to watch this movie, I was prepared for another boring plot and was surprised by the creativeness and genius in the opening scene. The scene alternates between a hip-hop/rap beat and a slower, more classical piece. Both shots include dancers performing at their best. The hip-hop dancers attend a crowded, dark party. They wear sharp, high-heels. In contrast to this picture, ballerinas dance in an open, bright studio with ballet slippers on their feet. This could symbolize the double life Tyler leads. During the day he is a disciplined ballet dancer, but morphs into a car-stealing Mr. Hyde at night. The director's (Anne Flethcer) alternating shots show how living in the city can be sharp like the woman's heel, and how Tyler and his best friend Mac (Damaine Radcliff) think that the rich kids who attend the school (actually most attend on grants or scholarships) lead a softer, easier life, like that of a ballet slipper. Cultural differences may seem to separate these people, but as we learn, forgiveness and love know no boundaries.<br/><br/>We root for Tyler and Nora throughout the entire movie. The scenes in which Tyler and Nora dance together are vibrant and fun, inviting the audience to jump out of their seats and join in; there aren't any rules.<br/><br/>Although the plot was predictable and the acting regular, Step Up achieved its main propose: to entertain me for an hour and a half. If you are a dancer, musician, underdog, or someone who wants to hear a good story about ""stepping up"" to the world, Step Up is a film made for you."

The dancing in the movie was hot. The storyline isn't that good neither.

","Okay, so when I first saw the trailer to this movie, I knew it would be cheesy, but I was at least hoping for a decent storyline. This script seemed like it had been thrown together in ten minutes. There were too many conflicts with each of the characters and none of them were ever given enough depth to make an emotional connection with the viewers. Channing Tatum has potential as an actor, but it wasn't displayed in this movie. He gave a much more vibrant performance in She's The Man, whereas he was almost emotionless in this flick. The acting as a whole was disappointing; Jenna Dewan was a decent dancer, but she lacked the emotion and the drive to create a memorable performance as an actress. The whole cast seemed forced throughout the movie; their acting was mediocre at best. However, the dancing was good and I really liked the music. It was also refreshing to see a movie that was free of nude scenes, heavy swearing, and sexual activity. I recommend this movie as a rental, but I wouldn't pay to see it in the theaters."
"hcalderon1","10","5","11","10 September 2006"," if you enjoyed Dirty Dancing you'll love Step Up
","An enjoyable dancing movie that made me want to stand up and cheer. It had great music and great dancing. This movie begins with Tyler Gage, an 18 year old whose life never seem too easy, but Tyler is an amazing dancer. One night while out with friends he ends up in the wrong place at the wrong time, he soon gets arrested and he is told by the court that he must be a janitor at a music school for his committee service. During that time he notices the beautiful dancer Nora Clark. One day Nora notices what a great dancer Tyler is. Something happens to Nora's dance partner, and she really needs a partner before opening night. After so many tri-outs with no luck, Tyler ask for a try, she lets him try out. When he does it very well, they soon become dance partners, but will they last. My favorite next to Dirty Dancing. The two leads were great. This movie will be enjoyable for a life time to come."

","Something funny about movies. Different genres carry different expectations. Dance movies for me prompt the lowest. I don't care how trite the story or incompetent the writing and acting. I just don't care as long as the dancing is good.<br/><br/>In fact in a way its better for the dancing if there aren't a lot of other aspirations. AFter ""Tango"" and ""Red Shoes,"" I don't need more elaborate folding of the show within the show. But the dancing had better be good.<br/><br/>And by that I mean it not only has to be good as dance, but it has to be cinematic. There are only three ways to accomplish that that I know. Oddly, though the director is a well known film choreographer, she seems to know none of them.<br/><br/>The way you expect in a ghetto-meets-whitebread story is in the raw energy, the sheer power of unpracticed but expert physical expression. Not here. The whole thing is not only validated by a slick production number at the end, but we see all the practice of that same.<br/><br/>No energy. No impulse. No life.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life."

And of course it had some twists and turns along the way, but it still had a good meaning to it. The dance moves were out of my mind, and the music was perfectly matched to the scenes, it kept me so into the story. Plus the actors were all great, especially Mario, who was pretty good, which i didn't expect. And of course you can't keep your eyes of the lead male in this one. I will probably go see this one again, and buy it the first day it comes out on DVD. It is a great movie and I recommend it to all."

","Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan are hot hot hot. Absurdly pretty, and they can both dance. While a teen dance movie was not my #1 choice, it was a pretty enjoyable film. No big surprises, but it fulfilled what it set out to do with admirable skill and pace. The 'white-boy hood' character threads were well executed by the extremely handsome Tatum- as the 'White Hood Kid' can be a character that is very hard to swallow and easy to play terribly. While there is lots of dancing, there is not so much that the whole film feels like a support structure to display dancing, which would bore me to tears. Mario is interesting to watch and has good arcs. I have a crush on Rachel Griffiths so I'm biased there, but one of the few faults in the movie is her character evolves unrealistically... she develops into a place of compassion from one of hate without much to make that change. All and all, a surprisingly fun movie."

The story isn't that new, but it's a good, interesting story. Anyway, in this film the dancing is more important than the story and the dancing is very beautiful and really impressive.<br/><br/>I think we can make the best comparison with the sequel of Step Up, Step Up to the Streets. I like the second one too, but I prefer the first one. In Step Up to the Streets the story is a bit more interesting and more inventive, but the dancing isn't as good as in Step Up.<br/><br/>In conclusion I would say if you are a fan of dancing, then it is really worth seeing Step Up."

","I think Step up is a great movie because it's about a dance school, and I love dance so that account for why. The main characters name is Tyler and he is really nice. The movie is laid in USA, and I like USA a lot so that's good. Tyler is a boy and he is poor, he lives in a block with much crime. So Tyler is like everybody else in the block. And one day the police take Tyler because he was stolen a car. And after that he had to work on the dance school as punishment. Then he met Nora, she was a student on the dance school. They started to meet, then Tyler and Nora become in love. I recommend Step up, its one of my favourite movies. The end of the movie was good because everything ends good, everybody was happy."

","With a cast of relative unknowns, with the exception of former Oscar nominee Rachel Griffiths, this film, dealing with youngsters at a school for dramatic arts, is absolutely marvelous.<br/><br/>It's basically the story of changing one's environment so as to get the best out of what life offers.<br/><br/>When our hero is involved in school vandalism, he is sentenced to 200 community hours of service at the school where he did the damage. There, he falls in with a different crowd of youngsters. Our protagonist comes from a dysfunctional foster home where the father drinks beer all day. His two African American friends are two guys into prank making. Unfortunately, the younger brother, is afraid of nothing and he will meet a tragic ending. Again, he could not get out of his environment.<br/><br/>At the school, Tyler, who can dance up a storm, naturally falls for her a girl who needs a dance partner when her partner is hurt.

","Wow this movie is the best movie i have seen since the movie save the last dance came out. it is suitable for all age groups and genders. I love the techniques that they use in their dancing i love the way they show the contrast between ballet and hip hop. it also shows that people can change if they really want something. this the first film in a while that hasn't got over the top love scenes because its more about determination and fighting for what you want and love. the acting can have little bit more work but it still is great and the dancing over rides the acting so thats OK. most dancers will love this movie more than people who don't dance. But this movie will get people who don't dance to want to give it a try. when you are watching it just want to get out of your seats and join in. The soundtrack also it awesome it works well mixing ballet and hip hop together so the contrast isn't just through dancing its through the music and the attitude between both the main characters. So i fully recommend this movie to anyone to watch it."

","Please do not think for a moment that I feel ""Save the Last Dance"" is some cinematic epitome of greatness, because it isn't. What is it, however, is a film that was pretty useless all around, but had enough good ""stuff"" in it to make it very entertaining.<br/><br/>""Step Up"" not only lacked all that ""stuff,"" but the dancing was horrible too! Last time I checked, if a movie is going to be about dance, the dancing part SHOULD be impressive, no? I am not one to diss films for being formulaic or overly contrived, as I love many movies which are just that, but if you are not going to add anything NEW to a medium, it should at least be done well.<br/><br/>This film is almost like a terrible remake of ""Save the Last Dance"" gone wrong. The story was completely ridiculous, if not totally implausible. The dance sequences were boring and uninspired, like a bad week on ""So You Think You Can Dance."" Even the music was predominantly made up of really horrible, generic RnB. They hit on way too many clichés (including black man with gun, non-understanding parent, overworked-absent mom) and not once in this film would anyone begin to care about these stupid people so when there is the obligatory dramatic death of a young one, all it does is make you roll your eyes at how mundane every aspect of this movie is. Even the editing was terrible with so many bad cuts and continuity problems, I wondered if the director was even awake sometimes.<br/><br/>Channing Tatum stars and I was hoping to see him show some acting chops, but all he did was prove he can play a white boy wannabe reallybadly. And he's not that great of a dancer. There is no doubt that the ex-Abercrombie model is gorgeous, but even that wasn't enough to really make this movie worth sitting through. If he is going to have any future, he's going to have to stop appearing in crap films like this and ""She's the Man,"" learn to act and not think that his perfectly sculpted face is going to get him anything more than a few more fluffy film roles until he fades away and regrets giving up modeling."

But here, we don't get anything new, it stays a very simple movie overall with no incredible developments in the scenario.

The acting is poor at times and not as emotional for a drama movie, as the story had everything for it but the young and raw actors could have made it so much better."
"tbills2","6","1","1","14 February 2019"," Step Up to the beat! I love Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan!
","Step Up is more than just a fun movie, it's a real movement! It's right at the heart of the dance revolution flicks premiering towards the turn of the new millennium with Honey (2003) starring Jessica Alba of course then You Got Served (2004) cranked it up a notch then this in 2006 and Stomp the Yard (2007) shook things up the next year and you can even credit Center Stage (2000) way back in the day for starting it all!<br/><br/>Step Up plays like a mixtape of some of your favorite hip-hop jams of the 2000s with Petey Pablo, T.I. and Ciara all contributing along the way and a great title track while R&B singers Mario and Drew Sidora actually show up to the party and kill it giving great performances!<br/><br/>Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan interlude all of the cool, hot dance action with an inspiring and powerful true life love story that you just don't usually see play out onscreen as the main attraction. Dewan and Tatum fell in love in Step Up and that's definitely what makes this movie so special. They share genuine chemistry and they're so gorgeous together you can easily see why Tatum fell for her Jenna's amazingly beautiful and so sweet! Their love will last forever! Channing and Jenna split last year and they are no longer together, did you hear? I love Step Up! I love Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan too! I love dancing! And music!<br/><br/>'ooh ah the way u look at me im feeling u!! ah i just cant help but trying 2 keep it coo-oo-ool!! i can feel it in the beat when u do those things 2 me dont let nothing stop u mooove ring the alarm the club is jumping now so get up!!!'"

"estebangonzalez10","6","1","1","25 February 2015"," Tatum's charisma carries the film and lets us forgive its many flaws
","""I'm fighting, for something that's real for the first time in my life!""<br/><br/>When Anne Fletcher made her directorial debut way back in 2006 no one imagined that this small budget film with a relatively unknown cast would end up grossing over 100 million in the US and inspiring a franchise that currently stands at five movies. It wasn't received warmly by the critics due to its cliché storyline and corny dialogues, but audiences dug it. I never was interested in the franchise and this was my first time actually sitting down and watching one. The main reason was because I knew this was Channing Tatum's break out role. He had done a couple of movies before with smaller roles, but this was the first time he was given a lead role. Tatum has delivered some strong roles recently (Foxcatcher being his most impressive) so I wanted to go back and revisit some of his earlier work. I was surprised I actually ended up enjoying this film as much as I did and I think it is largely due to Tatum's charisma. He didn't deliver a great performance, but he definitely carried the film with his charm making it enjoyable. The dancing was also pretty solid although I am not much of an expert in that area. The main problems with Step Up revolve around the clichéd screenplay and dull subplots that almost derailed the film completely, but the charisma from Tatum and his excellent chemistry with Jenna Dewan make this an entertaining viewing experience. It's been 9 years since Tatum and Dewan met on set for this movie and they are still together in real life. The chemistry was really there. <br/><br/>Step Up is one of those films that you know is formulaic, unoriginal, and without any great technical achievements, but you still find it enjoyable due to the charismatic lead performances. You could file Step Up under the romance/dance genre along with other films as Bring it On, Save the Last Dance, and Honey. The screenplays are perhaps the weakest thing about these films, but you still can find them enjoyable when the lead characters deliver charismatic performances and know how to dance. That is the case with Channing Tatum who plays a troubled young teen who lives with his foster parents and spends a lot of time in the streets. One night out with his friends he ends up vandalizing an arts school and gets caught. He is ordered to do 200 hours of community service as payment for the damages he caused. At the school he meets a young student from a wealthy family played by Jenna Dewan who dreams of becoming a dancer. When her dancing partner gets injured, he offers to help, and the plot evolves from there.<br/><br/>The story works best when it focuses on the two lead characters rehearsing and dancing together, but when the film shifts its focus on other subplots revolving around their friends the story losses some of its appeal. There is unnecessary conflict introduced in the film that is resolved rather easily and in a predictable way. There is also a tragic scene that takes place near the end of the film that felt out of place (the melodrama is poorly handled by the screenwriters). However, the final dance scene is one of the best in the movie so it does end in a positive note. Despite its predictable storyline and formulaic premise, Step Up is still an enjoyable film. Not good enough however to get me interested in the sequels."
"ecml","10","1","1","20 March 2011"," Great dancing talent for all ages to watch
","Although I'm way, way past a teenager, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. The dancing is great and really attention grabbing. If I see it on the schedule, I try to catch, at least, the finale which is, to me, fantastically choreographed. The acting may not be Oscar worthy but I don't have anything bad to say about it except for Rachel Griffiths. She seemed to be holding way back and was very, very flat. I find that strange because I really enjoy her on Brothers & Sisters.<br/><br/>It was nice to see a a location of Baltimore - not NY or LA. All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie that I just happened to come upon one weekend on cable. Not too sappy or too violent or unbelievable. If you like to watch dancing, you'll like this movie. If you are open to all kinds of music, I think you'll like it.<br/><br/>The social statement to me is that with hard work and the luck of an opportunity to participate in the arts can drastically change a young life. There is so much talent out on the streets and, with funding being cut more and more, the talents of the young are being wasted and everybody suffers."
"wilcoxtl","Null","1","1","24 January 2011"," Review of Step Up
","I love this movie for numerous amounts of reasons. The dancing is amazing and the dancers they use are actually good. Usually, in dance movies, they either get actors that can't dance and have to have doubles (which is usually very obvious) or they just have the actors attempt to dance which is never good. Sometimes they get good dancers, but then they can't act. Step Up has dancers that can act and it really brings together the whole movie. <br/><br/>One thing that I don't like however is the fact that Skinny has to die. They just had to pick the cute, innocent, little brother to die. Not only did he die, but he was shot on the streets. Shocking part of the movie that really killed the mood. I also wish that there weren't as many heart breaks in the plot line. Two couples broke up and the main couple were constantly fighting. One fight makes for a good story, but multiple gets to be a little much.<br/><br/>I like to compare Step Up to Center Stage. They are both dance movies that involve romance between the lead female and male dancers. The girl in both movies go through a hardship and overcome it by the end and both of the males lose their girl at one point in the movies. There is lots of very good dancing in both and the actors do their own dancing as well."
"bob the moo","Null","1","1","22 November 2009"," A product that does what the packaging says it does but doesn't innovate, excite or appear to have had much creative input into it apart from the final packaging
","Tyler Gage is a white kid from the wrong side of the tracks. Helping his friends escape, Tyler is caught red handed smashing up a school of the arts and is sentenced to community service there. While doing janitorial work he sees the ballet students doing their routines and he himself is later observed by one of the students (Nora) doing his street moves with his friends. When Nora's partner goes out with an injury she turns to Tyler to help her, since he has basic skills. Both have their struggles with this working relationship but while Nora opens up Tyler to the possibilities through dance, he brings an unique urban feel to her routine – but as romance blossoms things become harder.<br/><br/>I never bothered with this film when it came out but the rising star of Tatum made me step back and take a look at this. What I found was a film that struck me as being a mass produced product rather than being a film that someone created or that the makers really wanted to make. What I mean is that didn't seem to be much in the way of passion or inspiration behind it. The story is a predictable mishmash of other films and you can see so many things from Breakin' through to Save the Last Dance all in the mix here. It is definitely something that knows what it needs to do, does it and doesn't worry too much about making it special, different or anything like that. And so it treads the path you know it will from the first minute and as a story it never rings true so much as just meeting it with a shrug.<br/><br/>In fairness though the dance routines are reasonably good and the soundtrack does give it an energy that helps it but both of these things are the type of things that will fade with time as other films supersede it. The cast do the basics as well. Tatum is good in so much as he manages to carry off a white urban caricature without looking ridiculous. In the normal terms he is not ""good"" but on these terms he does the job. Dewan is attractive but you never feel the heat between them and their relationship (working or romantic) never seems real. The rest of the cast are pretty much doing what one expects as well – and when even Six Feet Under's Griffiths or The Wire's Lovejoy is calling it in, it hardly seems fair to expect Mario to be doing much.<br/><br/>Overall this is a product more than it is a film and as such it is one of those things that does what the packaging says it does but doesn't innovate, doesn't excite and doesn't appear to have had much creative input into it apart from the final packaging. It is a solid genre film for the viewers it was made for but it is unlikely to stand the test of time well at all or indeed have much appeal to those that want it to do more than tick boxes."

","The title of the film is 'Step up'. The first time I went to see this movie was in the cinema. I saw the movie three years ago with the Chiro. But I saw the movie several times. The film is directed by Anne Fletcher. The main characters are Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan. The genre is drama, music and romance. Step up won in 2007 the ' Teen Choice Award' and was nominated for the ' Young Artist Award'. The movie was filmed in the USA in 2006.<br/><br/>The story is about Tyler and his friends going into an art school and destroying the stuff there. When he gets caught he needs to do a community service, cleaning up the school. Everybody thinks he is a failure until Nora discovers his dancing talents. Nora is busy with putting her showcase together when here dance partner gets injured. She takes the risk dancing with Tyler, who has a total different style of dancing. He even makes some improvements to her choreography. Nora found the new choreography so good that she decided to do her showcase with Tyler. <br/><br/>I tought it was a good film because there's a strong storyline in it and because there are several genres mixed in the film. The Music that is used in the film is also very good, I like kind of music. But it's great that the film ends in an other way than you should think, I liked that a lot!

","So one word. Amazing! Step up is definitely the best movie i have ever seen. I am a teenage girl, so it is pretty obvious that Channing Tatum(Tyler Gage) is hot, but even with that everything else was amazing. The acting was great, the dancing was great. The drama in this movie was like nothing else. The music is catchy and placed in the perfect places. The plot is great; a teenage white troublemaker living in foster care in a ghetto afro-American community. This movie shows people how harsh living in areas like that are. From alcoholic parents, to breaking in a school without even a second thought, to stealing cars, and finally to drive-byes. Skinny's death was extremely sad, but the turning point in Step Up. Without the death, nothing would have fallen into place like it did. The love story is great. Having a girl like Nora, rich, artistic, with a loving family, and then Tyler, a poor artistic, but foster child is good. Even though most teenage dramas have that plot, opposites attract, this is beyond anything I've seen. With Nora already being together with Brett, and not fully admitting her attraction to Tyler, its in a way, suspenseful. The drama. love story between Nora and Tyler isn't the only love story in the movie, which also parts Step Up from other movies. The love story between Miles and Lucy is perfect, with Lucy dating a ""sophisticated, real man"" named Colin she denies her attraction to Miles. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone, even if you aren't into dramas, it is amazing. I have seen a movie very similar to this, Stomp The Yard. Also a great teenage drama movie. But, for my opinion, Step Up is the better of the two."

If someone is expecting the acting prowess of Harrison Ford or Meryl Streep, they're watching the wrong movie. That's not what Step Up is about. But if you want casting that befits the roles in the movie to a tee, this is your show. I'm definitely not into chick flicks and wouldn't categorize this as one. Even my husband, who has 2 left feet on the dance floor, repeatedly watched the dance finale with me. The music just added to an already enriching performance. The dance moves were superb and astoundingly well-choreographed. Hats off to all involved."

I liked how the concentration wasn't mainly on the love life of the characters but their ambitions and their need to do something that they love as a profession or to just better their lives. Being an artist, composer and a dancer at heart I could relate to all the characters. I did not read the reviews nor did I for Superman Returns, The Devil Wears Prada and this movie, but I have to say this is one of the best summers ever. The only down side was Pirates of the Caribbean 2. I slept every time Johnny Depp wasn't on screen. Excellent. Who is Channing Tatum? His dancing is spectacular. Jenna Dewan was amazing as well. I related to the DJ carrying around his keyboards and demos and laptop, the singer. Everything was so real."
"bkoganbing","6","4","9","19 August 2006"," Eminem Meets Fame
","In looking over the reviews of Step Up I saw comparisons to Flashdance, Save the Last Dance for Me, and a few others. The pithy review that Step Up got in my hometown free paper Art Voice remarked that the film had some nerve to advertise it had an original screenplay. Personally I like to think of it as Eminem meets Fame. The only thing missing was Debbie Allen doing the choreography.<br/><br/>Lead Channing Tatum in this film is a kind of an Eminem light. He's a kid being raised in a foster home in Baltimore and he's been busted for breaking in and trashing the Maryland School of Arts. As punishment he gets to do janitorial service at that same school. <br/><br/>Channing's got some moves though and he hooks up with a girl from the right side of the tracks, Jenna Dewan, who needs a rehearsal partner. <br/><br/>If you've seen all the films mentioned above you've got a pretty good idea what follows. If the film is hardly original, it doesn't mean that it's bad. Both the leads have some real moves on the dance floor and as Tatum regrettably remarked, he found out that dancing can indeed be like rocket science."

","I agree that the acting may not be the best, but look at their history. None of the actors/ actresses have years of experience, so based on that I think they all did an awesome job. My husbands first look was that it was not his type of movie, but once it got started he didn't want to miss any part of it. He really enjoyed! For me, the dancing was out of this world. I really enjoyed the entertainment and the way the movie shows the magnitude of love dancing can bring to people. It also shows that dancing is not for wimps... ITS HARD WORK! The whole idea that if you love something or ever get a second chance to do improve and do what you love.. TAKE IT!! Love It, Love it... I would definitely recommend it."

","Now I must be honest and say that I am a huge fan of dance movies such as Honey, Save the last Dance and Dirty Dancing. I really enjoyed every moment of it. I mean it isn't Oscar material but its nice to find a movie that makes you feel good and leaves you smiling.<br/><br/>The chemistry between the leads is fantastic, and I loved watching them together. The choreography is brilliant and the main plot is actually pretty good. <br/><br/>I can't wait for it's DVD release and hope to see more of the actors in this movie.<br/><br/>So give this movie a chance, I'll doubt you will be disappointed..."

","Does the plot sounds like something you've heard before? That's because you have heard it before. The plot is over used, the movie is a bit cliché and sometimes cheesy, but Step Up was AMAZING!!!! The dancing is incredible. Step Up was choreographed SO well! Props to Anne Fletcher!!! I was surprised at how much I liked this movie. I mostly was seeing it for Channing Tatum, but ended up liking it so much that I saw it 4 times. Jenna Dewan and Channing Tatum both are great dancers. I was very impressed. The soundtrack is also fantastic!! I was tapping my foot the WHOLE time!!! If you liked Save the Last Dance, or any other dance movie, you'll love this one!!!"

","OK. It wasn't the best made movie in the entire world. But which movies nowadays do? All good possible stories have been thought of, especially dance movies. So why not mix all the movies together to make a good movie? I saw a lot of movies in this film, and all those movies I enjoyed. I found this story funny, romantic, and the dance moves were superb. The only thing I didn't like about it was Tyler Gage's character wasn't fully shown (his personality). I thought that the two of them had chemistry and I wish my boyfriend knew how to dance now. It inspired me to dance, which I used to, and regret that I quit now having watched it. I thought this story was really balanced out with comedy, thrills, romance, and good music also! Definitely going to buy this movie when it is out of theaters."
"grltalk590","4","3","6","16 August 2006"," well.... that dancing was good.
","When the movie started it was good. The plot has real potential. BUT although the movie isn't very long it seems to never end. After about the first 2 scenes everything just starts to get very boring. I also thought that once Tyler and Nora got together all the chemistry that they had disapeared. I also thought that when the characters who were ""singers"" were singing it was painful to listen to.<br/><br/>One person I saw it with said it was the worst movie he had ever seen. I wouldn't go that far, this movie did have some very good moments. The Dancing was spectacular, and the girl who played Tylers younger sister is really fantastic, I've really liked her in a lot of things that shes done. She and Tyler had wonderful chemistry. But even the awesome dancing and the few good moments weren't good enough to salvage this movie for me.<br/><br/>I'm rating it a 4. It was almost average. It wasn't a one or a zero. Could have been worse I guess."

I also thought that cast in the movie was amazing! They are all excellent actors and they deserve recognition for their talent. The dancing in the movie is amazing! Channing Tatum is an unbelievable dancer and also a heartthrob!! Along with Jenna Dewan. The two make a gorgeous duo and they work together so well.

","I like to watch all the films related to singing and dancing, and this one is no exception. Let alone comment on the plot and the characterization. I like a few pieces of simple dance. Maybe the more difficult it is to get, the more I like it, so I like the films related to dancing!"
"eminkl","5","0","0","9 October 2019"," Even if the picture breaks no new ground, the verve of the actors and their fancy footwork is half the battle.
","Watching ""Step Up"" for the first time almost six years after its surprise sleeper success in theaters, what's most compelling is how such a standard, cliché-happy dance film has spawned three sequels to date (at the time of this writing, ""Step Up: Revolution"" is days away). Maybe each generation needs its own love stories set in the midst of learning steps and cutting a rug, but this isn't ""Dirty Dancing"" or even ""Footloose."" Nevertheless, Channing Tatum (in one of his first leading roles) and Jenna Dewan (his future real-life wife) don't have to falsify the obvious chemistry they share as two opposites divided by class but united in their passion for dance.He plays Tyler Gage, a foolish Baltimore teen living with foster parents who is sentenced to 200 hours of community service after breaking for the arts at the Maryland School and destroying property. She is Nora Clark, a school star pupil who sees Tyler scrubbing floors and takes him under her wing as she prepares for her big recital (she lays down her former partner after hurting herself). Together, the two start to gradually combine the street movements of Tyler with the ballet of Nora while gradually falling for each other.<br/><br/>Anne Fletcher (2009's ""The Proposal"") made her directorial debut with ""Step Up,"" crediting her with capturing the dance sequences with a cohesive editorial style that doesn't feel the need to cut each half-second to a different angle. Screenwriters Duane Adler (2001's ""Save the Last Dance"") and Melissa Rosenberg (who would continue to adapt the ""Twilight"" series) are responsible for mucking things up with a script that couldn't be more predictable and derivative if it was attempted. There's a friend of Tyler's Mac (Damain Radcliff), who feels slight when his buddy passes out playing basketball with him instead of playing Nora.There's the impressive younger brother Skinny (De'Shawn Washington) from Mac, who starts stealing cars with tragic consequences like his sibling. There's Director Gordon (Rachel Griffiths), the school's tough headmaster, who doubts Tyler has it in him to pull through and succeed. And there's Nora's harping mother Katherine (Deirdre Lovejoy), who fears that her daughter is heading for disappointment if she's not focusing on education as much as she's dancing. Any guesses if she's going to end up coming around?<br/><br/>""Step Up"" culminates in Nora's big stage performance and the ""will-he-or-won-he?"" non-suspenseof Tyler showing up in time for her to go out. Of course, by the end, more will be rekindled than just Nora's shot at a university scholarship. Inoffensive but old-hat, anybody with a cursory history of this subgenre of cinema will feel familiar with the film. Still, Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan are an attractive pair, and the on-site shooting at Baltimore by Michael Seresin (2003's ""The Life of David Gale"") supports the story well. By going vintage (you know, with movies from the 70s and 80s), teen audiences could do better, but they could do much worse as well.Even if the picture does not break new ground, half the battle is the verve of the actors and their fancy footwork."
"roxydzey","10","0","0","8 July 2019"," Love this movie but
","I love this movie but characters were acting (not actors but the characters they were acting) like annoying teenagers, the best example how Tatum's character dissed 2 times the girl and quited, and i just cant understand why would he quit SO easily. Especially the 2nd time, the girl wasnt guilty of that situation at all and he just quited dancing AND broke up with the girl. Doesnt make sence, it wasnt her fault at all.. Or for other example i cant understand why tatum and his friend from the hood got into the fight when tatum's character got realy hard into the school dancing. I mean it felt like all main characters are selfish pricks and thats it. Thinking only about their own good. Way too much. Alot of hate and alot of fight between friends and love here. And when the little brother Skin died his brother made up his mind to start living normaly, IGNORING THE FACT THAT HE DIDNT WANT TO LET TATUM'S CHARACTER (i have bad memory sorry :D) GO FOR HIS BEST FRIEND DREAMS IN THE 1ST PLACE.. So selfish, i didnt like this at all. And then he changed his mind only after brothers death, thats logic and okay, but it made me pissed even more actualy.. Or for another example the girl which was always somehow angry about stupid stuff with school DJ. Dj was a very nice guy but she talked to him like a.. Well watch a movie and u will understand what last word should be in that senctence :) Didnt make any sense, random hate coming from nowhere once again, without any normal reason..
Anyway I still do like this movie alot. Im still gonna rate this 10, but with minus because of that. Im valueing not the whole story in this movie but some parts of it which i love most, actors acting in that movie which i really liked, music and dancing, and I love how they connected rap hip hop with balet dancing. Thats so awesome, just like glueing together classical music with electronic one. Genious."

","There were musicals and then there are Dance movies. Which I guess could be considered the new musicals. Bollywood seems to be doing OK with them. And while in movies like Step up, there is a reason for dancing (other than walking down the street), the idea seems to always find a crowd of people wanting to watch. Why? Maybe because they either would love to be able to do the stuff they see on screen, maybe because of the love story, maybe because of the songs.<br/><br/>The answer lies within the viewers of said movies. But if you have to kick-start a franchise (other than getting money online for your idea that is), than there could've been worse ways than this. Channing Tatum in his breakout role, dancing yet not stripping on film. The romance and the basic story is simple and predictable, but the two leads (who have ever since been married) really sell it ... guess the chemistry was real there ..."

","Three young punks, one of them played by Channing Tatum, break into an art school and proceed to trash the place in the rebelliousness. Like these movie punks always do. Tatum's character gets caught and has to do community service at the school in order to pay for what he's done. But, while serving his time, he finds out that these rich artist kids might have something in common with him. Namely, the passion for dance.<br/><br/>The plot is about as basic as they come, with Tatum's character having to help a young female student (Jenna Dewan), who has just lost a dancing partner to an ankle injury, and enlists Tatum's character to replace him. But the film has a lot of energy and good attitude that keep it going even when the plot should bore you to tears. Tatum and Dewan have great chemistry together, and tellingly married a couple of years later. The school is also a fun setting, with an atmosphere of its own and all the side characters show the passion they have for creating things, be it music or dancing or paintings.<br/><br/>The film is also shot rather well. The sets look great, it has fantastic colours and all the various dance numbers are shot in a way that allow you to really feel the movement.<br/><br/>Nothing much more to say, really. It's exactly what you'd expect from hearing the description, and for some people that can be a problem. Personally, I do like it after a fashion. It's not something I'd regret not having seen, but neither do I regret seeing it. It was a pleasant diversion."

"PavelRios7","4","0","0","3 August 2015"," Bereft of plot, authentic emotion, or acting chops from its two leads, this romance serves as the franchise's high point.
","This movie lacks a complex cause-and-effect structure typical of good films and a plausible, well-constructed plot. It also fails to provide logical reasons for what little conflict there is as well as keeping the interest of the viewer. The acting is mediocre at best; however, the dancing and choreography are the movie's highlights. It cannot be emphasized enough, however, that there needs to be more dancing, specifically in the practice sessions, to make the film seem faintly realistic. In regarding to the quality of acting, Jenna Dewan is more dancer than actress while Channing Tatum once again fulfills his typecast character of ""that cute guy from the ghettos."" Besides their eventual marriage, the two actors show little chemistry on the big screen. The two protagonist's character traits are easy to find decent but hard to deem sympathetic. Look no further than James Thurber's ""The Princess and the Tin Box"" for irony regarding the stereotypical ""rich girl likes poor boy"" cliché portrayed in this movie. For people who enjoy formulaic, predictable romances without any substantial conflict, depth, or sincerity."

","(Plot) Tyler is a troubled young man with untapped dancing skills. He has moved from Foster home to Foster home throughout his life, vandalizes a very posh arts school, takes the fall for it, and does community services for his unwise decision. He meets and falls for a beautiful, talented dancer named Nora (Jenna Dewan-Tatum) who helps turn his life around, and capitalize on his dancing skills. <br/><br/>I actually enjoyed the second sequel to a certain extent, but this series is starting to get a little old now. Before they decided to get every last dime they could from this franchise, they made a fairly moving film like this one, which started it all. I'm not much of a dancing fan, but some of the stuff Channing, Jenna, the rest of the guys did made my jaw drop. It was truly impressive. Tyler's (Channing Tatum) story of reformation is a rather uncomplicated one, but effective all the same. It's not going to dazzle you with the plot or anything like that, but it sets out to entertain the masses, and it does that quite well. Channing Tatum gets a bad rap from some. (I'd venture a guess, that it's resentful husbands or guys with a girl that has a crush on Channing) I'm a guy, and I actually like him! He comes across as a little green at times, but he manages to overcome that with presence, charisma, and believability. His chemistry with Jenna Dewan is quite transparent, and it's easy to see why they fell in love for real, in real life. Channing worked hard and I commend him. Jenna Dewan is stunning. It also helps that I could relate to her character with ease. <br/><br/>Final Thoughts: I admit to being sick and tired of this series, but this movie manages to entertain me. It's not rocket science, just a very nice story about redemption and defying the obstacles in front of you. It's a good movie, at least I think so<br/><br/>7/10"
"rebecca-ry","6","0","0","20 July 2012"," Enjoyable
","'Step Up' is primarily a dance film with some great dance sequences included. A lot of people therefore criticise the acting in this film because it is pretty poor from most of the performers.<br/><br/>With Channing Tatum it's difficult; sometimes his acting can be terrible, his face hardly shows any expression at all in some scenes and his dialogue is wooden. However, in other scenes - particularly with his adopted little sister - he acts fantastically and gives a real-life performance that seems so natural. He acts best in long discussions with people. Jenna Dewan (now Jenna Dewan-Tatum) is good, not great. She's a professional dancer so you cannot expect her to be outstanding at acting because it simply is not her profession. She isn't bad though, I certainly would not say her acting performance was bad, just not great. Her dancing is of course the best in the film, Tatum is really good too. <br/><br/>The story is not that great, it's too clichéd as is the case with a lot of films about dancing. There are some moments where you think the story could have been a lot better if they had worked on key points. They bring in important themes to the film such as living a life of crime, youth tragedies, crime taking over neighbourhoods but they don't explain or spread these themes out enough for them to take a hold on the film meaning the themes are half-explained and you're given a 'happy' ending whilst you have all of these questions unanswered.<br/><br/>Overall, the film is enjoyable. I would recommend it if you like this sort of film, it's a decent film to watch if you just want to eat popcorn but don't expect anything outstanding."

","Step up, plays it entirely by the book which may seem safe for a film maker, but ironically can be equally risky, in the worst case scenario your film could look recycled. <br/><br/>This dance concerns about a break dancing street kid (Tyler) who is forced to do a couple hundred community service hours for an art school which he was caught breaking into. The first thing that gets his attention when he starts doing his time, is a girl in the dance hall, whose dance partner has just broken his foot. Tyler volunteers to replace him, Nora is not surprisingly doubtful, but to her surprise Tyler is quite good, but how committed will he be to this, when it means leaving his old life/friends behind?<br/><br/>Step Up does it better than most, but not as good as the best. It does it's best to treat the characters as human beings, not just bodies to dance. Jenna Dewan and Channting Tutum are a decent screen couple not so much because the are cute but because they feel like real people. It These are two kids who were NOT meant for each other, they don't look it and they don't act it, but when they dance they appear flawless. <br/><br/>Step Up's problems are screenplay related. It is never unpredictable, and for that matter, it's not super believable either. This is not a film for an intelligent audience, it is a feel good movie, no more no less, but it's catchy, never too shallow, and It's enjoyable"

","Channing Tatum's character Tyler Gage is the person i envy most after watching this movie. He's extremely talented dancer with great looks and all his potentials have been well exploited by the director. Nora Clark played by Jenna Dewan compliments him well throughout the movie.<br/><br/>The story is not that fascinating. Tyler and his friends vandalise the MSA(Maryland School of Arts) and so 200 hours of community service is how he has to pay back. Then he meets Nora who desperately needs a partner for her senior piece, as her previous partner is not well..??? or some stuff like that. They connect well, then some ups and downs and at the end they give a great performance. Wow....!!!<br/><br/>But what really needs to be appreciated is the dance performances throughout the movie. Real treat for every dancer like me. Special mention for the last performance in which great co-ordination along with a good piece of music is presented.<br/><br/>Director Anne Fletcher with her directorial debut is fine at directing but she's great at choreographing. Kudos to her for the same. So people get in a good mood, sit back and enjoy/"

","Without TV's ""So You Think You Can Dance"", Eminem as a character model, and especially without writer Duane Adler's Baltimore past, this dance movie would never have become the minor classic alongside Adler's Save the Last Dance(2000) it's now seen as. A third movie is now in the works.<br/><br/>Many ""fluffier"" dance movies (Honey(2004), Stomp the Yard(2007), and the insufferable Centre Stage(2000)) have inadequate plots/resolutions. Socially relevant dance movies have tended to elude filmmakers--sadly because it often eludes the dance industry itself. Step Up(2006) actually refers to this with Tyler's line ""I'm sorry, it's just that y'all're talking' 'bout dancing like it's rocket science""! <br/><br/>Screenwriters Melissa Rosenberg and Duane Adler, based on his original story, subsequently fought hard for a ""great dance movie"", flip-flopping with lead character back-stories for authenticity. They achieved it, only to have the rushed-to-cinemas 2008 sequel ruin it again: for some ungodly reason, the adorable and talented Ann Flether--choreographer/director of the original--was ""not available"" to direct the sequel, only Executive Producing the 2008 stinker which, shockingly, made more money.<br/><br/>Step Up(2006)'s opening credits immediately herald a movie which takes great care to ""execute with precision"", as credits are individually wiped by the digital recombination of dancers over text, challenging even 007 credit sequences for ingenuity.<br/><br/>Adler's timeless coming-of-age story concerns the clash of two dance worlds, which promises and delivers a Romeo-and-Juliet style romance. Setting the story in the writer's hometown of Baltimore gives the racial issues authenticity.<br/><br/>These are instantly turned on their head, reminding us of singer Eminem's bio, as a poor white ""brutha"" remains family to his black friends while the rich ""white"" girl is actually brown and from a broken home. Nora(Jenna Dewan) isn't ""stuck up""--she's just every bit as neurotic and ambitious as most art school seniors who have all been abusively driven to self-obsession by an unforgiving performance industry. In other words, the leads are both well-drawn characters from real life who are only as flawed or complex as the story requires. Additionally, Tyler's foster mother Lena(Jane Beard) and his precocious foster sister Camille(Alyson Stoner) are at least honestly drawn characters with their own problems.<br/><br/>The film's most serious hiccup comes during the first act, with a terribly ham-fisted attempt to pull us into the art school world: the older of the three delinquents are both way too old to be throwing stones or trashing a school. This counterintuitive plot device is further stretched to incredulity by Tyler's martyrdom with the ""rent-a-cop"". What would've played instead is Tyler's self-sacrifice had it been Skinny(De'Shawn Washington) who was nabbed because he'd been the ""recessive gene""-teen who did most of the trashing. That would've worked better--Skinny always was a crime scene waiting to happen.<br/><br/>The other supporting characters are, if anything, even better. Miles(Mario) and Lucy(Drew Sidora) have an even less stereotypical bickering secondary romance written for them than the leads got. For one thing, it's Miles who's kinder and smarter than the girl--how refreshing! In their role-reversing relationship, he finally tells Lucy off: ""If you want to be with somebody who doesn't appreciate what a good thing he's (her cradle-snatching boyfriend, Colin) got, that's 100% your business; I just thought you'd be smart enough to know that you deserve better"". Great words to say to the 17yr-old skanks in the audience too, but I'm wondering what will poor Miles do when he discovers that his skank really wasn't smart enough? Tyler is a surprisingly good fit into their group as he becomes Miles' ""wingman"", much as he (used to be) Mac(Damaine Radcliff)'s ""wingman"" at home; and he also gradually completes the first couple when Nora's boyfriend Brett(John Henderson) bails--on the school, his girlfriend, and his music partner Miles--to egotistically advance his solo singing career.(1) <br/><br/>Conversely, the movie also has a lot of social commentary about young people quitting everything they start. Obviously the propensity affects foster children more often, and Adler and Rosenberg must be commended for reaching out to such kids with their screenplay. Hope and self-worth is often what those kids need most if they are to end their days ""being better"" adults than the circumstances they were born into.(2) <br/><br/>Experienced choreographer/first-time director Ann Fletcher must be given enormous credit for pulling together a flawlessly edited ""great dance"" movie that tells its feelgood story with honesty and social relevance. Fletcher's staging and editing is almost impeccable for.....a choreographer (she did cut the key introduction scene between Miles and Tyler too short for accents to instantly matter). Her cast consisted mostly of dancers whom she coaxed into acting, yet they all have great timing. Even the likable hunky lead, Channing Tatum(She's the Man(2006)), exhibits some well-captured on screen reactions, and Fletcher wrote the funniest line in the movie as romantic vulnerability for him: ""Is this where you, um (take me to) kill me?"" <br/><br/>However, although the falling-in-love montage is natural and honest, Tyler and Nora's continued sexual abstinence is perhaps unrealistic for a couple of dancers. It is, however, great social modeling.<br/><br/>Thankfully the nightclub and finale scenes aren't disappointments, as is often the case in dance films. The first features a reworked Electric Slide that's surprisingly sold best by a vivacious (and not-so-well-hidden) blonde wearing a fuchsia tanktop and a baseball cap. Had she had more screen time, she'd have given Nora/Dewan a run for her money.<br/><br/>The second proves the director's good judgment in leaving the finale unseen till the very end. The Senior Showcase features Kwane Holland's incredible classical-and-hip-hop mix track 'Bout_It (soundtrack on Jive Records). Additionally, the track delivers the talents of Nuttin'_But_Strings, the director's own discoveries. They're a couple of brilliant young male hip-hop violinists whom Fletcher drizzled throughout the movie.<br/><br/>If Get Over It(2001) was Fame(1980) for junior high, Step Up(2006) acts as a Fame remake. It's so universally well-rounded and well-executed that it compares well to earlier minor dance classics Dirty Dancing(1986) and Footloose(1983).(9/10)"

","I watched this movie very reluctantly expecting some stupid, bullsh't dance movie (like High School Musical), but it turned out to be 10 times better than what I expected. I even enjoyed it! Although the storyline wasn't great the action and music made up for it. The beginning got you interested in the movie and the rest was just great.<br/><br/>They had the perfect mix of dance and action. Too much dance would mean a stupid dance film and too little would take away from the movie. The acting was surprisingly great considering most of the (dancing) actors do dancing as their main job. The choice of characters was great and the overall production was very good.<br/><br/>It was sad when Skinny died - (I think an unnecessary death) but the rest of the movie is pretty light hearted and happy.<br/><br/>You might be thinking why I didn't give it a better rating considering the comments - its because i'm just personally not into dance films as much as other genres. If you love dance films then this movie is certainly for you.<br/><br/>I think this is a great movie and even if you don't want to see it I strongly recommend that you do."

","This movie was OK, not great but not Dirty Dancing by any stretch. The storyline was very simple and almost predictable - Tyler Gage lives life the bad way and is usually caught up in drugs, violence and crime. It is not until he and his gang vandalise Maryland's School of Arts that he is finally caught and is sentenced to 200 hours of community service. It is here that he meets Nora, a professional dancer who is in need of a partner and when she sees Tyler expressing his moves in the parking lot, he seems an ideal choice. As the two begin to work together, they predictably fall in love and Tyler must choose between his brotherhood or his dream. The storyline, I admit, is good but what let's it down is the fact that we all know where he is going to end up and what is going to happen. There is simply no element of surprise whatsoever in this film and for me, that lets it down. <br/><br/>The acting is good, particularly from the two main characters. Their characters are believable and I won't deny, they pulled it off nicely. The film had it's fair share of action, humour, good dance moves and romance. If you like films that are pretty predictable, cheesy, have irritating songs and lots of cheesy romance, then this is the film for you. However, if not, I recommend you look elsewhere, perhaps at Grease or Dirty Dancing. This film is good but no where near great. Half of the time, I just wanted to forward the songs on and let me tell you there, there's a lot of them!! 7/10."

","I only watched this film after seeing Step Up 2 in the cinema, and first off was rather surprised that there was a complete change of characters in the two films (except for Tyler, who was present in Step Up 2 at the start). The film itself is really enjoyable to watch - make no mistake, it's not worth an Oscar and most likely will not last the decades and remain in peoples DVD collections for years to come, but it's entertaining to watch, and much better than flicking through the TV channels aimlessly for hours in an attempt to find anything half decent to watch.<br/><br/>It's a typical boy meets girl story, but with a twist. Girl is a ballerina that needs a replacement dance partner, boy is working in the school doing community service, and just happens to be the only one up for the task. The choreography is good (not a patch on Step Up 2 however, though that may be because I prefer watching street dancing over ballet) and the acting is believable. Although the story has been done many times before, it's one of those classical tales that can be re-watched many times in a variety of forms. The female lead (do not know the actors name) is a wonderful dancer and a beautiful actress, and the male lead managed to pull off his part incredibly well.<br/><br/>A must watch for those who enjoy dancing and a good old love story. It's one of my favourite films, though be warned, this won't be everyone's cup of tea."

He's great! But folks, we watched this film not for the steps but for the love story that came up w/ his passion for dancing.. So this is where the You Got Served inspiration came in. The directors got so hooked up with the dance steps that they forgot to add details to the story itself! The story even ended like the ending of High School Musical which is kinda funny! I mean, this is a LOVE STORY! not some gangster inspired film nor a child psychological feed of being a high schooler! that I could say made this film not good to watch..<br/><br/>all in all I really love the roles of the characters and the story..

"zardoz-13","7","0","0","17 February 2008"," Predictable but Entertaining, Opposites Attract, Teen Dance movie
","""27 Dresses"" director Anne Fletcher's urban dance musical ""Step Up"" qualifies as a predictable but entertaining teen movie about the society's haves and have-not's and the peculiar circumstances that bring them together. Essentially, ""Step Up"" resembles ""Save the Last Dance for Me"" but with the roles reversed and the setting modified. Jenna Dewan of ""Take the Lead"" plays the heroineNora Clarkwho lives to dance and can imagine nothing else but dancing in her life. Her mom worries about her daughter and her future and pushes her to think about college rather than getting a job as a professional dancer. Nora is the best ballerina at the Maryland School of the Arts, and she cherishes the memory of her late father who supported her dancing aspirations with unconditional love. Vanilla Ice look-alike Channing Tatum of ""Havoc"" plays the hero--Tyler Gagea ""Rocky"" type character. When underachiever Tyler isn't displaying his superlative street dancing moves, he hangs out with two African-American friendsMac Carter (Damaine Radcliff of ""Glory Road"") and Mac's impetuous little brother Skinny (newcomer De'Shawn Washington)and they steal cars for local chop-shop gangster Omar (Hip-Hop Musician Heavy D of ""Dallas 362"") who loves to throw parties.<br/><br/>Tyler and Nora hail from completely different backgrounds. She lives in the lap of luxury with her single mom, and Tyler lives with a foster family. She attends high school at the Maryland School of the Arts, and he bides time at a local high school. One night after they provide Omar with another hot vehicle, Tyler, Mac, and Skinny are playing around throwing bottles at each other when one of the bottles smashes a window in the MSA building. Inquisitive as they are, this happy-go-luck trio enters the edifice through the broken window and trash an auditorium. In the middle of their vandalism, a security guard appears and manages to tackle Tyler while Mac and Skinny beat it for parts unknown. The judge sentences Tyler to 200 hours of community service that our hero must serve at MSA and MSA director Gordon (Rachel Griffiths of ""Ned Kelly"") tells him that his vandalism has cost the school one scholarship for a student. Tyler winds up performing custodial duties everyday after he gets out of school. One day he spots pretty Nora in her dance class and she reciprocates his look of interest with one of her own. Currently, Nora is hard at work on a dance routine with the help of her boyfriend Brett Dolan (Josh Henderson of ""Broken Bridges"") who is providing the music. Her dance number will appear in the showcase at the end of the semester that prospective dance employers will watch, so a lot is riding on her search for music and choreography. Things turn sour for Nora when her dance partnerColin (newcomer Jamie Scott)injures his leg. Nora cannot find anybody who can dance with her and hold her up above their head as a part of the dance routine. One day Nora spots Tyler demonstrating some of his gyrating hip movements. Reluctantly, she asks Gordon if she can use Tyler and Gordon gives them her approval. Nora confides in Tyler that she has a great idea for a dance routine but it requires more dancers. When they practice next, Tyler shows up with a dozen dancers from MSA. Apparently, Nora doesn't know her way around MSA all that well and she lacks Tyler's charisma.<br/><br/>At this point, ""Step Up"" degenerates into the typical boy-meets-girl, boy-loses-girl, but boy-wins-girl back. Tyler starts off as a jerk but over the course of the movie his behavior ameliorates. Naturally, Mac and Skinny don't have a clue about what Tyler has gotten himself into, but what they do know is that he has been shunning them to perform his community service and rehearse with Nora. Along the way, more trouble occurs when Skinny is shot by a gangsta for stealing the gunman's vehicle. The usual funeral occurs and Tyler realizes now where his priorities lay. They go on stage and perform the dance routine with Nora's mom in the audience and Mac watching his boy do his thing. Predictably, Nora's prayers are answered and she realizes her dreams. When the dance employers ask about Tyler, director Gordon chimes in that he is a transfer student. <br/><br/>The dancing is good enough and the characters of Tyler and Nora as star-crossed lovers is easy to handle. The opposites that attract each other has been done a million times, but the convention still packs a punch and the two have chemistry. The things that drag down ""Step Up"" are the ghetto, inner city stuff with Skinny getting a cap popped in him off-screen. Basically, scenarists Duane Adler of ""Save the Last Dance for Me"" and ""Dexter"" scribe Melissa Rosenberg preserve all of the dance and romantic love stories clichés and Fletcher shuffles it all together for a feel-good 103 minute melodrama. Everything, by the way, takes place in Baltimore and the filmmakers shot every frame on location in Baltimore. Despite the familiarity of the material, Fletcher brings a raw energy and enough momentum to make it entertaining enough."

The plot is somewhat predictable, and basically focuses on fulfilling your dreams, using the medium of dance.<br/><br/>The hero is caught for vandalism of an art school and is sentenced to 200 hours of community service - in the same school - as a janitor. The heroine's partner sprains his leg and she takes on the hero as the dance partner. They have a stormy relationship, but in the end - well, you can predict how it ends! The final sequence of dance is exceptionally good - good choreography, good dancing.

This film inspired me to start dancing lessons because the dancing was amazing and beautifully choreographed. When I was watching it I couldn't help but try some of the dance moves. It also took me into the view of what teenagers living in those types of lifestyles (where music is their closest friend) grew up with, from and into. It may be a film about one boy and girl and that they meet each other through their dancing skills, but you get to watch them dance professionally and grow into a stronger relationship just by showing their strongest passion: to dance.

","This is a sort of BIG BILLY ELLIOTT movie. Very familiar and yet very entertaining dance school pic has the awesomely charismatic Channing Tatum there to anchor it to the screen. Looking like the love child of James Dean and Josh Hartnett if that was possible, he has looks of both and solid acting skills... enough to overcome the hilarious Eminem 8 MILE nonsense first half complete with hugely over-sized toddler pants and silly hat scenes. Similar to any two reels of TAKE THE LEAD or CENTRE STAGE or HONEY and SAVED and STRICTLY BALLROOM and even Saturday NIGHT FEVER this is a FAME /Ballet school drama that is predictable in every scene, but because of Tatum stays watchable. The tiny-tot ballet scenes are hilarious. Can Tatum dance? Yes, and even seems to manage hip hop dance athletics. He was a standout in the lite teeny SHE'S THE MAN at another school and survived the dire drivel of GUIDE TO RECOGNISING YOUR SAINTS... and I welcome any new pic I see his name. Hopefully the 'action producers' can keep guns from his hands and let him develop into a major male star in romantic and music dramas. He is better than being shunted into cop pix and awful BLACKHAWK DOWN imitation pix. The dance numbers are energetic.. especially the blue shirt one in the middle of the film... the goofy romantic thing he is capable of is very appealing. The camera loves him and he has a solid male image excellent for new young adult films like this. Rachel Griffiths plays the thankless role of the headmistress of the school and she sleepwalks thru her role as if she filmed her scenes on a Monday after a day on the SIX FEET UNDER set. It's a Tatum pic this one and it works completely because of him. Terrific photography too. I really like this film and those above like it.

After vandalizing a bunch of props on a Performing Art schools stage, he is sentenced to 200 hours of community service to the Maryland School of the Arts. During his service time, a girl named Nora (Jenna Darwin) dance partner has an accident and can no longer dance, she seeks to find a replacement to practice for her senior showcase till her partner recovers. Many boys audition, but none make the cut. Tyler offers to do it, and is quickly accepted.

I have never really been a big fan of dance movies even though I am a dancer. The acting is good, but not great. But boy can these actors dance. My hats off to Anne Fletcher for her fantastic choreographing job on the dance sequences and her debut as a director. This film is very entertaining. The story can be slow at parts, but for being a dance film it's pretty good, plus there is tons of humor. I also like the fact there is not a bunch of that gangster talk, very little swearing, and very little, if any, sexual references. However, there is some gang related talk, activity, and also a drive-by shooting. The music in the film is also very unique in it's own right.

And the dance scenes aren't just confined to certain emotional scenes that inevitably result in epiphanies for the boy/girl/pigeon watching at window, the movie really focuses on dancing and showcases the talents of the stars beautifully.<br/><br/>The acting is reasonable, not bad enough to make you feel soiled and not good enough to distract you from the slammin dance moves.

It is a dance movie which has some plot to it. The actors aren't academy award winners but they're not bad either. The male start doesn't show a lot of emotion but guys like that (my son is that way too) don't show a lot of outward emotion. He shows compassion for his siblings and his friend.

","I've been looking forward to this movie for the whole summer. Being a hip-hop dancer, I am the first in line to see any dance related movie. I never go in expecting Oscar worthy performances and the only realistic thing I expect is hot dancing. ""Step Up"" was no exception. I expected an average performance at best with a good mix of hip hop dance and music. However, for those with the same expectations as mine, beware. Although there is dancing in the movie, and it is decent, there isn't much of it. There is only one real scene of hip-hop showmanship. The others last about 10-15 seconds at most. I'm guessing the director wanted to put the story and the characters at the forefront and use dancing to enhance the chemistry, similar to Save the Last Dance. Sadly, as expected, the story and the characters are delivered in a typical substandard form and fail to achieve the said ""save the last dance"" chemistry. The dancing, which should have been the focus as in other dance movies, is instead left lagging behind in screen time. Overall, the movie is decent and it may still be worth seeing it for the little dancing that there is because it's still hot. Do not expect non-stop dancing action with filler story. Since this movie failed to impress even me, and I usually have low standards when it comes to dance movies, I give it a 6. ""Take the lead"" blows this out of the water."

","Regarding to the comment above I don't agree. It is not full of clichés, and there acting was perfect. They were stumbling through things because that is what their character was supposed to be doing. And when showing off that is also what their character was supposed to be doing. I am very good at predicting movies, and this one was hardly as predictable as others; like the death of one character was very unpredictable until about five minutes before it happened, and even then the film maker wanted it to happen like that. I very much enjoyed the movie along with the dancing, the acting, and the story; I recommend guy or girl to see this movie."
"jon.h.ochiai","8","2","6","30 August 2006"," A Real Step Up
","""Step Up"" is derivative, predictable, and formulaic. That being said, Director Anne Fletcher's hybrid classical hip-hop dance romance is completely arresting and thoroughly enjoyable. I was surprised how engaging the movie is. Within the first 20 minutes, you can predict the outcome. And ultimately, it does not matternot in the least. What ""Step Up"" has going for it is a breakthrough star performance by Channing Tatum. Tatum plays delinquent high school student Tyler Gage, who happens to be a gifted street dancer. Tyler rolls with Mac Carter (Damaine Radcliff) and his little brother Skinny (De'Shawn Washington). After Tyler is caught vandalizing the Maryland School of the Arts, he must serve his community work sentence at the school. Tyler catches the eye of star ballerina Nora Clark (Jenna Dewan). She spies Tyler's dance display outside the school. Nora is in a lurch. She is preparing her senior dance piece, but her dance partner is injured. Dance company reps attend the Senior Show. Nora promises her Mom (Deirdre Lovejoy) that if she does not land with a dance company she will apply to Cornell University. For Nora dance is her lifewhat she lives for. Eventually, Nora strikes a deal with School Director Gordon (Rachel Griffiths) and Tyler. Gordon reluctantly agrees.<br/><br/>Tatum and Dewan have amazing chemistry as Tyler and Nora. Of course Nora has a self absorbed jerk boyfriend Brett (Josh Henderson), who is on the verge of signing a record deal with the collaboration of brilliant classical/ hip-hop composer Miles (recording star Mario). For the first time Tyler is able to see the greatness in himself. But like Mac reminds him, ""You quit everything you start."" So it is truly time for Tyler to be responsible for his life and risk being extraordinary. The ""90210"" and ""Fame"" trite melodrama aside, ""Step Up"" is inspiring and you cheer for Tyler and Nora. Even with the corn ball predictable story, ""Step Up"" is really about taking responsibility for one's own greatnesswhich is everyone's birth right.<br/><br/>""Step Up"" has spectacular dancing be it ballet, hip-hop or hybrid. Jenna Dewan is a classically trained dancer. Channing Tatum is an awesome street dancer on screen. I checked on-line that Tatum is not a trained dancerhe a gifted athlete and martial artist. Tatum possesses a star quality and natural charisma. Tall and handsome he has great screen presence. Tatum plays basically a lug, but he is so charming and has great range. Whether he is playfully trading dance moves with his sister Camille (so cute Alyson Stoner) or fighting with a gang banger in a club he always comes across real. There is a truth about Tatum's performance. Though somewhat overshadowed, Jenna Dewan is winning and beguiling as Nora. Dewan captures Nora's passion and heart. She and Tatum have magical chemistry. That leverages against all the predictability inherent in ""Step Up"".<br/><br/>Anne Fletcher as both director and choreographer is amazing. The final dance number is killer. However, I found more compelling the training and creative sequences with Tyler and Nora. Dance is a great discipline and an art. Training and talent get you in the door. Art is all about the feel, passion, and creation. ""Step Up"" possesses these qualities and there is such joy in this movie. The music is equally stunning and captivating with its blend of urban beats and classical orchestration.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is solid. Rachel Griffiths brings the right compassion and gravity as Director Gordon. Mario is natural and strong as composer Miles. Damaine Radcliff gives a street edge and authenticity to Mac. Lucy Avila is charming as Nora's friend Lucy.<br/><br/>""Step Up"" is great fun at the movies. Channing Tatum is a going to be a big star. ""Step Up"" is a real step up."

","Some people say they're tired of dancing movies, but not me. If you ignore the fact that there's other dance movies you'll enjoy this one. I guess you can say some of the dance movies are the same but what does that have to do with enjoying the flow of the movie? The story is.....well I guess you can decide on that. A girl needs to have a dance routine to impress spokespeople for dance companies, so she needs to have a good routine to impress the people so she can get a job with one of them instead of going out to college. But her main dance partner hurts himself so who will take her spot? Some punk from another school who got caught vandalizing her school so he has community service at her school. So it ends up that he becomes her new partner and they fall in love but she has a boyfriend so there's conflicts.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie was good and bad. First off all each of the cast acted well. They each pulled their own weight. But but them together and they fall apart. The main two people didn't have chemistry, and you didn't believe that a guy like that could get with a girl like that in that type of scenario.<br/><br/>Now where the movie gets good. The dancing and music. First of all the soundtrack is amazing. I loved every song they had in this movie especially how they took 2 songs and mixed it to make it sound a lot better. Even though other movies have done this before I really enjoyed the music in this movie especially. Now about the dancing. The choreography is really great. The directing of all of it was amazing. You have to give the people who played the kids in this movie kudos for being able to do that. It's amazing what some people can do.<br/><br/>Overall I loved this movie. Yes I am a guy who loved a dancing movie, just to show you how this movie can appeal to everyone. I would really recommend seeing this."

","Alright, many people will begin to classify this movie with ""bad acting"" and ""teens only drool over the lead actor"". Is it really necessary to automatically label a movie terrible because the lead actor is gorgeous beyond belief? Not only was this movie entertaining, it was romantic, humorous, and sad. The acting was good, the dance scenes were amazing. I got so into this movie. I thought Tatum did an excellent job with his dance moves, he really seemed to flow into the part of being a white guy in the ghetto. His acting skills were a bit off. Dewan did a pretty good job acting, but I will say it was not the best. Her dance moves were amazing though. Her flexibility and being able to adapt to both styles of dance were incredible.<br/><br/>This movie was made for teens. So why are older people criticizing it when teens are loving it? Yes, we get to stare at a gorgeous boy for an hour and half. WHAT IS THE PROBLEM WITH THAT. This movie really makes you want to get into dancing.

","When I was first invited to see Step Up I was a bit reluctant. My friends who are extreme Channing Tatum fans eventually got me to go and I loved it. The movie was good and because it was opening day the theater was full. Unlike the trailers that made Tatum seem like a bad actor the acting was good for his amount of experience. The one thing that I did not like was the combination of so many plots. I think that the movie would have been better if they just stuck to the good stuff instead of being ambitious and trying to tackle so much at a time. I would definitely recommend this movie because it's exciting , fun and easy to relate to."

I've never seen the actress who played Nora before but she seems very good. some people have commented that they think both look to old to be high school students but I disagree.

"rs1-6","5","1","2","11 August 2016"," But they can't
","What we have here, is a cliché-ridden school of the arts flick. I am moved to write this review while it is only halfway through. Perhaps I'll change my opinion by the time it ends. A story about a street smart, sort of, break dancer (Channing Tatum), a budding ballet student(Jenna Dewan Tatum), and assorted family and plot-filling friends. The boy happens to be sentenced to janitorial community service at the school after having broken in and vandalized the building with his buddies. The dancer suddenly is in need of a practice partner and (guess what?) our janitor just happens to take on the job. The plot is annoyingly formulaic. Dancer and dude fall in love. Mother disapproves. For tears, there is a random death that goes nowhere in the story line. Well, the two protagonists wind up together forever in the film and in real life, as they actually met and fell in love on the set which is, perhaps, the most interesting part of this tale. OK, it's over and I haven't changed my mind. Watching it was a waste of time. Now, what is the worst thing about this dance production? Unlike, ""Fame,"" ""Saturday Night Fever,"" ""Flash Dance,"" etc., nobody in the film can actually dance!"
"Gordon-11","Null","1","2","19 August 2012"," So little dancing in this film!
","This film is about a man who has to serve community service in a dancing school, because of the misbehaviour of his foster brothers.<br/><br/>I was expecting ""Step Up"" to be similar to other dance movies, such as ""StreetDance 3D"" and ""Honey"". However, ""Step Up"" does not concentrate on the vibrant energy of young dancers. Instead, ""Step Up"" concentrates on the lives of the characters. There are little scenes of them dancing, and even if they are dancing they are just isolated practice scenes. For a dancing movie, the number of dancing scenes is quite pitiful. The story is not so engaging either, so I was left feeling bored and disappointed by ""Step Up""."
"jboothmillard","4","1","2","14 December 2010"," Step Up
","Following on from Save the Last Dance and a few other dance movies before, this recognisable title was the next one I tried, from choreographer turned director Anne Fletcher (27 Dresses, The Proposal). Basically Tyler Gage (She's the Man's Channing Tatum) lives with his foster parents in the lower class African American neighbourhood of Baltimore, he is is a talented street dancer but also a troublemaker with his friends Mac Carter (Damaine Radcliff) and his little brother Skinny Carter (De'Shawn Washington). Having fun partying and stealing cars, they one night break into Maryland School of Arts committing vandalism on the stage with all the props and equipment, and Tyler is the one caught and sentenced to 200 hours community service. Under the watch of Director Gordon (Rachel Griffiths) he is assigned to work as a janitor in the school cleaning floors and windows, and picking up the litter. He has been lightly distracted in his work seeing the dance classes, and particularly the talent of beautiful ballet student Nora Clark (Take the Lead's Jenna Dewan), who is already seeing someone. She oversees him doing his street dancing outside, and when her original partner Andrew (Tim Lacatena) has a strain, Tyler offers to take his place and follow her choreography. As the practising continues Tyler not only suggests new street dance style moves into the routine that will be judged, but he and Nora are getting very close. Tyler has been known to start things and give up after just a short time, and of course this is what happens when for almost no reason at all he stops practising with Nora, leaving her alone. She does try and get him back, and there is a small vice versa situation, it is after the Boyz n the Hood style shooting and death of Skinny Carter that Tyler has to decide to help Nora with her judged performance and maybe get a place in the dance school himself. In the end the final performance with Tyler and Nora goes brilliantly, they both gain high praise and interest from the judges and school heads, and obviously they are happy together. Also starring singer Mario as Miles Darby, Drew Sidora as Lucy Avila, Heavy D as Omar and Josh Henderson as Brett Dolan. Tatum and Dewan make a good couple, but to be honest the only highlight are all the well choreographed street dance sequences, not a bad romantic dance drama. Okay!"
"KineticSeoul","5","1","2","14 October 2010"," Well it ain't a terrible dance flick
","This is probably the first dance flick that revolves around romance. And it was pretty much sort of dull and boring throughout the whole movie, with a few good dancing in it. The plot is basically this, a hip hop street dancer gets in trouble and has to serve some community service hours at the school he trashed with his friends. If it had more hip hop dancing in it, it would have been a better moving. Not trying to bash on ballet, but it was just plain boring in this. The emotional and dramatic parts in this was just plain dull and lame. Overall it's a pretty boring dance flick, mainly cause it doesn't have enough cool dancing in it, and tries too hard to focus on the romance aspects of it, but it's not done really well and seems really weak. It's also a pretty narrow and predictable story, with nothing really interesting going on. It's passable film and has a few moments that is decent, where guys can tolerate it and girls will probably like it.<br/><br/>5.1/10"
"darewhee","5","1","2","28 June 2008"," Bad acting and a typical formula
","I fell asleep the first time I watched ""Step Up"". The second time I watched it I found the movie just as boring as before.<br/><br/>The movie copies formulas from previous dance movies, most notably ""Save the Last Dance"". The two movies share a lot of similarities. Both involve troubled main characters who must fulfill their dreams of dancing, while falling in love in the process. Both movies build up to the final dance scene. Except ""Step Up"" does not do this. The final dance scene disappoints and is anti-climatic, whereas in ""Save the Last Dance"" I get goosebumps every time when Julia Stiles dances to the song ""Live Your Dreams"".<br/><br/>It is hard to be a fan of this movie, when there have been so many better ones before (i.e. Centerstage and Dirty Dancing), all with the same plot lines. While I don't mind the dance story formula, ""Step Up"" fails to be creative, making it boring for those who have seen movies such as ""Save the Last Dance"".<br/><br/>The acting in the movie is terrible. The lead female character is annoying and hard to watch. There is nothing special about this movie except the eye candy named Channing Tatum who fails to deliver a decent acting performance as well(Iv'e seen the same character in ""She's the Man"").<br/><br/>Final Words: Skip the movie, buy the soundtrack."

At the end of the watching, I had given it a 1. So we split the rating here. Some of the dance sequences are fun and skilled. But the awful awful awful script with the characters as thin as tissue paper and the death of one main character was signalled from two miles away. And on.<br/><br/>This review said it best:<br/><br/>'Non-story' ... Step Up<br/><br/>Another West Side Non-Story, scoring low on the raunch-o-meter. Jenna Dewan is the Wasp dance student at a Fame-style school who gets the hots, or rather the certificate-PG family-friendly tepids, for a tough guy with dancing skills from the wrong side of the tracks, played by Channing Tatum. These supposedly physical young people are evidently content with kissing and contain themselves as chastely as Trevor Howard and Celia Johnson. For tweenie sleepovers only. <br/><br/>I am long past being a tweenie and my sleepovers rarely involve movies. 2 out of 10 for the dancing. Poor Rachel Griffith taking on a job like this! EWWW!"
"Derrick-Siu","3","1","2","24 December 2007"," below par dance movie
","Whilst not expecting this film to be as good as Save the Last Dance, I was expecting a lot more than what was served. The acting, plot and character development was all sorely lacking, to the point where the motivation for character's actions were at many times missing. An example of the poor character development, is that we are shown how these boys kill time in their underprivileged situation by getting involved with illegal activities, but we are not shown why and how they got involved (eg at least try and show they are trying to fill something they feel is missing in their life) - but all we see is them acting and being stupid. so we don't feel any sympathy or empathy for the main male characters. Also lots of cheesy and corny lines, doesn't help the script either. and unfortunately even the strongest area of the film - the dancing - was only OK, as it really lacked the WOW factor one should expect in this day."

He seems so insecure with himself until he hits the dance floor. At that moment he becomes the most confident person in the room because he has some serious skills.

People that saw this movie had to love it i saw it Friday night and as soon as we were 20minutes into the movie i declared it my new favorite. I loved how Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan connected with each other, and the choreography was so fabulous. I loved watching this movie and i plan on returning to the theater to watch it again, and again. During this movie i laughed and i cried. It had all the makings of being the best movie of the summer. Anyone who would criticize this movie really didn't understand it. Personally i thought it was amazingly wonderful, and Channing Tatum was amazing at acting"
"brian090888","9","1","3","3 February 2007"," A Pleasant Surprise
","I went into this movie thinking it would be the same old story. In many ways, it was; however, I found that it added a certain spice to the dance-movie genre which is becoming quite trite as of late. I do have some complaints, such as the scene where Skinny was killed. It was predictable, and I thought detracted from the rest of the film . . . but the acting was inspired, the dancing was phenomenal, the music was excellent, and outside a few very cliché moments, the story was good.<br/><br/>It is now one of my favorite movies, primarily because I thought the acting ability of the leads was amazing. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys this kind of angst-ridden but artistically executed drama."

","This movie was worth watching. I really enjoyed this movie because they all had good roles and they made the movie really good which I enjoyed,the dancing wasn't as good as I thought it would be but still it was really good,the songs were really good,Thye had good beats and it made you feel like dancing,The message in these movie is really about doing better.After skinny died his brother and his friend realize that what they are doing for a living is really not gonna help them get anywhere in the future and that they know that they can do better than what there doing,so they both change their life's around.Overall I enjoyed it because is not every day that they make a good movie like these one.If you are thinking on buying a good movie BUY THIS ONE because it got a message and is for everyone"
"fluffypinkchickens","10","1","3","2 February 2007"," Step is the best dance movie!
","This is a great movie that everyone should see if they are into dancing.(Spoiler) Step Up has a great cast with the hunky Channing Tatum playing Tyler who is a rebel. He gets in trouble with the law and has to do community service for 200 hours. He spends this time at Maryland School of the Arts where he see's Nora played by Jenna Dewan. After her partner twists his ankle and cannot do the routine with Nora its up to her to find a new dance partner. None are up to her standards. So when she tries out with Tyler they perform perfectly an they develop a relationship. Anyways no more spoiling here but i have to say this is my favourite movie so far this year. Go see it!!"

","So what did you guys think? I thought well her read my comment then maybe that will pursue you and just maybe I hope cause it's a gr8 movie you will watch it and those you have comment!<br/><br/>This movie was above all the movies that I have ever watched. It is a movie not only directed at kids,teenagers or adults that like to dance but a movie for all. Step Up shows that two different people from totally different backgrounds aren't that different from one another!<br/><br/>Channing Tatum played the role as Tyler Gage he really busted some tight dances moves. Nora Clark was played by Jenna Dewan she moved across that floor like an eagle in the sky. Step Up has a great moral behind it, all you have to do is listen and think about things on a completely different way, be 3 Dimensional.<br/><br/>My friends and I thought that this movie and the choreography was taken to a completely different level!It's amazing how directors and producers script writers and all that Jazz, know exactly what to put into the movie. Watch Step Up I watched it like a million times. A movie worth crying for! WOW!"
"phantomoftheforest","9","1","3","14 January 2007"," I actually really liked it
","When I first saw the previews for this movie, I admit, I wasn't all that excited to see it, but I rented it anyway and really enjoyed watching it. Yeah, Channing Tatum needs little work when it comes to being 'gangsta' but overall turned in a convincing performance, I think I'd rather fall in love with the character he created than a character truer to life because he had a sensuality and a sensitive side that usually aren't exhibited by actors with basically the same role. I especially enjoyed the dancing parts, it made me want to get up and dance! The best kinds of movies make you want to stand up and do exactly what the characters are doing, especially the end during the performance, I didn't, however, like the fact that he keeps giving up and then comes back and says ""What do I have to do?"" but admittedly the results of his asking were pretty cute especially when they're in the little kid's ballet class, the little girl is just so adorable with her chubby cheeks :) This movie is a story of redemption and defiantly merits the name because it successfully has a dynamic character from end to end. The actors had chemistry, plus (a MUST have) they could dance (which I'm sure can be contributed to a great choreographer) I enjoyed the music, the dances, most of the story line, I think I'll buy the movie sometime soon."

","Inspiring definitely! Won't become a classic but it might change something. If I see movies where people fight and reach coming from parties and drugs always makes me think. same thing I'm doing, wasting my time with nothing. So when i see a movie like this i always decide to do something(never happens). Feel good movie, life is not as unfair as it seems Music is great, i'm not for that kind of music but it fits and it's not bad listening to it without the movie<br/><br/>although the big black guy should have auditioned to basketball, wouldn't have made it any more cheesy just a little more fair and the little girl should have started learning ballet from the dancer chick. I know glitter and to sweet but wouldn't have been any more cheesier <br/><br/>Great dancing anyways!"
"Chris_Docker","6","1","3","26 October 2006"," Regular fare, competently delivered
","Step Up (three stars)<br/><br/>Director Anne Fletcher Writers Duane Adler and Melissa Rosenberg Stars Jenna Dewan, Channing Tatum Certificate PG Running time 103 minutes Country USA Year 2006<br/><br/>Nora is training to be a dancer at the fairly exclusive Maryland School of the Arts. Tyler is a rebel from the wrong side of the tracks doing community service at the school after getting caught breaking in and vandalising it for kicks. She is classically trained in ballet and contemporary dance. He can breakdance like there's no tomorrow and throw in body-popping and cool good looks (Tyler is played by ex-model Channing Tatum). She needs a dance partner and there's the usual storyline footsie of boy-gets-girl, breaks up with girl, aspires, is gonna dance, is not gonna dance, they make each other feel good in public together then kiss-kiss finale.<br/><br/>This is the same formula used in every modern dance movie and Step Up has no surprises, but for an enjoyable slice of this type of cake it is no worse than average. It doesn't have the glossy editing/directing and punchy acting to make it stand out like a Fame, Dirty Dancing, or Flashdance, but it's fine on its own level, competent, and has some good dance sequences.<br/><br/>From a dance point of view, classical ballet is very upright, geometrical, relatively emotionally unexpressive and danced in a precise manner. Breakdance, using different heights, opening and closing in fluid motion to express feeling, and working off the beat more like jazz, is a natural opposite. Mixing the two together gives an interesting and explosive combination. Nora finds that her dance routine is greatly enhanced by Tyler's style and gives him a crash course in ballet (which would be needed for posture and control).<br/><br/>A good hip-hop soundtrack boosts these joining of opposites, adding violin to the funkier beats. A forgettable movie, but worth seeing by dance fans or teenagers after easy-viewing."
"Jay_Exiomo","5","1","3","20 September 2006"," Same old dance moves
","You really can't fault ""Step Up"" with at least having its heart in the right place even if its trite dramatic elements overbear it as a whole. Tyler Gage (Channing Tatum) is serving a 200-hour community service for the Maryland School of Arts after getting caught trashing some of the school's props during a late-night vandalism. Soon, in a twist of events, he finds himself teamed up with Nora Clark (Jenna Dewan), a ballet dancer in her senior year, for the school's showcase wherein lie their futures.<br/><br/>Directed by choreographer Anne Fletcher and written by Duane Adler and Melissa Rosenberg, ""Step Up"" is weaved to the formula of cookie-cutter dance movies that's a dime a dozen nowadays. Overstuffed with too many plot lines and directed without much fluidity, the film doesn't break new grounds or usher anything that hasn't been shown in, say, ""Take the Lead."" The actors can only do so much but they can't step up from a movie full of stock characters and typical subplots. Troubled guy who's capable of doing something great. Girl unbelievably dating a guy who doesn't deserve her. Black Americans who sulk at social prejudice. Mother who ""wants the best"" for her child but can't see that what her child does is what's the best for her.<br/><br/>The chemistry between Tatum and Dewan is as active as that of a helium with a neon. Tatum is so stoic in mumbling his lines. As for Dewan, while she is no high-caliber actress, she has a rather effervescent presence that translate prettily on the celluloid.<br/><br/>Perhaps what would have made ""Step Up"" a much more compelling film was if it paid more attention to the area it's tackling and making it more innovative. There's nary a persuasive composition (or at least none that I can remember) as most of the choreography consists of body shakes, lifts, turns and pirouettes. A standing ovation has never felt more conspicuously staged.<br/><br/>As it is, ""Step Up"" ends up as just another familiar piece that stocks on its shallow characters, their clichéd episodes, and the diaphanous ending Hollywood constantly obligates."
"JoeJames76","6","1","3","23 August 2006"," Dance movies made only for the sake of dance, acting be damned!
","There was a time, soon after the second World War, when drive-ins numbered in the thousands and film distribution was evolving and a new ""teen"" market was creating a need for youth oriented product. This spawned a golden age of what came to be known as ""B-movies"", starring pretty young men and women, who were pretty talentless, full of fun and thin on plot. Step Up is a B-movie in every sense of the word.<br/><br/>Today the movie business is extremely driven by teen dollars. This is why a film like Step Up is made. Perhaps the only reason. i can't imagine someone wanting to make this film for the message it conveys (community service can lead to new relationships?, white boyz can be ballerinas too?). Instead, this movie is exactly what it was designed for. Take a pretty boy who can dance, but really comes off tough (James Dean type) and a sweet young lady from a proper home, and let their worlds collide, then co-mingle. It's the Grease formula, all over again.<br/><br/>Granted, Channing Tatum makes for a good John Travolta replacement, with some hood street cred, but looks that rival Brad Pitt's introduction in ""Thelma and Louise"". He actually comes across as an adequate dancer and actor, a nice cross between Eminem in ""8 Mile"" and Matt Damon in ""Good Will Hunting"". Unfortunately, his Sandra Dee isn't ready to make the leap to lead status, as Jenna Dewan's acting certainly needs more work than her dancing. The rest of the cast seems better suited for TV, including an oddly cast Rachel Griffiths (Brenda on ""Six Feet Under"") whose presence makes you wonder what she did to deserve this.<br/><br/>The script is filled with every cliché under the sun, and just when you thought that something unpredictable might happen, it doesn't. Right from the beginning, when a character's younger brother is introduced, i said to myself, ""Please don't make him be the lesson learned"". Let's just say that every teen romance and ghetto flick plot line is rehashed to the exact detail, without a whiff of originality.<br/><br/>What this allows the audience to do, is to enjoy the dancing scenes and the booming soundtrack. This may be the first film that would work better as a 90 minute music video, and save us from either uninspired dialogue, or misdelivered dialogue. Sadly, even the dancing doesn't compare to previous dance films like ""Center Stage"", ""You Got Served"", or ""Honey"".<br/><br/>Grade: D+"
"budhuntr2","8","1","3","21 August 2006"," Step Up... gets my Thumbs Up.
","This was a very refreshing movie to view. I think the director took good care in exposing each character's strength's and weakness. I found myself cheering for everyone to ""get it right"". The ending made it all worth the ride. Beautifully done. We need more movies like this not just in the theater's but on television also. It's good to see the arts being portrayed as a blend. The way the cultures blend in a large city, broadening their base to reach out and touch everyone, insuring the survival of its being. Through out the movie you keep wanting to shout to the main characters to step up, don't stop, keep going, meanwhile you feel their pain and understand that this just maybe, all there is for them. Then they show that they have more to offer, you scream with them... yeah! That's what I am talking about! If the movie doesn't move you, the music will. I only hope ALL the music finds it's way on a soundtrack disc."

","This is directed at younger film goers...producers have the challenge of finding dancers who can act. I'm loving your thoughts on this movie as a person of the 30's-40's generation who needs to hear the truth if we're gonna produce better movies that don't insult your intelligence.<br/><br/>So my question is; what's more important, an actor who can move a little, be dance-doubled and deliver a great performance like Catherine Zeta Jones or Richard Gere in Chicago] An OK actor who gives it a try like Julia Stiles in Save the Last Dance, or Jessica Alba in Honey] or a kick ass dancer who may be a little shaky acting-wise, like Cheyenne in Shall We Dance? I'm not saying either is better I just want to know what you think. Dante Basco and Banderas from Take the Lead could do both, but they are few and far between."

Just some things weren't that good It was a bit like Save the last Dance. But one thing that i loved about the movie was the soundrack it featured some artists that not a lot of people know. Channings dancing was great. But I don't think his co-star fit with him I mean he was to gorgeous for her.

The movie begins with Tyler(Channing Tatum), a rough and tumble kind of guy, who is a great dancer, but seems to be having it rough. One night he and his friends break in a performing school, and pretty much wreak some of it. But Tyler gets caught, and his friends get away. His community service is that he has be a janitor to the school he wreaked. Tyler soon notices the beautiful dancer named Nora Clark(Jenna Dewan) who's partner gets injured. But Nora sees what an incredible dancer Tyler is, decides to give him a try. Lets hope they do well together. This was a great movie all over, great acting, great dancing, and great music.

I also liked the ed when he was at the showcase and he told the girl that he was fighting for something real for the first time those word sounded so real. then when she let him dance... there are no words to describe how he looked dancing except for amazing. he is really good at it, almost as if it were natural and like he'd been doing it for years.

It did have a couple plot lines going at once but they all fit in at the end. Being a dancer myself i enjoyed every choreographed part of this movie and the finale at the end was amazing. This movie was awesome and it even has inspired me to go further into my dancing career. This movie was serious but it also had humor in it which everyone loves. Hahaha i never knew that Channing could dance but him and Jenna were both amazing at dance and at acting. This movie had also had a couple love stories in it which everyone always loves. And of course it had a happy ending. The one thing that i didn't like was how there was to much hes in, wait no hes not in, hes in,nooo he quit again with ""tyler"". But in the end he pulled it off and even got his transfer."

I love the soundtrack, it is amazing and the dancing skill is awesome. i loved the actress who played Nora. The plot was interesting and not the arc type dancer movie i expected. overall a great movie, but the Ciara in the end kind of lessened the excellence. Channing was decent, he can act pretty well, but he didn't act much in this role. i feel like he could have been a bit more emotional. Jenna Dewan was amazing. the dancing overall in this movie was impeccable. the routines were amazing and kept you watching especially in the scene when Drew Sidora sang 'Til the Dawn. The soundtrack is mamzing, i couldn't wait to buy it, and i love every one of the songs. the actors were a bit old for their roles, but thats what you see in show business. I loved how Channing wasn't lovey dovey with his siblings, it made the movie more realistic. Some say that there were too many conflict, but he conflictsof the two separate lives made both of their lives seem to blend and i think that they show reality, where there usually is a lot going on in both of their lives. overall, i loved the movie. the dancing is amazing and i love Jenna Dewan and Channing Tatum."
"claireunga","7","1","5","13 August 2006"," Good dance movie, but nothing fabulous
","I was skeptical about seeing this movie, and thought it would be exactly like ""Save the Last Dance."" However, the plot is more original, and dance is a much more central part of it than in ""Save the Last Dance."" Channing Tatum (Tyler)'s performance is very good despite how hokey the movie got at some points, but Jenna Dewan (Nora) was slightly disappointing and even a little annoying at times. The dance scenes in the movie are phenomenal and very impressive, and I loved the chemistry between the two main characters, but the movie is incredibly corny in scripting and plot action. It's not worth a $9 ticket, but I saw ""Step Up"" for $6.50 and felt I got my money's worth."
"secret0009","8","1","5","13 August 2006"," It really is the next generation dance movie
","I saw this movie this afternoon with 3 other girls and 3 guys and I wouldn't say it was bad. It wasn't perfect **he should have been shirtless more** but besides that it was a good movie. It brings 2 types of unique dances in one combined routine that was so good I wanted to literally get up in the cinema and dance, sing and clap.<br/><br/>Channing Tatum is brilliant in this movie, although his character is much of a thug (which personally is a turn down for me) his role is really good and so is the script. It tells the lives of 2 different people with different taste, different homes, different families...but the one thing they share in common is their love for dancing.<br/><br/>I'd really tell people to go see it because it shows the present generation of kids and teens.

I'm NOT GOING TO END THIS 17 TIMES !!!!!"
"gtp-4","8","1","6","13 August 2006"," Critiques thus far unfair
","I'm not going to try and maintain that this is the best movie ever because while I think it's a great movie, it does lack the sort of depth of plot exhibited by something like Memento. But let's be honest here it's not that type of movie, and it's not intended to be that type of movie. It's intended to be a feel good movie with a ton of great dancing and it entirely delivers on that aspect.<br/><br/>One, the dancing was amazing. I'm a ballroom dancer and like most people I enjoy my share of hip hop dancing though I'm certainly not trained in it. Irrespective of my credential or lack there of, I thought this movie exhibited some really awesome dancing. While it's easily compared to Save the Last Dance, this movie goes far beyond Save the Last Dance both in believability and in dance showcasing. I happen to still like Save the Last Dance, but this movie exceeds it in every way. Unlike many dance movies this movie shows an excellent and imaginative final performance as well as the training scenes throughout. It mixes ballet and hip hop in a seamless and unique way and the soundtrack is amazing.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the acting in this movie was excellent. I know many people have been complaining about Channing's performance, but as someone who works for the Public Defender's Office specifically in juvenile court, I found his acting to be amazing. His acting was so true to life that I thought I was looking at one of my juvenile clients. People might complain that he was robotic or didn't show enough emotion, but you've got to realize the type of person he was attempting to be. He's not some upper-middle class expressive kid. He's an indigent kid who's had no childhood and is living in an environment where emotion is not exactly a quality you want to show. I walked out of the theater thinking I'd never seen someone express so much realism in a character, so I find it hard to believe that people are claiming that his acting was bad. I think instead that these people making those remarks have no idea of what the character he was trying to portray would actually think or feel or how they would act.<br/><br/>All in all I think this was a great and enjoyable movie and while you shouldn't expect Lord of the Rings quality, you should also give it a chance before lumping it into the category of juvenile chic flicks most everyone else seems to have hastily decided it belongs to.<br/><br/>And one final note - as to the person who said there were many better films that exhibited dancing - I'd really like to know what films he's referring to. Because it definitely wasn't Save the Last Dance and it definitely wasn't Center Stage and I'm just left wondering what else s/he's referring to."

","So I went to see this last night and I don't think I've ever been in a room with so many other girls... Of course as the previews show this movie is somewhere between Center Stage / Save the Last Dance and it does its job well. They did an amazing job of getting people who could really dance from the first scene to the credits you could tell that those people could really move. <br/><br/>When you go to see this movie I wouldn't expect the unexpected, there are no unbelievable plot twists but it is not predictable enough to be boring by any means. The main characters are perfect for each other and play off each other really well, and both are completely believable as the characters they play<br/><br/>I hope you go see this you'll enjoy it, and even for the lack of testosterone in the theatre I can't see guys hating the movie for the girl is hot and its well put together and got a great soundtrack.<br/><br/>My only complaint is that they didn't have his little sister dance more.. we all know she can move"
"Roundfacema360","10","1","9","11 August 2006"," My thoughts of the film compared to past dance films
","I keep it real in my critique!! This how I felt..<br/><br/>1) Overall- Step Up was cool. It had likable characters. The character ""Mac"", Tatum's best friend in the film was the realest to me. It's like I've met him before. The dancing was hot. In the very beginning the ballet mixed with street was so hot! I loved how they showed both styles. Some dance moves were even similar. It's funny how both dance styles went with the music too. The last dance piece at the end of the film was an interesting mix of dance. I loved it.<br/><br/>2. The main characters.<br/><br/>Clearly ""Nora"" Jenna Dewan's character is a professional trained dancer unlike Julia Styles who trained for that role. I like both main characters in this case. But dancer wise, I HAVE TO GIVE UP TO JENNA SHE WAS GREAT!! Channing Tatum's personality came alive on film. He was funny with good sense of humor.<br/><br/>As for dancing..he's not that great of a dancer, he's JUST OKAY. Every time I thought he was going to do something really amazing, he let me down. His back handspring in the middle of the dance floor was sloppy and no form to it. That particular scene in the club was cool except Tanning really didn't grasp charisma as I expected.<br/><br/>I've seen ton of b-boys that would knock Tatum out in the first round of the battle. He was okay though. <br/><br/>But Step up was more enjoyable. Save the Last Dance comes in second. The death of the character ""Skinny"" in Step up was NO surprise! The moment he started getting in trouble in the beginning of the film, I thought ""He's going to die, if not NOW then later on."" Some character in the hood ALWAYS have to die. The way Skinny died made no sense, he looked really stupid. At least back in the day in the film, Boyz N' the Hood Morris Chestnut's character died without it being his fault it was more tragic. Skinny's silly actions got him killed.<br/><br/>If you're going to kill of a likable funny character at least let him go with some sense.<br/><br/>FOR THE RECORD SAVE THE LAST DANCE WAS NOT THE FIRST INTERRACIAL FILM WHERE TWO DANCERS MEET FROM 2 COMPLETELY DIFFERENT WORLDS OF DANCE..IT WAS BREAKIN' 1984. Ozone the b-boy meets contemporary dancer Kelly.<br/><br/>It was street life meets privileged life. Done way before Save the Last Dance and Step up!! Classic films like Beat Street and Breakin' are too good to be categorized with modern movies today like Save the Last dance, Step Up and especially Honey."

","Some of ""Step Up"" is so ludicrous I wondered whether it was originally conceived as a spoof comedy. As every cliché in the book is hit!

It was an OK way to spend time watching with a date. <br/><br/>Channing Tatum was likable and the female lead however she was, was attractive too.

"oldhamma","10","0","1","26 August 2010"," Love love loveee this movie and Channing Tatum (:
","I absolutely loved this movie and I got super pumped when I found out they were coming out with a 2 and now a 3! The dancing amazes me and every time I watched them do a dance routine it made me wish that I would've stuck with dance when I was little so I could do some of the moves they did. Channing Tatum being one of the main actors in this movie made it all the more better of course (: I think this movie did a good job of showing that anybody can do anything they put their mind to. For example, in the movie Tyler (Channing Tatum) lived in a foster home just causing trouble all the time and after he started working so hard on the dance numbers, it paid off in the end!<br/><br/>I can't think of much I didn't like about this movie, it was awesome all around! I could've done without the shooting in one scene because that made me sad and I always have to turn my head when that part comes on. They also should've been clearer about the whole foster home thing because I couldn't figure that part out for a long time, I always thought he lived with his family. Other than that, the movie was great!!<br/><br/>I would compare this movie to Dirty Dancing because I recognized a lot of the same dance moves in both movies. The dancing is pretty dirty in both movies but that's what attracted my attention, no one wants to watch ballroom dancing on the big screen. I would say I enjoyed the drama and plot to Step Up more though!"
"Floated2","5","0","1","7 February 2010"," wasn't that great but not bad
","I watched this movie but wasn't really expecting to watch it at all. this movie wasn't such a good movie. Before i watched this movie i didn't have high expectations for this movie because many dance movies seem not to be great. So i was right, step up wasn't such a good movie, it was alright and enjoyable at times but wasn't really entertaining. That female main character can't act, it's so fake. The dancing in the movie was nice. The storyline isn't that good neither, it seemed rushed and really weird. There were a few parts of the movie that is confusing...and the setting of this movie is of a high school...its stupid, the actors CLEARLY look like they're in their 20's. They should have switched that and just make them college/university students. There was also some funny parts that I enjoyed like when Channing (Tyler) was goofing with his friends, and how he acted towards the female. I was a little surprised that there were some serious drama scenes that should not have been included (ex. Tyler's friend's little brother murder scene- really bad to show, made no sense) Overall, I think this movie is pretty decent for people that enjoy dance movies and are fans of Channing Tatum..so Id recommend it"
"khemass","6","0","1","25 April 2009"," It wasn't entertaining
","I didn't enjoy this movie, due to several reasons.<br/><br/>1. The plot is nothing new.Very, very predictable and not interesting.<br/><br/>2. The script and the building of characters are very poor. The characters change from bad to good without any believable reasons. It was like one night he wants to be a bad boy then then the next night he wants to be a good guy. People can change that easily? In reality does it take some more motivation? And how did the two leads fall in love? Why did they fall in love? When did she feel there is something desirable in him? I don't see anything that leads to their romance. It was like, OK, let's fall in love, because the director tells us to.<br/><br/>3. The acting was fine. I think the supporting cast were OK. They did a passing job. And I especially Rachel Griffiths in her role of dance school director. She looks so graceful. I also think Jenna Dewan is believable and natural as Nora. However, I wish I could see more expression on Tyler's face. He has such a dead look even in the scene when he was about to kiss Nora for the first time. There should be a spark in that moment, but there was none. (I don't have anything against him, though, his body was beautiful and his dance skill was fine. He just needs a little improvement on the acting.) <br/><br/>4. The dance scenes were good. I enjoyed them. I can see that they have worked hard to make those scenes look good. BUT there were too few dance scenes in this movie!! This is disappointing for me because I was expecting that at least, if the script is bad, I should be able to enjoy a lot of dance in this film. But why did they make a dance film with so few dances? I just don't understand. Some movies are very boring, such as 'The Company', but the ballet scenes are so incredibly beautiful and there were a lot of them in the film and that was enough to keep me entertained. But this one lacks good story and lacks dance scenes.<br/><br/>Conclusion: I don't know what to enjoy in this film, and I don't really blame the cast."
"stormarm","4","0","1","25 March 2008"," Just another formula ""teen talent"" flick
","It's silly that I have to point out that this review contains a spoiler, as once you know the basic plot and genre, you already know everything that's going to happen in this movie.<br/><br/>But, so as not to be too harsh, it should be said that the dance scenes are quite good, the characters likable, the performances credible, and the team does a good job of keeping you engaged and suspending disbelief if you're willing to let them. So the film is certainly worth renting if you've seen everything else in the store you want to see and are looking for a pleasant-enough mindless diversion for 90 minutes.<br/><br/>My complaint with the movie is that it's a shameless, clueless, formula plot trotted out for us yet again, just with a hodgepodge of plot cliché's that are just as hackneyed as the ""good up-tight girl meets bad cool lost boy"" romance conjoined with ""the big performance which will make or break our heroes, both as people and as a couple"" plot.<br/><br/>The script wasn't as rife with plot cliché's as say, BOOTMEN, but it comes close, and even shares a good dozen with this other lamentable ""dance classic"". Well, at least our heroes in this flick aren't putting on their big ""do-or-die"" finale dance performance to raise money to save the farm/school/mill/town/hospital/youth-center/etc., but only to win an offer from a professional dance troop (and of course the approval/blessing of the disapproving, real-world career-minded mother) for our heroine, and a scholarship to the performing arts high school (and a ticket out of a life of crime in the ""hood"") for our hero. <br/><br/>Gee. Can you feel the suspense? Can you bear to wait to know how it all turns out? This ending is such a shocker that no one should be seated during the last 5 minutes."
"moviewizguy","4","0","1","2 February 2008"," Every second chance begins with a first step.
","The film follows the tale of the disadvantaged Tyler Gage (Channing Tatum) and the privileged modern dancer Nora Clark (Jenna Dewan), who find themselves paired up in a showcase that determines both of their futures. Realizing that they only have one chance, they finally work together.<br/><br/>So, this is one of fifty million other dance movies released a few years ago. But this movie has a twist: there's a new dancing style! If you wonder why people keep making dance movies, there are always new dancing moves from each new dancing movies. People really go to see dancing films to see the dance sequences and not the plot, and I won't blame them for that.<br/><br/>Obviously, the highlight of this film, along with several other dance films, are the dancing sequences. I must say, they're really above average. I would say the score is also very good. Now for the plot, you are right if you think it's predictable and clichéd.<br/><br/>Other than that, there's no reason to see or not to see this film. If you want to, go. If not, don't go. You won't gain or lose anything from it. I say, if you watch this movie for the dance, watch it. If you watch this movie for the plot, you'll be disappointed."
"MLDinTN","6","0","2","28 May 2007"," unoriginal story, good dancing
","This movie was OK. The music and dancing were pretty good. But the story was nothing new. I did like the 2 lead actors. They helped to make the film entertaining enough to watch. Both were hot. And I think Channing Tatum should be the next break out hot star. The final dance routine that combined ballot and hip hop was one of the better dances I've seen in a film. Tyler's friends were a little annoying since they kept trying to get him in trouble and acted like he was putting them off by trying to learn a dance routine. It took Mac's little brother dying for him to see living a life of a delinquent was no way to be. Very predictable. Also, the school's principle had to be about the most predictable character I've ever seen in a film.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: If you like hip hop and dancing, then you will find this entertaining enough to watch. Otherwise, skip it."

","Agree totally w/Trippin Ziggy, great movie if you love dance and can get past the cheese factor. The obligatory final dance is well choreographed, efforts to conceal male lead's dance double aren't too obvious (ie having her look out window at him dancing...v. clever), and T-Zig is right, her outfits are adorably quirky. Wish I had her wardrobe and her pirouette...enjoy this movie every time they make it!<br/><br/>Seriously, it would be nice if someone made a realistic movie about small-company/gypsy dancers...something neither as self-consciously arty as The Company nor as formulaic as Step Up, Save the Last Dance, etc. etc. Maybe I'm looking for a documentary or something close to it. Would also nice to understand better the life-after-dance of those who have done it successfully...the teachers, coaches, and so on. There's an entire cable channel called Classic Sports...other than replays, it's interviews with ex-players. Where is Classic Arts?"
"pswanson00","5","0","1","13 April 2007"," enjoyable crap
","For anyone who's ever seen a movie, there are no surprises in this film. Everything about it is predictable, including the death of one of the protagonist's friends. The plot is as thin as Kleenex, but the dancing IS quite good. I'm at least 3 times the age of the target demographic for this film, and -- surprise to me -- I actually liked the music! The big obstacle to my enjoyment of the non-dancing part of the film was the central character. For the first half of the movie I thought he was a reprehensible, thieving, moron who should be shot on sight, saving the state in which he lived the trouble of executing him later. By the end he had improved in my eyes slightly, but not much. Through the entire film I was hoping he'd eventually appear in some pants which actually fit him, and ditch the bleeping backwards ballcap while dancing. This is an idiotic youth film which happens to employ some good dancers. I was deeply surprised to see Rachel Griffiths in this film, as her work with which I'm familiar is much edgier, has much more of an independent energy. This is decent entertainment if you love dance, but at the bottom of my personal list of dance movies."

"Robert_Hearth","7","0","1","10 March 2007"," ""Do I Look Like I Own Tights?"" --- Tyler Gage (Channing Tatum)
","""Step Up"" (2006) <br/><br/>Directed By: Anne Fletcher <br/><br/>Starring: Channing Tatum, Jenna Dewan, Mario, Damaine Radcliff, Drew Sidora, Rachel Griffiths, De'Shawn Washington, & Josh Henderson <br/><br/>MPAA Rating: ""PG-13"" (for thematic elements, brief violence and innuendo) <br/><br/>Dance movies have been running rampant in Hollywood latelyand most of them have been horrible. Critics almost always pan them and, despite the usual strong audience turnout, many audience members leave feeling disappointed. One of the very few dance movies that revolutionized the genre was ""Take the Lead"" and, despite still not winning many critics' hearts, it connected with audiences. It grasped a much deeper of the understanding genre than its shallow cousins and sported top-notch performances with impeccable dance sequences. ""Step Up"" is more of a romantic drama than a dance movie, though I suppose dance is a huge part of the movie thus sealing it into its genre. It falls for most of the clichés and stereotypes to which other teen romances succumb, but its lively and energetic dance moves coupled with electric chemistry between the two leads and solid supporting performances make ""Step Up"" a step above the norm.<br/><br/>You've heard this plot beforeor, at least, something very similar. ""Step Up"" tells the story of two teens, both from two very different worlds, who meet and fall in love. The first is Tyler Gage (Tatum). He is the ""bad boy with a heart"" who is, ultimately, just misunderstood. The other is Nora Clark (Dewan), a wealthy dance student preparing for her senior showcase. When Tyler and two of his friends wreck the stage at a prestigious art school and Tyler is caught, he is forced to do community service. His service: he must work as a janitor at the school. He happens upon Nora whose partner has just been injured. She needs someone to take his place if she wants to get a position at a dance company after graduation. The two meet, sparks fly, the status quo is thrown off balance, and the two prepare for the ultimate dance routine. Does this sound familiar? Delete the dancing and you have countless other romantic dramas. But, that is the key to improving a clichéd plot: adding something new (i.e. the dance aspect).<br/><br/>""Step Up"" actually has good performances. Channing Tatum is a good actor but, I'll be perfectly honest, his performance here is mixedhowever the guy has shown his talent with other projects (namely ""A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints"", in which he gave a caustic, gritty performance). This just isn't his best work, but don't give me wrong. His performance serves its purpose. Jenna Dewan, on the other hand, aces her role. She worked very well. Not surprisingly, the two leads work best when they are together. They have amazing chemistry and their dance sequences are spectacular. For his first role in a major motion picture, Mario does fine. There isn't much substance with his character, but he handles it relatively well. Drew Sidora starred in ""White Chicks""but I can forgive and forget. Can you? If so, then you will probably see that she does manage to give a nice performance here. My only question is: can she really sing that well? She sounded awesome.<br/><br/>When ""Step Up"" ended, I realized that, despite all of the clichés, I had had a blast. The movie is, if nothing else, an entertaining film. It is anything but flawless, however. It is cliché-ridden and there really isn't enough dancing. With such amazing choreography, more dance sequences would have been greatly appreciated. I was also a little disappointed with how Nora's first boyfriend, Brett (Henderson), was handled. Instead of making him seem like a realistic character that would have provided more conflict for Nora, they merely took the easy route and made him into a complete jerkthe same was true with Lucy's (Sidora) first boyfriend. But, like I said, I had funas did the audience with which I watched it. Everyone seemed to enjoy it and, ultimately, that is the reason why movies exist. If movies fail to entertain, then really what is the point? ""Step Up"" may not be the most original film to date, but it is too much fun to ignore.<br/><br/>Final Thought: ""Step Up"" is pure entertainment, nothing more or less.<br/><br/>Overall Rating: 7/10 (B+)"

","As a dancer myself I can enjoy a well choreographed dance sequence, however, I think that was the only thing from this movie that I enjoyed. Step Up was entirely predictable and the acting was mediocre. I got somewhat bored throughout its entirety, and although the end sequence was decently done it was nothing spectacular. The romantic storyline isn't very compelling, and I never felt that any of the characters were particularly deep. The plot in and of itself is stereotypical, played out by individuals who's dancing definitely beats out their acting. This movie feels like a cheesy version of Save the Last Dance to me, and if that isn't your cup of tea, I wouldn't even bother watching Step Up. If you're still curious, it isn't entirely painful to watch, but I personally wouldn't say its worth the money of renting."

She is a serious student with a structured home life, with life goals,he is a screw up who lives in a foster home and 'borrows' cars for joy rides along with his foster brothers. His goal is to wake up out of jail tomorrow.<br/><br/>Channing Tatum (an accomplished athlete in high school) is Tyler Gage, and one night an opportunity via a broken window gets him and his buddies into a school auditorium, where they proceed to goof off and do lots of damage. Security manages to capture Tyler, who is then given (lucky for the plot of the movie) 200 hours community service as a janitor at the school of arts.<br/><br/>Pretty Jenna Dewan, a dancer, is Nora Clark, dancing student at the school. She is preparing for an end of year show, and hopes to get a dancing contract, but her partner is injured. She auditions every able bodied boy at her school, but none of them are any good. Tyler steps up, offers to help, Nora is surprised to see he has potential.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie involves encouragement, then discouragement, miscommunication, anger, breaking of commitment, re-commitment, all the types of things to move the plot along. So as we watch, we wonder, ""Will Nora and Tyler end up together?"" Most of us can guess.<br/><br/>The lead actors are good, and nice to watch.

She demands he show her that he's worth the spot.<br/><br/>A tale of achieving your ambitions, of change that one person can go through with the help of another, of trust, romance and above all: Dance!

However, some of my friends urged me to watch it with them. I must admit I had quite a negative paradigm about ""Step Up"" and recently watching Channing Tatum's stiff acting in ""She's the Man"" didn't exactly have me too enthusiastic about it! After the hour and a half that I sat through it, my view did a 180 and all I could say was ""Bravo!"" The dancing routines are superb, the direction is pretty good, so is the choreography not to mention the unbelievably believable chemistry between Jenna Dewan and Channing Tatum. I see people criticizing the acting in this movie, but I think its much better than most, maybe not the best they could come up with, but its pretty good. Channing Tatum does a much better job in ""Step Up"" than he ever did in any of his scenes in ""She's The Man"" He brought the role of Tyler Gage to life and boy, can that guy dance!

"rstef1","5","0","1","27 December 2006"," Step Off
","What dance related movies does this film not rip-off? Basically, it's an amalgam of Cutting Edge, Flashdance, Fame, Dirty Dancing, and others, with a sprinkling of Boyz N the Hood dusted on for street cred. There is not one single cliché overlooked, not one trite situation unused in this flick. Channing Tatum seems a likable lead actor and can dance, but he can't carry the weight of this awful script on his looks and charm alone. After the first twenty minutes of the film I knew the following:<br/><br/>1. Nora's original partner for the dance showcase will, conveniently, be unable to dance with her; 2. Tyler and Nora (played by non-actress Jenna Dewan), will triumph at the showcase; 3. Something BAD is going to happen to Skinny; 4. Supporting characters Miles and Lucy will end up together (with no believable explanation as to why); and, 5. Tyler will overcome all obstacles, while retaining his friendship with pal Mac, and help everyone else live happily ever after (except poor Skinny of course).<br/><br/>Tyler's transformation from street punk to art school dance savant is wholly unbelievable and really ridiculous. Making it more ridiculous is the school's director ever allowing him to dance with one of the students after he broke in and trashed the school. And why would the director be willing to offer him a scholarship when she clearly points out that his vandalism robbed another student of a scholarship??? Also, I'm no judge, but would Tyler really be assigned to do his community work at the place he broke into and smashed up? That just seems stupid. Finally, I had to shake my head in amazement at the ending where, a few days after seeing his younger brother killed, Mac is able to laugh and rejoice with Tyler over his dancing at an art school for which Mac has previously shown nothing but contempt.<br/><br/>If you can get past the trite and far-fetched situations that swamp this picture, there are some good dance numbers and catchy tunes well staged by choreographer/director Anne Fletcher. Channing Tatum may have a career if he stays far away from more films like this."

","Look, I think this movie is great.. I don't care what other viewers think.. I really like it... The movie is really great for those people who's passion is dancing... The dance moves Tatum and Dawson demonstrated were great.. It's a great story about romance,dancing,friendship and reaching out for your goals... In that movie you can learn that it doesn't matter where or what level you can be able to reach your goal if you are willing to fight for it. It doesn't matter if your a like Tyler or Nora as long as you're willing to fight for something that you want... That movie tells you that it's your dream,It's what you want, so, go, and fight for it... If you want it you have to be willing to fight for it, no matter what it takes.. This movie teaches a lot..... It should be rated 10...It's great and no one could change my mind about it"

","Tjis year I saw 2 dance movies: ""Take the Lead"" and ""Step Up"". ""Take the lead"" was boring. Plot was very outstretched. But ""Step Up"" was full of action and romantic. Dance and Hip-Hop rhythm makes this movie idiosyncratic.<br/><br/>Channing Tatum shows us he's acting in ""She's the Man"" and I was exited to see that movie. In this movie Channing Tatum act not that good as in ""She's the Man"", but he has some good dance moves. Jenna Dewan had horrible character in ""Tamara"" movie. This movie makes her to back in good way of acting. The both are great actors and they will be better in the future...<br/><br/>Soundtrack was stylish. Even Ciara with her ""Get Up"" song had perfect return to music business.<br/><br/>Anne Fletcher had a good debut like Director. So this movie worth a 8 rating, because it's sexy, romantic and stylish"

","this movie was quite good and entertaining but i was quite disappointed.<br/><br/>this movies plot was kinda weak. I didn't like the idea and i thought that some parts of the movie were not needed. Channing tatum and jenna were good as there characters but they annoyed me. especially jenna she just kinda made me annoyed and channing was like to much of a wannabe street boy and you could tell he was acting that part and trying very hard. The dancing was very good though and that part i enjoyed.<br/><br/>i wouldn't rave about this movie but i could watch it again and again just a bit disappointed weather is was over hyped or it just didn't meet my standards."

I saw it with one of my friends and we both liked it so much that we dressed up ghetto and acted out some of the scenes. I thought that Alyson stoner needed some more lines because she's pretty good at both acting and dancing. I liked it when Camille and Tyler get a little closer as a family. I'm a big lover of sad movies and there are some sad parts in the film. There is a shocking loss towards the middle of the film.

Especially Channing Tatum, I mean I already loved him before this movie, but this just put the icing on the cake. The relationship between Jenna and Channing on screen might leave something to be desired, but the dancing sequences more then make up for it. If you don't want to just have a good time with friends and groove to a movie then don't watch it. But if ya like to have a good time and hang out with ya buds, this is a pretty good flick to watch.

"hokienmun","7","0","1","28 November 2006"," Dance fusion brought to a new level
","Wearing the hat of a dance enthusiast, I find the fusion of freestyle street dance and traditional ballet moves spectacular and refreshing. I'm inspired already to get out there and jiggle! Fresh-faced Channing Tatum was fantastic in his dance routines though I feel he's not quite ready to play a bad boy. <br/><br/>Story wise, it's rather predictable and stereotyped. Downtown bad boy meets uptown good girl, both fall in love, and both have the dance of their life in the finale. Jenna Dewan was unconvincing in her role. She was saved by Channing who stole the show. The sidekicks failed to shine either. At times, they were redundant and annoying. <br/><br/>Still, go and watch it just for dance sake!"

"DICK STEEL","8","0","1","6 November 2006"," A Nutshell Review: Step Up
","I think I'm fast becoming a fan of the dance genre. The moves and the music just gets to me, be it Mad Hot Ballroom styled documentaries, or street hip hop, or a fusion of both, like in the recent Take The Lead. Step Up is one such movie, full of youthful energy that makes you want to stand up and do a jig or two.<br/><br/>The storyline though is nothing to shout about. It stuck to formula with leads that don't get along, and yet fitting like a glove as they heat up both the dance floor as well as one another's hearts. It's your usual bad-boy-good-girl pairing, with inspiration rubbing off each other, and the usual white-trash and upper strata of society mix and exploration of differences, or maybe perhaps, some similarities. Like its dance moves, the story's a fusion of improvisation and structure, so despite the tinge of familiarity, you'll probably forgive it as it allows you to do a quantum leap to get headlong into the scheme of things.<br/><br/>But what struck me is how similar this movie's structure and lead character are to Eminem's 8 Mile, with the same mould of a ""white rabbit"" boy, from the underclass, trying to triumph against odds that he faces in his quest to do something worthwhile with his life. Replace 8 Mile's freestyle rapping with street hip hop dance, and you get Channing Tatum's Tyler Gage, the dude from the hood with hardcore dance attitude yo!<br/><br/>This bro I can tell is gonna heat up the screens for the ladies in da house. You can hear silent female sighs each time he comes on to do his thing. If you find him familiar, yep, he was playing opposite Amanda Byrnes in She's The Man as the captain of the football team. Step Up's other lead is Jenna Dewan as the rich girl Nora Clark pursuing a dance career, and has to come up with some slick choreographed moves for her final year project to gain the attention of scouts from the industry. No prizes if you think you know who she has to turn to for help. There are various supporting characters, but I'd like to highlight R&B singer Mario's stint as a music producer-student who has this knack of rocking da house from tunes spun from his macbook (yep, product placement).<br/><br/>But before you dismiss this as yet another run of the mill dance movie, it's actually both adequately entertaining, and fused with a right amount of drama, for character development purposes. Pursuing of dreams, of living up to promises made, of being there for friends, these are but some of the tired but tested sub plots that make its usual rounds in the movie.<br/><br/>As always, you never really get to see the entire dance sequence during rehearsals, until the finale where it's full-dress-show-off time. And director Anne Fletcher, who choreographed moves for plenty of movies, pulls this one off brilliantly. It was well worth the wait, even if it all ended in a saccharine sweet manner."

","Step up - now i am not usually one to go see 'chick flicks' but my friend begged me to go and i was quite surprised... it had a good plot. the actors filled the characters nicely. GREAT dancing and good music. the only thing i did not like was the kid brother getting shot, i mean it was so predictable it happens in all the movies.also maybe they should of gone in to the main characters backgrounds a bit like showing us why Tyler was in foster care and why he hated his foster dad so much. Nora's mother not quite agreeing was predictable as well. maybe they should of been a bit more original. But i must say this movie was very enjoyable and i will be buying it on DVD when it comes out.

"inkblot11","7","0","1","16 October 2006"," A familiar story but a welcome one just the same
","Nora (Jenna Dewan) is an aspiring dancer at the Maryland School for the Arts. She is dismayed when her partner is injured, as it comes just weeks before a recital that is a stepping stone to an offer from a dance company. She needs a new partner to help her rehearse and she starts looking. Tyler, on the other hand, is a teenage foster child in a rough section of Baltimore. Although his foster mother tries hard, his foster father is a no-good loafer who doesn't give the children under his roof the time of day. He just wants a paycheck. One day, Ty and a couple of friends go inside the MSA to retrieve a ball and end up trashing the place. Tyler is sentenced to serve as a janitor at the art school for his community service. Oh, and by the way, Tyler is a talented hip hop dancer. You can probably guess what's coming. Tyler observes beautiful Nora and becomes aware of her dilemma. His solution? Choose me as your dance partner, dear Nora. It happens and it changes both of their lives. This sweet movie, with a rougher undertone, has that ages old story of unlikely and star-crossed lovers. Nora is from a world of privilege and Tyler is from the world of the have-nots. Yet, given a bit of time and effort, they find they need each other and can benefit greatly from the contact. Dewan is very lovely and a terrific dancer while the actor playing Tyler is talented and attractive. The script is a winner and so are the costumes and settings. It would be wonderful if inner city children everywhere could be given a showing of the movie. Tyler's life is truly changed by his exposure to the world outside his neighborhood. Nora, too, gains respect for those less fortunate than herself. Don't hesitate to let teens, or anyone who wants to see the film, get their chance. It is a great character building movie with a special sparkle and beauty."

","""Step Up"" is not really a movie you watch for the story. It's totally predictable and definitely you've seen all these scenes and situations in many other movies before. It is not even about the actors (I did not know any names of the leads, nor do I recall them right now). It is something you watch because of the great dance sequences. I especially enjoyed watching 2 scenes: the romantically shot dance sequence on the rooftop, bathed in afternoon sunlight; and that climactic dance sequence in the ""showdown"", very well choreographed and executed. There was a scene with the male lead danced with his foster siblings, which I found charming. The hiphop soundtrack is also very good. That song in the final credits ""Get Up"" by Ciara is very infectious, I'm having last song syndrome up to now."

","OK, so, I thought this movie was awesome. It was worth it just for the fantastic dance scene at the beginning, and the one at the end. Themusic was great, too. <br/><br/>The plot was the perfect lame plot, the one that is so bad it's good. It was ridiculously predictable, like the writers went up to someone on the street with the premise, asked them what they thought would happen, then wrote that. <br/><br/>But the lines are delivered perfectly for that kind of movie - if this was the first chick flick you ever saw, and you'd never read a romantic book, you would think this was a really awesome movie. And it's only boring to people who have ADHD or something, because something is always going on: it's a movie. There are a few longer-than-they-should-be montages, but I wouldn't call them boring, just annoying. And realistic? No, way, way no. Past unrealistic. But who wants to go to the movies for realism?"

It teaches you that no matter what background you come from, Poor, Average of Rich if you fight for what you want or believe you will come out on top, and that you just quit things when It gets tough. It has an awesome start an awesome middle and the best ever ending. Even tho the ending is a bit predictable you will still love it. It has everything a movie needs, sadness, suspensions, happiness and some (but only a little bit) of down right predictable moments!

I really enjoyed the dancing although the acting was patchy at times. there are certainly a lot of clichés in this movie but Step Up does combine likable character, cool dance moves and an infectious rhythm. Channing Tatum (Tyler) also stared in She's the Man, but this movie really showed he had some talent in dancing. He stars alongside Jenna Dewan (Nora) and they definitely work well together. I recommend this to people over 13 yrs old and its the sort of movie that makes you want to start dance classes!"

","Nothing special. Average dancing movie where unexperienced ""male hero"" gets to dance with ""female hero"" and they fall in love. Can't be that easy, because movie needs to hold people in cinemas for at least hour and half, so there are some side stories involving friends and parents of our ""hero's"" and some problems getting to the finish line, but nothing special as well. And, happy end of course. Movies like this one were here before, and will be again for sure, because some people just won't learn.

And their portrayal of an arts school was stereotypical, or rather, what you always see in movies and not often in real life. But I really enjoyed the dancing, especially the beginning sequence with the juxtaposition between ballet and hip hop. As I love to dance, I really enjoy watching dance movies.

This movie is very predictable, but most movies are these days. Personally the energy and the romance is what brings this movie to my favorite! I feel that this movie is kind of the same as Take The Lead. Save The Last Dance. Honey. But at the same time, it is original in its own way because of the other conflicts that come up throughout the movie. Even though some people may think it is a lame movie and totally set up, I still find it original and something easy to watch. It's not only a chick movie, thats for sure. Anyone can watch it, even teen guys. So if you haven't seen this movie, I definitely recommend watching it because it is a way of escaping and getting interested in the characters and what goes on in the movie."

","This movie is not at all as it may seem. This is not a Dirty Dancing 5, nor is it a Save the Last Dance 2. It is very well balanced, Not too cheesy, not too cliché, and the dancing is very inspiring. The movie could also be seen as a good eye-opener. It dismisses clichés about today's society through its plot; not all students at fancy art-schools are rich brats, less fortunate young men are not a lost cause, dancing is a form of art, not just having fun, etc. Both lead characters are great actors as well as dancers; I'm sure we'll be seeing much more of Channing in the future. Step Up is a feel-good movie not just for girls, because as the movie shows, guys can dance too."

"jaddison383","7","0","2","4 September 2006"," Exciting, Charming, and Insightful
","Perhaps all that can be said against Anne Flecther's Step Up, is that it left you wishing you could watch it more- and as we all know, that is what a movie sets out to do. From it's exciting beginning to it's edge-of-your-seat anxious ending, this movie ruled. It provided a deeper sort of story than Hollywood generally is brave enough to do, yet still made it easy for teens to watch and enjoy. The dancing was beautiful and exciting, the drama felt real, and the side stories were insightful and charming. I adored all of the side stories. The little tales of the main girls best friends getting together, to the Principal and Tyler's fight to accept one another, to the tragic story of his young friend's tragedy- all these things only made the movie better and more interesting. The only thing that really could have been done better were those side stories- they could have gone into a bit more detail. That would have made all the difference. They chose to stick more to the main story, though, and the movie was still entertaining and certainly enjoyable. See it. It's a lot of fun! 7/10 stars!<br/><br/>Jay Addison"

It also teaches you to know when to enough is enough, meaning, do not keep making the same mistakes. To know when it is time to change and move on to good and better things. I thought this movie was also very entertaining. The dancing was awesome. I, myself love to dance, especially if it is a choreographed dance or not. It was actually the dancing of this movie that caught my attention. But, like I said, it is more than just dancing. So watch it and you can find out for yourself. =)"

","I will agree with some of the complaints I've seen about the acting in the movie. But, although the acting wasn't top notch I will say that the movie had an incredible moral lesson/theme if you will--about different 'worlds' coming together and how the view issues in life so differently. It also spends a lot of time on understanding differences in daily life and issues between both 'worlds.' In addition this movie dealt with our need to be true to those we love around us as well as the importance of being true to ourselves. It teaches about choices and accountability for your action. I highly recommend seeing it! Oh, and the dancing was phenomenal. I myself tend to be inspired by the dedication and determination of those who put themselves out on display-- and the dancers performing in the movie were so inspiring and the story line so moving that I have seen it twice in the theaters already."

","I thought this was such a good movie!!! I have seen it twice, but both times I thoroughly enjoyed it. Although it didn't have a super-deep plot, I liked the dancing and the leads. It was obviously better the first time, but I just had such a great time going to see it. I think adults and kids alike would enjoy this movie, so I am realllly glad that I saw it! I also like it because I dance, so seeing it up on the screen really got me into the movie. It was very entertaining and the acting was awesome. The only thing is that Channing Tatum has the tendency to not show emotion. But everything else was pretty good, so I would definitely recommend this movie to someone. Also, Channing Tatum was HOT!"

","I really enjoyed the movie Step up. The previews did remind me of ""save the last dance"" and maybe ""flash dance"". I found the movie much better then those old movies. It was a feel good movie about doing what you Love. Also about having a Passion in life for something. I know a lot of adults that do not have a drive and motivation almost like the character at the beginning of the movie, but at the end He had found his motivation and was moving forward in his life. Channing Tatum has a tough upbringing in comparison to Jenna nice school and nice family home. They come together to embrace each other and show one another about life. Someone with no goals shows another how important it is to have goals and dreams. That is important for kids and teens growing up today. I was once a kid and I knew how to have dreams and aspirations. I love a good dance movie maybe because it involves doing what you love and Feeling Awesome about it.. I love the choreography in the movie. The ballet and street dancing was amazing. Great story. It may seem like all the others but it was original with itself. Yes, i am a dancer too :)"

This movie was so inspirational, I am a dancer, and I encourage all dancers to see this movie, it really helps you follow your dreams! The dancing in this movie is incredible, it also contains very catchy and entertaining music! This was seriously the best movie I have ever seen. There was a lot of drama in this movie, with just the right amount of comedy, entertainment, sympathy and fascination! It was such a catchy movie, I found myself wiggling around in my seat, it really makes you want to get up and dance!

"mcatcomp","8","0","3","24 August 2006"," The critics are idiots
","I've read quite a few reviews on this movie and I really don't understand why Step Up is getting such bad reviews. First of all, you don't go to a dance movie to see Oscar-worthy acting. Chances are, you want to see some dancing and Step Up blows away most dance movies out there. What Miss Fletcher did, contrary to other dance movies out there, was take dancers and make them act - not the other way around. I would rather see poor acting in a dance movie than poor dancing. The chemistry between the characters was believable, the cinematography was brilliant; there was some humor, some drama and most importantly, a good overall message for younger viewers. You can tell by watching that the actors had fun making this movie and because of that, it was fun to watch. Having said that, I would bring my son to see this movie in a heartbeat. I wouldn't have to cover his ears or his eyes - and nowadays - that's saying a lot. Its a good, wholesome movie and you'll be groovin' in your chair during the dance scenes. Its a shame that today's society gives Oscars to movies that have gay sex scenes and proclaim it a ""must-see movie"" but rip apart the decent ones and tell you not to waste your money on a movie like Step Up. I don't get it. Go see Step Up - I believe you and your family will enjoy it. Miss Fletcher is a class act and I can't wait to see her future movies. Hey Joel Siegel - I don't know what you're smokin' buddy - this movie gets 2 thumbs way up, baby."

I normally don't watch movies that are like this but when I saw it was about dance I just knew I had to watch it. Especially since it has Channing in it I knew I would love it. Also with Jenna Dewan in it I knew it was a major must see! Plus with the fact that Mario is in it is a good thing. I have liked Mario since Destination Fame in 2004. He is an amazing actor and singer. Also since Glory Road I knew I had to see every movie with Damaine Radcliff in it. He is also an amazing actor but he isn't better than Channing.

"savage_wordz","8","0","3","20 August 2006"," A Pretty Good Movie
","The first thing you need to do when going to see this movie is put all of the critics' views out of your mind. You must have an open mind when watching this movie to decide for yourself how good it is. I myself have seen this movie twice and plan on seeing it a few more times. Why do you ask? I think it's entertaining.<br/><br/>The story is really a mix of Fame and Dirty Dancing. Rich girl meets bad boy. Only this time its the rich girl who needs the bad boy's help. It has great dance sequences in it as well as a great soundtrack. The chemistry between the two leads is very good and they work well together on the screen. <br/><br/>I've seen and heard people knocking Channing Tatum's ability to act and what they fail to realize is that he's playing his character to the fullest. It is Taylor, character, who seems to be brooding throughout the film. His character is a guy who thinks the world is a place where you don't dream or want for fear of never getting it. I think its more of the character wasn't written to the fullest, and no knock on Channing's part. There were other characters that could have been written a bit deeper. <br/><br/>Overall I think this is a good movie for those who like Dirty Dancing, Fame, Footloose and movies of those sorts."

","As a student studding film i know I'm not supposed to like these kinds of movies, but i thought Step Up was amazing. I watched many of my friends dance when i was little but i never had the moves, and still don't....so seeing something so hard look so easy was such a feel-good thing. The movie is mostly happy and cheery, minus the part where macs brother gets killed, but otherwise it would be a great movie to torture your boyfriend with. The first kiss is a little stiff, but the chemistry brought on the dance floor between the dancers is wonderful. I strongly suggest this to anyone who has chased a dream or is chasing one. The sound-mixing for this film was also very well done. I'm not a fan of hip-hop but i had to get the soundtrack, and it has become one of my favorites. Enjoy this wonderful movie!"

","As a dance lover, I knew I had to see this movie. I knew nothing of the lead actress going in, but was shocked to see someone who could hold their own in the role. Channing was an amazingly good dancer. As for the white-bread comments on here, having gone to an art school, its great to see a true representation of one. There are all different types of people that attend those, from the rich to the very poor, and all just want to be the best artist and person that they can be. Otherwise, they would not spend an average of ten hours more a week in school than the regular student. Bottomline is Jenna and Channing delivered entertaining dance moves throughout, and it was set to high energy feel good music. The characterization of ""Skinny"" was great, and brought the whole movie together. When I left the theater, I turned my radio up loud and car danced all the way home. It is what it is, and that's a good time."
"DanceDiva2004","7","0","2","20 August 2006"," Step Up---A Dancer's review
","I have been a dancer for almost 20 years of my young life. Ballet and Lyrical are my main studies, but I can dance Hip Hop as well. When I first heard about Step Up I knew I was going to be in for some great dancing and most likely bad acting. The female star Jenna Dewan, is one of the most technically clean and polished dancers I've seen in a film in a long time. I hated Jessica Alba in Honey. Anyways.... When Jenna was in Take The Lead a few months back, she captivated me with her ""sexy Tango"" in the final scene. I hadn't really known about her until then, but I knew that she was going to take her career to a new level if she could move like that and sell some movie tickets. I think this movie itself is just OK. The plot as well as the acting is somewhat boring and definitely jumps all over the place. However, I felt that every dance scene was very connectable with the audience....especially if you can relate to dance classes, and routines, etc. The final performance had me in awe. The Choreographer did an amazing job of creating this routine. Channing Tatum, who is just unbelievably hot, does an average job and comes through with his performance at the end. Overall....I'd give this movie a B-."
"StoneyGirl","8","0","2","20 August 2006"," Step Up Steps It Up More Than A Notch
","As with any dance movie, there is a little bit of the dream element happening. The story inevitably involves some sort of rags-to-riches aspect, hopefully at least one spicy character, and the music and moves to back the threat. Step Up has it all, and also showcases enormously palpable chemistry between the two lead characters. The movie not only oozes sex appeal, but sends the viewer to a universe where the music is funky and edgy, the characters all represent in some way and rescue each other, and one can truly step up to a level of self-actualization. It's the kind of place this viewer would like to escape to every once in a while, and tear up the dance floor the way the characters in the movie do, with the same style, passion and aplomb. If dance movies are your thing, you won't want to miss this one. And if they're not, you might just feel a spark through your veins this time around."
"craigdillon","6","0","2","19 August 2006"," entertaining movie
","The movie is clichÃ© and predictable. But most musicals are. That actually is part of their charm. Would you really want a musical that ends like a Shakespeare tragedy? Except for West Side Story that is. This movie has the dance worlds of Hip Hop and ballet colliding. Channing Tyler dancing was great, ever bit as good as Jenna Dewan's. More could have been done with this movie. The characters of Skinny and Camille were very well written, well played, and left me wanting to see more of them. The movie could have focused on more interesting parts of this collision of cultures. However, when looking at a song and dance movie, you must look at the songs and dances. Personally, I do not like Rap, but the music was rhythmically rich with great texture. The dancing and choreography was excellent. I enjoyed it very much. The group dance scene at the club reminded me of the group dance scene at the hop in West Side Story. It is not a classic. For the dancing and music, though, I recommend it.<br/><br/>One more thing. I think Channing Tyler will have a great future."

I did find the subject matter similar to 'Center Stage' and the plot line of 'Save the Last Dance'. Personally, I preferred 'Step Up' to 'Save the Last Dance'. I found the latter offensive and downright annoying at times. Anyway, I agree that the acting was not the most impressive part. Yet, I found I was able to overlook that lacking aspect of the film. Over all, I found it very cute. Finally, I really enjoyed watching Channing Tatum as well because he is very, very HOT."
"calmly_insane","6","0","1","18 August 2006"," Decent and Expected
","This movie is not a terrible movie, quite a contrary statement to many reviews bestowed upon the film. The movie's premise is simple enough: a young man has been charged with a misdemeanor and must complete 200 hours community service at the scene of the crime.<br/><br/>The scene, which sets the setting for most of the film, is the Maryland School of Arts, a prestigious school in which only the most gifted students may attend. It is during the community service that our protagonist, Tyler Gage (Tatum), meets the obligatory cute dance student, Nora Clark (Dewan), who is from a different world entirely.<br/><br/>The film has many honest, touching moments. The first meeting, the flirts, the dancing scenes in the clubs and the studio. The Director of Photography did a great job of showing the immense contrast of the two worlds, and the striking similarity of the inhabitants. The plot advances rather well, with it's conflict along the way. The score was excellently chosen, and used very well in the many dancing and emotional scenes.<br/><br/>The film is not without its gross negatives however. Acting is the first problem. Both Tatum and Dewan, while giving decent performances, have almost zero chemistry on screen, and this is noticeable throughout the film. The two leads' friends are a little stronger on the acting side, with Damaine Radcliff (Mac) possibly being the strongest. There were many moments that were mere plastic and filler, moments where any simpleton can tell the actors are bored, or frustrated, with the inept writing they've been given. The script, half the time, seems like a re-written ""Save The Last Dance"", which on that note brings me to my last complaint: many, many shots in this movie almost seem to photocopy other teen-angst dramas. The basketball court, the housing, the attitude, all is not unlike the mentioned dance movie.<br/><br/>The ending is predictable, as is most of the movie, but not so much that it's disappointing or frustrating. It deserves a giggle and a little pat on the back for recognizing trends, but nothing more.<br/><br/>The film is presented as a ""defining film of this generation"". A little much for weak acting and scripts, but this film will suffice for a dry week at the video store. It's decent in every way, and expected in every way, being the movie we all know it's going to be."

It was filled with just the right amount of drama, comedy, & romance. There was a little bit of scary in there, but overall I thought it was great. People say the acting wasn't very good, but what do you expect from people who are dancers?? I mean they're used to acting without words, & I'd rather have people that can dance and not act very well, than have people who act awesome & can't dance. But even I thought the acting was good. I didn't notice anything that could've been changed. I don't know what people were thinking when they posted these horrible comments. The movie isn't just for dancers or teenage girls, I saw 3 elderly woman who came together to watch it, & a grown male adult who came by himself. The dancing was absolutely amazing!!! I loved it!

That just doesn't make a good first impression! :d Afterwards I didn't regret my choice to stay because I seriously liked the movie. Maybe it was a bit predictable, but the story was good.

More of a chick flick, this movie may be entertaining for male dancers as well. This is a definite summer must-see. The storyline is simple yet effective and two young, budding actors, Jenna Dewan and of course, Channing Tatum, do an excellent job stepping into their roles as the main characters higher-class Nora and troublemaker Tyler. You can feel the chemistry and the talent these actors have make the movie THAT much more enjoyable. The music is very suitable for the story and a very good family movie.

","A lot of people seem to think this movie isn't worth seeing. Hopefully, you'll go see it anyway. I've never been one to listen to others opinions before seeing a movie, and often the most hated are actually the best. <br/><br/>I didn't see Step Up because of hot men in tights (or baggy jeans) or because of the girls in leotards. I went because I love dance. And music. And movies. And let me say that I was not disappointed at all. <br/><br/>There were times when the acting could have been improved, yes, but it was far from horrible. The story and the characters where all realistic. I thought it would be the same old story. You know, guy meets girl. Guy helps girl. Guy falls in love with girl. They fight, they get back together just in time for an amazing dance routine. And, in fact, that was a lot of it. But there were twists and turns and in all the movie was over and beyond that. <br/><br/>Instead of one basic plot filled with the usual teen angst, there were several mini plots all woven together. Lucy and Miles, Mac and Skinny, Nora and Tyler. That kept the movie interesting. <br/><br/>Let's get to the dancing. And the music. The movie opens up with dance. Its a constant split from ballet to street dancing/hip hop and back, all to great music. Contrary to popular belief, you can put ballet to hip hop and it looks amazing. The dancing caught me in the beginning, the middle, the end. The club scene was funny and entertaining, I loved it! And the end senior piece was amazing! OK...the choreography just plain rocks. I'm used to seeing ballet mixed with Latin dances, ballroom, jazz...any number of things...but I've always been addicted to the mix and match of ballet and hip hop. There's something about the structure of ballet mixed with the flow of hip hop that just makes you want to move! I wish i could move the way the dancers in the movie did, and I think that you will as well.<br/><br/>now i just can't wait until it comes out on video. I'll buy it.

","I went to see 'Step Up' expecting the typical storyline of boy meets girl, boy and girl dance, boy and girl end up together. Well, I wasn't disappointed on that part. However the way that this storyline was done, was original. At the recital I honestly thought she was going to let him walk away. (Thank god she called him back at the last second). The friends add depth to the characters, ""You are defined by the people you place around you."" And Channing's character isn't quite the stereotypical 'bad boy'. He's someone who's stopped caring about everything worth caring about...yet he still finds time to be a pretty awesome older brother to his two foster-siblings. Jenna's character is a bit of a princess but when you've worked your whole life for something, and one single moment is going to define the rest of your life, you'd be pretty tense and snobbish too. If you listened closely you would have heard some pretty funny lines, example: Tyler (about Skinny) ""Naw, he's Ellen."" Mac (laughs) ""Ellen gets more women than him."" Skinny ""HEY!!"" Little things like that help make a movie. Considering all the other summer movies out there (Pirates excluded) this is one you should go see, with and OPEN mind, and don't be surprised if you come out wanting to dance."

","My expectations for ""Step Up"" were low, but I wanted to see the dancing. Surprisingly, I enjoyed it as a movie as well as a dance vehicle. <br/><br/>I anticipated a""Rocky"" formula, but the movie turned out to be about learning to make mature choices. <br/><br/>The dismal circumstances of our protagonist's life are unfortunately not uncommon these days, and he was just as pouty, inconsiderate, short-sighted, and self-destructive as teenagers in these situations frequently are. The emotional growth of our main character was expected, but a surprising bonus was the emotional growth of his best friend. And the music and dancing were a joy. ""Step Up"" is not ""Fame"", but it's not bad, either."

","The general storyline is a bit trite, but the music and dancing were quite good. This movie would be better if there were less minor characters and the main characters had more depth. Some of the characters and subplots were completely reduced to stereotypes and just shouldn't have been there in the first place. <br/><br/>On the up side, the movie has some interesting moments and lines that capture the reality of living the less-than-privileged life, especially the dynamics between Channing's character and his friends/family. <br/><br/>The acting wasn't anything special. Jenna Dewan's character wasn't developed enough to require acting chops, she just had to look pretty and pout here and there. Channing's good with the shy/awkward/sensitive boy thing, but he should expand beyond that in future roles in order to establish himself as a quality actor. Both leads were VERY skilled dancers though, whether they are good actors or not. <br/><br/>The movie did deliver its share of good dancing and hip hop music. People shouldn't be so hard on it; it wasn't hyped up as some sort of Academy Award Best Picture, it was advertised as a dance movie.

","I have gone through one of the comments and I was upset to say the most.... no offense to you who thinks that all teens are absolutely shallow but to be quite honest you are the shallow and immature individual who comes on this site because you are at home and alone and have nothing good to say about anything so you complain about a movie only because of Channing Tatum and the physical aspects that people did not understand the true meaning of the movie, well to be quite honest I enjoyed the movie, if it involved Channing or not. I think that the director of this film casted the members well and they did a wonderful job acting. I enjoy dance and I always have; watching two different worlds of dance come together and collaborate the love for dance and the passion and love for one another. I found the movie to be well done and fun to watch i enjoyed it myself and i know many who have. If you haven't watched the movie yet i suggest that you go watch it soon. I absolutely loved it!!!!!"

","I really enjoyed this movie. The music is awesome. The dancing is amazing. sure the acting isn't spectacular, but thats not everything in a movie. Sure Channing Tatum could have had a lot more facial expressions and emotions, but maybe thats how they wanted his character to be portrayed? who knows. its not that important. people need to stop analyzing it so much. I thought the chemistry between Jenna and Channing was awesome. They really clicked and made the movie romantic. I've already seen it twice and going back for the 3rd time tonight!.. i highly recommend buying the soundtrack. its amazing!<br/><br/>GO SEE IT!!"

","Overall, I loved this film. I won't say it was perfect because it wasn't but it has been getting some undeserved bad reviews. I would say the main pitfall of this movie is the predictable storyline. However, I think that the amazing choreography and the quality of the actors more than makes up for it. I thought the casting was excellent and the actors were perfect for their rolls. While watching the film, you can pretty much guess at what will happen and be right. In the end though, I found this film satisfying. Being an art school student myself I can relate as I'm sure thousands of other art students can. Plus it has a happy ending so who can say no to that?"

","I loved the movie step up ! I dance and I guarantee if you dance you will like it to. In some parts I was tapping me foot along to the beat and in others I wanted to get up and join in dancing. It was a great movie ! I suggest that if you have not seen this movie and are looking for a good movie to see that you see this. I also suggest you will enjoy this if you dance, or like movies that people dance in, like I do that you should see this. It was the best movie I have seen this year. so I enjoyed this movie and I am almost positive that everyone else who has seen it or is going to see it also had enjoyed it or will enjoy it and have a great time. I'm not going to spoil you by saying anything, you will have to see it for yourself...ha ha"

","I've been dancing for as long as I can remember and I always enjoy a good dance movie, and especially one with Channing Tatum. But this movie was basically a mix of every dance movie I've ever seen. It was so predictable, I knew everything that was about to happen after watching like 20 minutes of the movie. Those of you who have seen the movie must agree that the plot was taken from Center Stage, You Got Served, Save the Last Dance, and Dirty Dancing. The characters and the plot are not very developed and you don't feel like you're part of their struggle as you do in Center Stage or Save the Last Dance. Channing looks better in She's the Man anyway. But I love soundtrack. I think Mario's character Miles is my favorite in the movie."
