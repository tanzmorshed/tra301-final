","So PP 1 & 2 were fun to watch, hell I've watched them a whole bunch of times... The storylines were ok, regards an Aca Contest blah blah blah... but this... this takes the cake... They go on a quest to compete with two other bands and a rapper??? And end up being 007 agents blowing up a boat after being kidnapped??? <br/><br/>REALLY???<br/><br/>I feel this would have been a better movie, if the Bella's had gotten jealous of the younger hotter Bella's and competed against them... Maybe the Younger Bella's introduced guys to the group, and the Older Bella's teamed up with the Tones...<br/><br/>THIS would have made WAY more sense... Com On guys - you spoiled a great franchise there...<br/><br/>Wait for the DVD - or even TV..."

","I knew i would not like this movie when *SPOILER* it was nonchalantly mentioned jesse (skylar astin) and beca (anna kendrick) had broken up and he'd moved on way too quick. way to character assassinate. it just got worse from there. rebel wilson is a comedic actress, but too much of her is just obnoxious and that is what this movie is-obnoxious. i rarely laughed and i didn't recognize most songs they sang. i must be getting old. i have to say my favorite in the series is 2. there is no puking i have to fast forward through. and beca and jesse's cuteness makes up for everything else. elizabeth banks and john michael higgins are hilarious as always. basically, this movie only gets four stars because of who is in it, not for its story."

","8 January 2018
First Film of the year and first Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Pitch Perfect 3. So I hadn't seen the first two, I thought I better catch up, one mega acapella binge watching session later I'm fully caught up and ready for the third instalment. It didn't really matter much about the plot which was probably just as well, as long as the music entertained........and I reckon they didn't do too bad. This instalment sees the Bellas all grown up and beginning to make their way in the world, only it seems they can't make it without their acapella sisters. A little regret on parts of each of the girls makes them jump at the chance to take part in entertaining troops on the USO European tour. It's all the old crew with Beca and Fat Amy leading the way, add some competition in the form of a lean mean girl band, a rock/country group and put them slap bang among aircraft and helicopters on a selection of US naval bases and you have a fun light-hearted film which is guaranteed to keep your feet tapping throughout. Rebel Wilson is gloriously unfazed by all she says, sings and does and the whole film is once more led graciously by Anna Kendrick from disaster to singing magnificence as the film reaches its crescendo. You can almost keep your eyes closed throughout as the music is bouncy and easy to listen to, and ever so slightly leaves you wanting more. Aca-enjoyable."
"rappin_elvis","1","58","83","18 February 2018"," Horrible- waste of time
","I thoroughly enjoyed PP1 and PP2. Like overly enjoyed it. This movie was so stupid its unbelievable. Don't waste your time. Whoever wrote this embarrassment of a movie should never work in showbusiness again. They tried to turn the original pitch perfect formula into some sort of action movie that's just so silly. Literally, Sharknado is a better movie in every respect compared to this."
"xkorix","3","24","33","17 January 2018"," Two movies for the price of one
","I was pretty excited to see this movie since I loved the other two but was wary of what it might be like. I went opening day to see it and left the theater feeling horribly disappointed. <br/><br/>The premise started out well enough with the Bellas being washed up and trying to find their place in the world, then going on a final tour as a last hurrah. It seemed like a fun idea and the other groups made the musical number fantastic and I was excited to see where it would go. But then the movie pulled a 180 and suddenly turned into some espionage spy thriller and I was so confused as to why. All the fun tour stuff basically stopped to make room for this new plot that seemed completely unnecessary, only to have the previous tour stuff come back at the very end. It felt like two movies going on, trying to compete with each other and I did not like it. <br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, there were funny bits with the spy stuff and Fat Amy kicks ass in the last twenty minutes, but for a movie about music, there wasn't much singing after the first half hour or so. It felt like 'quick, get the singing out of the way so we can move onto the action' but the action wasn't nearly as exciting as the singing and even that was subpar. There's even a scene with Amy and her dad where she looks like she's going to sing with him on stage but they cut and go to Becca and the others instead, and next time we see Fat Amy and her dad, they're laughing and have made up. I'm 99% sure there's a deleted scene here they did horrible at masking.<br/><br/>The end was cute but didn't make sense to me. The Bellas hated the way their lives were going then suddenly when Becca gets offered the gig, they suddenly admit they didn't want to sing at all and love how their lives are? This especially annoyed me in Chloe's case since the whole second movie was her trying to stay with the Bellas as long as possible and now at the end of this she decides 'nah, I'm good not singing anymore'. It all just felt out of left field but maybe that's just me.<br/><br/>Long story short, if you want an action espionage movie with secret-off shore bank accounts, explosions and some karaoke thrown in here and there, then by all means go see this. If that's not your cup of tea, don't waste your time and just re-watch the first two instead."

","The Pitch Perfect films shows the contempt Hollywood shows to its female audiences. The original was a fun frothy film aimed at women and enjoyed by men as well. A serviceable if flawed date movie.<br/><br/>Since then it has been a case of diminishing returns as each sequel gets worse. In the third instalment the script seems to be made up as it goes along.<br/><br/>The Bellas have gone their separate ways after the previous film. Emily (Hailee Steinfeld) is leading a new version of Bellas and asks the girls to attend a reunion which they take to mean that the original Bellas will reunite. It seems the original girls are not happy with their jobs and would love to sing together again. <br/><br/>Aubrey (Anna Camp) uses her dad's military connections to get into the USO and perform in Europe where they get a chance to compete to be the opening act for DJ Khaled who seems to be impressed by Beca's (Anna Kendrick) vocals.<br/><br/>Television hosts Gail (Elizabeth Banks) and John (John Michael Higgins) pop up again making abysmal catty comments about the Bella's and later follow them to make a documentary on the group, an idea so messily added into the plot, that is forgotten part way through.<br/><br/>The main plot involves Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson) who reunites with her estranged father (John Lithgow) but he is more interested in her overseas bank account that contains a lot of money.<br/><br/>Well at least the singing is nice but the story is awful, at least the cast spent a few days in Nice. John Lithgow has a nice stab at an Australian accent but it seems no actual Australian actors were available."

","Clearly so - Pitch Perfect 3 is the worst of all three parts of the series. Why? Lazy writing, no new ideas at all, lazy script, endless repeating of the same tired cliches and beaten paths. Anna Kendrick is extremely sweet and nice, Rebel Wilson is funny and loud, John Lithgow is a funny little trifle, too. Apart from that, all the virtually same scenes are rotated nonstop for ever. Vocals, competition, evil rivals, love lost and found, and surely, the final singing scene is a sickly sweet honey toffee sugary treacle idiocy, but for good music, it'd been a total mess.

"belle-41942","5","10","15","22 April 2018"," Since when did this become a ""Rebel Wilson"" movie!!!!
","I really loved the first two Pitch Perfect movies and was really looking forward to this but..... while I appreciate the story line, there were two things that really annoyed me. First, since when did this become a Rebel Wilson movie? It was all about her. I don't mind Rebel Wilson in small doses but I'm not a huge fan and frankly, as much as I love the movies, I don't particularly enjoy her part in them. I am Australian and I actually find her sense of humour distasteful. She's not funny. Second, I did not like the way that Rebel Wilson's character, Amy, belittled Haillee Steinfeld's character, Emily. Quite simply, it showed to the world that it's okay to bully someone. And it wasn't just once, it was quite a few times. This is not a criticism of Rebel Wilson but a huge criticism of the writers/director as it leaves me wondering what on earth was going through their minds when they okayed those lines in the movie. Anyway, apart from that, it wasn't too bad but definitely not as good as the first two. I will say that the ending was was great and so was the song they chose, Freedom."
"davispittman","4","8","12","11 July 2018"," Gave me an empty feeling
","Pitch Perfect 3 (2017) is the third installment, hopefully the last of the Pitch Perfect series. Only reason that I say I hope it's the last is because once you go as low in quality as this film, it is time to stop. I am a fan of the first Pitch Perfect, I gave that film an 8, admittedly I have not seen the second installment, but I don't feel like I needed to to get this one. This film gave me a very hollow, empty feeling from start to finish. The comedy has stopped working for the most part, yes there are a few laughs, but not a lot. Also, the plot isn't that interesting and the plot delves into absolute insanity. Like it goes from regular Pitch Perfect stuff to an action/spy movie and I don't feel like it worked. If they could do this well, then I say sure go for it, but they just didn't. The characters are the same, but they've just been placed in a bad film, and that's sad because you want the final film in a series to be good. I am sorry to say that Pitch Perfect only gets a 4."
"bkrauser-81-311064","6","8","12","1 January 2018"," Pitch Perfect 3 - Because Why Not?
","The Barden Bellas are back once again for one more chance at acappella glory. This time, the film begins with the women singing Britney Spears's ""Toxic"" on a yacht in front of a group of severe looking men. After the song reaches its coda, Fat Amy (Wilson) the heretofore unseen member of the group, crashes through a window ceiling, opens up a spray of fire extinguisher foam, then yells at the group to ""get out"". They all do only moments before the yacht unexpectedly blows up.<br/><br/>Why not? Why the f**k not. This series already jumped the shark back in 2015 so why not have a movie entirely based on taking the shark and repeatedly kicking it? So sit back and enjoy the now mid-to-late-20's Bellas finding some contrived way to sing again then find some contrived way to compete again and then finally find some contrived way to have Anna Kendrick have her cake and eat it too.<br/><br/>The Pitch Perfect series as a whole is an interesting beast to say the least. The first was a sleeper hit that depended on little more than it being a good movie to get butts in the seats. And wouldn't you know it the movie actually reached its target audience, making a cool $115 million against a $17 million budget. Who knew there was such an eager audience for a female-centric comedy? Next you're going to tell me water is wet.<br/><br/>Thing is, I doubt the makers of Pitch Perfect themselves thought it'd be as successful as it was, thus the existence of its hastily made and forgettable sequel. Now we're on its second sequel, and if you want a comparison for the trajectory of this series, know that the Bellas have gone full Goldmember (2002) featuring much of the same stale jokes and completely ignoring overall thematic progression.<br/><br/>The impetus behind this latest reunion has the group singing their hearts out for a USO tour set up by Chloe's (Snow) absent father. Once they arrive they soon realize it's more than just fun and games. DJ Khaled it seems is there hunting for a new opening act and the girls will be pitted against bands with actual instruments for the top slot. As the gals gear up for competition (again), Fat Amy bumps into her father (Lithgow) for a reunion that winds up being less than ideal for her and the group.<br/><br/>Of course most everyone apart from Jessica (Jakle) and Ashley (Regner) get subplots that are setup and knocked down with less than ten lines each. Kendrick's involves the flirtations of a music producer (Burnet) while Anna Camp has her own paramour waiting in the flies. The one follow-through between everyone? the undeniable fact that life is never quite what you expect and my, isn't that disappointing.<br/><br/>In that regard, Pitch Perfect 3 may actually be the darkest of the series, offering everyone only a small reprieve from their humdrum life of anonymity, to once again capture ""the glory days"". The film doesn't resolve this thread nor give us an alternative worth reaching for. Instead it merely establishes as a point of fact that life after college sucks. Oh well, might as well sing about it.<br/><br/>But of course anyone who's been with the Pitch Perfect franchise so far knows it's not about the messaging, it's about the music and the characters. In both regards the film succeeds about 50% of the time. Despite little screen time Hailee Steinfeld and Anna Camp do fairly well in growing their respective roles. The songs, specifically the melded ""sing-off"" between The Bellas and girl-punk band Evermoist does have its charm once you get over the tonal whiplash.<br/><br/>Yet there's so precious little connecting the songs with the characters or for that matter the songs with the characters lips. The direction, especially during the singing sequences is so slapdash and lazy with no attempt being made this time around to make it seem like their actually singing live.<br/><br/>I'd be embarrassed for the actresses on the screen if I wasn't so convinced they were having a ball up there - an attitude that ultimately saves this movie from being an absolute waste. Nothing is taken seriously other than the friendship these characters (and by this point, these actresses) have. Every broad comedic stroke and patently ridiculous action sequence is done with such congeniality that it's hard not to at least muster a warm smile.<br/><br/>Pitch Perfect 3 is ultimately a one-and-done disappointment. In a year full of female-centric comedies that managed to be incredibly entertaining, it's sad to see a series that arguably kick-started everything to be this lazy and uninspired. Still, if you're looking for mild entertainment and have grown with these characters and you really, really want to see this one, you may just get your money's worth. After all many movie theaters now sell alcohol right?"

","Why I ask you? Why oh why oh why oh why oh why do the scriptwriters of Pitch Perfect 3 - Kay Cannon (the original PP screenwriter) and Mike White (""The Emoji Movie"") - think that this dreadfully lazy set of loosely connected scenes represent a viable basis for a movie? Is the view from the guys who green-lit this thing that the crowd that loved ""Pitch Perfect"" and the pretty dreadful sequal ""Pitch Perfect 2"" will pay their box office money regardless? Let's advertise the hell out of it and cash in our chips before word of mouth gets out!?<br/><br/>In this 'adventure' the Bellas go on a US Forces overseas tour (though this is not really explained until they suddenly appear in Spain - what? how?). The really really annoying commentators John (John Michael Higgins) and Gail (Elizabeth Banks, ""Love and Mercy"") tag along, filming some lame half-arsed documentary about them until even the scriptwriters get fed up of that tedious plot-line and it quietly withers on the vine.
Fat Amy (is this still an acceptable nickname in 2017?) also runs into her nefarious father again after many years (John Lithgow, ""Interstellar"", ""Daddy's Home 2""). Lithgow - sporting a wonderful Australian accent - is about the best thing in the film. The ""plot"" (sorry, I can barely bring myself to use that word) revolves around Daddy trying to get something of Amy's that he needs, for reasons - given the yacht he sails - that makes no sense whatsoever. Will he succeed? Will the Bellas get selected to headline with DJ Khaled (who is apparently a thing, but I've never heard him on BBC Radio 2)? Does anyone really care?<br/><br/>As my wife pointed out, it's a bit unfortunate that the only Bellas who are not stick-thin size zeroes are the obese loud one, the black lesbian one and two that nobody knows why they are there. The message to the target female teen audience is clear: if you want to be ""in"" you'd better diet... hard. Nice.<br/><br/>What can I say that's vaguely nice about this film?<br/><br/><ul><li>Some of the acapella song and dance numbers are fun enough, particularly ""Toxic"" that opens the film;</li><li>The closing number by Anna Kendrick (""Table 19"") is quite appealing;</li><li>There are also about 5 funny lines that made me smile: not laugh... smile; </li><li>It's also a relif John and Gail, unlike in ""Pitch Perfect 2"", only come out with one xenophobic/racist comment in the film (and that's about the French, so that hardly counts ).</li></ul><br/><br/>And I'm out...<br/><br/>There will be no doubt die-hard teenage fans who will love this one too. But my wife was a great fan of the first film (as indeed was I); she tolerated the second one; but even she declared this to be ""Aca-Awful"".

The script is stupid, the plot a mess, the acting cringe worthy. <br/><br/>DJ Khaled's name must be mentioned 50 times, like every 2 mins, the whole idea that he would make a singer give up her last chance to sing with her group is inane, he couldn't make her a star next week? The entire back plot with Amy's dad is a distraction, her turning out to be a fat ninja even more silly. Then at the end the girls are all saying they will move on to mundane careers while Fat Amy announces she's worth $180 million, but there is no offer to make them all millionaires and still have a ton left over. <br/><br/>These types of movies are a fun distraction sometimes, but the quality of this is more like straight to DVD. There are so many instances where the girls singing is impossible to sound the way it does, especially when Becca brings the whole group up on stage at the end with only one microphone yet it sounds like they are all mic'd."

It starts off with the Bellas down on their luck and they have to come together to regain their former glory. However, there was a B sideplot involving Fat Amy's dad and I kind of wish the film was more of that. One of my favourite scenes was Fat Amy kicking ass on that yacht (while still taking the time to eat a sandwich). It was so funny, but also just a different and refreshing way to take the series. <br/><br/>Also Skylar Astin nor Ben Platt return. As much as I like those actors and their characters, I do think it was a smart idea not to include them. I feel like with the second one they didnt really know what to do with them (particularly Astin's Jesse). And I cant imagine they would have really fit in this movie either except to be thrown in a scene or two as the ""supportive boyfriend"". <br/><br/>Overall it was fun and I enjoyed myself. No, it doesnt really add too much and you can genuinely tell where the film is going to go but its still a pleasant ride. I enjoyed it more than the second one, but the first one is still the best.<br/><br/>Also my favourite line in the film was when Lily introduces herself as Esther in a completely normal voice and then says ""Satan finally left my body"". I genuinely snorted so loud in theater."
"niallmaggs","7","5","7","5 January 2018"," Quite a lot of fun actually! - Film Review By Niall Maggs (http://ateenstakeonfilm.com)
","Pitch Perfect 3 is your typical musical for teenage girls, not a particularly good film, but a most definitely enjoyable one filled with silly but humorous jokes, and witty dialogue.<br/><br/>The plot of Pitch Perfect 3 is so ridiculous and boring, but the comedy factor manages to make up for it, supplying the audience with constant laughs, particularly from Fat Amy played hilariously by Rebel Wilson, who can be irritating at some points, which is where the film suffers, however most scenes involving her are usually the best moments.<br/><br/>The lead character Beca, played wonderfully by the excellent Anna Kendrick, is also a high point in the film. Kendrick manages to carry the rest of the cast, mostly filled with mediocre performances, and stand out above them all due to the sassy, smart but adorably innocent character she plays. She's someone the audience can root for, and is easily likeable. However, a lot of the supporting characters aren't quite as pleasant or loveable...<br/><br/>Kay Cannon's script is of average quality but entertainingly witty. Some lines of dialogue are more cringe worthy than Anakin and Padme's romance in 'Attack of the Clones' (and that's saying something!) but you can't help but forgive such embarrassing dialogue and love it, because that's what makes it fun!<br/><br/>The direction is, again, average but the pacing is surprisingly flawless. There isn't one point that feels dragged or rushed, and the flow stays very consistent throughout. With a minimal runtime of just 93 minutes, there isn't much time for slow story building and development like Blade Runner 2049, but you couldn't expect much more from a film like this.<br/><br/>Like I said, the performances from the supporting cast are mediocre at best, but, once again, you wouldn't expect Oscar worthy portrayals in a teen musical like this one! The cast work well with what they've got, but what they've got isn't much. However, you can tell they have great chemistry, and enjoy working together.<br/><br/>The cinematography is unnoticeable, which would make it average, and just blends in. No IMAX mind-blowing wide shots or expert special effects, but maybe that's a good thing. There aren't any mind-numbing distractions, so you can just enjoy the bare bones simplistic structure, and there's nothing wrong with that at all!<br/><br/>Because it's a musical, it's going to contain music and dance. Was it good? Well I'm no singing expert, but it seemed alright to me... Some of the songs were embarrassing and plain cringe worthy, but you can't bash the effort the actors put into the routine, which displays their dedication, and just proves they want to make sure the audience have an exciting time.<br/><br/>There is also a stereotypical, unnecessary villain played by John Lithgow, who fits all the criteria for a cliché mastermind bad guy. There really was no reason for him to be there, and literally doesn't develop the plot in any way, and only has some relevance in the last fifteen minutes.<br/><br/>This is one of those movies that would be considered a guilty pleasure. You know it's not a great film, or the best of the year, nor does it try to be, however there is so much fun to be had with Pitch Perfect 3, filled to the brim with light-hearted humour which is simple, laid back and clean. A perfect family friendly movie and one that can be enjoyed by everyone."

Lots of cheap laughs and a little feel good music. Thats it. But that is all it has ever been. So the measure is how good it makes you feel.<br/><br/>The story, whilst very predictable and normal, did flow okay and the pace was good. There didn't feel like there was that much singing in this one but it was enough for me. All the pitches looked great and the visuals were all done well. I've not heard of this director before but I liked her work. The humour and 'action' were all well executed and I had a good few giggles throughout. I was expecting a bigger ending with more of a punch but it never quite came. It was okay but I expected a big hitting finale. <br/><br/>Overall I came away a little happier having had the chance to laugh at a few cheap gags. It is what it is and it made me laugh.

"Rack-Focus","10","30","67","22 December 2017"," Back to Bellas
","If you were a fan of the first Pitch Perfect movie and were disappointed by the bloated sequel, you'll find Pitch Perfect 3 to be acc-awesome. I saw all three movies back-to-back-to-back at the Pitch Perfect Treble feature so I was able to put them into fresh context.<br/><br/>The third chapter gets back to basics and focuses squarely on the core cast, along with Hailee Steinfeld and Chrissie Fit from PP2. <br/><br/>Pitch Perfect always worked best as a ""small movie"". PP2 made the usual mistake of going big, rather than going deep. The result was needless plot distractions like the Green Bay Packers and Snoop Dogg. Sure, those elements were fun, but they didn't add much. Also gone is the weirdness of PP2, like the Teutonic Das Sound Machine, the Riff Off Host, and jokes about illegal immigrants.<br/><br/>What's left is a much tighter plot featuring the Bellas doing what they do best. My favorite scene in PP3 is the riff off where the group effortlessly segues from song to song. I'm sure it was heavily choreographed and rehearsed, but it seems so natural and reflects a chemistry developed from doing three movies together.<br/><br/>PP3 also avoids the third chapter mistake of trying to cram in everyone who appeared in the earlier features. A lot of the main characters are gone, and the roles of some of the remaining ones - most notably Elizabeth Banks and John Michael Higgins - are diminished to give the Bellas more time. Even the finale, arguably, goes small to focus on the Bellas and their sisterhood.<br/><br/>In the end, this franchise finale is ""pitch perfect"". To paraphrase Jesse, if you like watching a bunch of girls doing covers of songs one last time, you'll love this movie.<br/><br/>As a final note - PP3 does a nice job closing this chapter of women's lives and also in paying homage to the past movies. Look for references and scenes from the past and enjoy how far these women have come."

","'PITCH PERFECT 3': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>The third film in the comedy/musical trilogy about a young women a cappella group, called the Barden Bellas (from Barden University). In this (supposedly) final installment, the girls reunite (years after they graduated) for one final singing competition, at a USO tour overseas. Anna Kendrick, Rebel Wilson, Anna Camp, Brittany Snow, Hailee Steinfeld, Hana Mae Lee, Ester Dean, Alexis Knapp, Elizabeth Banks and John Michael Higgins all reprise their roles from earlier films. While Ruby Rose, John Lithgow, Andy Allo, Matt Lanter and DJ Khaled join the cast. It was directed by Trish Sie (who also helmed the 2014 musical/dance flick 'STEP UP ALL IN'), and it was written by Kay Cannon (who also wrote the first two movies) and Mike White (who also wrote the 2003 musical/comedy flick 'SCHOOL OF ROCK'). The film has received mostly negative reviews from critics, and it's performed modestly at the Box Office. I found it to be mostly a bore, and unamusing, but I did highly enjoy the first two movies. <br/><br/>Years after graduating from Barden University, and winning the world championship, the Bellas get back together at their friend's, and former Bella (Steinfeld), show. There they reminisce, and talk about how they miss singing, and that each of their lives have not turned out the way they had hoped. The girls then decide to accept an invite to perform at the USO tour overseas, with other musical groups. Once there they find out that the show is also a competition, and the Bellas get very intensely involved in this competition once again. <br/><br/>Every time a 'PITCH PERFECT' movie comes out, I'm never eager to see it, because I don't think I'll really like it that much. I was pleasantly surprised with the first two movies, and I actually gave them each 4.5 star ratings (because they're great 'feel-good' musicals actually). So I had higher hopes for this one, but the trailers still didn't sell me on it, and I was definitely not pleasantly surprised with it (when I did see it, on opening night). I really wish they would have stopped after 2!"

Finally, at lest they tried to get beyond the Fat Girl jokes and physical ""humor."" There's less music, but more ""substance"" to the plot. Silly, yes, but a plot nonetheless, that has nothing to do with music competitions. And when the Bellas are facing Certain Death, it's Fat Amy that comes to the rescue, and in a way that makes her weight an advantage instead of a handicap.

"mytwin-02225","7","5","8","30 December 2017"," Pitch Perfect 3: Badass Bellas
","After facing countless acapella competitions in the first two films, Christmas 2017 marks the last journey of Beca and her 'family' Barden Bellas singing together. This time, however, Barden Bellas wouldn't face another acapella team in an acapella competition. As a matter of fact, there is a little part of competition atmospheres (only when the Barden Bellas are playing with rip-off game with another bands) as this third installment focuses on things that much more important than winning any competition, which is to moving on to the next stage of our life. Beca is frustated with her job as music producer because she couldn't do what she thinks the best for musician's music. This is why she quits her job and agrees to go on a tour with other Barden Bellas members who also don't satisfy with their current life. Fat Amy meets her father again and thinks that he has changed so that they can live happily together like they used to be. Both Beca and Fat Amy are trapped within the past, they want to relive the past which is seemingly happier than present time and the future. And throughout Pitch Perfect 3, audience would be learning with them that someone could create their future without completely leaving the past behind (Beca would still have her 'family' even though she accepted DJ Khalid's offer).<br/><br/>Pitch Perfect 3 keeps the trilogy record for having amazing acapella performance (lots and lots of dancing and singing), but also goes all the way to make itself different with the first two films. Barden Bellas against music bands. Barden Bellas against the evil father of Fat Amy. Barden Bellas succesfully ruin DJ Khalid's room. With all of these things combined, Pitch Perfect 3 becomes an extraordinary musical film packed with right amount of comedy and action. It is like a Jackie Chan film plus singing and dancing.<br/><br/>The script is okay. The acting is amazing. The only problem of this film is the visual aspect. Similar camera movements are excessively used that make the visual looks boring, especially when Barden Bellas perform on stage. And I get a feeling of watching a travelling video blog rather than a film every time Barden Bellas are moving to another country. There would be a fast panning that shows the distance between the countries, then a montage of 'what would we find in the country' continues (ex: shots inside a busy outdoor market). This montage technique isn't able to convince us that Barden Bellas are actually in the same country with the camera. We don't see Barden Bellas inside any of this montage shots (correct me if I mistaken) and when we see Barden Bellas, we don't see anything we saw in the montage as they always perform at an indetail space (open grass field or inside a building).<br/><br/>Overall, Pitch Perfect 3 is a safe bet for watching with family or friend. Even though they might not like the story, the actors, or the visual, they wouldn't deny that Barden Bella's performance is enjoyable and funny moments are funny."

There is some romance, comedy, intrigue, betrayals and laughs, along the way the girls learn to make some adult decisions, and move into the next stage of their life while cherishing what got them to where they are and how to cherish the past. 
There are worse movies and there are better movies, but this is another chance to hear the Bellas one more time. They don't a completion, but they do win at life and come together to support each other."

"jtindahouse","6","5","9","23 February 2018"," Doesn't quite have the magic this time around
","I'm a surprisingly big fan of the 'Pitch Perfect' series. I even enjoyed the first sequel more than the original. This time around though I don't think they got it quite right. There's a giant glaring hole in the middle of the film and that is an almost complete lack of a plot. Sure, one is kind of thrown in there near the end as an after-thought, but by that stage it's too late. The whole thing just feels like an excuse for these guys to perform more songs. Now, I'm not saying there's anything wrong with that, but when you can have both it's disappointing for it not to be there.<br/><br/>Otherwise though all the things that made the first two great are still present. 'Fat Amy' is still in terrific form. Apart from the two commentators she really is 95% of the comic relief the film has, but she manages to carry it no problem. The character works really well and I'd have no problem seeing a spin-off for her. The songs were also good for the most part, but perhaps there weren't quite as many bangers as in the original two films. Not having the boys acapella band this time around I think quite hurt the film. <br/><br/>'Pitch Perfect 3' isn't a bad film by any stretch of the imagination, I just don't think it can live up to the high standards set by the first two. If this is the last edition in the series though I think they can hold their heads very high, with a fine trilogy having been produced."

"aaronlbacks","2","8","18","15 January 2018"," I wish this was Pitch Perfect 2 so I could title this review ""Pitch Perfect 2/10""
","This was the first movie I saw in theaters in the New Year, and if it's a sign to come for 2018, I am deeply afraid. It's a cash-grab disasterpiece, and I feel it's quite a fine example to show how lazy corporate executives will get with popular franchise movies that are bonafide money-makers. They know the waters well. The fish bite without even checking the bait now! Why even bother putting something on the hook anymore? (I'm looking at you too, Star Wars). The best way to describe this movie is that it is half-assed in some of the worst ways possible. Lazy attempts at jokes in between sleepy dialogue. Most of the jokes were funnier in the sense of how pathetic and cringe-worthy they were than the actual set-up and punch line. I found myself as a turtle during this movie, slowing shrinking my head into my jacket-shell with each ""Fat Amy is fat. I like eat"" joke. And for how surprisingly random the plot seemed, somehow it managed to keep itself incredibly predictable and incredibly trite. And along with the random plot came randomized tone as well, just like way out left hook type biffs of sentimentality in a movie full of corporate greed, spliced with comedic bits that fall right on their face, and a James Bond-type sequence at the end (what?), this movie demonstrated the emotional and tonal maturity of a bad sitcom episode. And it became quickly obvious to the actresses involved that this movie was nowhere near the quality of the original because almost every performance here is phoned in. They were only there for the check, and DJ Khaled seemed likewise, leaving his natural energy and persona at home during his set days. And some characters seemed like they wouldn't damage their reputation being in such a movie and their characters ""got pregnant and couldn't tour"" or ""they broke up"" and I hold some respect for them. And aside from the laziness of this film, the crowd-pleasing and innocuous tone was extremely annoying as well. Let's add the military because you need to support your country and everyone knows that it's illegal to hate a patriotic movie! And let's go to all these foreign countries and give them shout-outs so our overseas box office sales are healthier. And let's throw in some really lazy female empowerment agenda because that's important now. And even though it includes all these shout-outs, I still can't imagine the person who would go out and enjoy sitting through this movie. The only redeeming quality I will give it are the song and dance sequences. Luckily the choreography and compositions were not lacking and were easily the most entertaining parts of this entire film. Idk, I'm getting even angrier at this film just writing all this out, so I'll leave with just two questions: was this movie really needed? And why did I spend ten dollars to see it?"

Have low expectations, and you will find much enjoyment in this movie. Expect it to be just like the first, and you will be searching for another hit of your drug choice without any luck. Know that this movie is for fans who love the other 2. Don't take it too seriously, but don't completely underestimate the privilege of getting to see another one.

The first act is pretty entertaining and sets up an interesting premise where the Bella's have to compete with real bands using instruments. This plot is almost completely abandoned however when the movie decides to become an action movie with a hostage situation. There is a severe tonal problem with this movie but I can't say I didn't have fun with certain aspects and scenes.

"mt-95256","3","3","6","3 January 2018"," Aca-trocious. Not funny, not entertaining and just embarrassing.
","TL;DR
<ul><li>Just awful</li><li>Ridiculous, boring story stuffed with silly side-stories in a failed attempt to engage the audience and not let them realise they've run out of ideas</li><li>Music from the other bands only emphasise the annoying noise coming from the main characters</li><li>The dance choreography is good, but sadly the editing doesn't allow us to enjoy it</li><li>Anna Kendrick is likeable as ever, but is playing the same character she always does</li><li>Hailee Steinfeld needs to go back to how she was in True Grit</li><li>Rebel Wilson is truly awful - crass, unfunny and annoying; an insult to comedy</li></ul><br/><br/>Pitch Perfect 3 wasn't my choice of film to go and see; and if there's ever a fourth, yet again I won't choose to see that one either. Sadly though, despite protests, attempts at compromise and pleas that I hadn't seen the others so it wouldn't make sense, I was dragged, kicking and screaming, into Screen 4 and told to be quiet and enjoy it. Enjoy it I did not, but at the very least I did stay quiet... Quieter than one should be in a comedy, without a single laugh emanating from my cringing face. I can only pray I won't be dragged to a mess like this again. Unfunny, embarrassing and incoherent, it baffles me that any film of this calibre can make it to a trilogy.<br/><br/>The story is absolutely incoherent and not engaging in the slightest. It's akin to an X-Factor documentary more than a musical film. Giving up on their careers for a competition isn't the sort of message Hollywood should be giving to millennials struggling to get to grips with adulthood and heading to Europe is the most cliched move you can imagine - naturally every American franchise heads to Europe as soon as they run out of ideas. The competition itself means very little to the overall plot, with the writers having to shove in plot lines like Beca's romance and Amy's daddy issues to fatten up an otherwise depressingly thin and unengaging plot. Though it may be strange that the most boring story is the central one that the film revolves around, the really sad irony is that the side-stories are in fact the more interesting parts of the film. It's as though this film can't decide what genre it is or even what story it should be telling. This results in the film being even more infuriating.<br/><br/>'Perhaps the music can save it,' I hoped. Sadly, unless you like subpar cover groups, this is unlikely to be the case. It's problematic when other groups are more talented and entertaining than the central one you're supposed to care about. If you were ever unsure about a cappella, this will not make you a fan. At times you'd be forgiven for assuming they were some sort of Alvin and the Chipmunks tribute band instead. At the very least the dancing is choreographed and performed well, allowing the dancing to be the best element to the movie - it's just disappointing the editing can't allow the camera to pause on one shot long enough to let us appreciate it.<br/><br/>It's recently been said that modern American comedies are not what they used to be; this film is simple proof to back up that claim. The characters should be charming, funny and enjoyable to spend time with. As it happens, the cast of The Bellas are a strange bunch, but not in that charming, quirky way so many coming-of-age teen movies are. They're not particularly endearing, although at least they do work well together and come across as good friends - largely in the way they speak over each other, constantly cheer each other on, have group hugs... This can't fail to make you in the audience feel like an outsider, not welcome to join in and be part of The Bellas. Not that this is a bad thing; with a group of characters who are so similar, ditzy and brainless, I think I'd rather spend an hour and a half with one of the other groups. The main spokespeople for The Bellas is mainly confined to three main characters; namely Anna Kendrick's Beca, Hailee Steinfeld's Emily and Rebel Wilson's Fat Amy. I'm still confident that Anna Kendrick has the ability to broaden her range of characters - she's been playing the same sort of person for years. Still, despite her wasted potential in this film, she's fortunately likeable nevertheless and it's a relief that she's the central character as opposed to one of the others. Similarly, Hailee Steinfeld showed excellent promise years back when she got an Oscar nomination for her role in True Grit. How the mighty have fallen; it's noticeable that no other Oscar nominations have come her way since. If she were to distance herself from films like this and apply her likeable personality and brilliant talent, she'd be fighting the awards off with a golden stick. Sadly the third main character we see far too much of is Rebel Wilson. How she seems to be moderately successful I'll never understand. The polar opposite to Kendrick and Steinfeld, Wilson's not at all likeable, nor is she anywhere near as funny as her character was intended to be. With desperate, pathetic jokes and crass humour which shows an utter lack of wit, I can only hope that her lines were improvised and not written; such an embarrassment couldn't fail to end the careers of the writers (assuming there were any writers, I wouldn't be surprised if there weren't). The only saving grace in terms of comedy are Elizabeth Banks and John Michael Higgins. Although not all their jokes hit the mark, their lines are the only sections of the film that bare any resemblance to comedy and they really do deserve more.<br/><br/>Without seeing the previous two I can't comment on them, but I'm sure they can't possibly be worse than this. Perhaps one of the worst films I've seen in a while. It makes other disappointments in 2017 seem wonderful in comparison. Good dance choreography and occasional enjoyable music, can't save a film drowning in irritating noise from The Bellas, an incoherent central story consistently distracted by side-plots, ditzy and annoying characters talking nonsense over each other and unfunny, crass and embarrassing attempts at comedy that fall flat on their face, with most of them coming from one character in particular... Pitch Perfect 3 is so far from 'perfect', I can only hope that a fourth will never come to pass."

If you liked Pitch Perfect 1 and Pitch Perfect 2, you will like Pitch Perfect 3. If you did not like the prior movies, you probably won't find this movie any better. If you like the A Capella singing sequences, Pitch Perfect 3 has plenty. If you like the irreverent humor, the movie does a great job with completely relying on old jokes from the first two movies. The characters maintain their quirkiness without being overdone, the plot is interesting and reasonable, and I actually found the ending better than Pitch Perfect 1 and 2. And finally, if you are in love with Anna Kendrick, whose dry comedic timing is just awesome, you give the movie an extra star."
"estreet-eva","5","3","7","9 January 2018"," Suffers from sequel dimishing returns but worth it for DJ Khalid
","Movies not originally written as a multipart series struggle to avoid a natural decline in entertaining power. The Anna Kendrick series offers a textbook example of this cinematic principle. The nerdy acapella jokes which made the original refreshing feel stale, you've seen the song battle with unusual singing groups (e.g., the Green Bay Packers) before, the big movie-ending showdown is more ritual than riveting. To its credit the movie breaks the fourth wall to acknowledge some of these tropes most insightfully when Beca explains the impromptu sing-offs and then mentions that they always seem to lose them. Like the 2nd outing the movie could have used some editing particularly around a B plot involving John Litghow as Fat Amy's father. The gravity of sequel physics might have made #2 the bail out point if not for one man - the incomprarable DJ Khalid. The possibly genius / possibly raving idiot quote machine gets a hilarious scene where he spouts inpenetrable DJ Khalid philosphy why an assistant translates for the audience (""what DJ Khalid means here is you need to let go of the anchor of the past if you want to rise to your future."") Nobody has yet heard the first 2 or 3 lines following the scene as movie-goers were still gaffawing. In short, when will DJ Khalid get his own movie?"
"jeannefrancoise","10","3","7","9 January 2018"," Fun acting, great performance, everlasting friendship
","Dear readers, now I am going to show you why Pitch Perfect is the most well-known drama musical in Hollywood movies. First is about how Director connected all the girls to be together and make a group of acapella-dancing. This is not easy, but we can see the proof that they can make it. Second is about the plot. Pitch Perfect 1,2,3 have the same common story line: Beginning and ending with a competition. This philosophy coming from the real life that we always want to be the best in everything in our daily lives. So Pitch Perfect story line is all about competition, how people getting bullied, how to fight back, how to be honest, and how to be yourself. Some movie critics say that Pitch Perfect is just a slapstick movie, well, it is not true. By watching the characters of the plot, Pitch Perfect is more than just a comedy. This is a fun acting, great performance, and everlasting friendship. Every morning, the Pitch Perfect songs is like a mood-buster for me and wow, Anna Kendrick is such a great motivator. She has an unique personality. She loves herself, she is funny, awkward, and entertaining at the same time. I conclude that the movie Director in this Pitch Perfect 3 can still make the highlight of showing a life of acapella group in Hollywood industry. Pitch Perfect is part of my life and I can assume there will be Pitch Perfect 4 for reunion. Who knows, we can see those bitches again? :)"
"timo-luege","9","3","7","5 January 2018"," My favourite of the three
","PP3 might be my favourite of the three movies. The characters has just come into their own with Cloe's obsessiveness, Aubrey's competitiveness and Fat Amy's all around insanity, balanced by Beca's calm. The move had me laughing from minute two and I enjoyed every bit of it. It's a funny, feelgood movie. Also: Rebel Wilson is the real star of this movie, imho, and I find her hilarious. If you like her, you will like the movie. If you don't like her, you won't."
"rockman182","6","3","7","23 December 2017"," Pitch Perfect 3 (2017)
","I am an Anna Kendrick maniac, so it goes without saying I'm always going to watch anything she's in. I did quite like the first Pitch Perfect. The music and a capella were good and the film was entertaining. The sequel wasn't very memorable, few moments here and there but not enough to be considered a good film. The trailer for the third film didn't look amazing but I was interested in seeing how the film series would end. The addition of Ruby Rose caught my eye as well. Overall, the film has good music and performances but does little to give the series a good send off.<br/><br/>The Bellas are now older all with jobs they hate. They relish the opportunity to sing together once again. So, they decide to go on a USO tour where other rival bands use instruments instead of just harmonizing with their voices. Becca also must decide if she wants to pursue her dream of a musical career without the Bellas. Of course, there are also other sideplots. This film is pretty much billed as the last Pitch Perfect and yet its actually a really weak ending; one that goes out on a whimper.<br/><br/>The writing for this one is unfocused. The competitive nature of the series is present at first but fades away as it mixes with a villainous ransom plot. It becomes a real mess when the film tries to over plot it self. The Fat Amy jokes never worked and they don't here either. Its actually probably the weakest film in the trilogy and is further proof that we only needed one Pitch Perfect. The music and singing is top notch as usual and is unsurprisingly the best the film has to offer.<br/><br/>I couldn't help but feel that the film was just unnecessary and tired. Ideas were short and the film seems to exist just to complete a trilogy. Much like the second the musical performances are great but its hard to find anything else to really praise. The first half of the film is failed by the poor writing in the second. Also, no one ever needs that much DJ Khaled. In the case of this series, I really hope this is it and Pitch Perfect is done.<br/><br/>6/10"

","I had fun watching it, but the whole thing felt rushed. However, the chemistry between the female cast continues to be amazing. Also, the performances (even when the editing was a bit too fast paced) were , as usual, spectacular; and, as much as it was a goodbye film, it didn't feel like this should be it. It's not their best but it makes you laugh and, for me, it makes me want more. Less sub-plots, less craziness, more of the girls at what they do best: be a family of weirdoes singing together."

","Likes : Ya i know what people are gonna say pitch perfect is just a small time film and a chick flick not really a worth it film, although it a guilty pleasure of mine as some of the main cast singer are gorgeous specially two of which Anna Kendrick and Brittany Snow.<br/><br/>Simple after three disappointing film at the end of this year you kind of need something fun to pick your mood for Christmas up and wide down the year, i'l be honest pitch perfect three was a perfect film to just relax in the ambiance of music which is at it best with this film.<br/><br/>Although this is the last film of pitch perfect it gone out with a big bang in give the audiences some of the best music mash ups and comedy, but unlike the previous two movies it add a surprising twist as one of the groups father turn up after a few year, but you would think it a happen reunion but nope.<br/><br/>This reunion almost get the girls killed before they can do their last stage appearance together, which was good for the story give the movie more than just singing which was great.<br/><br/>With cameos from Ruby Rose and music industry DJ Khaled playing himself really added some flare to this film which is great, making it a really enjoyable film to watch. It always great listen to Anna Kendrick singing as she has this amazing singing voice that so beautiful to listen to it also has you in tears, she not just a brilliant actress but amazing singer.<br/><br/>Although the comedy is a little weak at time, this is just one of those great fun movie to watch if you had a disappointing end of 2017. <br/><br/>Dislikes : The only thing wrong with this film is some joke did fall flat in places and John Lithgow brilliant actor but it felt like the way they've written his character in this film felt like a creepy old man it just came across that way on screen."

"adam-63492","4","0","0","24 May 2020"," Do NOT watch this if you want to keep your good memories from the first 2 movies.
","Everything about this movie felt off from the first 2, which I enjoyed so much more. The music and vocals were great, but didn't experiment anything new and they chose the safe option of just reading through popular pop lyrics. I feel like it would probably be easier if I just list all the issues I had with this movie:<br/><br/>
Strange/non-existent plot which had utterly pointless development. We feel little to no motivation to root for the Bellas in this new boring competition. We go from The Bellas reuniting, to another ""competition"", to somehow Fat Amy's Druglord father showing up out of nowhere. It wasn't so much the random story that got me, it was how off this movie felt to the first two. I mean I'm pretty sure the cook dies on the yacht in this movie, Fat Amy is just some professional assassin who can take out multiple muscular men and heartlessly explodes the boat, probably killing a few people. I mean, when did murder and kidnapping become part of Pitch Perfect?<br/><br/>Secondly, WHY DJ Khaled?? I could think of a million other artists (if you can even class a guy who just yells his name in every song an artist), who would have absolutely demolished his performance and make the movie more convincing. I really felt like Khaled must have been the one who payed the producers to get this role, because he was just treated like a god in the story, like he was royalty who doesn't care about the lower singers and he plays some piano as if his skills and privileges are unmatched. DJ Khaled is like James Corden, he's in a few odd movies, his presence doesn't really fit the context, and every time we see him the movie automatically feels terrible. Imagine someone like Adam Levine in Khaled's role!<br/><br/>The movie had almost no development. In the first 2 movies, part of their success was through the process of 'rising up' and 'finding yourselves', which the Bellas had to overcome together. In this movie, they sing, they sing again, and again; there's no practicing we see, they just know a bunch of songs and seemingly sing on the spot when the time comes. On top of this, it turns out that The All-Powerful and Knowing DJ Khaled never cared about that stuff anyway, because he can just ""feel"" Becca's unlimited potential by listening to a few recordings and mashups she makes while in his hotel room. Who cares about all the other talented bands there right?<br/><br/>The Songs were a little boring to me. The vocals, don't get me wrong, were 10/10, but I didn't feel the same improvisational lyrics the other 2 movies conveyed so well. It was super generic, they didn't try anything new the last movies did, they basically just sang popular pop songs together. They even sung the Exact same song 'Toxic' twice which I really don't understand the point of.<br/><br/>
I could really go on but I feel those were my main issues. All in all, it could have been worse, but I really wouldn't watch this movie if you enjoyed the first 2, because it will ruin your good perception of the characters and storyline. This movie was unnecessary, had little development and almost no plot. It felt cheap, didn't have many funny jokes, and was a really poor and disappointing end to the Pitch Perfect movies."

","I had followed the Instagram posts regarding behind the scenes and teasers during filming for this so I was well aware that this would be more Fat Amy focused compared to the previous two movies, that we would be getting into who exactly Fat Amy is. That being said it still took me two years to watch the full movie.<br/><br/>I watched with as much of an open mind as possible despite already knowing the simplicity of the storey line. The Bella's growing as individuals out in the real world but unhappy and wanting to feel like the did when they were all still at Barden,. (Minus Legacy of course who is still attending University.) and end up going on the USO tour to reclaim those feelings.... all the while being 'filmed' by Gail and John for their ac-umentory.<br/><br/>A few items definitely rankled me. They 'dumbed' down Chloe, made her base her happiness on needing a boyfriend, and made her super awkward. Her attempts to flirt with Chicago were cringe inducing and not in an amusing way.<br/><br/>Don't get me started on DJ Khalid's over acting when he had to deliver the few lines he was given...(thankfully).<br/><br/>I did enjoy how Beca's character has grown over the duration of the franchise, but still at the core was very much a sarcastic don't touch me or I will bite ray of sunshine.<br/><br/>The running gag with Jessica and Ashley and the sarcastic deadpan delivery Jessica gives when the two are acknowledged was fantastic. (For me those were a couple of the best moments in the movie.)<br/><br/>I personally thought the ending brought the franchise full circle as it began with a young person's single tunnel vision desire/dream to make it big making music who ends up with a hodgepodge family and fantastic support system, and it ended with the reaffirmation of the hodgepodge family supporting said family member when they get their golden ticket in the music industry."

","There's not much to this second sequel to the surprise 2012 blockbuster, and that's part of its charm. Mind you, there's no denying that this finale arrives a little dead on arrival, stretching as it does a rather thin series plot past its breaking point, with international intrigue and espionage action from the first few scenes. But at its heart, it's an undemanding and undeniably charming way to spend ninety minutes, while the cast continues to radiate infectious good will. Anna Kendrick and Rebel Wilson still work well against each other, while Haylee Steinfeld steals scenes left and right. In the end it may be time for the Bellas to hang in up once and for all, but it's been a pleasure getting there."

"cruise01","5","4","13","22 December 2017"," Third time may not be the best time for the Acabellas to return which lacked the fun the first movie had.
","The acabellas are back in this final installment and good riddance from what started to be a fun filled musical comedy to redundant boredom. I loved the first Pitch Perfect film, it introduced the audience to the world of acabellas and singing without using any instruments. The characters were different and fun, and the plot never was cliché. The second film was fun but lacking in a story. Pitch Perfect 3 lacks the plot, humor, and the characters are no longer interesting from what they once used to be. On a positive note, this third installment is supposed to be the final film in the series with the story concluding the characters. <br/><br/>The Bellas are done with college and are living among their lives. Beca (Anna Kendrick) loses her job cause she was not cooperative with her music manager. Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson) lives with Beca and host her own street corner shows singing Amy Winehouse mix ups. When every one is not happy with the path they tried working for, they all meet up at a reunion invited by Emily (Hailee Steinfeld). They all decide to partake on a tour for United Service Organization competing against some ruthless bands that hold no rules and use instruments. <br/><br/>There was not much of a plot. We learn that Aubrey (Anna Camp) father is in the military and she all of a sudden gets passes to sing in the tour after their own friends invitation did not open them up to singing at the reunion. Then, there is a sub plot of Fat Amy's father shadowing their group overseas played by John Lithgow, who tries to reconnect with her by placing a stuffed animal on her pillow. And another sub plot with Beca getting the attention from a music manager which he is recruiting only her. Then, in the end as every one started off with their miserable jobs. They all fall back to the same position they started with. Besides they got to see and sing with each other for one last time. <br/><br/>This film also lacked in humor and it was not as funny as the first film. Most of the jokes are all Rebel Wilson's character trying to say the most wisecrack lines that are annoying than funny. Hailee Steinfeld's character is the one being poked at for stupid responses. Brittany Snow is falling in love with a military guy with lots of awkward encounters. Hana Mae Lee is still the quiet one and a mystery. Alexis Knapp steps out on this one for majority of the film. And Elizabeth Banks and her co commentator are still on the spot light cracking jokes about feminism and sexist humor. <br/><br/>Overall, Pitch Perfect 3 is a miss this time around. It was not as funny. It was boring at times. The characters are not as entertaining as they used to be. The plot is just horrible. <br/><br/>I rate the film 2.5 out of 5 stars. I would recommend this film as a rental. It just was not worth sitting through this in theatres."

(WHY IS IT A SPY FILM) This movie normally would just be a fine sequel to Pitch Perfect 2. But NOPE, IT'S A SPY FILM.

I couldn't put spoilers in this review if I tried as there is no plot anyway! The characters are not developed whatsoever, the script is embarrassing (and that's a polite way of putting it) and it misses an important aspect that made the first one good - comedy! Rebel Wilson is mildly funny but the other characters couldn't be funny if they tried. The biggest joke in this is that DJ Khaled is hailed as some musical genius in this- for those unfamiliar with this pile of hot, steaming poop, his claim to fame is saying ""We the best music, DJ Khaled""-.

"MonsieurMS","Null","1","2","29 August 2018"," PP3 revives the franchise--please let it end here for the moment
","After a failed attempt to get younger and go in a different direction in PP2, PP3 happily develops a plot line that makes sense for the aging singers. To me, this is way better than PP2. It has villains with talent (the Zombie performance was exceptional, loved the soldiers, etc.). It has boffo performances. They needed to do something different while going back to their roots. Happily, Steinfeld was marginalized as well. Overall, to me this worked well and the PP3 riff-off was a great one. Sure, nothing will match #1, but that's life.<br/><br/>What's next? Hopefully, nothing for awhile. The performers are longer in tooth. As cute as Anna Kendrick is, she doesn't look like a recent college grad any more. It's hard to keep finding ways to bring them back. The discussions in the movie of getting on with life made sense and imparted an air of finality.<br/><br/>If there's a PP4, it can be in 2030 with the stars mentoring a new cast and showing us where they wound up.

","Pitch Perfect 3<br/><br/>Sadly, if you want to sabotage an a cappella group you have to slit a member's throat.<br/><br/>Or, you can do what the rivals in this musical comedy do and play instruments.<br/><br/>Three years after their last performance, the dismantled Bellas (Brittany Snow, Anna Camp, Hailee Steinfeld) are reunified for a chance to perform in a USO show alongside DJ Khaled. But when he only wants Beca (Anna Kendrick) for his opening act, it divides the outfit.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Fat Amy's (Rebel Wilson) ex-con father (John Lithgow) lands the girls in hot water.<br/><br/>With its reunion plotline dependent yet again on a singing competition, this third entry in the pointless musical pageant is the absolute worst in the series, and unwatchable.

The Bellas are grown up but all going through a rough patch, they reunite and are invited to a military concert but not to perform, just to watch. However one of them has a connection to the military and they managed to crowbar a singing competition into the already thin plot. We also see a ridiculous subplot involving Fat Amy and her estranged father.<br/><br/>This film is for a female audience based on a busy cinema full of young girls.

"trmoore-61899","3","1","3","19 February 2018"," Just Disappointing
","This is the second movie I have attended in 2018, and, unfortunately, I am 0 for 2 on the year.
The movie was just, well how to I sum this up in one word, pointless is a good one. Don't get me wrong, the first movie in the trilogy was a great film. Something that hadn't been attempted, well attempted and succeeded before in my opinion. An entire movie about acapella. But, as we have seen, there is only so much you can do with that theme. The second movie was okay, nowhere near the level of the first. And the third seemed like a pure cash grab. The jokes fell flat for most of the movie, only making me laugh a couple times. For a comedy movie, it wasn't very funny. We lost most of the original cast from the first movie, including the entire male group the Trebelmakers, including the talents of Skylar Astin (Jesse) and Ben Platt (Benji). There were a big part of Beca's character arc in the first and second movie, and they weren't there for the final movie, or at least I hope this was the final move.
The usual redeeming quality about these movies is the music, and I was the most disappointed about that aspect in this. The songs they chose to sing were boring. There were no uptempo songs, no mash-ups (which the first movie was famous for), the riff off just didn't work. It was just bad really. There was only one good song in my mind, so I would suggest buying ""Freedom! '90"" only from iTunes if you are at all interested in the album and don't waste the rest of your money.
The one good song leads directly to one of the only positive things about this movie, and that is Anna Kendrick's performance as Beca. For the bad movie that this was, it finished out Beca's character arc very well. Due to the non-casting of her boyfriend in the first two films, they broke them up in the movie, but they didn't get her back together with another guy in the film, which was the right move. Beca's singing was on point, which I think is a real underrated aspect in Anna Kendrick's arsenal as an actor I might add. And they finished with her being in a perfect place for the character, so well done on that.
The movie I would compare this to is Star Wars: The Last Jedi if you can believe it, although a real difference in quality level. A very good main character arc, but very distracting with the rest of the plot line around it. If you take out all the scenes without Anna Kendrick in it, this would have been a much better movie.
My suggestion to anyone who hasn't seen this in theaters is don't unless you have a huge crush on this trilogy. I honestly, wouldn't even suggest renting it. I would wait until it comes out on Netflix, HBO, Hulu, whatever your preferred platform really. And as for buying the movie, I would only do it if you need it for your collection to finish out all three, and even then I would look for a bundle pack with the other two. This movie wasn't the worst in the year of 2017, but it certainly wasn't great."

","Pitch Perfect 3 was a fun and mostly enjoyable movie like the previous two. This was the weakest of the trilogy. I love Anna Kendrick but the rest of the cast is nothing to get excited about. There were a couple moments of actual laughter but not much. John Lithgow was just a bad miscast as Fat Amys' father, it was weird. There were some other awkward parts just throughout. It tried to be like an action movie at one point and it was just odd. The music was great though, as per usual."

(Please don't let them make a Fat Amy spin off).
I really won't say any more as the movie speaks for itself. Avoid"
"huey2088","2","1","3","17 February 2018"," Watch it for John Lithgow
","PP3 is so far from being about the songs and the a capella singing. Not long into the opening sequence, there's an explosion that hinted of what is to come - it has gone into another genre to attract more audience because the music is getting too predictable and rather old for this third installment. And they only have themselves to blame for making a cash grab with this and the previous sequel. They should have either renamed it or just never made PP3 because it's plain to see the soul is not there anymore that the disjointed plotline is not even worth writing about.<br/><br/>There are two good things in this movie. John Lithgow, who plays Amy's (Rebel Wilson) estranged Australian dad delivers the perfect accent and pitch that shows what a skilled actor he is because it is one of the most difficult to master in films. Lithgow makes every scene worthwhile and he even sings without betraying his adopted accent. <br/><br/>The other good thing is that (and I'm holding them to their words in their trailer) when the Bellas reveal they all have wishes to pursue other careers remotely related to singing, thus ending the need for another sequel. I actually felt sad and started to miss them and their wonderful voices right after this scene but enough is enough. And as if to suggest further that this is indeed the end, they perform a rendition of George Michael's ""Freedom"" with not just a band but also an orchestra thus severing their a capella roots for good.<br/><br/>""Freedom's"" definitive lyrics are about being true to oneself and knowing when it's time to move on in, ""But today the way I play the game is got to change, oh yeah. Now I'm gonna get me some happy."" The way PP3 concludes with the Bellas' prolonged group hug (for those unfamiliar with the trailer) is we love the family we've become but it just doesn't work anymore, we want to do something different and I might add, someting more meaningful. Freedom from another plotless sequel made solely for cashing in and we should all embrace this decision."

"gavinp9","6","1","3","1 January 2018"," Fitting finale
","'Pitch Perfect 3' is quite similar to the first two films, revolving around the ""Bellas"" a cappella group - although this time they're out of college and dealing with being grown-ups. So when the chance to reunite for one last set of shows arises, playing to US troops in Europe, they all jump at it. Not much more to the plot than that, except for a slight detour with Amy's Dad (Lithgow), which doesn't add a whole lot, except him doing a horrible Aussie accent.<br/><br/>There's some crap songs and a few decent ones, but they always make them interesting to watch/listen to and the film always has plenty to keep it's momentum up - Beca (Kendrick) obviously getting the most screen time and a satisfying conclusion. Amy (Wilson) has a good number of funny lines and Chloe (Snow) has a bit more to do, and the other seven each get a few moments to shine.<br/><br/>I still wish there was more of Elizabeth Banks & John Michael Higgins as the commentators/documentary-makers, but they're still great in every scene they're in. It's all predictable, but nonetheless uplifting and all about being there for your friends and following your dreams, while still being fun enough."
"MichaelNontonMulu","7","1","3","29 December 2017"," The Final Performance of the Bellas
","As the third part of this musical comedy movie, I could not help but to compare this with the first and second movie. Just what I suspected, the movie's story was not as good as the second one, let alone the first one. To me personally (and my wife shared the same sentiment as I did), the first one was the best. That one was truly honoring the a cappella style of music with the competition to be the best at university level and we get to see the earlier problems a big group would have in real life. The second one despite the movie expanded their universe to a world competition, the story itself was probably a bit less good, but the competitors of the Bellas were still a cappella singers. Whereas this time, the competition comes from a real band which I think was not really apple to apple, plus the story of this third one was a bit forced.<br/><br/>The nice thing about this movie was still the performance of the Bellas were still as good as before and they also seemed to give more portion to other members of the group (except Jessica and Ashley characters. LOL). And the jokes were still quite similar to the earlier movies. My favorite character in this film (and the 1st & 2nd ones) was definitely Fat Amy who was very funny, plus she gave a surprisingly cool scenes in the boat towards the end of the movie. Oh, Lily's character was also very fun. This time, the characters of John and Gail were not as much as the previous movies, but they still gave crazy fun commentaries as usual. 1 other thing, I still think that the movie might not be suitable for children whom I noticed were there when I saw this in the cinema today.<br/><br/>The songs this time were quite up to date and seeing this movie, you should expect to see a lot of songs wonderfully sung in a cappella style. My favorite song scene was the very cool brief riff-off between the Bellas and other groups. Basically the movie was having a similar formula with the earlier movies, like the competition, the crazy stuff they always managed to do, some relationships, and funny moments. The best thing about this movie to my personal opinion was the last song which would bring out lot of emotions for fans of the Bellas (like my wife). Plus the end credit scene was also fun to see as it served as reminder of the journey these girls had all the years.<br/><br/>Overall, if you are fans of the group and also love to see songs sung in a cappella style, or any other style, plus some fun jokes, then this movie is definitely for you. This is a light movie that should not be over thought and just to be enjoyed as pure entertainment. However, if you must have a logical story in a movie, then this might not be to your liking. My advice for you to forget all your logic and just go enjoy the movie, maybe sing in your own heart. Do not forget to watch the Pitch Perfect 1 and 2 first before watching this one so you could be familiar and understand the characters (and some of the jokes) better. <br/><br/>for my complete review pls have a look at michaelnontonmulu.blogspot.co.id"
"zkonedog","3","1","3","28 December 2017"," A Severely Missed Opportunity
","""Pitch Perfect"" is a franchise that really shouldn't succeed even close to the levels it reaches. Yet, it manages to grab from just enough audiences to prove itself viable most of the time. It has the ""girl power"" audience, the audience that loves the raunchy humor/wisecracks, and of course the well-choreographed song/dance numbers. Throw in just enough of a story, and you've got something.<br/><br/>The first ""Pitch Perfect"" film was all about the transition to college and branching out in the world. ""Pitch Perfect 2"" was about diving deeper into that experience and bonding with friends. Though never in line for an Oscar nomination, a story arc was indeed in play here. ""Pitch Perfect 3"" was supposed to be about coming together after college is over and being a bit lost in life (as many young people feel at this point in time). Sadly, that opportunity is wasted by a script that doesn't try nearly as hard as it should to continue the story arc. What results is a jumbled mess, punctuated by just enough musical numbers to keep it watchable for even the hard-core fans.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""PP3"" sees Beca (Anna Kendrick) and the rest of the Bellas (Rebel Wilson, Brittany Snow, Anna Camp, Hailee Steinfeld, Ester Dean, Hana Mae Lee, etc.) struggling to adapt to life outside of the group. They are presented an opportunity, however, to participate in a USO tour to ""support the troops"", (as well as perhaps prove themselves to be the opening act for DJ Khaled) and they all jump at the opportunity to sing again.<br/><br/>Story-wise, this movie is a mess from start to finish. The USO doesn't really even make that much sense (and keeps changing in plot-device fashion to fit the narrative), no character development takes place, and a subplot involving Fat Amy's father (played by John Lithgow) is inanely stupid. There is even a confusion of tone, as the writers didn't seem to know what they wanted this movie to be. Is it about the Bellas reuniting and ""finding themselves"" again, or is it about acapella music vs. instrumental music? Unfortunately, neither path is definitively taken or resolved.<br/><br/>To me, the saddest thing about ""PP3"" is that it missed a golden opportunity to ""go out on top"", so to speak, as this is a franchise that is not (despite its previous cash-cow status) going to live on forever. It has already lost a lot of that forward momentum. This could have been a great ""final reunion"" movie that brings everything back together and to a close. That doesn't happen here, though, as instead the tact was more to just create an average PP film and sort of leave the characters adrift at the conclusion. My guess is that the studio producing these films did not yet want to make an ""ending film"" in the series, but I think they will come to regret that decision (this one is not doing well at the box office at all).<br/><br/>Overall, then, ""Pitch Perfect 3"" was a big disappointment to me. The song numbers are literally all this film has going for it. The rest is a mess, and potentially a long-term mess for this franchise as well. It's too bad that the studio wants to milk it dry, as that is exactly what seems to be happening here. Creatively-speaking, ""PP3"" is bone-dry."
"MartinHafer","2","1","4","18 April 2018"," Beyond just jumping the shark!
","I am not the sort of person who you'd expect to watch any of the ""Pitch Perfect"" films. However, my daughter begged me to try and I actually did enjoy 1 and 2. They were fun and non-demanding films....a nice change of pace from the often serious foreign films I often watch. So, it's not surprising that this 50-something guy decided to see the third movie in the franchise.<br/><br/>My biggest feeling while seeing ""Pitch Perfect 3"" was that they've 'jumped the shark'. If you aren't familiar with the phrase, it's a reference to the TV show ""Happy Days"" and refers to when it (and other shows or franchises) have peaked and they are desperately trying to keep your attention by doing awful things with the characters, such as introducing Cousin Oliver on ""The Brady Bunch"" or having Fonzie jump a pool full of sharks in his motorcycle. Instead of the semi-believable plots like there were in 1 and 2, the writers had obviously run out of ideas and were grasping at straws here. After all, what else would explain Amy having a super-villain father who kidnaps the A Capella group?? And, this is made worse with plot elements like bee attacks, more crude language and a strong emphasis on making the group sort of like hiphop stars! <br/><br/>
Overall, this is a very badly written and even embarrassing film...one that seems cynical and has little regard to the fans who embraced and enjoyed the series."

To tell the truth, the subplot concerning the Fat Amy character and her dad-played by a game John Lithgow-seemed like it belonged to another movie though it was fun having Fat Amy becoming an action hero and Lithgow doing an Australian accent. Anna Kendrick is, as always, charming both as her character and singing the familiar songs from the present to about 30 years ago. That goes with the other females in the cast as well.

While not as good as the original, this tale toned down the comedic prompts and overacting, to deliver a nice little wrap up to the series as a whole. Beca's story is touching and not only ties the rest of the crew in, but also gives you the emotional finesse that this series is famous for. The musical numbers, while not as impressive as previous installments in terms of showmanship, has the same toe tapping power we adore in this series, so get ready to buy another soundtrack. Yet the movie still has room for improvement, primarily in utilizing its characters and the story. Many of my favorite characters were diluted in the movie, and the rivals continue to pale in comparison to the Trebletones this time in their limited screen time.

"2001ASOfan","5","1","5","23 December 2017"," Kind of enjoyed it, but...
","This was a tough film to rate. The performers are clearly having a ball, and undoubtedly had even more fun off-screen as well. It does feel like we the audience are being invited along on an overseas vacation, a lark, an all-stops-out, almost drunken-silly reunion of friends, and that may be its central problem: it felt to me like the director and actors (and screenwriters) were having so much fun on location improvising and goofing (and singing and dancing) that they forgot to include an engaging plot or any attempt at coherence and effort to make a great comedy ""finale"" for the Pitch Perfect series. Even John Lithgow, one of my favorite actors (especially in comedies), seems to have dropped any pretense of effort at real acting or performance in favor of chewing the scenery, bugging out his eyes, and playing with a very odd-sounding Australian accent (this may be an inside joke that those from Australia WILL get a big laugh out of because it's so off, but it just sounded, well, like a bad attempt at an accent to me). Anna Kendrick and especially Rebel Wilson, and many of the returning players (Elizabeth Banks, I'm looking at you) clearly improvised much of the dialogue using the ""throw everything at the wall and see what sticks"" method of improv, but, unfortunately, the editor didn't take out the not-so-great moments. It's still fun to watch them all at times, and the musical numbers are slick and well-choreographed, as always in these ""Pitch Perfect"" films, but this Part 3 ""finale"" (I say that in quotes because it sure would not surprise me one bit if they are back for #4 if this one is a hit) is truly just OK, hence my settling on a middling 5-star (out of 10) rating. One thing, though, I sure do think Rebel Wilson deserves another shot at a major sitcom where her improv goofiness can shine (with the help of an editor and sharp-eyed director)--she won me over by film's end, yet again, especially during the final ""action-film"" section of scenes (without giving anything away). She is a talented hoot."
"kjproulx","5","1","6","23 December 2017"," A Fine Conclusion, I Guess
","Look, I'm not going to be the person who says that they love the original Pitch Perfect film and let that cloud my judgment into thinking its sequels are just as great because they're not. The release of Pitch Perfect back in 2012 was an anomaly. I quite enjoy watching that film and when Pitch Perfect 2 hit theatres, I found myself mildly enjoying it for the musical numbers but ultimately seeing it as a retread. Pitch Perfect 3 is now playing in theatres around the world and I can't say much more about this addition either if I'm being honest, but at least it tried to be different. If you're a fan of the first two, here are the elements that may intrigue you during your viewing of this third and probably final installment.<br/><br/>Pitch Perfect 3 follows the Bellas after they've graduated University and moved on to the real world, trying to start careers. When they all realize their lives are miserable without being a part of this team, they form together one last time to travel the world, performing for the troops. This leads them on a journey that will have them realize where they belong in life and possibly even sprout lifelong careers for them. Although incredibly uneven, this film intends to give a solid swan song to these characters in order to conclude a trilogy, and the result is satisfying for fans, but it's not enough to dig itself out of familiar territory.<br/><br/>As I mentioned, this is a film that tries to be very different, injecting family aspects and action sequences, but it feels like too much of a departure from the first two movies in terms of story. Many of the jokes are funny for fans of this trilogy, but many of them are sadly just repeats from past films. The best part about these two sequels are easily the musical numbers. I can replay certain scenes from Pitch Perfect 3 in my head and remember having a good time in the theatre, but I very soon realized the inconsistent premise when comparing it to its predecessors.<br/><br/>I will say that the third act of this film definitely does a good job in taking care of its characters and truly making you feel like this is the end of a trilogy, but it was a little too late for me by that time. Yes, I enjoyed the musical aspect of the movie, but the heart of the first film just isn't there anymore. Watching characters interact, fall in love, and build chemistry was truly what made me enjoy the first movie so much. Sadly, with many of the cast members mysteriously absent from this installment, it just felt off to me. It makes very lazy attempts to explain why they're no longer around, making me just want to watch the first two again.<br/><br/>In the end, I can't say that I disliked this movie, but I didn't like it that much as an overall product either. Yes, the musical numbers and mash-ups are awesome to hear and see performed, but the story itself, along with the interaction of the cast is what made the original as good as it is, and that is the main thing I couldn't seem to find here. I would recommend this movie to hardcore fans of the first two installments, but this movie is surely not for newcomers. I enjoyed the aspects of this film that called back to the first and second and certain characters are given their due, but I just can't truly recommend that a theatrical experience is necessary. Pitch Perfect 3 is a fine conclusion for fans, but not a very good movie overall."

In it's thrid and final(?) installment, the Bellas are ""approaching their 30's"" which is all too evident upon them witnessing their shiny and bright, youthful replacements.<br/><br/>While caught-up in their average and miserable jobs, so it seems, the girls are ""reunited"" (not really since a good portion of them live together) at a current Bella Bardens performance via Pitch Perfect 2's Hailee Steinfeld. When their so-called reunion heads South, the Bellas realize how much they miss singing together. Thus, former leader Aubrey (Anna Camp) gets the Bellas an opportunity to sing for the troops in the Army in a USO tour.<br/><br/>But, what are the Bellas if there's no singing compeition to challenge them? Upon their arrival they instantly size-up the other entertainers around - ""Saddle Up"" and ""Evermoist"" to be exact, by challenging them to a riff-off. ""A what"" is the groups' response. Soon after they learn of what is the actual competiton, music producer DJ Khaled who is judging the groups over the course of the three performances they'll have to pull-off. Then he'll select one winning group to open for him in a final performance as well as sign onto a record deal. <br/><br/>The Bellas once again prove that even in the most complicated oppositions, which in this case they must compete against real bands with instruments, and a pesky villain played by Ruby Rose, the front woman of ""Evermoist"" they hold their ground with an old-fashioned type of show.<br/><br/>During their travels, Amy (Rebel Wilson) has her own reunion which is with her Dad, Fergus (portrayed by John Lithgow). This side plotline is a distraction which the film could have done without. The intent of Fergus took the fun and light-hearted comedy into a unwanted direction that is not common with the previous ""Pitch Perfect"" films. Actor John Lithgow's Australian accent could have used much improvement."

","My guilty pleasure is movies like this. Light, funny, stupid...
But even for me this was way too over the top and all over the place.
The sub plot didn't make any sense, so it felt like it was just thrown in randomly. Or actually it felt like the Becca-storyline was the sub plot and Amy the main thing.
In earlier movies Becca was more the star, but now this more like Amy's movie. Kind a weird decision in my opinion.
If you don't know how to make a ""mysterious spy"" movie twist, then just don't. Even the musical numbers were kind of lame and had lost their spark.
Also how each of the characters' stories were closed had so many clichés that I started to wonder if this movie was supposed to be parody.
Probably not, but it certainly felt like it. Boring, jokes were lame, characters felt tired... Can't recommend."

Attempting to rekindle their past magic they bound together, join a USO tour, and-while the rest is really left for the viewer to discover, the third time is definitely not the charm as this mediocre sequel throws out lots of unfunny lines, contrived scenarios, underwhelming musical numbers, and inane supporting characters, including Lithgow (seemingly trying to do a sendup of Crocodile Dundee) who looks like he belongs in a different film altogether. Padded and forgettable, this is a waste of good talent and definitely not the ending that this series deserves. *½"

It was almost a distraction from the main storyline but it was very fun. The jokes wernt laugh out loud but many of them were funny. Its just a shame that the best joke in the movie was already given away in the trailers. But Beccas storyline with DJ Khaled was great and really added much more depth to the story. Its a shame that Jessie didnt return, it feels like Baccas and Jessies relationship in the past 2 movies was pointless. Overall a very fun movie and would recommend that you give it a shot."

","The songs have lost fuel. This was more of a world tour. Three week earlier, now we found out why there were singing like silly children. And now we found that why girls have low emotional intelligence. Not only the casting, as they want to gel as a group but from the director. Trish Sie just uses forced feminism all the way.

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","4","0","1","25 October 2018"," Gotta love 'em, but these pitches have run out of steam
","If ""Pitch Perfect 2"" was a care-free, money-making victory lap for the writers/producers who managed to strike comedy gold the first time they made a movie about collegiate a cappella, what does that make ""Pitch Perfect 3?"" Choreographed singing and dancing on the grave of what was once a funny, charming and original 2013 comedy, perhaps.<br/><br/>As with any franchise three films deep, those who endeavor to watch ""Pitch Perfect 3"" have formed an attachment to the characters to the extent that satisfaction comes merely from seeing them again, or in this case, finding out what they've been up to since college. The Bellas are all struggling to adapt to post-college life with no jobs or cruddy ones, when Aubrey (Anna Camp) pulls a plot out of thin air and says she has a military connection that will allow the group to reunite for a brief USO tour.<br/><br/>The storylines that develop on said tour are all recycled or preposterously fabricated, with the group feeling threatened by the other acts on the tour that ""use instruments"" and Fat Amy's father (John Lithgow, with a delightful Aussie accent) dropping in unannounced. The musical numbers-once again the bright spots of this series-get artificially inseminated into the story, including a head-scratching ""battle"" with the theme of ""artists you didn't know were Jewish.""<br/><br/>Writer Kay Cannon had stayed involved with all three scripts, and she's kind of phoned it in on this one, even with the help of a solid collaborator in Mike White. If the story had stayed with these struggling post-college Millennials rather than swooping them off to Spain, France, etc. something good could've come of it. Instead, the ignorable plot puts more pressure on the humor, which like ""Pitch Perfect 2"" is hit or miss, with a lot of the same bits and tired jokes about each of the Bellas resurfacing.<br/><br/>That said, Cannon has always kept the spirit of these films as fairly self-aware, even at their lowest points. Director Trish Sie, who made her name directing a few viral OK Go videos including the famous treadmill dance, recognizes that irreverent spirit, but doesn't add any creative ingenuity, opting instead to follow the template set before her. Considering the musical scenes generally stand alone, there's no reason there couldn't be a few knockout music video-esque concepts baked in as diversions from the poor story.<br/><br/>The music is great, Elizabeth Banks and John Michael Higgins could banter all film long and I'd eat it up, but the storylines and characters have been stretched as far they can go. It's an aca-awesome ride that will mercifully come to an end.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more"

","Not great, not all that terrible- a decent watch if you're bored and need to kill some time, or drone out the usual rational voice in your head.<br/><br/>Pitch Perfect has always been more of a guilty watch, I never expected a fine art film with a gripping storyline or uh, logic. But that said, I think they pushed it a little too far... Man, I can even forgive DJ Khaled and the Ballistic Bees (which incidentally would make a great band name), or heck, even John Lithgow's manipulative parenting. But the rescue mission with Fat Amy, and the sudden unexplained popularity at the competition- just 'being themselves'; I really expected something novel, at least musically- considering the first movie's rise to fame is almost 88% because of the MUSIC. It would've been interesting to use some elements of the 'Cup' in the performance (since they were instrument-less, also they HAD a rapper in their team?! And choreographed dancing? Why were these elements so under-used?). <br/><br/>Perhaps they could've dived more into an Army based storyline (Listen. How. Is an internationally wanted criminal floating right under the nose of the Army? This is just bad writing. You're telling me the other Major Army Dad didn't think of doing ANY recon on his daughter's teammates? They didn't sign any freaking scary-ass documents to enter this in the first place? The whole Army tangent could've added a lot more realism to the story. I would've been 100% okay if the American Army swooped in and saved their butts- THE SHIP WASN'T EVEN IN INTERNATIONAL WATERS- IT WAS LITERALLY 2KMS FROM THE COAST.)<br/><br/>Pitch Perfect 4 better not be Anna Kendrick recruiting these girls for her new album. Honestly I'd rather see a biography-styled film about Fat Amy and her Fat-Celebrity franchise fighting copyright issues in court for freedom of expression. <br/><br/>Minus the gaping plot hotels and under-utilised script and actors, I've always, always loved the cast and have even made it a point to watch their other work, so I don't have only this to judge their skills by. If the studio has them under contract and they're forced to do more of these- I really hope they replace the writers."

","'Pitch Perfect 3' may be an entertaining film, just like it's predecessors, however it lacks the charm that made the first film a success. The simple goal in any comedy film is to make it funny and entertain its audience, which 'Pitch Perfect 3' certainly does. Its well-loved characters are back, with all of their quirks and crass one-liners. Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson) is the obvious highlight of the film, which was intended. While she may have only been a minor character in the first film, everybody found her that funny that she had a bigger role in the sequel. I was quite unsure about that idea, as I preferred her as a side character - she was funnier that way. Everything is funnier in small doses. However, in 'Pitch Perfect 3' Wilson's character is taken further than just having a bigger part and she now had her own storyline throughout the film that was essentially ridiculous and far-fetched. It was quite a weak attempt to make this film unique from the rest of the films, but in the end, it was wildly amusing and produced several laughs. Other than that storyline, the remainder of the movie felt just like the other movies - especially with Becca's (Anna Kendrick) storyline which was essentially the same as the previous film. The cast itself, with their comedic deliverance, were able to save this film from being an absolute bore. Kendrick and Wilson were the standouts in the film, as far as cast members go, along with Brittany Snow and Hailee Steinfeld. As for the music, which the Pitch Perfect franchise is so well known for, was ultimately a disappointment. It wasn't as good as the original film, the highly anticipated 'riff-off' was a disaster and the finale had the wrong focus. Alas many of these flaws, 'Pitch Perfect 3' was still able to give out many cheap laughs and is worth watching if you are a fan of the previous films."

","The Bellas are back in what is clearly intended to be a final film, although the lure of the mighty buck is not something to be easily denied, so who knows.<br/><br/>This time they are off to entertain the troops around the Mediterranean and, guess what, they find themselves in a contest again and, as usual, find themselves subject to hostile judgement from the two hostile commentators who, this time, are making a documentary. Add to the mix Fat Amy's Dad, who arrives on his luxury yacht to see his daughter perform, But he's not necessarily a very nice person...<br/><br/>The plot here is the daftest yet. The girls are increasingly anonymous, with Rebel Wilson overwhelming everything, Anna Kendrick coming 2nd, Hailee Steinfeld 3rd, Brittany Snow 33rd, and the rest indistinguishable from each other. The very funny Hana Mae Lee as Lily gets distressingly little to do.
John Lithgow gets to do an Australian accent which, in terms of accuracy, trails some distance behind Dick van Dyke's cockney one.<br/><br/>The musical numbers are well arranged and (mostly) well staged, but I didn't find most of the songs very good: the hummability factor was low."

","I've now seen all the Pitch Perfect films which may be a surprise for a single 26-year-old guy, but I'll admit the first one was entertaining. It could be argued they should have stopped at one, but this one has its redeemable points. For example, I never thought I'd ever see John Litgow singing, but I'm thankful that is in the world now. <br/><br/>The story was predictable and the sudden fighting sequence of the usually clumsy Fat Amy was just odd to watch and seemed out of place from the entire Pitch Perfect universe. Finally the fact that the main plot line is trying to impress DJ Khaled who is portrayed as the epitome of music is laughable. Looking forward to number four where Beca begins work on her first album and brings the Bellas back in to help with vocals... because that's how predictable these films have become, but Brittany Snow will continue to bring me back."

I'm not even going to waste anyone's time on pulling it apart in a review - it was a waste of our time trying to suffer through it, so I won't waste yours with reviewing something miserable. There are so many great movies and good ones out there to watch - this should NOT be the one to waste time and money on. The script is terrible, and you can't ask for or expect much from actors when the script becomes ridiculous. It's painful to watch and embarrassing for actors who probably envisioned something much better than this. The only reason this even gets two stars is because the singing is pitch perfect."
"lunalovitt","2","0","1","8 April 2018"," Easily the worst...
","I loved PP1 and was pleasantly surprised by PP2, but this movie... This movie was horrible. It's like they picked the things that were bad about the first two and focused solely on making those the main parts of the movie. I really wanted to like this movie, don't get me wrong. I went into watching it thinking that it would be a lovely hour and a half of good music and funny story. Instead there was... like... no music? Yeah, they sang a bit and there was kind of a competition, but in the end this movie focused on some weird out of left field backstory for Fat Amy that NOBODY wanted. At all. Like... why? Normally I don't get angry at movies, but this is the first exception I've had in a long time. So let's break it down.<br/><br/>First off, let's look at the group in general. The movie brings back most of the cast from the first and second movies. At least, the female cast. The love interests from the first two are completely gone and barely glossed over and one of the more interesting female characters gets written out because she's pregnant (And oh boy she's a whore so she doesn't know who the baby's dad is. So hilarious.... I guess.) Not that Stacie was the most interesting character around, but at least she was memorable. Not sure why she was written out (other than maybe political gripes), but I let it slide. To be fair, hardly anyone in the main cast gets much attention in this movie other than Beca, Fat Amy, and Chloe. Speaking of which, let's get down to the plot and sub-plots.<br/><br/>Let's address the elephant in the room. The drug dealer international criminal father background for Fat Amy was so far out of left field that it was not good. At all. It was surprising, but not in a good way. And then suddenly she's some kind of kung fu expert who can take down a ship full of bad guys? There is no way the Fat Amy in the first two movies is the same as this one. Not only that, but she's even more unlikeable in this movie. Her character went from funny in the first to okay in the second and now just completely unlikeable. Her incompetence and overall crappy freeloading attitude is just grating. I'm not sure why the main plot of the movie had to be a conflict between her and her estranged father. <br/><br/>Then there's Beca's will-they won't-they relationship with this new guy and the story of how she's an amazing music artist/producer and blah blah blah. As much as I like her, Beca's character fell flat in this movie as well. She was... more of a stiff board than anything else. I was very sad to find that she just didn't stand out and honestly I didn't find myself invested in anything she did. Her best part in the movie was in the first act where she quits her job. Everything else... is meh. And really, this new guy Theo is nothing compared to Jesse. There is no chemistry and it's so forced that it's painful to watch.<br/><br/>Speaking of forced romances, Chloe and Chicago were also a boring subplot. Are they a cute couple? Yes. Was it a believable relationship? Eh, depends on who you ask. At least someone ended up happy, I guess? I was also very annoyed that the Aubrey subplot with her father was only resolved in the ending credit scenes. Poorly played, but at least it was a satisfying ending unlike literally every other ending in the movie.<br/><br/>A lot about the story's plot really didn't do it for me. And the ""competition"" wasn't really a competition at all, or at least there was no real supporting story for it. We start out with the Bella's realizing these other artists are really good, even better than them, and then... Nothing happens? Somehow they still end up moving forward and Beca gets chosen as the winner? I mean, really, DSM was a far more compelling ""rival"" than anyone in this movie because you got to see the Bellas struggle against their adversaries and attempt to better themselves. In this movie the ""rivals"" were barely side characters and just there for a brief time to show that there was something more to the movie than Fat Amy's boring and unlikeable plot line. Not only that, but the Bellas did not evolve at all. There was no internal struggle or dealing with issues like in the past two films. It was like the Bellas themselves were just a backseat plot.<br/><br/>Speaking of boring, the music really suffered in this movie. I came into this expecting great musical numbers, but instead we got brief snippets of songs and no real finale song. Sure, there was a somewhat short final piece of Beca and her friends, but there was no production to it. I get the meaning behind it, but I wouldn't be bothered as much had there been an actual attempt at a big choreographed and well-written song scene in the movie. In fact, the music itself took a backseat to Fat Amy. Yes, her story rears its ugly head again in this review, but that's because this is how it was in the movie. You'd move on to the promise of music and the Bellas and then end up straight back in the awful Fat Amy drug smuggling daddy plot.<br/><br/>So all in all? This movie suffered a great deal due to Fat Amy and the backstory we never wanted. PP movies are about the music and the Bellas. Instead this may as well have been called ""Fat Amy: The Movie"". A movie, mind you, that nobody wanted. There was no good music pieces in it and there was no real story for the Bellas. It's like everything was being thrown in last minute and as a result nothing got the spotlight other than one poorly executed and unentertaining bit. I hate saying it, but I hated this movie. It wasn't worth my time or money and it is a sore disappointment as the end of the PP trilogy."

","This movie is riddled with sub plots because the main plot of the story is too boring and short to warrant a full length film.

Without spoilers, the movie would have been OK without the whole incredibly lame, unbelievable, Fat Amy side story which makes zero sense and feels like a tumor hanging onto the side of the movie. A Fat Amy side story sounds good, but its really, really not. And no one seems to care that Fat Amy literally murders multiple people? But they are all men so it doesn't count is that it?
A fun, musical movie doesn't need to be turned into violent (however ridiculously fake) murder. especially when said murders arent even acknowledged. 
No Trebblemakers and no (well not really any) Stacie Hot Girl also make matters worse.

Their group chemistry is the heart and soul of this franchise. Beca and Fat Amy have a great back and forth relationship. However, Fat Amy's ridiculous story is not funny and her gimmick gets less fun especially without Beca. This is a collapsing franchise. Like others before it, this one goes over to Europe to speed up the decline. The writing is clunky and a throwback to bad sequel writing. It's weak and cliche in a bad way.

","I was introduced to the series back in 2015 by my s/o and I had my doubts, but ended up loving them. Unfortunately, the 3rd installment fell short imo. The Treblemakers not being in the film other than a mention in a passing conversation. No Jessie, Bumper, or Benji. The espionage esq sub plot was awful. They should have stopped at PP2. The only real highlight were the characters of Gail and John. I will applaud Kendrick for refusing to let her character be romantically involved with anyone other than Jessie, and the Chloe romance was not terrible."

","Pitch Perfect 3 (2017)
This is a musical comedy film that is a sequel to Pitch Perfect 2 (2015), and the third and final installment in the series. It stars Anna Kendrick, Anna Camp, Rebel Wilson, Brittany Snow, Hailee Steinfeld, Hana Mae Lee, Ester Dean, Chrissie Fit, Alexis Knapp, John Lithgow, Ruby Rose, Kelley Jakle, Shelley Regner, Elizabeth Banks, and John Michael Higgins. The film follows the Bellas, now graduated from college, reuniting for one final performance together during an overseas USO tour. The group, of awesome nerds, will come together to make some music, and some questionable decisions, one last time. The film received poor reviews but was profitable and we'll accepted by the viewing public. It may merely be one too many. Don't get me wrong, the music was great and it still has its funny moments. However, the plots get thinner and thinner."

","It was bad and i say again it was pretty bad. Taking away the main gems that made the previous 2 so amazing but they tried a totally different path this time which literally murdered the movie , we wanted to see singing but we were thrown some stupid action sequences and predictable story , we wanted comedy but what we got were same lame jokes not funny at all apart from few and the competition thingy was the final nail in the coffin, worst antogonist and wrost overall feeling to the competitions we have seen earlier and the movie seems too rushed it felt like they were making a titanic sequel and they totally wanted to avoid making pitch perfect 3 :) .
 Maybe it was not the movie but instead of expectations that let us down.."

","Pitch Perfect 3 is okay. There are some fun laughs but overall kind of a disappointment. There weren't very catch songs and the whole action level added just seemed so extra."

","I had heard it really wasn't that great a movie but I wanted ot see it anyway because I LOVED the first and liked the 2nd. But sometimes even though you expect something ot not be great its still a major nummer when its worse than you thought it might be. I think I laughed out loud maybe twice and both were lines by John Michael Higgins but even he and Gail couldnt save the movie. Its almost like they couldn't agree which storyline to go with so they threw a bunch at the wall and said lets see what sticks! And the ""action"" storyline with fat amy really fell flat for me. Even John Lithgow who pretty much can do no wrong in my mind wasn't making it work. I think Amy is better in small doses. and I really missed Jesse Bumper and Benji. I kind of had a feeling Benji wouldnt be in it due to Evan Hanson but still disappointing to not get the other two in at all and only a quick mention about them. All in all disappointing."
"SpeakingEye","Null","0","1","3 January 2018"," A Pitch Perfect Mess of a Film
","I am a huge fan of Pitch Perfect; it is that rare film where you can watch countless times and always be entertained by the brilliant cast, writing, songs and general feel good that surrounds a movie where all involved know they are creating something special.<br/><br/>Pitch Perfect 2 pretty much drained all the good will I had for the series; a real let down.<br/><br/>When I saw there was a Pitch Perfect 3 I was really suspicious but we movie fans are sentimental at heart; we want to see the good in a franchise that provided such a great first film. So I bought my ticket and then proceeded to watch what I confidently predict to be the worst film I will watch this year. <br/><br/>Pitch Perfect 3 is a great example of how franchise owners foolishly believe that a returning cast can re-create magic time after time, even when given a lame plot, script and new weak supporting characters. This film only shows how wrong this approach is. The brilliant Elizabeth Banks and John Michael Higgins are recycled, only this time with truly awful lines. Rebel Wilson was clearly considered by the producers to be a comic genius in the first film but clearly gave us her best lines (about 2 of them) back in the first film. Even Anna Kendrick cannot save this film. The basic problem is that in trying to go out on a high, the discipline of the first film is lost to self-indulgent terrible ad libbing and a weak plot centred around Wilson as an action hero.<br/><br/>Ok so what would I have done differently? The re-uniting for the USO tour could have focused much more on cheering up battle scarred troops which would have added some much needed depth to the film. There could have been a great opening to the film starting with Beca visiting each character in their new ordinary lives to persuade them to return to the group. The DJ competition should have been ditched completely. They should also have paid any money to have Adam Devine and Skylar Astin to reprise their roles as their relationships with the girls provided so much to the first film's success. Aubrey's relationship with her father could also have been explored in much more depth and Fat Amy with a half decent script and solid soldier character support could have been the love interest this time.<br/><br/>Despite all of the above, I will always be thankful to the cast and crew for bringing the original Pitch Perfect to the screen. It will always be a go to movie for when I need cheering up. I really hope that all concerned know that its time for the series to say goodbye."
"RforFilm","5","0","1","29 December 2017"," What can I say? It's Pitch Perfect 3. Fans of the series will like it fine, but it's just passable in my book
","Looks like we've got another Pitch Perfect movie out. I might as well talk about them. I'll admit they've never been a favorite series of mine. I find them a tad annoying and perhaps full of themselves. That's not to say I don't understand why people get into them. They've made a lot of money, and I base that on the one element that's done well; the singing. Those that have been in a capella groups know how difficult it is to recreate instrumental sounds. It's the same thing as beatboxing. Don't tell me your impressed when someone can make guitar and electronic sounds all with their vocals. <br/><br/>Do the Pitch Perfect movies do well for a capella groups in college? Probably. Can they translate out to movies? Sometimes. The previous movies have had their strengths, as I said in the singing department and even some laughs, but their not something I'd return to on my own. I've mentioned before that third movies in franchises tend to be the point in which the steam has run out. Has the steam run out for the Bellas? Well...lets look at Pitch Perfect 3 to see what we have. <br/><br/>After graduating since Pitch Perfect 3, the majority of the Bellas are living in New York City as they try to make something of themselves. Beca (played by Anna Kendrick) is trying to make it as a music producer, but quits on principle. Her roommate ""Fat Amy"" played by Rebel Wilson is simply trying to make it as a celebrity. Both seem to be empty since graduating. Though she, Fat Amy, and the other Bellas get invited to a ""reunion"", all it was, was to simply watch the only Bella still in school, Emily (played by Haliee Steinfeld) and her group. She apologizes for misleading the group and treats them to a night out.<br/><br/>While they talk about the good memories of school, former leader of the Bellas Chloe (played by Brittney Snow) tells them that they might be able to perform in the military USO show. Everyone loves the idea and they sign up. Upon arriving, the Bellas find out that not only is it a full competition, but they'll be competing against full bands that use instruments. While the Bellas keep trying to find a better tune and find out what's going to happen after this, Fat Amy's father Fergus (played by John Lithgow) is back after being absent and wants to become close with his daughter.<br/><br/>The best way to describe Pitch Perfect 3 is that it is what it is; a Pitch Perfect sequel. Fans of the series get exactly what they'll be looking for; more singing, more the bellas, and of course, more of Fat Amy saying some offbeat jokes. There's not a lot that separates this from the previous movies other then that the girls are out in the real world. It's just that the majority of those parts are rushed in favor of getting to the main plot.<br/><br/>The one element that feels out of place is a kidnapping subplot that feels out of place. Though I won't say what happens, let's just say that most audience members are going to be looking at their watches wondering how long this movie is. It tries to add on some character history, but who cares? People that love these movies aren't there for a spy thriller. Their there to watch the Bellas sing.<br/><br/>As far as musical sequences are, their done well. It's also a scenario in which the songs and performances are good as before. I know their trying to make it bigger, but the problem is that not only are the Bellas at too much a disadvantage, but the final song feels like something that goes against what a capella groups would do. Maybe it's because the last song in Pitch Perfect 2 felt like a better send off then this does. This has been marketed as the final Pitch Perfect movie, though we'll see what the audience says.<br/><br/>I'll give this five microphones out of ten. What can I say? It's Pitch Perfect 3. If you really liked the first two, then you'll get into this fine. Newcomers (I don't know why you'd start here) should watch the first ones before knowing if this is for them. I'll pass on watching these again, but don't let that stop the fans who love these."
"Pjtaylor-96-138044","4","0","1","28 December 2017"," Not as bad as I'd imagined, but my imagination is pretty vivid.
","It's well documented that the musical is my least favourite of all genres, being the only one that I'll actively go out of my way to avoid, and so the prospects of me liking what is not only a full blown contemporary musical but a weak-chinned third entry into a stalling franchise of a full blown contemporary musical were slim to say the least. Nevertheless, I curled my toes, clenched my teeth and sat back on my newly tightened sphincter as I prepared for a cinematic death unlike any other and, to my surprise, I survived the experience essentially unscathed. It's safe to say that I was pleasantly surprised by the piece, but it's also safe to say that it's an utterly bland and joyless affair offering nothing even close to an original moment and seemingly confusing cringes with crack-ups. No, it wasn't as bad as I'd imagined, but my imagination is pretty vivid. 4/10"
"Jakemcclake","5","0","1","27 December 2017"," Similar To Other Pitch Perfects But, Missing Something
","The women of Pitch Perfect are in this movie, but some of the great things about the first two are missing. Anna Kendrick rocks the screen again with her fantastic smile. There are some good songs in it for, example the song ""Freedom"". But the great appeal of Pitch Perfect is missing somewhere. It is replaced by stories of women having difficulty dealing with being out of College. <br/><br/>There is also a bad sub plot about Fat Amy effectively being...super girl when in a fight. This simply does not work and is hardly believable, entertaining or even interesting. As with the first two, the music still is the reason to watch this, but it is not a good as the music in the first two."
