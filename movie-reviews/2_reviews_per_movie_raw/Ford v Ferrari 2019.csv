","This is what cinema is supposed to be! Amazing chemistry and acting by both leads, seamless CGI and practical effects to enhance the film, a firecracker script, a true story, pulse pounding soundtrack, booming sound mix, and edited so well that 2.5 hours flies by! Completely and utterly engaging . So good in fact I saw it twice within 24 hours . Once in Imax and once in Dolby cinema ."
"nickfarf-42699","10","518","590","15 November 2019"," As close as possible to the truth but!
","I was at the Philadelphia Film center premiere on 11/11/19 to view this terrific movie. At the age of 68 and a tifoso of Ferrari since age 8, ( 1959 ), this movie hit a nerve. Truth vs Fiction. This was a David vs Goliath movie, however Goliath wins. The movie recreates a golden era of auto Racing. It was seriously dangerous with death and injury a guarantee at every race. These drivers were absolute warriors and we're fearless. Now Ferrari winning LeMans six straight years in a row from 1960-1965 is actually the David in this movie. Ferrari for all their dominant winning form was still a tiny company that sold fancy $15,000 sportcars to support his racing team. Winning LeMans was a $16,500 team prize. These Ferrari drivers were salaried. The prototype class at that time was wide open with no upper limit on engine size. There was an under 2 liter class that Porsche and Ferrari dino control, but the over 2 liter was unlimited. I read carefully about the Ford move to acquire Ferrari, as daily news reports would cross the associated press. The movie is spot-on about Ford cars lacking desire back then. Chevrolet had the Corvette, Corvair and sporty looking Impala and Chevelle. Now Ford is the Goliath in this movie. They are the big corporate giant with unlimited resources. Ford paid for the Ford GT. It was really a Lola Gt with a Ford badge put on it. Ford put their name on every innovation provided by all the racing/equipment suppliers that went into that race car. Unlike Ferrari being designed, engineered and built handmade in that Italian factory. Ford spent more money on developing a racecar than the total price to buy Ferrari outright. Hired every Nascar team to provide expert pit crews, engine builders and offered 80,000-100,000 to each driver for one race . Now the movie, it's a movie that non race cars fans can and will enjoy. It shows how Shelby and Miles are really the heroes of the winning team. This was true. Their relationship is spot on in the movie and they know what is needed to win. They battle off the track against Ford executives and against Ferrari on the track. What is not disclosed in the movie is the quitting of the Ferrari ace driver John Surtees. When he left Ferrari, the team was devastated. He along with Ford's Ken Miles were two true warriors. Also not shown but lightly covered in the movie is the three years of disastrous outing for the Ford racing team. Did Shelby steal the Ferrari pits stop watches? Did Shelby actually throw spear lug nuts into the Ferrari pit lane to make the Ferrari pit crew think that the race car was missing a nut on the car out on the track? Did Enzo Ferrari actually tip his hat to honor Ken Miles? Who really knows. Everybody is dead. I remember the lug nut rumour in the 1960s, as that was a southern stock car trick. I never heard about the theft of Ferrari stop watches by Shelby. As far as Ferrari tipping his hat. Ferrari was known for or not attending many races. All that aside, did I as a Ferrari fan enjoy this movie. My answer is a Yes, Yes, Yes. With the exception of James Garner in Grand Prix, this is the best movie to deal with the sport of autoracing. Bonus is that it is also a great human interest story and they create the mood of the sixties as U vividly remember it. I rate this movie a ten and should be nominated for Oscars."

","I've seen a lot of car movies, as a self-professed car nut. As such I judge them harshly, and immediately dismiss entries that don't provide enough reason to care about what is more important than the car: the driver. Think of the Fast and Furious and Transformers franchise. If you care about the driver, and the driver cares about the car, you care about the car. The car is a tool, an extension of the hero's body, and gains provenance with the audience when it helps the hero on their personal journey. Movies that come to mind that do this effectively include Gone in 60 Seconds, Bullitt, Need For Speed, The Italian Job, Batman Begins, and The Bourne Identity. Some of the James Bond movies do it well, like Goldfinger, The Spy Who Loves Me, The Living Daylights, and SkyFall, but many do not because of the lack of character arc in the story. We cannot forget about perhaps the greatest car movie of all time, Back to the Future. The shining example of how to make the car a proper star.<br/><br/>And now enters a film by James Mangold and starring talented actors Matt Damon and Christian Bale called Ford v. Ferrari. My arms crossed, and expectations lowered, I was ready to be disappointed. Although I love Mangold as a director, somehow I assumed there would be a Michael Bay approach to the movie, putting more emphasis on car action sequences than the characters. To my surprise, not only was I dead wrong, but the film became one of the best car movies I had ever seen.<br/><br/>Thinking back, I should have known better. Unlike many car action oriented movies, this one is based on a true story, and fact-based dramas tend to take themselves more seriously. It is sort of a shared biopic between legendary sports car designer Carroll Shelby and race car driver Ken Miles. The movie focuses on their efforts to beat Ferrari at Le Mans, a story I'm well aware of (like I said, bonafide car nut). And Mangold is an Oscar winning filmmaker collaborating with Oscar winning people such as Damon and Bale.<br/><br/>And boy do their talents shine in this movie. The driving engine of the story, if you will, is the loving but at times clashing relationship between Shelby and Miles, portrayed brilliantly by Damon and Bale in a manner that in my opinion is more entertaining and engaging than the dynamic duo of DiCaprio and Pitt in Once Upon A Time ... in Hollywood. Damon and Bale have different styles of acting, but both arrive at the same place: creating a character that faces disappointment in the search for victory.<br/><br/>Shelby has to come to terms with the disappointment of having to quit his racing career due to heart problems, and creating a winning team at Le Mans is his way of proving to himself he's still a winner. Miles is desperate not to disappoint himself because unlike Shelby, he's never had a shot at winning at a big race. This is due to his abrasive personality, despite an amazing talent on the race track. On top of this, Miles desperately doesn't want to disappoint his wife and son, who support him fervently in his dream. Both characters have their own obstacles in search of escaping disappointment, with Shelby dealing with the suits at Ford and Miles dealing with problems of the car in the race as they present themselves, and the trial of besting the other race car drivers. Their individual struggles intersect in the mutual desire to win at Le Mans, resulting in a brotherhood and mutual love for each other that feels genuine and earned.<br/><br/>Henry Ford II, played by a very effective Tracy Letts, reveals in a quick but moving scene why he wants to win at Le Mans. After Shelby takes Ford on a whirlwind nauseating ride with the new race car they have engineered, Ford breaks into tears. Not so much because of the physically jarring experience of being jostled around at breakneck speed, but because of what the car means to his family name. ""I had no idea. If only my dad were alive to see this,"" he tells Shelby. Damon, in that scene, responds with wet eyes. The character Ford reveals how much he doesn't want to disappoint his family legacy. In fact, the entire endeavor started with an insult from Ferrari, stating, ""You're only Henry Ford the second, you'll never be Henry Ford."" And in an earlier scene, Ford compares himself to his legendary grandfather in a speech to Ford factory workers concerning his disappointment in current company sales.<br/><br/>Cars represent man's desire to chase a dream. Whether it be designing the fastest car, or driving cars the fastest. And despite all the obstacles that may get in man's way, the biggest one is always himself. But with perseverance and the help of others, this obstacle can too be overcome. Ford v. Ferrari manages to get to the heart of this message with deceptive ease and supreme confidence. The film's absolutely gorgeous cinematography and direction capture some of the most amazing car sequences ever put to the big screen. A surprising but believable behind the scenes factoid is that Mangold and the cast are not car nuts at all, and were simply moved to tell the story of the characters. This is why the movie works so well, because they understood the car as supporting the story rather than the other way around.<br/><br/>Ford v. Ferrari is an absolute winner, with memorable performances from its cast, and my favorite Mangold picture thus far. For me, it is one of the best of the year, and as far as car movies go, one of the best ever made, and miles away from a disappointment."

"Kikisaurus","8","62","72","12 February 2020"," I know nothing of cars or racing, nor do I care about either yet....
","To start off, I have always hated racing. Yes, hated. It think it's a ridiculous waste of resources, and boring to watch. I have zero interest in cars - and thus I know absolutely nothing of the history. I knew nothing of this film beyond reading the blurb before I started watching it, so I was very interested to see whether I would like it at all. I did. Despite being so uninterested in the subject, the film got me interested in the story, and especially during the final race I was on the edge of seat not knowing what would happen. Fantastic acting job from both Damon and Bale, usual. They never disappoint. Excellent writing, directing, cutting, sound editing.. A very whole package overall.<br/><br/>To finish off; I am STILL not interested in cars or racing, but this film stands on its own even so."

","Just saw F v F at the Telluride Film Festival and it is phenomenal. Perfect performances, incredible visuals and editing, immersive sound, and a riveting story. A real winner. Christian Bale lost 70 pounds Defoe the role and is a delight. Damon is spot on. Catriona Balfe is excellent. All the actors playing Ford executives are excellent as well. Masterful direction from James Mangold. A must see."
"Keemshave","9","125","156","21 November 2019"," An exhilarating and emotional ride
","A lot of notes were hit by Ford v Ferrari. The characters are fleshed out very well and give you the emotional attachment you're looking for in a movie. Bale and Damon's performances are great; they pull you into the story and completely disappear into their roles. James Mangold proves, once again, to be a master behind the camera. The action scenes are shot to perfection and will have you biting your nails.<br/><br/>The film's technical aspects were top-notch as well. Wait for this film to be nominated for sound design and editing. These technical aspects, during the climax of the film, will blow your hair back and give you goosebumps.<br/><br/>All in all, this film provides a pleasing experience for the crowd that not many films can even come close to delivering. I loved about every second of it, despite its long runtime."
"kjproulx","9","198","257","10 September 2019"," Filled with Energy
","Biopics can be a hard sell at times. Whether you're diving into the troubled life of an addict or exploring someone's sexuality, there are many touchy subjects these days. With that said, I feel there are also those that will stand the test of time, in terms of being able to please a wide audience. Ford v Ferrari is one of the latest true stories out of Hollywood that will be hitting the big screen soon, and here's why I believe it absolutely deserves attention.<br/><br/>Following multiple characters throughout, Ford v Ferrari focussed on the fact that Henry Ford II was given an idea to create the fastest race car in the world. His mission is to take down the likes of the company Ferrari, who have held the title for years. Carol Shelby (Matt Damon) is approached by a member of the Ford team and is recruited, only to be the one finding himself recruiting the driver in Ken Miles (Christian Bale). That's the core premise and there's a lot to dive into from there.<br/><br/>If you're a fan of racing or cars in general, this movie will be for you. This is a very well-directed film by James Mangold, and the racing sequences are quite long, taking up a good chunk of the nearly 150-minute run time. Luckily, they are very intense, practically shot, with a fantastic score to back it up, and sound effects to get your heart pumping. Everything about the exciting aspects of this film was top notch.<br/><br/>Christian Bale and Matt Damon give stellar performances here as the two leading men in the film and I totally bought their rigid friendship that slowly developed. Sadly, without giving anything away, there is an incident that I feel was not explored enough, which slightly took away when a certain moment is meant to impact the movie. Other than that, this is a fantastic movie from beginning to end.<br/><br/>In the end, Ford v Ferrari is engaging, emotional, and downright thrilling when it wants to be. I was invested in these characters and on the edge of my seat during the climactic races. I thoroughly enjoyed my experience with this movie. There is a missed opportunity in terms of emotion during a certain scene, but I was able to forgive that, seeing as the rest of the movie was so impressive. Ford v Ferrari is one of the best movies I've seen so far this year and it will be one to see when it officially releases."

","Ford V Ferrari is one of the best movies I've seen this year, and for someone who has little interest in cars besides minivans and SUVs, that's saying a lot.

A supremely well-balanced combination of corporate rivalry, on-track competitiveness and human drama."

Everything that needs to be said has already been said about the two leading stars in the movie but big shout out to the supporting cast including Jon Bernthal who was great.<br/><br/>The story is good but it's a biographical drama so not much can be changed even though there were few liberties were taken with few facts that were presented.<br/><br/>The sound design was excellent which made your heart race faster when you heard the roar of the Ford GT 40!<br/><br/>Cinematography by Phedon (who was also the cinematographer for the pursuit of happiness) gives us some nice shots of the race which immerses you into action.<br/><br/>I got to watch it as part of secret preview show! It will get few Oscar nominations but doubt it would claim any big prize.

","Review:
'Ford v Ferrari' is a sports-drama film directed by James Mangold.
What a film this is! I really wish I had waited to do my top ten list of 2019 until I seen this movie. My eyes were glued to the screen the whole time I was watching it.
The plot follows a determined team of American engineers and designers, led by automotive visionary Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) and his British driver, Ken Miles (Christian Bale), who are dispatched by Henry Ford II (Tracy Letts) and Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal) with the mission of building the Ford GT40, a new racing car with the potential to finally defeat the perennially dominant Ferrari racing team at the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans race in France.
Christian Bale and Matt Damon give stellar performances here as the two leading men in the film and I totally bought their rigid friendship that slowly developed. Jon Bernthal shows that he is more than an action guy when it comes to his acting capabilities, and Josh Lucas might just be the evillest villain to come out of 2019, including Thanos himself. What a dick he is in this movie and he plays it to perfection.
James Mangold proves, once again, to be a master behind the camera. The action scenes are shot to perfection and will have you biting your nails. The race scenes have the tension they need, and Matt Damon and Christian Bale bring the humor without over doing it.
Overall, this is entertainment at its finest. There are some true story films that don't relate well to the big screen, this one will excel expectations. Great direction with a phenomenal cast is an A+.
5/5"

","If you're not a car/racing nut, don't be put off by the title. Even though the storyline is about the real life battle between the two car giants, the best thing about this film is Damon's and Bale's on-screen friendship, the cherry on the cake being Christian Bales portrayal of Ken Miles.

"jc_hans","9","18","26","19 January 2020"," As good as ""Rush"" but in a different way...
","Yes indeed, I say it; as good as ""Rush"" (the rivalry between Hunt and Lauda). This movie focuses on the rivalry between Ford and Ferrari. And focuses even more on the deal between Carroll Shelby and Mr. H. Ford II. And the driver/mechanic of one of the cars during Le Mans in 1966: Ken Miles.<br/><br/>Christian (Bale) and Matt (Damon) are portraying there characters really well. I didn't know that Bale was British, now I know. But either way, every character in the film is believable. The story - based upon real life, so not completely accurate - is entertaining and comes close to the real deal.<br/><br/>If you are looking for the real story of the race (and the events towards that) this ain't the movie for you, because it's a movie and not a documentary. And the movie needs to entertain the crowd that is coming towards this piece. So who should watch it ? Autosport fans for sure, Endurance fans absolutely (like myself), car enthusiasts perhaps - depending on which car-class(es).<br/><br/>The way they set the whole vibe (I was instantly back at my first trip to Le Mans (2012)). The way they show you the track and the rivalry, and the cars. It's really an awesome movie. Just like Rush. Yes Rush was more about the race, but had also a story but a bit thinner then this one. The story isn't a big one in this one, but it's there. And if you expect a Rush look-a-like you will be sad, so expect more story !<br/><br/>I will definitely get this on DVD."

"bob-the-movie-man","10","37","62","20 November 2019"," A linear story on a circular track - but beautifully done.
","Despite the love affair cinema has had with cars over the years, the sport of motor racing on film has been patchy. Too often the drama on the track has been deluged with melodrama off the track, as in John Frankenheimer's ""Grand Prix"" from 1966. While recent efforts such as Ron Howard's ""Rush"" have brought modern filming techniques to better convey the speed and excitement, it is Steve McQueen's ""Le Mans"" from 1971 that had previously set the bar for realism in the sport. But even there, there were a few off-track love stories to interweave into the action.<br/><br/>I wouldn't hesitate to suggest that ""Le Mans '66"" is a strong contender for the motor racing high-water mark.<br/><br/>The film was marketed as ""Ford v Ferrari"" in the US. (What... do the American distributors think their film-goers are so stupid that if ""Le"" is in the title they will think it sub-titled foreign language??). But it's a valid title, since the movie tells the true story of when Henry Ford... the second... (Tracy Letts) throws his toys out of the pram at Ford's faltering progress. (""James Bond does not drive a Ford"". ""That's because he's a degenerate!"" snaps back Ford, which kind of typifies the problem""). Marketing man Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal) persuades retired hot-shot racer Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) to take Ford's blank-cheque to build a car to win the Le Mans 24 hour race.<br/><br/>Shelby enlists maverick Brit racer Ken Miles (Christian Bale) to help design and drive the next-generation machine. But neither had banked on the interference of the hoards of Ford suits, led by VP Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas). An explosion is imminent! And its not just from the over-heated brake pads!<br/><br/>What's really odd about this film is how linear the story is. While we get to see the family life of Miles (to add necessary context to what follows) these are merely minor diversions. There are no sub-plots or flashback scenes. It just relates the history from beginning to end, enlivened by some of the best and most exciting motor-racing footage put to celluloid.<br/><br/>At a bladder-testing 152 minutes, this really shouldn't have worked. I should have got bored and restless. But I really didn't.<br/><br/>In many ways - bladders aside - I think this will appeal in particular to an older breed of movie-goer. It's a 100% 'sit back in your seat and enjoy' cinema treat.<br/><br/>This is the first film Matt Damon and Christian Bale have made together, and I understand that Damon specifically signed on since he wanted to work with Bale. And there is palpable chemistry there. The movie includes one of the best 'bad-fights' since Colin Firth and Hugh Grant locked horns in the Bridget Jones films. And Damon - never one of the most expressive actors in the world - here really shines.<br/><br/>Bale also appears to be having a whale of a time. Not having to adopt a US accent suits him, as he blasts and swears his way through various UK-specific expletives that probably passed the US-censors by! He often tends to play characters in movies that are difficult to warm to, but here - although suitably spiky and irascible - the family man really shines through and you feel a real warmth for the guy.<br/><br/>There's a strong supporting cast behind the leads, with Tracy Letts' fast-driving breakdown being a standout moment. I wonder how many takes they needed on that for Damon to keep a semi-straight face?! Also impressive as the son Peter Miles is Noah Jupe. If you're wondering where the hell you've seen him before, he was young (Marcus in ""A Quiet Place"").<br/><br/>Where the film comes alive is on the track, and a particular shout out should to to the technical teams. Cinematography is by Phedon Papamichael (""Walk the Line""), film editing is led by Andrew Buckland and Michael McCusker. And sound mixing - which to my ear was piston-valve perfect - is by Steven Morrow. Also worthy of note is a kick-ass driving soundtrack by Marco Beltrami that genuinely excited. These categories are fearsomly hard to predict in awards season, but you might like to listen out for those names.<br/><br/>If I was going to pick at any faults in the film, it would be that Ford exec Leo Beebe is painted a little too much as a ""boo-hiss"" pantomime villain in the piece. It could have been perhaps toned down 20% or so.<br/><br/>James Mangold (""Logan""; ""Walk the Line"") directs in style. From the rather po-faced trailer, you might think this is a ""car movie that's not for me"". But it really is a tremendously fun movie, with some genuinely laugh-out-loud moments mixed in with edge-of-your-seat action and some heart-rending moments.<br/><br/>Above all, this is a film that really benefits from the wide-screen and sound-system that only a big cinema can provide. As such this goes on my ""get out and see it"" list without any hesitation! It's going to make my movies of the year: and I'm off to see it again on Saturday!<br/><br/>(Read the full graphical review on One Mann's Movies on the web or Facebook. Thanks)."
"trelerke-politics","6","59","106","23 November 2019"," well done for its genre, but only just, good acting on the part of Bale and Damon
","I used to race cars, still spend a bit of time on the track, so I know this story,
even met some of the actual people involved here (I'm old), and I wanted to really like the movie more than I did. Of course the car porn was fantastic, the casual way in which iconic multi-million dollar cars were placed around the set and even some of the scenes showing the GT40 moving around the airport tarmac were very good. For the latter, they captured speed well here, which is very difficult. So, kudos. But the actual danger involved, although shown to some extent, was not given the attention really needed. I understand the dramatic demands for a movie, but I would think emphasizing the danger would only help. Just to be clear, there were two deaths in a five month period, Miles and Macdonald, although deaths and massive injuries were very common then, these deaths actually had an effect on the racing community. Also, to be clear, the Ford effort was massive, they simply hired the very best in the US to get the GT40 developed. It really was a huge disparity between Ford and any other team. In reality, once Ford got out the kinks, it was a foregone conclusion, no matter that Ferrari made amazing cars. In this regard, little was made of the genius and absolute necessity of Phil Remmington to the entire GT40 project, he was the actual development lead on the car and he was made out to be a Disney -like character, uncle Phil with almost no real role to play. Well, actually, the character of Miles, also an engineer on the project was a compiled character that included ""Rem"" but because Rem was the essential piece for GT40 development, they had to gesture towards him, I suppose. Again, it was an okay movie, very much in the genre, although a bit better acted, Damon and Bale fighting with each other, using food, a thrown wrench, the supportive, loving wife. Within the context of a buddy movie, the movie does work, but its too long and you feel it, although I did like the way Miles death accident was shown, not a lot of buildup, save for the music, and then a highspeed muffled crash, no huge histrionics after and then the both true and movie cliche line ""sometimes they don't come home."" I wanted more of the internal mechanics of that, I wanted more of Henry Ford crying in the car, a great scene, actually because both the absolute insanity of being in a racing car as well as his joy were conveyed, I thought that was a magnificent human moment, unexpected and worth the movie, on it's own."

","Le Mans '66 is a fast paced thrill ride from beginning to end. It tells the story of how carol shelby and ken miles built a car that could beat Ferrari in 24hr race at Le Mans where they had won the previous 4 years. The biggest strength in this film is the chemistry between the cast, good performances all round from Josh Lucas to Ray McKinnon but the whole film hinges on the chemistry between the two leads. it delivers on that front with the highlights of the film being scenes with Damon & Bale genuinely feeling like two old friends bantering back & forth about cars. Matt Damon does a great job as Shelby but can't help be overshadowed by Christian Bale who steals the movie with his performance as ken miles a man on the journey to find that one perfect lap. James Mangold does a good job with the direction you feel the gear shifts & the tension when the Ford Gt40 screeches it's breaks around right corners. There could probably more ambitious or creative shots in some of the races but in my honest opinion I think the performances Mangold got out of this cast outshines the technical stuff. The writing isn't the best and can come off as cheesy & predictable in certain areas but for the most part I felt it was well written and had a good pace to it. I'd recommend Le Mans '66 it's not 1st place but it's a near perfect lap."

"ecastrodesign","10","54","99","22 October 2019"," A big Hollywood Film that delivers !
","Once in a while, a big Hollywood film is made with big Hollywood stars, and big Hollywood production values and occasionally everything works to deliver a dynamic cinematic event.
Such is the case with director James Mangold's new film ""Ford v Ferrari"". Armed with superior talent in front and behind the camera, Mr. Mangold has directed his best film yet with bravado. A strong screenplay is the foundation of a great story involving the characters portrayed by Matt Damon playing American Car Designer Carroll Shelby, driver Christian Bale, and Tracy Letts as Henry Ford II, all involved in challenging the famous Italian car maker Ferrari at the famous race at Le Mans in 1966.
From the very first frame, James Mangold sets the tone with exciting, bold and energetic images that are visually arresting, alongside a great score that never overwhelms or feels generic. The editing is outstanding, as the pace is so fast moving, pulsating with nail biting excitement, especially in the racing sequences.
Cinematographer Phedon Papamichael, along with Production Designer Francois Audouy, and Costume Designer Daniel Orlandi, have created a rich canvas, always authentic in feel, full of subtleties resulting in a formidable palette that comes together beautifully.
Flawless performances are a high point under the guidance of James Mangold's direction. Matt Damon has rarely had the opportunity to show quite a range from confidant showman to a vulnerability we rarely see. Christian Bale as always disappears into his character and delivers another stellar performance, and Tracy Letts layers his performance with strength and flair.
Ultimately, James Mangold's master work delivers on all fronts, and on the whole one of the most satisfying films of the year, and certain to be a major contender for many well deserved awards !"

"Bertaut","8","24","43","1 December 2019"," I'd have preferred to see Michael Mann's version, but this is an impressive and heartfelt study of friendship and triumph
","Based on <a href=""/name/nm4859003/"">A.J. Baime</a>'s Go Like Hell: Ford, Ferrari, and Their Battle for Speed and Glory at Le Mans (2009), written by <a href=""/name/nm0445669/"">Jason Keller</a>, <a href=""/name/nm0125336/"">Jez Butterworth</a>, and <a href=""/name/nm3890871/"">John-Henry Butterworth</a>, and directed by <a href=""/name/nm0003506/"">James Mangold</a>, Le Mans '66 (released in North American with the equally generic title of Ford v Ferrari) counts <a href=""/name/nm0000520/"">Michael Mann</a> as an executive producer. This is notable, as Mann himself has been trying to bring an adaptation of <a href=""/name/nm0946717/"">Brock Yates</a>'s Enzo Ferrari: The Man, the Cars, the Races (1991) to the screen since at least 1993. Indeed, at one point, Mann's <a href=""/title/tt3758542/"">Enzo Ferrari</a> was set to star <a href=""/name/nm0000288/"">Christian Bale</a>, before he was replaced with <a href=""/name/nm0413168/"">Hugh Jackman</a>. Whether or not it will ever be made is open to speculation, but it seems unlikely in the wake of Mann's involvement with Le Mans '66, an excellently made but unadventurous movie.<br/><br/>Mangold is a fine director, but he's no Mann, nowhere near, and the film did, to a certain extent, leave me pondering what kind of kinetic brilliance Mann would have brought to similar material. In contrast to Mann's body of work, Le Mans '66 could never be accused of breaking any new ground or trying anything especially original - it hits all the beats, it hits them well, but it never strays from the formula. Looking at issues such as friendship, male pride, personal integrity, sticking it to the Man, art v commerce, individuals v corporations; it is, in essence, a thematically broad and aesthetically anonymous pre-auteur theory audience-pleaser made with the technology and aesthetic sensibilities of modernity. And whilst the individual parts may be unsatisfactorily safe and familiar, the whole is unexpectedly accomplished and immensely enjoyable.<br/><br/>The film begins in 1959 as Carroll Shelby (<a href=""/name/nm0000354/"">Matt Damon</a>) wins that year's Le Mans, only to be told he has a heart condition and must stop racing. Cut to 1963, and Henry Ford II (a superb <a href=""/name/nm0504832/"">Tracy Letts</a>, who steals every scene he's in) has just had an offer to purchase Ferrari rejected and been personally insulted by Ferrari himself (<a href=""/name/nm0320969/"">Remo Girone</a>). Livid, Ford II determines to build a car capable of winning Le Mans, which Ferrari has won in 1958, 1960, 1961, 1962, and 1963. Ford Vice President and General Manager Lee Iacocca (<a href=""/name/nm1256532/"">Jon Bernthal</a>) contacts Shelby, the last non-Ferrari driver to have won the event, and asks him to design a car. He gets to work but says they'll need a great driver as well as a well-designed car. He reaches out to Ken Miles (Bale), who has a reputation as one of the best drivers in the world, and is renowned for his almost supernatural ability to identify problems in test cars after only one or two laps. However, because of his volatility and unpredictable personality, few want to work with him. He comes on board, but immediately clashes with the Ford executives, particularly Senior Executive Vice President Leo Beebe (<a href=""/name/nm0524197/"">Josh Lucas</a>).<br/><br/>Le Mans '66 is somewhat similar to Michael Mann's <a href=""/title/tt0248667/"">Ali (2001)</a>, insofar as it uses the grandiose moments of history to tell an intimate story - Mangold uses the determination to win Le Mans '66 as the background against which to examine issues such as friendship and the clash between gifted individuals for whom success is its own reward and corporations who don't see value in anything unless it's monetarily successful. Indeed, the argument could be made that the film is actually a commentary on the Hollywood studio system, with Shelby and Miles representing independent filmmakers who love the craft and see the medium as an art-form, whilst the Ford executives represent the studio, always more concerned with the bottom dollar than artistic integrity, always getting in the way of the people who, if left alone to work, could produce something spectacular (we'll ignore the fact that the whole thing feels like it was made by an algorithm designed to hit as many clichÃ©d feel-good moments as possible).<br/><br/>The film is also extremely funny in places, especially in a scene where Shelby shows up at Miles's house, and the two get into a fight on the street. Miles's wife Mollie (an underused <a href=""/name/nm1495520/"">Caitriona Balfe</a>) emerges from the house, looks at the two men fighting, goes back inside, and remerges with a garden chair, a drink, and a copy of Better Living. She then sits down to watch the action. It's a hilarious moment, but it's one with great thematic importance - this is very much an androcentric world (Mollie is virtually the only female in the entire film), but for this brief moment, the audience is allowed to pull back and laugh at the utter ridiculousness of competitive maleness - boys will be clichÃ©d boys, always trying to outdo each other, and getting all worked up over something as pointless as a fast car.<br/><br/>This thematic focus, however, is not to say the film ignores the intricacies of racing; on the contrary, there's a huge amount of techno-babble concerning vectors, aerodynamics, the mathematics of torque, the torsion of metal, and the ins and outs of physics. Additionally, although thematically, the focus isn't on the races themselves, there's no denying that the aesthetic design of these scenes is exemplary, albeit familiar. Mann would have done wonders here, but Mangold, cinematographer <a href=""/name/nm0003659/"">Phedon Papamichael</a>, and sound designers <a href=""/name/nm0316102/"">David Giammarco</a> and <a href=""/name/nm0929329/"">Jay Wilkinson</a> have crafted some truly intense moments. For the most part, Mangold and Papamichael avoid any objective shots (for example, there are no overheads giving us a good vantage of the entire race), and there are very few shots showing us something that Miles is unable to see. The scenes aren't shot in the first-person, but our vision is anchored to his. This, of course, contributes to a subjective focalisation and creates the sense of being in the car with him, which brings a default level of intensity, as well as giving the viewer a perfect vantage point from which to see just how fast these guys are going and how difficult what they do actually is.<br/><br/>In terms of problems, there are only two of significance. The first concerns just how safe and rudimentary the film is. Aesthetically, although the race scenes are kinetic and exciting, there isn't anything new or inventive in them; thematically, the film doesn't say anything we haven't heard before; and structurally, it walks a very well-worn path - chances are that everything that you think might happen in Le Mans '66 does happen. This is your basic underdog story, and it adheres rigidly to that template. The character of Beebe is a good example of just how rigidly. In essence, he's a poorly written token villain because you can't have an underdog story without a token villain (usually in the form of bureaucratic interference). In this case, when Mangold feels the need to inject some conflict into proceedings, Beebe will pop up to throw a wrench into the works. His motivation? Apart from some brief references to how he doesn't think Miles is a ""Ford man"", his antipathy is never explained - the character is a Swiss army knife villain who can be used for multiple purposes, a one-size-fits-all bad guy without an iota of nuance or interiority. The second problem concerns Shelby himself, who is disappointingly one-dimensional (at best), as we learn absolutely nothing about his personal life - for example, the film makes no reference to the fact that by 1963 he was on wife number three (of seven!). Who is the film's Carroll Shelby, and why should non-racing fans care about him? We never get an answer - he's Matt Damon wearing a Stetson and speaking with a Texas drawl. And that's about all the character development he gets.<br/><br/>Although these issues are significant in isolation, the thing about Le Mans '66 is that it's so well made, it rises above the clichÃ©d and overly-familiar nature of many of the individual scenes, resulting in a whole that is very much more than the sum of its parts. A film about friendship and integrity rather than racing, it doesn't take any risks, nor does it bend any rules. Indeed it does nothing that could be labelled innovative. For all that, however, I couldn't help but enjoy it. It won't surprise you, it probably won't move you, it certainly won't change your life, but the storytelling is clear and refined, and the journey is one well worth taking."

"TheLittleSongbird","9","8","12","19 December 2019"," Rushing to the finish
","After being very behind with film watching and reviewing, a lot of my reviews this year being dedicated to individual episodes of shows, completest quests and some cartoons, finally made the decision to watch more films released this year and to finally review the films seen earlier this year but hadn't gotten round to seeing. 'Le Mans 66' was a very eagerly anticipated film, due to liking the lead actors and loving 'Rush' that this has been compared to by some, and one of the year's (quite hit and miss) more acclaimed films, so there was not any doubt about seeing it.<br/><br/>'Le Mans 66' (often advertised though under the easier to remember title of 'Ford v Ferrari') doesn't disappoint a vast majority of the time, almost everything is right with it. Found it an exceptionally well made, acted, written and enthralling film and one of the year's must sees, also one of the few films this year where the advertising actually did it justice which is such a rarity in film (having lost count of the number of great films that were criminally mismarketed or misleadingly so). Seeing as 2019 has been another hit and miss year, with a fair share of good to brilliant films, a fair share of mediocre films or less (including clunkers) and films sitting in between, that is saying a fair bit actually and am not trying to sound like a snob here.<br/><br/>It isn't without its flaws, though they are hardly any. Did find the character of Peter and his scenes rather too twee for my liking, like when the film cutaways to him where he pointlessly explains the action. 'Le Mans 66' already had a lot of emotional impact of all kinds, the character and his presence just didn't seem necessary.<br/><br/>Maybe it is a little too long too, it could easily have done with being perhaps 15 minutes shorter and lessening or excising Peter's role would have made things better.<br/><br/>However, 'Le Mans 66' looks great. Especially the editing, which is actually quite astonishing in the action-oriented scenes and can see some kind of nod for Best Editing at any of the big awards. Likewise with the sound editing, which is quite striking in its authenticity, 'Le Mans 66' capturing the spirit of the sport and the personal lives behind it beautifully. James Mangold's direction is stylish throughout, the action-oriented scenes have plenty of thrills and mostly the personal lives scenes are emotionally investable.<br/><br/>Script is tightly structured and is nicely balanced. The story is always well balanced and some twee moments aside is always compelling. The climactic race is absolutely thrilling in every sense of the word. All the performances are spot on, with Matt Damon giving one of his better and most good-natured performances and Tracy Letts excels in his role, especially in his post-drive breakdown and his frankness during the Ford executive presentation. Best of all is Christian Bale in the film's most demanding role, he captures the uncomprimising attitude needed brilliantly.<br/><br/>All in all, excellent and one of 2019's highlights when it comes to film. 9/10"
"neilfrancis2","8","38","76","5 November 2019"," Good.
","Not a massive fan of motor racing or motor racing movies but i did enjoy this.
The major asset for the film is the cast, Matt Damon is very good but the real star of this is the fantastic Christian Bale, a superb performance from a great actor.
The story of an unsung British hero, a very modest and a very real hero, he did really drive a tank in WW2, is a tale very much worth telling.
It is long bit flies by - go see."
"Turfseer","6","32","64","20 December 2019"," Entertaining 60s sports car racing flick receives full blown Hollywood treatment
","I must confess that sports car racing is probably at the bottom of my list when it comes to the type of spectator sports I like to watch. Granted, it takes a lot of courage to be a race driver. But why risk your life especially if you're married and have children? (as in the case of one of the protagonists here, Ken Miles, played quite effectively by Christian Bale).<br/><br/>
What's more, most of the glory seems to go to the companies that put up the money for these spectacles. So in this case, we're asked to root for the Ford Motor Company with their obnoxious, win-at-all-costs boss, Henry Ford II (Tracie Letts), and his minions, who propose that Ford enter the racing game as a grand marketing promotion opportunity.<br/><br/>
In looking at the title of this film, one can get the wrong first impression that the antagonist is Ferrari, the small Italian car manufacturer, known for its output of luxury vehicles as well as success in sports car racing. After Henry Ford attempts to buy Ferrari and is turned down, this is his impetus for getting involved in the racing game. His goal is to develop a new, blazing fast car that can usurp Ferrari's dominant position in winning one prestigious race after another (particularly on the French Le Mans circuit).<br/><br/>
Ferrari thus has little screen time after the initial rejection of the Ford buyout. Instead, Ford hires Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) a famous driver forced to retire due to a heart condition, now with an up and coming reputation as a top notch car designer. Shelby, an aggressive straight-shooter, hires the loose cannon Brit, Ken Miles, as his driver and mechanic consultant, just as he's about to lose his auto body shop due to non-payment of taxes.<br/><br/>
Meanwhile, Henry Ford appoints Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas) as his Senior Vice President in charge of developing the Ford GT40 Mk I prototype, the super car that's ultimately supposed to best Ferrari at Le Mans. Bebbe, a buffoon of a character, becomes the antagonist, when he opposes Shelby and his insistence that Miles take the wheel during the big race. Bebbe can't stomach such a ""politically incorrect"" character as Miles and insists that other drivers test out the new Ford car at the upcoming Le Mans race. Sure enough, Ford ends up losing badly against Ferrari.<br/><br/>
A cursory glance of the true history of all these machinations reveals that Beebe's push back against Shelby was exaggerated: the main sticking point in the film is his insistence that Davis not be the appointed driver. Historically, that never happened: the year before success, Davis actually DID race at Le Mans and lost to Ferrari.<br/><br/>
There's more standard Hollywood treatment here with the specious suggestion that the development of the GT40 Mk 1 was mainly due to Davis's innate knowledge of car mechanics-there's a scene where Shelby rejects a computer analysis by Ford engineers and trusts Davis, with his more home-grown approach, to fine tune the car. In actuality, the Ford engineers worked in close conjunction with Shelby and Davis, and the ultimate success was truly a team effort.<br/><br/>
While Damon's part as Shelby in the first half of the film revolves around defending Miles and convincing Ford that Beebe's approach at micro-managing will not work, in the second half, his role is really reduced to a glorified cheerleader, as Christian Bale ends up with the much juicier part of actually driving the car during the Daytona 500 ""tune-up"" and the ultimate challenge at Le Mans.<br/><br/>
All the behind-the-scenes drama ends up as a kind of mixed bag. Shelby trying to rein in the aforementioned ""loose cannon"" Miles can be entertaining but sometimes gets a bit much (especially when Damon and Bale fight like five year olds, tussling on the ground while Miles' wife looks on). Speaking of Miles' wife, Mollie (played by the sultry British actress Caitriona Balfe), she and their young son Peter, have little to do throughout, also often acting as glorified cheerleaders.<br/><br/>
The aforementioned behind-the-scenes drama also applies to the goings-on at the Ford Motor Company. There's a good scene where Shelby takes Henry Ford for a test drive which causes him to have an epiphany regarding the danger of driving these type of cars. As a result, Ford entrusts Shelby with calling the shots after the initial loss to Ferrari at Le Mans.<br/><br/>
Less successful is the way the scenarists handle Beebe who is reduced to the aforementioned buffoon. I'm thinking especially of that ridiculous scene where Shelby locks Beebe in an office, preventing him from giving orders during one of the critical test races.<br/><br/>
Ultimately, a film such as this needs to present a credible and entertaining enough behind-the-scenes drama in addition to its actual racing sequences. On that score, I will reiterate, the Ford v Ferrari ""drama"" is passable, which will hold your interest (not all of it is that ""believable"" however, on the other hand).<br/><br/>
The racing scenes (particularly the ones at Le Mans) are particularly well done and the outcome is a bit of a curve ball (SPOILERS: with Ferrari out of the race, Miles, who is way ahead, is ordered to slow down so that all three Ford cars cross the finish line at the same time!).<br/><br/>
The film also manages some pathos at the climax, when Miles ends up being killed in a test drive accident two months after his triumph at Le Mans. Racing aficionados will probably dig this wholeheartedly. Much lesser enthusiasts (such as myself) can appreciate the screenwriting effort, despite the Hollywood treatment."

An actor I had been working with mentioned it to me a year previously as he had landed a supporting role, I was excited by the prospect of a new film for motorsport fans such as myself. After seeing the trailer I remained excited, and yet slightly nervous about the handling of it.<br/><br/>After the first twenty minutes I turned to my fiance and stated ""this had better improve""....after 45 minutes, I was ready to leave. We stayed for an hour as we had bought drinks and hoped things would improve.

Visually it's okay to look at, as it has the budget of a Hollywood Blockbuster. But beyond that, you'll be watching much of it through gritted teeth."
"calin_hotshot","6","7","11","2 March 2020"," A goofy attempt
","I actually was pretty excited to see this movie. As an athlete myself I must say I usually don't agree with the hollywoodization of sports in general, but with Mangold at the helm and two of the best actors in the business as the main characters I got pretty optimistic.
Needless to say, all three mentioned above do their best, but the writting behind this movie is laughable at best. It tries really hard to be profound, with characters just charghing wrecklesly through the streets to show how pissed of they are, but it never really gets to the level of sentiment you would expect from and oscar nominated movie. I honestly don't know what got that nomination besides the shameless pro-american message.
Ford v Ferrari, which is not even the main thing about this movie, could be easily described like this: take a race car driver and put him in a movie that's not even about racing (it's unlikely it'll be any good). That's about the jist of it, just the other way round.
If you want to make a movie about a sport, just call someone who actually knows that field and listen to them. Sad to say, probably without his fault since it's a nicely passed, good looking movie, this is one of Mangold's misses.
Props to Bale for another great performance. Damon was fine, I guess. Also the movie is way too long at 2h and a half"
"FilmFlowCritics","7","47","106","14 October 2019"," No Bat-Mobile, but still a thrill ride from Bale!
","This movie has as much traction and grip, as the car that won Le Mans 66!<br/><br/>Another stunning performance by Christian Bale (without any body transformation this time!) and the same goes for Jon Bernthal! Yes, this movie might be 20mins to long, but it takes you on a long and exciting ride with an end you won't see coming, unless you spoil yourself with how the race in '66 ended - my advice: DON'T! it will pay off.<br/><br/>I'm a Formula 1 enthusiast and occasionally watch the Le Mans races as well, so I wasn't aware how the race in '66 ended. I wasn't even aware of the rivalry between Ford and Ferrari back then, but this movie won't bore you with the details to much. It gives the necessary overview of the needed context, so that every viewer understands what's on the line here.<br/><br/>I'd recommend a viewing in an IMAX for sure, to feel the sound and experience the race for yourself. Much like Rush, this movie manages to get the excitement of racing transformed to the audience, without focussing on any crashes or the (back then) still live threatening motorsport."

He seemed like he was an amazing man, driver and engineer!! Ford owes him and Shelby everything!!"
"zkonedog","9","2","2","17 February 2020"," Entertaining In Every Way A Film Can Be
","I've never watched a car race in my life. I have absolutely no knowledge of the historic events surrounding the Ford and Ferrari motor companies. None of those two things mattered in my viewing experience of ""Ford v Ferrari"". Not only does it allow the viewer to be a complete clean slate, but it provides the utmost of entertainment on almost every front.<br/><br/>For a very basic overview, this movie tells the story of how the Ford Motor Company was struggling in the 1960s and thus turned to racing cars to give their image a boost. The problem? For years, Ferrari has been the gold standard in that theater. But with Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) overseeing the project and the volatile Ken Miles (Christian Bale) in the driver's seat, they set out to take down Ferrari at the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans race.<br/><br/>One of the main strengths of ""Ford v Ferrari"" is that it tells a bunch of different stories within the basic framework. Not only is it the clash that the title anticipates, but also a story of personal redemption for Shelby, one of personal goal-achievement for Miles, and even a healthy dose of ""big corporation screwing over the little guy"" thrown in. All of those angles are very distinct, with nothing muddled along the way. The 2.5 hour runtime really helps with this, allowing such arcs to play out in their entirety.<br/><br/>The acting is also incredible from basically the entire cast. Bale gives a unique, quirky performance as seemingly only he can, Damon is solid (as always), and everyone else does their part admirably. Especially affecting are Miles' wife Mollie (Caitriona Balfe) and son Peter (Noah Jupe), who both provide much of the sentimental emotions present in the film. A specific scene where Ken explains to Peter exactly what he does on each individual racing lap is as good as acting gets.<br/><br/>There's also a never-ending sense of forward momentum and just overall fun to ""Ford v Ferrari"". It never takes itself too seriously, yet it isn't a comedy. It's long, but doesn't feel that way due to the expert pacing--a perfect balance of pulse-pounding action scenes and slower, more emotional scenes within the understated 1960s period feel. Director James Mangold probably deserves a good amount of the credit for making this all congeal together as well as it did.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a spectacular film precisely because it can hit audiences in so many different ways. Whether through the action, emotion, true story, or underlying themes, most viewers will be able to find something to enjoy here. Even if, like I said before, no previously knowledge of racing is present."
"classicsoncall","8","2","2","15 February 2020"," ""We're gonna build a race car.""
","You don't have to be a race car enthusiast to enjoy this film. I'm certainly not, having neither the desire or the patience to watch daring motor cars race around a track at mind boggling speeds. Though you do have to credit the drivers who enjoy the profession; it takes a certain amount of bravura and stamina to withstand the pace and stress forces that go with the territory. Without knowing the story in advance, I thought it was going to pit Matt Damon against Christian Bale as opposing drivers, but that idea was quickly put to rest. The legendary Carroll Shelby (Damon) is in the spotlight here as the former racer and design engineer recruited by the Ford Motor Company to build a championship vehicle. In no small measure was it Ford's response to a snub by Italian car maker, Enzo Ferrari, who turned down a merger with the American company in a fit of pique. Had he gone along, the end result in the picture may never have occurred.<br/><br/>The movie will call to mind the Steve McQueen race car epic ""Le Mans"" from 1971. With a half century separating the two films, both reliably capture the spirit and flavor of the world's longest endurance test. ""Le Mans"" has more of a documentary type feel than the movie under consideration here, with less of a plot and straightforward story line. Building up to the seminal race in 1966 featured in this film, the story takes an introspective look at the machinations of the Ford Motor Company to control all aspects of engineering a vehicle they hope to defeat the Italians with. Not to mention the politics and marketing aspect of selecting a driver who wouldn't embarrass the company by going public with any developmental problems along the way.<br/><br/>For fans and non-fans alike, the racing scenes are thrilling and adrenaline inducing. As driver Ken Mills, Christian Bale exudes nerves of steel and a soaring passion to be the best driver out there, achieving mind boggling speeds that would otherwise strike fear in the hearts of most mortal men. That was comically illustrated in the one scene in which Shelby himself took Henry Ford II (Tracy Letts) for a 'spin' in a car under development. If there's any sense of a let down with the picture, it would have to be the screw job Mills suffered when he agreed to bring in all three of Ford's race cars to the finish line together at Le Mans. Realizing it, Mills bore the slight with dignity, knowing in his heart that he was the best driver out there that day, and nothing could take that away from him."
"jensmartin","9","2","2","14 February 2020"," Christian Bale at his finest
","There is a lot of good in this movie but for me by far the best is the performance by Christian Bale. He is faultless in this move, even down to the subtly Brummie twang and expressions.

I expected bad acting on at least one of the two star actors parts (Damon, Bale), but this movie is good. A little slow in the beginning, but that's my only complaint (I literally fell asleep during the beginning and woke up and watched the rest of this great movie).<br/><br/>The race at the end is good, but moreso from an emotional standpoint than an action packed standpoint. I feel like they could've had a few extra scenes to ""wow"" us at the end."
"andrewburgereviews","7","2","2","11 February 2020"," Corporate gasoline
","""Ford v Ferrari"" isn't as much about the battle between the two mega-corporations in the title as much as it is about the fight between bureaucracy and action, calculations and instinct or faith and palpability. It involves internal struggles as much as external ones and carried superbly by its two leads, Matt Damon and Christian Bale--whose performance is Oscar-worthy--is one of the most likable, satisfying and entertaining movies of the year.<br/><br/>The plot heads towards an epic culmination at the 1966 24-hour Le Mans race in France and it involves the years in which Ford created the now legendary GT40 to finally beat Ferrari who has been dominating the racing realm of motoring for years. It follows car designer Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) and his driver, Ken Miles (Christian Bale) as they deal with the technical ins and outs, corporate interference and media standards navigating their vagaries to get to success. The movie is as old-school macho as its central characters. Shelby was an American maverick, always dressing like the boss he is, always determined to get the job done, but he was understanding of the business side. Miles, on the other hand, is as complicated as he is a brilliant driver. His approach to the world is stripped of formality, his driving is his religion and people should be as real as he is otherwise they become fodder for his unfiltered words.<br/><br/>James Mangold knew he was entering a world with high potential in entertainment when he approached this story. Whenever attempting to encompass American history, one tends to sensationalize through patriotism and venerate the people it contains. And indeed they are worthy of veneration. This plays out like standard Hollywood fare, the dream factory working its magic perfectly. But it's also very male-centric. Not only its characters look like they were made in a car factory, the women are also hysterical. A particular scene in which Ken's wife Mollie (Caitriona Balfe) has a nervous breakdown during an argument with Ken about him hiding his plan to work on the new GT40 is a bit exaggerated. As they are in their family car, she starts driving erratically and dangerously, the scene playing like an interrogation scene. ""I thought we loved this stuff!""--she yells until Ken spits everything out. Yet in the end, she is fine with it, she just wished he hadn't lied. Her worries are understandable and called for, but her over-the-top reaction Mangold decided upon is obsolete as representation for women--even if this was the 1960s.<br/><br/>In the end, though, ""Ford v Ferrari"" finishes with just the right amount of satisfaction. While both characters are likable and Bale's performance rules, Matt Damon's portrayal of Carroll Shelby is what really made me up this movie's grade. He is perfect as men who try to get the job done but also not upset anyone too much. His approach to Ford's CEO, Henry Ford II (Tracy Letts) on why he should get a second chance after losing in 1965's Le Mans is as elegant as it is harsh and true. Even if ""Ford v Ferrari"" seems a bit outdated it is nonetheless a movie which really wants to be liked--not only by car people, but by everyone. Well, it succeeded."

","Shellby is leading the Le Mans where he is focused, determined and one could easily hear his heartbeat and hot breath in a fading raving engine sound mastered by a genius sound editing. The future is not too bright for Miles Ford and Ferrari but unlike Miles he does not hold the cards in life.. When people in high places determine people's fate, trusting a friend who is controlled by such is not that easy. But the Miles-Shellby bond is a prime example of great casting. In the end, your fate is determined by people in suits; mirroring why unchecked heights of inequality can determine people's fate in our this era.

","The story of Carroll Shelby and Ken Miles gets the Hollywood treatment in this nostalgic look at the motor racing scene of the 60's. It also succeeds in harking back to the kind of films Hollywood doesn't make any more.<br/><br/>Although this is in many ways a standard three act rise, fall and rise again narrative it's elevated by the excellent central and supporting performances. Damon is on top form as the bullish and ambitious good ol' boy Shelby. Compensating for his own enforced retirement as a driver by building up a successful race car construction company.<br/><br/>Bale, as ever, gives a memorable portrayal as the flawed genius Ken Miles. Quick tempered but never nasty, a loveable rogue and family man whose own driving career could clearly have been one of true greatness if not for his inability to compromise or bite his tongue.<br/><br/>The two leads rock and roll throughout proceedings, quick to clash but quick to make up again and once on board with the Ford motor company (who are desperate to end Ferrari's dominance of the Le Mans) the film really cooks.<br/><br/>The Ford suits are played fairly stereotypically but Josh Lucas is the film's real hissable villain. Playing the smarmy exec role to perfection.<br/><br/>Events play out much as you would expect but no less entertaining for it. Even the somewhat cliched speeches and corny English asides (all English people love cups of tea and say Cor Blimey!) Don't detract from the thrills.<br/><br/>The racing scenes are noisy and muscular, visceral in the same way as Ron Howard's Rush and put you right in the driving seat. And the final race is the highlight. Here the story even manages a slight twist I didn't see coming and stops the film veering into well worn ground.<br/><br/>Top notch stuff, well worth watching."

","This film is like the cars it portrays. Slick on the surface, but complicated underneath. Yes it's a story born of corporate ambition in horn rimmed glasses and dark suits, driven by pride and stubbornness, but the heart of it is pure racing, to hell with money, marketing, good looks, any of that. I've watched half of this with my foot planted to the floor. The driving scenes are awesome, the roar of untamed engines (turn your sound up as loud as you dare!), shifting gears into blindness inducing speeds. Fast cars alone though can't carry a film, but thankfully the cast here is as great as the cars. Damon is very good as the lynchpin Shelby, as he drags Ford away from mass production and onto the racetrack to challenge Ferrari's dominance. Bale though, Bale is magnificent. His portrayal of somewhat renegade driver Ken Miles is the oil in the engine, the comic undertones with a 'my way or the highway' attitude. He literally drives this. The pacing is spot on, balancing the boardroom with the tarmac perfectly, all done with some Oceans 11 style slick, good ol rock n roll blasting out as men do manly things. It's a show piece with Ferrari painted as the bad guy. I'm fine with that. Yes the cars look sexy, ""If this were a beauty pageant, we just lost"", but gimme the brute force of the Ford GT40 any day. There's a ton of excitement and energy before the cars even get to Le Mans, but seeing that GT tear up the French countryside gets the heart pounding. Doesn't matter that I already knew the outcome, it's still exhilarating with some of the best racing scenes in any film, ever!"

The truth is that Ferrari were the complete underdog. What actually happened is that huge behemoth motor company Ford tried to buy the tiny Ferrari and Enzo said no. Ford threw their toys out of the pram and decided to build the GT40. With their limitless budget it took a few years for them to finally succeed at beating the tiny Ferrari company at Le Mans. And even when they did, Ford used a 5 litre engine versus Ferrari's 3 litre.

"athawolsux","6","39","91","21 November 2019"," A well-made, overly long, utterly predictable and formulaic feelgood underdog story that has been done to death
","Ford v Ferrari is a well-made, well-shot film with some very good acting. It is also an utterly boring, predictable, by-the-numbers sports/competition success story, and that is its damning flaw. The plot contains almost conceivable cliche that can be found in this sort of movie, hitting all the usual story beats. A hastily-assembled crew of outcasts being given a seemingly impossible task against an unbeatable sports rival, dealing with their personal problems and struggling against the interference of smug, suited corporate figures who do not like the fact that our heroes are not types who play by the book, and growing as characters along the way. Directing-wise, this plot comes with all the usual accoutrements, the most obvious of which is montages where the team of underdogs progress in their quest.<br/><br/>The result is a movie where one can easily guess all the plot points and how the next scene is going to play out. Even the lighthearted, comedic moments happen exactly the way such scenes happen in every other movie of this kind. All of this especially becomes a problem when it is far longer than it should be. And despite the bloated runtime, some story elements somehow remain underwhelming. We know that the main characters are good friends simply because the script pretty much tells us so, but this is not properly set up. Some of the context and the events that drive the story forward are difficult to figure out, although this may be less so for viewers who are familiar with the racing context and the real-life events. In addition, it is sad that for a movie titled Ford v Ferrari, we never really see the events from the Italians' side, who remain bumbling foes beset by their overconfidence throughout the film.<br/><br/>All of this is not the say that the movie is not well-made. It is, despite the obvious CGI-y look of some of the racing scenes, and this is pretty much the reason behind my 6/10 score. If you are a diehard racing fan, or -for whatever reason- have never seen a sports/competition movie of this kind, you might really like it. Otherwise, the redeeming qualities of the picture are not enough to save it from being pretty much a total bore."

See ""Rush"" for a far better outcome on all these aspects. The worst flaw is in the way they filmed the circuit De La Sarthe: first, there's no iconic shot on the Mulsanne straight, that's something I don't understand; secondly, they failed in showing what a grind was driving at 300kmh for three minutes, with a couple of very hard brakes. Also, they didn't show the slower classes of cars racing simultaneously, that were a true hazard. Overall, little remains for racing enthusiasts."

With that being said, I was still intrigued throughout the entire 2.5 hour run time. Christian Bale dominated the screen with his performance. I expect great things from him, but he really did outdo himself by portraying the oddities and ego of his character. If you are a fan of cars or racing, I imagine you will love Ford v Ferrari."

","One hell of a ride, your heart will beat and race faster while watching this movie especially if you are a fan of racing cars or etc. Directed by James Mangold (Logan, Walk the Line). Based on true story about American automotive designer Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) and British race car driver Ken Miles (Christian Bale), together they plan to compete against the race cars of Enzo Ferrari at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in France in 1966. The story itself was so emotional and adrenalin pumping, I'd really recommend if you haven't know the story yet before watching this movie. I'm not really a fan of racing cars but I'm not disappointed either with this one, either you fan or not- you'll enjoy this movie.<br/><br/>It's not just about the cars even the race or the business, that's why I liked this movie. It is personal, heartfelt, and touching. With all the long racing scene it won't even bore you, I wasn't even know before about the rivalry between Ford and Ferrari back then but big bravo on the writer and director, the racing scenes had me sitting up on the edge of my seat! This movie manages to get the audience feel the excitement and thrill of racing. A strong screenplay with phenomenal performance by Christian Bale and Matt Damon, not to mention other supporting actors like Noah Jupe and Josh Lucas. The chemistry between Bale and Damon is engaging, their characters fit so well.<br/><br/>Solid movie from start to finish, I'd really recommend you to watch it with IMAX. One of the best movies for this year. The ending may wasn't explored enough but if you know the real story, you might know why it wasn't explored enough. It is for the best I guess."

","Ford V Ferrari (Director. James Mangold)<br/><br/>James Magild once again delivers us another bloody great film. Ford v Ferrari is wild and thrilling film which I seriously did it expect to enjoy so much.<br/><br/>At 153 minutes, the pacing honestly flies by. I wouldn't say it needed trimming down at all. The whole film is a load of fun, thanks to brilliant performances, a great script and racing scenes which are brilliantly directed and filled with so much energy. The last race is honestly so well done, it is one of the best film moments of the year. The visual effects are for the most part spectacular. Even the more drama scenes are still just as interesting.
Also ther racing scenes are downright brilliant with their sound mixing and editing.
Christian Bale once again proves he is one of the best actors of this generation. He alone makes the film worth watching. Noah Jupe, Matt Damon, Jon Berthnal and the rest of the cast are so amazing as well.
Overall it's one of the most energetic and memorable films of the year. Mangold is such an ace director and his talent really shines here. It's a really stylish film and such a likeable film and definitely worth watching.<br/><br/>Overall Rating: A-"

","It is inherently uninteresting. A mega corporation gives a blank check to win a race, and they do. The film's crime however is it won't commit to this-Americanism is unfashionable today, so it wants it both ways, they're soulless villains same time as the Italians are othered bordering on Red Dawn-esque (for the crime of being a competent boutique car company?) Similar to First Man they hope no one will notice the misfire. Plus too many scenes of life lessons and a trademark killjoy biopic wife extend this half an hour too long...how many times can they bring out the exact same scene of Josh Lucas being a jerk or the wife being movie-wifey? But that is a great Christian Bale performance. He knows exactly how to register and where to pinpoint every beat. He's like the ultimate older brother. It's an example where good taste should have brought others into its wavelength, expanding why what he was doing worked and pulling the monotonous and contrived Josh Lucas nonsense they hammer into the ground scene after scene."

","The (mostly) true story of two passionate gear-heads and their tireless quest to unseat mighty Team Ferrari at the grueling 24-hour Le Mans endurance race. Armed, that is, with the financial backing (and all-too frequent corporate meddling) of Ford Motor Company. In that sense, it's a war on two fronts: they're playing catch-up against a more advanced opponent while also fending off the various obstacles and bad ideas tossed down from their own corporate brass.<br/><br/>Christian Bale and Matt Damon, somehow sharing the screen for the first time, provide all the personality this flick needs to maintain momentum, while the hair-raising cockpit scenes nail the hairpin turns. Bale plays the more fiery of the pair; a sparky, cocksure driver who comes out of near-retirement for this chance at immortality. Damon's man is full of piss and vinegar, too, but more amicable to the kind of machinations necessary for navigating a corporate American boardroom. From the first word, they're great together. It's not an easy relationship to define - blows are exchanged, often comically, more than once - but there's no arguing their kinship, even if both might brush it off as a mere working association. They both know the fine points of their job, and the slight quirks and deviations that make them essential to one another.<br/><br/>Several of the film's plot twists are telegraphed, even for those (like I) who didn't know the full story coming in, and it's guilty of occasionally dipping into the well of over-worn sports movie tropes, but otherwise it's an effective pulse-pounder."

","A pretty good movie really. Tells a good yarn. Nicely made. Good cinematography. Good acting and good character chemistry. Lots of cgi but merges in quite well. Generally historically accurate. Nice plot in that it creates two anti-heroes battling against being the underdogs and battling against the ruthless ambitions of their own sponsors. Pretty standard stuff really. Bale's UK Midlands accent is pretty poor but just about better than Dick Van Dyke's cockney chimney sweep! Given that he is English it should be better - but he nevertheless presents a likeable character. Damon presents no surprises as the ultimate straight man - but he always does this well. It could have finished nicely without showing Miles' demise - a footnote would have respectfully sufficed. But other than this I'm struggling to really fault the film. Naturally it does gloss over certain aspects of the real story and outside of the USA no one refers to the race as the 24 hours 'OF' Le Mans - but does it really matter and does it detract from the overall story? No of course not. This is exactly what it says on the tin. No more and no less. I refer to my title.ðŸ˜€"

"MrDHWong","9","3","4","30 January 2020"," A well-told story that balances high octane car races with genuine drama
","Ford v Ferrari is a biographical drama film directed by James Mangold (Logan, Walk The Line, Girl, Interrupted). Starring Matt Damon and Christian Bale, it is a well-told story that balances high octane car races with genuine drama.<br/><br/>In 1963, the Ford Motor Company recruits famous racecar driver Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) to assist them with designing a car that will help them beat their arch rivals Ferrari at the Le Mons race in France. To aid him with such a task, Carroll decides to enlist the help of British mechanic and fellow racer Ken Miles (Christian Bale) to test for any flaws and eventually race in the finished product itself. At first, the two of them make great progress, however Ken's brash personality and blunt honesty puts him at odds with the higher ups at Ford, causing the company to believe he may not be the right person to be racing their car and representing them abroad.<br/><br/>With its fast pacing and heartfelt drama to match, Ford v Ferrari rises above the typical car racing film to become one of the most interesting portraits of an intense rivalry in recent memory. The film isn't so much about the cars themselves as as it is about staying relevant in the public eye and maintaining a respectable image. From the very beginning, we are given the idea of how desperate Ford are to shake off their reputation of being perceived as making outdated cars that only one's grandparents would drive. This is juxtaposed with the cool and hip-looking Ferrari being presented as more appealing to younger potential motorists. The resulting races are used to further the film's plot and aren't merely there for mindless entertainment. While it may be obvious to some viewers what the eventual outcome truly is, it is certainly a lot of fun anticipating what happens along the way.<br/><br/>Director James Mangold successfully strikes the correct balance between car racing action and realistic human drama, so much so that virtually all audiences should be able to find something to be entertained by. His choices in editing and cinematography help move the film along at a breathless speed as we watch cars zoom past at high acceleration, sometimes resulting in some intense crash scenes. There are times though, where some of the mechanical jargon may prove confusing to non-racing enthusiasts such as myself as I did end up scratching my head at a few scenes where certain important car parts were being discussed by the characters. In addition to this, I wasn't quite sure about how some of the rules of the race track were showcased in the film, as it felt somewhat glanced over. Fortunately, these moments are infrequent and are often counteracted by the great acting of the film's leads.<br/><br/>Christian Bale is such a joy to watch as Ken Miles, the unapologetic perfectionist racer who wants to push the limits of what a car can do. It caught me off-guard at first hearing him use his native British accent while surrounded by other Americans as I am so used to seeing him play only American characters. Matt Damon gave a nice performance as well, but I feel that he was overshadowed by Bale in most scenes. This is due to Damon essentially being the straight man to Bale's outspoken antics which did cause me to focus more on Bale instead.<br/><br/>Overall, even if you aren't a huge fan of car racing films like me, this one contains more than enough entertainment to satisfy even the most car illiterate of audiences. The historic value of the depicted event makes for a solid drama and could possibly bring a newfound amount of respect to this genre in the near future.<br/><br/>I rate it 8.5/10"

However, lately there were quite a few great ones, like ""I, Tonya"" or ""Darkest Hour"". And man, this movie is definitely one of those great ones.<br/><br/>The most fascinating aspect for me is that the movie is thrilling, it puts you on the edge of your sit for the entirety of it, the racing scenes are incredible, and it was truly a pleasure watching it without knowing Ken Miles' storyline, I was surprise a bunch of times. That's me though, I bet that most people would at least search a bit before watching the movie.<br/><br/>Anyways, the movie has great cinematography, amazing performances by Damon and Bale. Also a shout out to Josh Lucas, he did great as well here, I hated him for most of the movie, and that was definitely the goal here.<br/><br/>The score is good too. The movie is 2h30 hours long, but it never feels like it, you are so damn entertained by the thing, that when is ending you actually feel like you could watch another hour of it in a heartbeat.<br/><br/>To sum up, James Mangold once again does a great job in his new movie, and he definitely has my attention now. Ford v Ferrari is a great movie for movie lovers but also for the casual moviegoer, who can simply watch for the sake of watching the racing sequences, at the end of the day, no one will be disappointed."

It's just more than any racing movie ever been...
The director of the film - James Mangold - did an exceptional job. There was a lot of - literally - moving pieces and he made those move together in perfect harmony.<br/><br/>It's good if you know of - or heard of - Shelby, but that's it. You don't have to know everything there is to know about car racing history. They tell you. And maybe it's even better if you don't. You can feel the weight of taking every corner without knowing if that's the last - and you can only have that experience once, until you don't know the story, the ending.
Of course, if you've ever driven above the speed limit, and with a 200+ horse power car as well helps - but it's not necessary to enjoy the film.<br/><br/>Fun fact: the last part of the movie is the illustration in the dictionary when you look up ""life's not fair"" or ""no good deed goes unpunished"".<br/><br/>Memorable quotes: ""Am I on fire?!""

","Henry Ford II offered to buy the Ferrari company. Founder and owner Enzo Ferrari turns Ford down at the last minute. Unable to take this lightly and vowing revenge, Ford II decides to use his considerable resources to defeat Ferrari in the 1966 Le Mans race. And a legend was born. ""Ford v Ferrari"" is the highly watchable cinematic depiction of the greatest rivalry in car racing history. Matt Damon portrays the calm and collected car designer Carroll Shelby who oversees the operation to win the race for Ford at Le Mans. Christian Bale plays the cocky and outspoken race car driver Ken Miles whose challenging personality stood out as much as his skill in driving. Together their tense relationship forms the heart of the story as their interaction covers the range of combative to genuine friendship as they make auto racing history. Of course, there's the races, where the high speed rush of the best cars of their time try to outspeed each other in fully charged blasts zooming to the finish line. One of the most notable bioflicks and a highlight in a year that has proven to be one of the best in cinema history, this is one that will turn out to be a fave among many fans of the silver screen."

","The stage curtains open ...<br/><br/>""Ford v Ferrari"" is exactly the movie it is billed to be. Movie magic that is a blast from the past with excellent performances by the entire cast. When I first saw the trailer for this film, I knew I had to see it. Sometimes, when you watch a preview, you can tell that you've just seen all the best parts of the movie. Not so with this one. It delivers.<br/><br/>The biopic starts with Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) receiving the bad news that he can no longer race since it would put too much strain on his heart and steer him to an early grave. So, he pairs up with race car driver, Ken Miles (Christian Bale) and together they form a friendship while remaining on the racing circuit and designing cars. When Ford Motors sales begin to plummet, Henry Ford II turns to Lee Iacocca for advice. Iacocca recommends that they purchase the now bankrupt Ferarri company. This plan is turned down by Enzo Ferarri who agrees to sell to Fiat instead. Enter Shelby and Miles as they team up with Ford to design a car that will put Ford back on the map by winning the famed Le Manz, a 24-hour endurance race.<br/><br/>I absolutely love this movie. It really is why we go to the theaters. The production values were second to none, the cinematography engaging, the racing stunts eye popping, the acting believable and the story involving. The only reason it doesn't get a full 10 stars from me is because it does run a little long. But, even so, you are so invested into the film, it goes by at a very good pace.<br/><br/>I highly recommend ""Ford v Ferarri"". I have plans to go see it at least one more time before it leaves the big screen. We're heading into December now, but it is easily one of my favorite films of the year. If you love a good story with enough action to keep you smiling, this is a great one for you. 9 stars out of 10."

"lavatch","Null","4","6","5 March 2020"," For a Film About Speed, This Was a Snoozefest
","""Ford v Ferrari"" is a film about speed. And yet somehow, the filmmakers seem clueless about pacing and holding an audience's attention. With a run time of 2 hours and 32 minutes, the film seemed interminable due to the long, padded scenes stuffed between the race car sequences.<br/><br/>The main problem with the film was in the character developments, which were one-dimensional and lifeless. A chorus of executives at the Ford Motor Company were an indistinguishable set of cookie-cutters. Incredibly, the visionary Lee Iococca blended in with the others, and it was never explained to viewers the genius of Iococca in the development of one of Ford's all-time best products, the Mustang. The one-note authoritarian dimension of Henry Ford II wore thin after his first scene, where he berates assembly line works and dismisses them for the day.<br/><br/>The two principal race car drivers were also a sorry lot. Matt Damon dials in his performance of Carroll Shelby, a washed-up driver with a bum sticker, who is the liaison between the Ford executives and the world of the speedway. Christian Bale plays the role of driver Ken Miles as a down-on-his-luck schlub with an attitude. The maudlin scenes between Miles and his kid were a pathetic showcase of parenting, wherein the values taught to the little boy are that being a reckless hothead in life somehow pays off.<br/><br/>The sappy dialogue of Miles and his long-suffering wife and the smarmy banter of the Ford executives bog the film down. Even the racing scenes were not as good as those crafted for ""The Art of Racing in the Rain."" From start to finish, ""Ford v Ferrari"" is a snoozefest and one of the most overrated films of 2019."

Just a couple of points ... it took Ford 3 years (not 2) to beat Ferrari, and, Shelby America came up with a system for changing brakes without changing the whole front suspension (which isn't what they showed in the movie). Sure, they changed out the caliper, but the rotor and caliper, and that was it. This seems like making a movie about the moon landing and claiming Apollo 10 got their first.

"babybuletgani","6","24","60","16 November 2019"," If you're unfamiliar with the titular race, you won't slip behind
","If you're unfamiliar with the titular race, you won't slip behind. Le Mans '66 requires no prior interest in the sport in the same way that you don't need to be a boxing fanatic to enjoy Rocky. At heart, it's a character piece; a platonic romance between two men best able to express themselves behind the wheel. Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon, affable as ever) is a former racerturned-car designer. In the '60s he's hired by Ford to head up the ailing motor company's morale-boosting effort to win the famous 24 Hours Of Le Mans endurance race. And, more specifically, to beat the reigning Ferrari team while doing so.
Shelby brings in his buddy Ken Miles (Christian Bale) not only to help design the vehicle that Ford is betting the farm on, but also to drive it. The aptly named Miles is purely driven by his passion for the automotive arts and an unquenchable need for speed. Wayward Brummie accent aside, it's a lovely, warm performance from Bale. There's the trademark intensity - heightened by his geometrically sharp cheekbones - but here it's in service to a common goal, and a love of the sport. Miles doesn't suffer fools, but there's a sweetness to his family-man side and the sheer thrill he gets from racing, hooting things like ""Giddy-up!"" as he pushes the rev counter to its limit. If Miles is the heart of the team, Shelby's the head, bringing his own racing expertise to bear while also managing the expectations of the suits upstairs, including the irascible Henry Ford II (Tracy Letts) and smarmy marketing type Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas). (There's a barely hidden filmmaking analogy here, as the creative visionaries struggle to keep their ideas on track while placating the needs of the executives.) Throw in Jon Bernthal as another, more amenable, exec and the cast starts to feel a little bloated, especially given that the two-hours-30 runtime is generous for a film on a largely predictable track. Bernthal's good, but did we really need another middle-man in the mix, given that Shelby already occupies that negotiator role?
Le Mans '66 truly roars into life during the racing scenes, particularly the final act show-stopper. The visceral, pulsequickening laps instantly join the canon of great race sequences, and they're a testament to the skill of director James Mangold and his team, equalling the set-pieces in any more obviously 'bankable' blockbusters. But Mangold's film isn't quite as compelling when not behind the wheel of a record-breaking sports car. For one thing, the US title Ford V Ferrari is somewhat misleading - yes, Ford are looking to unseat the Italian giants, but the latter are so little seen that there's never a palpable sense of a head-to-head rivalry. In their minimal screentime, the Italians come across as scowling stereotypes. And on the subject of stereotypes, Outlander's Caitriona Balfe is lumbered with a limited supportive-wife role as Mollie Miles. It's clear she knows her way around an engine, but she's rarely required to do more that squint with concern at a radio while her husband races. The family scenes don't quite get under the skin of Miles' compulsions in the way that First Man explored the more selfish aspects of Neil Armstrong's pursuits. It's on the physical side that Le Mans '66 really delivers - not only in the aforementioned races, but in the lo-fi mechanics, and the pit stops that canon of great race sequences, and they're a testament to the skill of director James Mangold and his team, equalling the set-pieces in any more obviously 'bankable' blockbusters. But Mangold's film isn't quite as compelling when not behind the wheel of a record-breaking sports car. For one thing, the US title Ford V Ferrari is somewhat misleading - yes, Ford are looking to unseat the Italian giants, but the latter are so little seen take an eternity in comparison to modern-day refuelling methods. The film is a visual treat, an expertly crafted piece of sun-burnished Americana, with no shortage of big-screen thrills. Mangold's career to date has seen a mix of straightforward blockbusters (Knight And Day, The Wolverine) and character pieces (Girl, Interrupted, Cop Land, Walk The Line) but, for all its strengths, Le Mans '66 doesn't straddle that divide as effectively as Mangold's last film, Logan, did."
"Magow-Intermean","9","17","40","1 November 2019"," Ford V Ferrari Review
","Ford v Ferrari thrills by simulating the record-breaking pace of the cars on the tracks, but really captivates because we care deeply about the men trying to make the victory happen.
Before his back-to-back dips into the comic-book universes of Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and the X-Men - in the films Logan and The Wolverine - James Mangold nimbly danced through genres in search of compelling characters. He'd make a Tom Cruise actioner like Knight & Day, but add on a bumbling innocent character to spice up the routine spy genre. He'd plunge into a conventional biopic like Walk the Line, but reinvent it with the aide of two commanding performance at the head of his Johnny Cash story.
Mangold's back at the helm of a sturdy, red-blooded American story of ingenuity and stick-to-your-guns re-invention for the spectacular new Ford v Ferrari. You've probably seen this type of story told before, but rarely this well, with supreme talents overcoming nearly impossible odds to achieve a goal everyone tells them they can't get.
It's the late 1960s, and Henry Ford II (Tracy Letts) faces a serious issue. The Ford brand, time-tested and baked into the American popular culture, is struggling to contend against an onslaught of cooler, hipper cars. Kids coming back from the war hardly want to plunk down cash on the cars on which their dads used to depend. Ford needs bold, company-saving ideas, and Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal) has one.
Iacocca wants Ford to compete on the global racing circuit. Specifically, Iacocca wants Ford to go head-to-head with the dominant force of the international circuit: Enzo Ferrari (Remo Girone). To do that, Ford recruits two men with intimate knowledge of this field: celebrated automotive designer Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon), who raced in and won the annual 24 Hours of LeMans in 1959; and Ken Miles (Christian Bale), a hard-headed and short-tempered grease monkey who has a seamless connection to his automobiles, and might be the only person talented enough to drive the car Ford needs to build from scratch.
Even if you know the results of the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans - and the outcome has been famous in the race world since the moment the event concluded - Mangold's Ford v Ferrari captivates and entertains with the peaks and valleys of the team's journey. The riveting drama spins a classic narrative of teamwork and ingenuity in the face of stifling adversity, as Shelby and Miles constantly had to convince Ford of the risks that needed to be taken if they actually wanted to win the race, and not just contend.
Mangold recruits two of the greatest male actors working today to play his leads, but they are overshadowed by one intangible co-star I like to call ""speed."" The racing scenes in Ford v Ferrari are breathtakingly innovative, with Mangold and his team routinely figuring out new ways to put us in the driver's seat of some of the fastest vehicles on the planet. The chief obstacle facing Shelby and Miles was making their protoptype race car faster, so the tests performed in the film had to convey that achievement. Ferrari thrills by simulating the record-breaking pace of the cars on the tracks, but really captivates because we care deeply about the men trying to make the victory happen.
Bale, in particular, is fantastic as the flawed and conceited Ken Miles, a dedicated husband and father who can't help but put his passion for cars ahead of the family he loves. He's conflicted by his desire to be around for them, but unable to resist the temptation that comes with the challenge of being right about the cars that Shelby fights to design. Arguably, Ford could not have competed at 24 Hours of Le Mans without Ken Miles' contributions, and I'd shudder to think of a version of Ford v Ferrari without Bale behind the wheel.
Under Mangold's watchful eye, Ford v Ferrari tells a stirring, inspirational story about professional pride, and tells it extremely well. The screenplay creates rich, complicated characters out of its underdog-sport template (though two supporting characters drag the main plot down with their unnecessary contributions), and Mangold's precision for filmmaking helps the ride stay perpetually smooth and swift. Hollywood used to specialize in these audience-bonding crowd pleasers. Now they are few and far between, so when one speeds along and is firing on all cylinders, so out of your way to support it."
"drjgardner","4","26","66","18 November 2019"," Great acting doesn't save a poor script
","There is some really good acting from all the principals in this film, but the direction is slow and shoddy and the script itself calls for too many shots of people changing gears, cars moving around the track, etc. Equally disappointing is the failure to once mention the Corvette, the raison d'etra for the Mustang in the first place."
"Prismark10","6","10","21","22 January 2020"," Le Mans '66
","Ford v Ferrari sees Christian Bale channeling his inner Nigel Mansell. He plays the racer Ken Mills, a war hero from Sutton Coldfield who became a maverick race driver for the fledgeling Ford racing team.<br/><br/>Mills is recruited by former racer turned car designer Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) who has been hired by the Ford Motor Company to turn around the company's fortunes by making their cars look hip. To do this they are going to knock Ferrari off their perch and win the Le Mans 24 hours race.<br/><br/>Of course it is odd to see Ford, a corporate Goliath to be cast as the underdog here. The racing division is championed by Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal) but the fly in the ointment is Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas) a square peg in a round hole.<br/><br/>In their sights is Ferrari, who themselves are struggling financially and have the temerity to object to being bought out by Ford. In retaliation Ford develop a racing car at a super speed with Miles testing it.<br/><br/>Ford v Ferrari is an enjoyable if overlong melodrama, the Le Mans race scenes are done very well. I did find the portrayal of Beebe as the token villain to be facile. He was there to give the film unnecessary tension.<br/><br/>The best performance is from Bale who leaves Damon behind."

"eelen-seth","10","19","46","11 November 2019"," The most entertaining film you'll see this year.
","Every year there is a film that has a little bit of everything to please anyone out there. A film that has heart, passion for a craft, strong performers, dreams that become reality - a film worth watching on the big screen, that keeps you entertained for 150 minutes. Well, Ford v Ferrari is that film.<br/><br/>American car designer Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) and driver Ken Miles (Christian Bale) battle corporate interference, the laws of physics and their own personal demons to build a revolutionary race car for Ford and challenge Ferrari at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, the world's oldest active sports car race in endurance racing, in 1966.<br/><br/>Shelby and Miles aren't doing this for fame or the prize at the end of the finish line, they do it because they love racing, building something from scratch and making it even better than ever thought possible. That's where the heart of this film lies. Just like those guys, you can tell director James Mangold and his team made this film with a passion for filmmaking. From production design, to camera movements in- and outside the race cars, to the attention to detail when it comes to costume design and historic accuracy. A true feat for Hollywood and for cinema goers worldwide.<br/><br/>20th Century Fox/Disney does seem to want to attract an audience that's interested in cars and racing, but this film is more than just that. It's about business and family, the message this film tells without any hesitance is universal and will keep everyone intrigued for its entire two and a half hour runtime. There's never a dull moment in this what might seem boring on paper event-film. Even the longest dialogues are riddled with Bale's over-the-top face acting and writers Jez Butterworth, John-Henry Butterworth and Jason Keller made sure to have serious conversations supercharged with dry humour. Bale proves how much of an acting-chameleon he is - I've never seen him do anything like this before. Even Damon, who I'm personally not the biggest fan of, since I find him very one-note, deserves my recognition as being simply incredible as Bale's on screen ""co-driver"".<br/><br/>The supporting cast might not be filled with household Hollywood names, but this cast is without a doubt one of the best ensembles you'll see all year. Noah Jupe (A Quiet Place) and Caitriona Balfe (Outlander) as Miles' son and wife will have many viewers look up their names. Jupe has a joyful screen presence that makes you want to protect him at all costs, while Balfe stands her ground with her mesmerising charisma. Her chemistry with Bale feels so naturally intimate, as if they're a married couple in real life - I found myself smiling every time they interacted with each other - magical! Jon Bernthal, Tracy Letts and Remo Girone each give compelling performances in every scene they bump and run.<br/><br/>Although I said this wasn't just a movie about racing, it does have the most spectacular race sequences I've seen in years, thanks to Phedon Papamichael's off the charts cinematography, flawless VFX and the amazing sound design team. Following the cars on ground level in hair clip turns is sweat inducing and will have you gasping for clean air when stuff completely goes wrong. There's never a moment you won't believe it's not Bale himself who sits behind the wheel.<br/><br/>Ford v Ferrari is the kind of movie everyone will enjoy. It has big Hollywood stars telling a timeless story about friendship and making dreams come true. In a year, full of sequels and remakes, what more do you want? This is one of the most entertaining films you'll see this year."

Every character in this movie seemed like they were playing their modern day selves, just on a sixties set with sixties clothing.<br/><br/>Matt Damon basically plays himself, almost like he walked off the Bourne set and put a cowboy hat on. Bam, that' was the extent of his attempt to play Carol Shelby. Total joke, I wouldn't have paid him a dollar to play this role. They really could have found someone better.<br/><br/>The movie was an hour too long. It was dumbed down for the Thanksgiving Dinner crowd. If you didn't see the documentary, you wouldn't know what was going on. There really was nothing about the engineering that went on with making the car. It was all about Carroll Shelby and Ken Miles.<br/><br/>Things about the movie were just weird. One character had a bubble jacket that I don't think would have been around back then. Matt Damon's character goes to meet Ken Miles' wife after a certain event, doesn't go speak to her...also, in spite of a tragic event recently happening, she and the kid act like nothing is wrong and life is great. It's really bizarre and lazy directing.<br/><br/>I can't recommend the movie, it was terrible, sorry. The documentary is far superior. This was just bad."

","Automotive geniuses sell their soul to corporate bureaucracy in effort to develop killer endurance race car. Carroll Shelby, the most beloved car designer in American history, faces the music when it comes to dealing with the Big Boys. His desire for endurance race success coincides with Ford's corporate decision to get racier, inspired by Lee Iacocco (the father of the Mustang). After that it's all individualism vs. corporate bullxxxx. I think Damon is the most reliable star out there, and it's a stretch but not too much of a stretch for him to play country outlaw Shelby. Bale is also stretch but a workable stretch for the equally individualistic Miles, a Brit racer and car designer. Henry Ford II is also magnificently played. The CGI was under control, the movie ran long but not unpleasantly so, the wrap up was a tad awkward but that happens. Appears to have captured the basic facts and feelings of the true life events, for which it deserves kudos. Could be enjoyed by non-racing fans."

","From a production standpoint: this film is bloody brilliant. Expert craftsmanship all around from the photography, editing, acting. I imagine this was a very difficult film to make and was handled with expertise.<br/><br/>The screenplay was very disappointing, however.<br/><br/>The racing scenes are fantastic, but most of the non-racing scenes are just cookie-cutter and uninspired. If the racing scenes weren't so thrilling and engaging, this movie wouldn't have a leg to stand on. There are certain themes and elements which James Mangold does so well-and you can expect to see them in this film-but they're never really explored with much depth. Themes such as fatherhood, sacrifice, independence in spite of authority, what a man must do to take care of his family, a child's expectations of their father; all of these are just lifeless, dead on arrival.<br/><br/>There's one female character in the film and she gets to sit at home and be the supportive wife to Christian Bale's character. That said, this is one of Christian Bale's best performances. He steals every scene he's in-but, unfortunately he only is ever given the same 3 beats to play. How many times can you watch him get angry when someone tells him he can't do something? Entertaining as it may be, it grows stale after a while.<br/><br/>The two-and-a-half-hour run time feels like three. Fantastic editing not withstanding, at least thirty minutes of the film could have cut. Cut this film down by thirty minutes, and you have a serious Oscar contender. Keep it the way it is, and you have a real letdown of what could have been one of the year's best."

The whole thing about this movie is that it's not about racing. If you're expecting a racing movie, better go and watch earlier installments of Fast & Furious franchise. This movie is about a great friendship and one of the most famous rivalries in the history of motorsports. Yes, it is a drama, that tells us a very sad story, that I won't tell now in order to avoid any spoilers.
it's amazing how good were the writers and the director, who managed to make an intense movie for a motorsports fan like myself. Knowing the story in details, I was sitting there an watching the movie living every second of it. Amazing work!
Matt Damon and especially Christian Bale are outstanding.
There are slight differences with the real story, but my guess is that it was done with purpose, to make the story more interesting/dramatic.
Overall one of the new additions to the my favorite movie list.
Go to the cinemas, grab a huge pop corn and enjoy more than 2 hours of an excitig story, some very well done racing sequences, great acting and some very good humor.

","Blech, did Ron Howard direct this thing, or is James Mangold just trying to trick us into thinking he did?<br/><br/>Look, I'm not at all into cars or car racing, so maybe I'm not the target audience for this. But I'm also not into diamonds or the diamond business, and I thought ""Uncut Gems"" was one of the best films of the year. I don't have to be ""into"" a subject in order to enjoy a movie about it, if the movie is done well.<br/><br/>""Ford v Ferrari"" is the kind of dull, bland movie made to be nominated for a Best Picture Academy Award, which....guess what?.....it was. The world is full of urgent problems, so what's the last thing we need? A bro movie about a car race from 50 years ago. But if you're going to make one, try to make one more memorable than this. This is the kind of movie that makes whenever it's set look like a glossy magazine version of that particular time period. It's the kind of movie that has one woman in it, in this case The Wife, who the screenplay assures us belongs in this world of boring white men because she knows a lot about cars and can be sexually suggestive when talking about them. It's the kind of movie that lets us know who the chief rival in the big final race is by cutting to shots of him glowering at the screen literally every 15 seconds. It's full of a certain American attitude I simply can't stand, exemplified by the fact that it has to make all of the Europeans in the movie look like bungling fools. I'm not sure what the movie's point is. I think it means to set up a conflict between those men who built and raced cars because of their passion for the art of it and those who just wanted to make a buck off of it. So of course this message is packaged in the safest, shiniest, most corporate Hollywood product imaginable.<br/><br/>Matt Damon's good ol' boy accent is unacceptable. Christian Bale is too good to be in this movie. Noah Jupe is a cute kid but he's used as a cheap narrative tactic to make us even more worried about the race scenes because we don't want to have to watch a little boy watch his dad go up in flames in real time. The best moment in the movie belongs to Tracey Letts.<br/><br/>Grade: C"

Occasionally, you become One with Le Car, somewhere right around 7,000rpm, and you either ascend into pure energy, or you blow a rod shifting into a bonus gear.<br/><br/>There are a few chances for Ford v Ferrari to be a more socially meaningful film, maybe more openings for more clever statements about the stuffiness of businessmen and suited executives versus the life-loving, individualistic visionaries who make the businessmen jealous because they do not have the creativity or talent to do much beyond monetizing other people's excellences. On the other hand, the movie does a good job of instilling the adrenaline rush of setting new lap records, none of which feels very safe.<br/><br/>If we all were to make a list of stuff to do for exactly 24 hours, speed racing is not likely to appear on many of our lists.

Here he gives us an ordinary man with exatraordinary abilities and quite a tough mindset. He is great and once again proves he is one of hte most verstaile actors out there. Matt Damon was also good but definitely stayed in the shadow of Bale. Also because I think the characters were much more intersted in developing Ken than Carroll. And this is one of the very few flaws of the film. Another worth-to-mention perfomance came from Tracey Letts. and on a lesser extend Jon Bernthal.
James Mangold understood perfectly to Combine strong characters in a very solid Story with many great technical aspects to make one of a Kind of Hollywood film I dearly miss.

Each of them has multiple scenes in which they are alternately charming and sympathetic. I was a teen when the historical events depicted in the movie occurred, and I remember some of them, which made this especially interesting to me. Occasionally the film falters when it succumbs to cliche, for example when it depicts the relentless efforts of Henry Ford II's kissing, sniveling right-hand man to undermine our heroes.

"ferguson-6","8","7","15","20 November 2019"," feel the vroom!
","Greetings again from the darkness. 7000 RPM. Racing legend Carroll Shelby describes that as the moment of racing bliss in the opening of the film. We are reminded of early test pilots breaking the sound barrier, or explorers reaching the peak of Mt. Everest. What follows is two-and-a-half hours of history, rivalries, egos, and sport. The racing scenes are exhilarating, and the men are driven by testosterone and compelled to be the best. They are throwbacks to a different era. An era that wasn't about fairness and feelings, but of determination and focus that produced results - either success or failure. There were winners and losers, and the ceremonies awarded no participation ribbons.<br/><br/>Who are these men? They are Carroll Shelby, Ken Miles, Henry Ford II, and Enzo Ferrari. Director James Mangold (LOGAN, WALK THE LINE) takes the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans and turns it into a rivalry between car makers, a friendship between racing icons, a look at corporate buffoonery that still exists today, and an old-fashioned movie that is fun to watch ... regardless of whether you know the first thing about racing or cars.<br/><br/>Matt Damon plays Carroll Shelby, the war veteran race driver-turned-designer hired to push Ford racing into world class status. Shelby is an industry icon who won the 1959 Le Mans before retiring due to a heart condition. He then founded and ran Shelby-American for designing and improving cars. He wore cowboy hats that were only eclipsed in size by his bravura in most situations. Christian Bale plays legendary driver Ken Miles, another war veteran and bombastic friend of Shelby, who can best be described as a race car savant. Contrary to the film's title, the story belongs to these two men, and the film belongs to these two actors.<br/><br/>Co-writers Jez Butterworth, John-Henry Butterworth, and Jason Keller take some liberties with the script and bend a few historical details to make the parts fit a Hollywood production ... but for the most part, the story is pretty accurate. Just a few years after the Edsel fiasco, Henry Ford II is agitated at the state of Ford Motor Company, and after a bitter and personally insulting failed buyout of Ferrari, Mr. Ford (played with proper arrogance by Tracy Letts) decides to engage in motor-measuring with the Italian company run by Enzo Ferrari (Remo Girone). He hires Shelby to elevate Ford racing to elite status with one main goal - beating Ferrari at Le Mans. Shelby's cocksure approach manages to keep Miles onboard despite the internal battles with Ford executives, especially Leo Beebe (a smarmy Josh Lucas). Beebe doesn't see Miles as ""a Ford man"", and in what is all too common in corporate life, prefers style over substance.<br/><br/>The film could have easily been titled Corporate vs Cars. Although the Henry Ford vs Enzo Ferrari segment is quite entertaining, most of the time is spent with Shelby and Miles trying to reach their dream while negotiating corporate obstacles. These two men have a love for racing and each other - in an old school, manly-respect kind of way. They are simpatico in their quest for the perfect car, and as Miles explains to his son (Noah Jupe) in a terrific scene, the perfect lap.<br/><br/>Additional supporting roles include Jon Bernthal as young visionary Lee Iacocca (who died earlier this year), Caitriona Balfe as Miles' supportive wife, and Ray McKinnon as Phil Remington, the lead engineer on Shelby's team. Of course, Iacocca went on to become Chairman of Chrysler, where he brought in Shelby to consult on the Dodge Viper, among other models. Supposedly Le Mans racing legend and 6-time winner Jackie Ickx appears in a crowd shot, but I missed it.<br/><br/>There is a stark contrast between the Ferrari factory and the Ford assembly line, but the egos at the top are remarkably similar. A bruised ego lit the fuse for the rivalry, but it was the car guys who made it happen. The racing scenes are adrenaline-packed and the sound in the theatre, combined with Cinematographer Phedon Papamichael (SIDEWAYS, NEBRASKA) close-ups inside the car, allow us to feel the rumble and vibration and speed sensation inside the Ford GT40. Damon and Bale are terrific. Damon struts with Shelby's confidence, and Bale (after a huge weight loss from his role as Dick Cheney in VICE) captures the cantankerous genius of Miles - plus seeing his yell at other drivers during races is hilarious. There is a comical rumble between Miles and Shelby that will remind no one of Batman and Jason Bourne, but as difficult as it is to make popping a clutch exciting on the big screen, Mangold's team comes through."

Come on, writers! Couldn't you do better than this?<br/><br/>Very much a boy's adventure pic with a slight seasoning of 'vulnerable man' stuff thrown in as a sop to 21st century sensibilities. In the only female role of any consequence, Caitriona Balfe is strong and supportive, but, for all the difference her character makes to the story, she might just as well not be there.<br/><br/>In the manner of all films about motor racing (e.g. GRAND PRIX, John Frankenheimer's 1966 movie), the race footage is what it's all about, and some of FORD v FERRARI's is genuinely thrilling.

","Had a personal day yesterday and picked out a movie I figured my girlfriend didn't want to see (and boy was I right, for multiple reasons).<br/><br/>Bale phones in his performance with a subpar Cockney accent that doesn't fool ANYONE, the script is predictable and the dialogue is flat and boring and makes you cringe so many times you start fearing for your health.<br/><br/>I was close to leaving the theater at multiple occasions, and I was never as close as during the ""fight"" scene outside Bale's house. At that point, one thinks someone in the crew should've had the integrity to raise his or her voice and say they should just go ahead and scrap the whole thing. Cut their losses.<br/><br/>It felt like a two hour and thirty minute Disney Channel-straight-to-DVD movie that could've easily been compressed to 60 minutes.<br/><br/>The only demographics I see enjoying this are kids, and male car buffs in their 60s that still daydream about winning ""that"" race and riding down into the sunset with that girl from high school they were too scared to speak to speak to 45 years ago.<br/><br/>For Bale, whose been on a roll in decent years, this movie is blemish of the worst kind. Sucks."

","One word: boring. Whoever thought this was a good idea for a movie should learn programming computers to perform specific functions. They should certainly never work at anything requiring interaction with the public. No good guys, bad guys, twists, or payoffs on the supposed expectations. I don't viscerally hate many movies. This is one. I usually like Damon, Bale, Berndahl, and many of the other cast. I had to force myself to sit through the whole thing. If you really want to check this out, wait for free streaming somewhere.

"harrylosborne","5","6","13","19 December 2019"," Americanised racing completely misses the point
","Typically if you show me a decent trailer involving actors of the calibre of Matt Damon and Christian Bale, I will be at least interested in seeing more. Couple that with a film that appeared to stay faithful to racing's core principles and sparsely use CGI for stunts, I was then invested in seeing where this depiction of Le Mans '66 would end up going. My doubts, regretfully, were reinforced roughly halfway through the film: the plot had devolved, the characters inconsequential, and the on-screen action boiled down to a clunky contest between the ""God-driven, hard-working"" Ford company and their lazily-stereotyped adversaries at Ferrari.<br/><br/>Carroll Shelby (Damon), an ex-racer now mechanic/expert on the national circuit is recruited by Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal) to begin work on a racing outfit under the name of Ford. Interestingly, Bernthal (a highly regarded actor in his own right) was painted in the trailers as a key figure in this film - however, he is marginalised almost instantly, making the final product appear recut since shooting finished. Shelby recommends the British driver Ken Miles (Bale), a notoriously difficult but brilliant driver to race under Ford at Le Mans. However, a comically minor incident between Miles and Chief Exec Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas) begins the most out-of-proportion grudge between the two, constantly trying to screw the company over for absolutely no founded reason other than they rubbed the wrong way.<br/><br/>This is the plot for the next 2 hours, interspersed with ugly stereotypes of either the English (through Miles and his family) or the Italians (portrayed as evil, scheming foreigners working under Enzo Ferrari's orders). This further ruins the realism of the entire film - am I really supposed to believe that the conglomerate that is Ford Motors is really the altruist in a story about the authenticity of racing? Further to this - isn't it beyond indolent to completely omit Miles' driving partners (Bruce McLaren and Denny Hulme) in a film about a race requiring two drivers throughout? The narrative constantly eludes that ""only Ken Miles is good enough to drive this race"", and yet he is constantly partnered with someone who must have been as good to maintain their success.<br/><br/>The driving is almost secondary to the glaring errors throughout the film, but it does provide some relief from the cringeworthy American narrative. The cars do look authentic and rough; the clothing matches the era, and the design of the film on the most part is clean and period-accurate. This shouldn't really come as a surprise given the profile and budget of the film, and almost makes the real issue (something I wasn't focussed on but that my father did point out) even more glaring: the driving makes no sense. Miles will be ""visualising"" his perfect lap, smooth changes and steady racing, and then come race-day, will slam the gears in and yank the steering wheel round corners like nobody in an endurance race ever would. This, to me, is a killer to a film reliant on accuracy - you cannot expect the audience to respect your work if you yourselves cannot stay faithful to the source material.<br/><br/>I wanted to like this film. I am still waiting for a film based on cars or planes to really blow me away. Dunkirk mad me sure that this sort of cinema can be done well, but they need both a director who breathes the topic, as well as a production company willing to take the financial risk to fully commit to creating this sort of feature."

","Passion, devotion, friendship. Absolute fantastic, fast paced and well written experience from start to finish. Loved the chemistry between the two main characters. Christian Bale was absolutely outstanding, and even though he had done this before, the body transformation from portraying Dick Chaney to Ken Miles still just makes me want to stand up and clap my hands. His determination and commitment to the role is on another level, not achievable to most actors out there. I've read that the main reason Damon wanted to do this movie, was to be able to work with Bale. Seemed like they two knew each other for years and have done dozens of movies together. The fight scene was hilarious!<br/><br/>As somebody who didn't know the story at all or have had any interest in Le Mans, the racing footage was excellent and well presented. It really makes you sad when Ken was cheated out of winning it but you can see he didn't care. He wasn't in it for fame.<br/><br/>Go and see it on the big screen while you can.

","Matt Damon and Christian Bale both gave terrific performances, but I felt like the movie was lacking something throughout.

"BA_Harrison","8","13","35","5 November 2019"," It's a winner!
","I'm no petrolhead. What little knowledge I have of classic cars I gleaned from playing Top Trumps as a kid. I do remember that if you had either the Ford GT40 or a Ferrari card, there was a very good chance of winning the hand, unless, of course, the two cars came up against each other. Then you had to choose wisely.<br/><br/>In the mid-'60s, Ford and Ferrari fought it out for real at Le Mans, a road race that lasts almost as long as this film (jk). At a whopping 152 minutes, director James Mangold's biopic is no quick win, but buckle up and sit back for the duration and you will be rewarded with a film that delivers great performances, a gripping tale of determination and courage, and some truly spectacular racing scenes (real or CGI? I couldn't tell).<br/><br/>Matt Damon plays car designer Carroll Shelby (the man who gave us the AC Cobra, another good Top Trumps card) who is hired by Ford Motors to help build a car that can beat Ferrari at Le Mans, thereby improving the company's image in the eyes of young Americans and putting the Italians in their place at the same time. Christian Bale is Ken Mills, the man chosen by Shelby to drive the car against the wishes of Ford executive Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas).<br/><br/>A classic underdog story, the film follows the team as they design and test the new race-car, experiencing various setbacks along the way (some of which are orchestrated by Beebe, who wants to see Mills fail), before finally making it to France. American viewers will no doubt feel a sense of pride at Ford's remarkable endeavour, but it'll be us Brits who'll be cheering the loudest (at least on the inside), for it is Englishman Ken Miles (a likeable turn from Christian Bale) who is the real hero of the film, pushing himself and the car to the limits.<br/><br/>The legendary 24-hour road race itself delivers all the thrills and spills necessary for an edge-of-the-seat finale, with Mills making a mockery of the Ferrari team as promised, but anyone geared up for a feel-good finish will be sorely disappointed, reality rarely being the fairytale we would like it to be. Remaining true to the facts, the film's final lap delivers a double-whammy of a downer that drives home the fact that, sometimes, life just sucks.<br/><br/>7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for the hilarious scene in which Shelby takes Henry Ford II (Tracy Letts) for a quick spin (and I do mean quick!)."

If nothing else, at least it's pretty damn good-looking and the racing scenes are shot and edited in a pretty high-octane way. Apart from that, it's cozily predictable (compulsory oft-repeated family melodrama and all), whether you know the history or not, but mercifully not in an enraging way like most movies of this type. A passable companion piece to Ron Howard's 'Rush'. I give it 5.5/10."

"i-88996","10","3","5","23 January 2020"," Ford V Ferrari
","Fast and Furious, no not the movie, the two words that best describe James Mangolds newest project, Ford V Ferrari. On the outside, Ford V Ferrari may seem like your run of the mill racing movie with a simple plot, but after watching you realize that it is much more than that. You see obsession, tension, and an overarching rivalry between The Ford Motorcompany and Ferrari. Henry Ford II (Tracy Letts), shows a compulsive behavior that radiates to those around him, he feels a need to win. For a chance at winning the 1966 24 Hours at Le Mans, Ford recruits Carol Shelby (Matt Damon), who then brings in Ken Miles (Christian Bale) as his faithful driver that has a bad rap in the racing scene but most importantly he can drive, and he can win. Starting out racing smaller circuits, Miles is afraid his racing career won't lead to success, and with a wife and a son, he is pressured to put down racing all together. This is until he is approached by Shelby about the plan Ford has to tarnish Ferrari's successful reputation in Le Mans.
Throughout the movie, Miles has a hostile relationship with Ford and its head executives. Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal) doesn't see Miles as being the face of Fords racing team. Miles and Shelby are constantly fighting with Henry Ford II and his team of executives to try to gain the freedom to create what they want. Shelby's outside the box thinking mixed with Miles' self centered attitude show how much they can influence a big brand, even if everyone is against them. Fords financial problems mixed with jabs taken at Henry Ford II by Enzo Ferrari encourages Ford to give Shelby the keys Fords new racing team.
Damon's cool southern composure and Bales witty thinking create a perfect chemistry that is hard to recreate. Although the team may fight, sometimes literally, they always seem to show respect and understanding for each other. Shelby, from the beginning, sees something in Miles and he can tell Miles will be the best driver for Ford. After getting the offer to race for Ford by Shelby, Miles quickly gets to work developing the famed GT40 race car, the only American made car to win the 24 Hours at Le Mans to this day.
Mangolds vision and execution in this movie perfectly encapsulates the golden age of racing. A time when teams did anything they could to win, when innovation was new and ideas were fresh. Everything from the sound design and visual effects to the pace of the movie flawlessly fuse together to keep you involved and interested. Everyone from gearheads that know every dimension of every part of the cars used in the movie, to those who have never thought to change their oil will be satisfied with this movie. Along with the cars, you also get to see relationships grow, watch hard times get resolved with hard work, and challenges get over come with persistence, making this a great all-around movie."

My only critique is that it is a long movie. It's appx 3 hours long and you can feel it by the end.<br/><br/>That being said, this is, in my opinion, the best movie of the year. Bale brought an Oscar winning performance as Ken Miles, a hardened, entertaining race car driver. His performance was probably one of the best of his careers. That was backed up by Damon, who played Carroll Shelby, a race car manufacturer with a love of racing. I only say that he backed up Bale because of how impressive Bale was, but if Damon had been alone in this movie, he would have easily been the star.<br/><br/>The filming and editing was phenomenal.

","The Ford vs. Ferrari story is amazingly accurate for a Hollywood made movie. Like many others, I ran to Wikipedia to look up Ken Miles and Carroll Shelby. Miles was a great car racer but not well known outside of car racing circles.The movie lovingly recreates that era and throws in a first rate cast headlined by Damon and Bales, but the rest of the characters ring true. The race car scenes which grab you by the throat are realistic as hell and heart pounding. The scenes showing the introduction of the new Ford Mustang, I remember very well. There were huge crowds at the Ford dealers and the demand for the cars was tremendous. Car racing back in the 1960's was a deadly dangerous sport with very few of the safety features incorporated in today's race cars. The Ford GT 40 really was fast and could hit 220 mph on the straightaways which is what today's Indy cars do, just for comparison. Matt Damon does a great job as Carroll Shelby, but minimizes the way Shelby cut corners in how he sold his cars, and he was slapped on the wrist a few times for his car selling practices. This is one of the few movies today that I would actually buy. It is such a great story and just listening to the sounds those cars made is worth the price. There isn't much not to like in this movie and it is a good antidote to the real world we are living in today if only for a few hours. I loved this movie."

","Ford versus Ferrari is too bland of a title for this amazing movie. International title Le Mans 66 already sounds much better. I would however propose Miles & Shelby: Friendship Through Racing. This is what the movie is all about. There is a lot of competition, culture, drama, hardship and racing in this film but once you have gotten the bigger picture, this movie really is about the friendship between an ambitious constructor and a tough driver.<br/><br/>This gem of a movie convinces on numerous levels. The settings are authentic and bring the United States of America, Italy and France of the mid-sixties back to life. An old sports car here, an iconic poster there and legendary race circuits bring back the pioneer age of race driving.<br/><br/>The actresses and actors are doing an outstanding job. Christian Bale and Matt Damon are two of the greatest actors to be around and they underline their excellent reputation for two and a half entertaining hours. Christian Bale convinces as rough guy with a tender core who cares as much about his own success as he does about his son who idolizes him. Matt Damon incarnates an ambitious entrepreneur who always strives to make the impossible possible. The supporting actors and actresses are also noteworthy as Caitriona Balfe convinces as resilient, smart and emotional wife and mother while Remo Girone delivers the goods by incarnating legendary entrepreneur Enzo Ferrari.<br/><br/>The story is obviously also addictive as viewers care about the fates of the charismatic protagonists. The plot might be predictable, especially if you have some background knowledge about the actual events this movie is based upon. This however doesn't reduce this film's enjoyment because everything is crafted with authenticity, detail and wit.<br/><br/>In the end, anyone who likes racing must watch this intense drama despite a few minor lengths. Those who were longing for a similar movie after the astonishing Rush six years earlier, will finally get something to crave for. Ford versus Ferrari is one of the most emotional dramas of the year and best enjoyed on the big screen at your local movie theatre."

Id even say Josh Lucas is only here because the writers think the stakes of a 24 hour race aren't enough so one needs the Corporate Suit Who Is Against Our Rebel Batman-Driver (and not to say there weren't pencil-pushing hacks at Ford then, I wasn't there and neither were you, but it's a total cliche thru and thru).<br/><br/>....YET, There's two things. First, to make a car analogy again because it's fitting, Ford v Ferrari works and moves like a dependable and well-oiled machine and which, not to get off on a long tangent because who the hell has time, would probably please journalists nowadays looking for ""Pizzazz"" with otherwise enthralling events (sorry if you know what Im referring to and I digress on current events), it also has star-actors who get to find subtleties within the little beats of the script and/or where Manhole finds a moment to let it breathe (a pivotal character beat between Ken and Mollie where she speeds like hell to get the bloody truth out of his man ends up being one, and so in the very last scene with Shelby and the kid), fantastic cinematography and editing and a score/song selections that rock immensely, and Tracy Letts (writer of Bug and Killer Joe) hilariously crying like a baby at another key scene in a fast car.<br/><br/>Second, the climax threw me for a loop in a way that made me very pleased - especially, as odd timing and weird I won't say luck but happenstance would have it, as this is a former Fox movie but now ""owned"" by Disney - because it speaks to a strong, hard lesson about what can happen in following the Corporate Line. Ken could go one way and be the independent rock star hero he is to himself and his son and a few others, or follow what he's been told will look good for a photo. His decision at first seems like and is deceptively a ""Good"" beat, where it's almost like the movie is saying, ""yeah, sometimes you gotta suck it up and do what they tell you."" But the actual consequence of this turns it on its head, and while the film doesn't hold on it for too long, it still resonates in a world where so many people are told to do something a particular way, and it opens one up to get... Screwed.<br/><br/>I don't know if I read into it too much or the way the filmmakers intended, but it puts an excellent bow on the underlying subtext (or flat out text, your pick) about how to get ahead or not get ahead or simply the pitfalls in a world dominated by corporate interests.<br/><br/>Oh, and it's a helluva adaptation of Speed Racer and/or Mario Kart, you decide there."

","I don't what to say - it just wasn't for me. If you're not into racing or cars or the ""american dream"" I think this is probably a movie to miss. For me, it was already not my style, but on top of that it felt like a film that had recycled the plot and characters of every other sports movie and re-skinned it.<br/><br/>Both Bale and Damon's accents were laid on thicker than ""fur on a frog"". Did I do that right? Apart from that - the performances were likely the highlight in the otherwise underwhelming film.<br/><br/>Another issue is that at least in other sports films there's a clearer, unifying theme to the movie. This film felt confused at times. Was Ford's bureaucracy a detriment or a strength? It flipped on a dime between what seemed like demonizing and congratulating Ford. Was it about friendship? That theme did not seem apart until its final scene - leaving it as a last ditch effort to move and connect the audience to the characters. At the very least we could say it celebrated Ken Miles for his achievements in the racing world - so kudos to that."

","Who would've thought that the year's most purely enjoyable cinematic delight would come to us in the form of what on paper appears to be a petrol heads delight?<br/><br/>Low and behold though, James Mangold's magnificently filmed, scripted and acted true life tale of motorsport legends Carroll Shelby and Ken Miles is not only a cracking biopic accessible to those of all ages but one of the year's best filmed big screen treats that is sure to be a major player at the upcoming awards season.<br/><br/>Stepping behind the camera for the first time since he delivered big results with Logan in 2017, Mangold maintains the form he found with the well-respected comic book adaptation to give Ford v Ferrari (also known as Le Mans '66 in many territories) a consistent energy and heart that maintains an almost flawless ability across its two and a half hour run-time to keep us glued to the screen throughout.<br/><br/>Mixing both character beats and high-octane spectacle, the race sequences in Ford v Ferrari are a site to behold, Mangold's managed to do what Ron Howard did with Rush a few years ago and make a car film for everyone as those seeking 4-wheeled action will be happy just as those that are seeking out character beats and focus will be.<br/><br/>Working off a genuinely funny and heartfelt script by Jez and John-Henry Buttersworth and Jason Keller, Mangold's exploration of the typical American hero Shelby and the deadest driven and wild Ken Miles work with Ford in 1966 to create a machine that could take down Ferrari's reign as Le Mans champion may follow a formula we've come to expect from such a film but it does so in such a fun, energetic and soulful way that Ford v Ferrari feels fresh and new, with two killer central performances to boot.<br/><br/>Teaming up for the first time in their varied career, Matt Damon as Shelby and Christian Bale as Miles create one of the year's most memorable double bills, an on screen relationship that will make you laugh, fist pump and possibly even shed a tear or two as the two motor racing geniuses battle against the odds, a bunch of Ford suit and ties and themselves to achieve their goals.<br/><br/>We've come to expect a certain standard from these two performers but both Damon and Bale excel here, with Bale in particular delivering another awards worthy turn as Miles, who in the wrong hands could've become downright unlikeable but here comes out as a man we can't help but respect and admire. While its unlikely Bale will walk away with any significant silverware in such a crowded year for male performances of note, there's a good chance his turn here will be fondly remembered as one of his best.<br/><br/>With these two fantastic lead turns front and centre throughout and a raft of memorable supporting performances from the likes of the always great Jon Bernthal, the slick Josh Lucas and a scene stealing Tracey Letts as Henry Ford 2, Ford v Ferrari is the all-round package, a trial against the odds underdog story that is a film everyone should check out, not just those already in the know about this wonderful true life tale.<br/><br/>Final Say -<br/><br/>A winning delivery of a tried and true formula makes Ford v Ferrari a ride worth taking, further enhanced by some immaculate direction and some wondrously entertaining performances, James Mangolds racing epic is one of the year's most memorable big screen events.<br/><br/>4 ½ ruined bags of groceries out of 5"

","Le Mans '66<br/><br/>I saw this at the Cineworld secret screening and my heart sank having already condemned it from the trailer. I loath movies about racing cars and I hate Christian Bale with a vengeance. Well despite these ""minor"" prejudices this was a really great movie.<br/><br/>Centering on a biopic of Ken Miles life as a racing car driving, played by Bale, and his friend Carroll Shelby, played by Damon. These two central roles were delivered with passion and some very fine acting. I could be wrong but Christian Bale's diction was so much better in his native english rather than the mumbling guttural we are usually straining to unjumble.<br/><br/>The elongated driving sequences were exhausting and to long for me but I could see others around me lapping this up. The entire ensemble were brilliant and really created the atmosphere of the racetrack and the maverick sportsmen of the 60's.<br/><br/>With regard to awards my mind tells me that there are merely supporting actor nominations here because neither of the leads here displayed any comprehensive array of emotions and that discounts them. Ditto for best movie."

","Inspiring, fantastically acted, and wonderfully approached, Ford v Ferrari gives the true life story the fuel it needs to truly become the one of a kind racing tale it could be. Christian Bale is obviously the largest standout of the films high end cast, giving another brilliant performance. Matt Damon is maybe only second best in the film, but he does a great job asd well, and provides for a perfect match for Bale's take on the character and its personality. The film is wonderfully shot, with breathtaking views, and fueled with an often pulse of excitement that truly grabs your attention the way a movie should. The film does seem to start slow, but as with cars, as it goes on longer it begins to pick up speed, making for an exciting ride. The soundtrack is also a particular standout, with an original score that fits its material better than most films this year, and a sound in general that isn't too loud or obnoxious for a racing flick. In the end, Ford v Ferrari is not perfect, but it is a car film like no other and certainly earns a chance in this years Oscar race, as if it didn't have one already.
My Rating: 9.5/10"
"shaht-16429","9","4","8","16 November 2019"," I am not a car enthusiast but thoroughly enjoyed this
","Ford v Ferrari tells the story of the Ford Motor Company after being betrayed by Ferrari in an acquisition deal trying to design a car to compete in the 66' Le Mans race to beat Ferrari first and foremost. Henry Ford II (Letts) recruits Carol Shelby (Damon) and Ken Miles (Bale) to engineer and race a car respectively in order to finally become the first american manufactured car to win the race.<br/><br/>As someone who was initially unfamiliar with the story of the 66' Le Mans race; what the build up to it entailed and what happened afterwards I was consistently glued to the screen. In my mind the stakes were high and anything could happen. And this story does not sugarcoat any part of the details. It is an underdog story in the sense that Ford, a much smaller underdog car company that doesn't specialize in speed is going up against a juggernaut like Ferrari, a luxury car built to be expensive and flashy is truly a race. It also shows that there is much more to racing that just speed and design, the driver plays a crucial role. A well-established relationship between the car and driver is frugal because in this race they would have to spend upwards of 24 hours together, they have to know each other and what their limits are, otherwise there will be catastrophic consequences.<br/><br/>The acting performances are all fantastic, even if no one really has an Oscar worthy scene. Christian Bale does not quite reach his full potential but is still very transformative as a hot shot arrogant but talented driver. Matt Damon is also pretty good despite his accent not being that convincing. However the standout performance is Tracy Letts as Henry Ford II, who is determined to beat Ferrari at any costs, including getting into his very own car and trusting his very arrogant driver. His performance inside his own race car was both gripping and hilariously performed. The racing scenes were also very stellar, there is the typical drama that happens inside the pit, but seeing it transform from the pit to the track is really masterful build up, and what made the race scenes so engaging, as well as the directing by Mangold. If a race scene is able to craft so much motion sickness and tension by just showing a shot-reverse shot sequence, then this is a job done by a real racing enthusiast or a great director.<br/><br/>There were however a couple of scenes that didn't really work. For example, a couple of character drama scenes. I understand we have to show the life of Ken Miles, his wife and son who are still supportive of his dream. However this really isn't a character drama movie, it is a real life dramatization of events. There are scenes that are kind of meaningless is the larger retelling of the narrative. They might have happened in real life, but there was no real payoff to any of them. For example, Shelby is shown to have a bad heart and would never race again. This is set up and doesn't pay off at all. Many scenes might be telling a real life story, but don't really affect the narrative of Ford v Ferrari. A good fifteen minutes could have been trimmed and the movie would have stayed the same.<br/><br/>Ford v Ferrari tells an engaging story for car enthusiasts, it has enough racing to satisfy anyone who has a thirst for high speed action, who may also love stunt driving not extremely dumbed down. It can also spark an interest for people who aren't automotively challenged. It is not necessarily a masterpiece or even a Best Picture contender, but it a solid two and a half our watch. It is fast, it funny and it is thrilling most of the way."

","Director James Mangold known for many movies including Girl, Interrupted, Walk the Line, 3:10 to Yuma has directed the movie Ford v Ferrari based on American car designer Carroll Shelby ( excellent acting by Matt Damon) and driver Ken Miles (Christian Bale known for American psycho, The Fighter, Vice, the Big Short). Shelby knows Ken is an excellent driver and can easily compete and win a race. Ken is married to Mollie( actress Caitrona Balfe) and the couple have an adorable son Peter( Noah Jupe ..seen him in A Quiet place). Peter follows his dad to the races and autobody shop. Ken is a simple man. Tracy Letts as Henry Ford II has to decide if Ken can enter car race in Le Mans, France and represent Ford. Josh Lucas plays role of Leo Beebe , right hand man for Henry Ford II and does not like Ken's appearance and mannerisms. I particularly liked the scene when Shelby has to tell Ken that because of his image ,Ken cannot be Ford's race car driver. Matt Damon was terrific as Shelby who has money and power to make decisions in favor of Ken but has to get over hurdles created by Leo. I really enjoyed the scenes when Shelby talks to Ford about how folders had to change hands so many times before reaching Ford and impact of decision making involving too many people. Christian Bale as Ken Miles exudes enthusiasm and passion for race cars and abilities to handle speed. Miles is happy to run the race and not too concerned about winning. Jon Bernthal ( movies The wolf of wall street, The Accountant) did very well as Lee Iacocca who agrees with Shelby's faith in Ken's race car driving abilities. Good ensemble of talented actors. Oscar worthy acting by Matt Damon . 2 hrs 32 minutes of Cars, mechanics of fast cars and differences between Ford and Ferrari manufacturers was truly interesting and very well presented. Excellent Direction."

"afroman_2301","8","2","3","4 April 2020"," Le Mans '66 (2019) Review by Infectious Reviews
","'Le Mans '66' (Ford v Ferrari), directed by James Mangold (Walk the Line), is a feel-good family flick that looks at the true story of Ford's car designer Carroll Shelby, played by Matt Damon (The Martian) and his driver Ken Miles, played by Christian Bale (The Dark Knight) - where they go head to head with Ferrari in the 1966 'Le Mans' motorsport race.<br/><br/>My first impression of the film, after watching the trailer, was; ""this looks and feels like 'Rush'."" 2013's 'Rush', directed by Ron Howard, a film I enjoyed very much - felt comforting and easy-going - even though there is a literal turn for the worse, there's still a warmness to the narrative that feels very smart and cool (at all corners). I was imagining 'Le Mans '66' to be very similar to 'Rush', and thankfully it was - my expectations were met. It had all the same coolness, slick dialogue and fast story. What appealed to me during both films was their aesthetically pleasing setting. I found myself wanting to be in the South of France or Northern Italy, laying in the sun and drinking a beer. 'Le Mans '66' draws you into to its ambience so well and it actually makes you feel present. I have watched it twice now and could easily watch it again, especially when the weather is looking grey.<br/><br/>A few pointers - looking at the technical side of film, the pacing was good as it kept the story fun and engaging though the duration of the film could have been shorter. Some scenes were not particularly interesting or necessary. There was a lot of exposition during the first act which had me wishing for a more conversational dialogue. A lot of what happened could have been explained in a less amount of time. Even so, it wasn't something I cared much about - its production value and sixties appeal had me glued to the screen. However, it was sometimes hard to settle down because of Bale's, over-the-top, accentuated accent but again, as time progresses, it was not something that bothered me throughout. Having said this, I thought Shelby and Miles' on screen relationship was joyful and convincing. Their narrative was interesting and gave me a better understanding about a story I never knew existed. Sometimes biopics have a better way of delivering information - due to their motivating characterisations and re-imaging of crucial events. For example, the racing sequences have more emphasis than actuality, (don't hold me to this - I have never been to a race in my life). However, the brilliant 'Academy Award' wining sound, edited by Donald Sylvester (Logan) and the great use of camera work by cinematographer Phedon Papamichael (Nebraska) - puts you behind the wheel of the iconic 'Ford GT40'.<br/><br/>For someone that has a mild interest in cars and motorsport - I thoroughly enjoyed this film and would recommend it to anyone - especially if you have a fascination about exhaust pipes."
"ilawadehla","9","2","3","4 April 2020"," Here's what you need to know before you watch Speed King.
","What exactly did Enzo Ferrari's purple ink pen circle?
For Car Lovers, the most anticipated movie of 2019 is ""Ford V Ferrari."".Of course, ""Speed Car King"" as a commercial film, while restoring history, there are also deductive elements in it.<br/><br/>Why did Ford buy Ferrari?
Ford and Ferrari, in the 1960s, when cars were not highly globalized, were simply two car companies that could not compete.One is the American overlord who pushes automobile production into the modern process, the other is the Apennine overlord who is immersed in automobile racing.
The two are on different continents and are not competitors in the same field, and their situations are even more different.1960-1970 was the golden decade age of explosive growth for Ford and all American car companies.During that decade, the annual production of individual models under Ford's main brand increased from 300,000 units to nearly 800,000 units. For Ford, which is aimed at the general audience, they have enough capital to do some things in circles.
Ferrari in the 1960s was in dire Straits, facing a situation that could not be uncovered at any time.Racing is a very expensive sport, a team behind the big boss to inject capital, the racing department needs to rely on car companies to obtain funds.At that time, Ferrari was like a single ""Iron Han Han"", no matter when and when, sports cars were only owned by minority groups.By selling sports cars, or selling racing cars to independent teams to feed the entire R & D team to form a closed-loop, this road is becoming narrower and narrower by Ferrari.Until 1963, Enzo Ferrari sat at the same negotiating table as Henry Ford II.
In the case of Ford, their purpose was clear - to move into the European car market.At that time, Europe was an incremental market for American automobile companies, but there was a very embarrassing problem in front of them:At least in the field of automobiles, Americans have no sense of superiority in European land.<br/><br/>Why was the deal called off at the last second?
Ford wants to buy Ferrari, and Ferrari also needs to find a ""golden master dad"" as a backer. This seems to be a good deal for you. It should be smooth sailing. What exactly caused the transaction to crash?Of course, it is not because there is a ""mole."".
Ferrari's private secretary, Franco Gozzi, wrote in an Italian car magazine about Ford's acquisition of Ferrari.He referred to the clause that angered Ferrari the most and led him to walk out of the meeting - ""each item was over 450 million lire (about $257,000 at the time) of the team's budget.Enzuo had to apply to Ford for approval.""On the agreement, Enzuo circled the words ""submitted"" and ""acquired"" with his purple ink pen, and wrote ""not acceptable"" next to them.
Enzuo was an unruly man, and it is precisely because of his temper that he has created many popular stories in the history of automobiles.In his view, the rules and regulations given to him by Ford seriously affected his freedom of management of the team, which he had suffered for decades in the field.
According to the description of Ford Department manager Fei Lei, in the process of negotiations between the two sides for nearly a month, there are also other factors of discord.Enzuo, for example, has been critical of Shelby's relationship with Ford, and his bid to enter the Indy 500 has been thwarted by Ford."
"neilwaynesmith","10","2","3","26 March 2020"," Ignore the Americanised factual inaccuracies, this is still a bostin' racing film...
","The Shelby mythology is well fed with this film, but to be fair, Ol' Shel himself was always quick to praise Ken Miles, so it's nice to see film that recognises the input from a truly international band of racers & hot-rodders.<br/><br/>Matt Damon is great as Carroll Shelby, but then Damon is great almost always.... To the casual filmgoer, his wheelin'n'dealin' business style, his brashness and his confidence are well portrayed, but you can appreciate to his performance easier if you've seen interviews with Shelby himself.<br/><br/>Christian Bale & Catriona Balfe are brilliant as the Miles'. They deliver the accent & lingo brilliantly (I was born in the same town) and I loved Bale's inclusion of the Brummie phrase ""going round the Wrekin"", that shows real depth of research into the character, even if it is wasted on the vast majority of viewers... In a racing car, Bale really makes you believe that he's grabbing that Cobra / GT40 and wringing out Every Last Drop of performance (watch the DVD extra's to see how it was done, well worth it!) as well as fulfilling his role as development driver by constantly thinking of new ways to go fast. You get the sense that he was immersed in the jargon, not just reading it from a page... He Understands.<br/><br/>The crew went to extra-ordinary lengths to recreate the period venues, not, thankfully, all CGI for which this film is all the better. The sight of all of those Cobra's, GT40's etc is enough to have one going weak at the knees (as well as the achingly gorgeous Panhard on a trailer when 'Miles' first gets to Le Mans), even if it obvious that the Superformance etc. cars are the ones running bigger wheels and low-profile tyres. A nice touch, possibly as a nod to Ken Miles' Midlands background, is the Mini (Austin, not BMW) sitting outside his garage.<br/><br/>The Ford politicking is central to the theme and, for dramatic tension is exaggerated somewhat. You can imagine Henry Ford II acting in that imperious manner, but any film needs a true villain and Leo Beebe (quite harshly in many opinions) carries that particular torch through to the films end.<br/><br/>Just like Steve McQueen's Magnum Opus, 'Le Mans', the hero doesn't win through in the end, coming second. Like many sporting controversies, there is opinion, denial, conjecture & opposing sides about the manufactured finish.<br/><br/>Interestingly though, the film has the cars finishing in a perfect line abreast, whereas in real life, Bruce McLaren sped up slightly at the end also, unlike the film, Shelby was also instrumental, with Beebe, in orchestrating the 'dead heat' although once the French officials had wreaked their havoc, he always went on record as having bitterly regretted denying Miles the 66 'Triple Crown'.<br/><br/>It's a bittersweet epilogue where Miles is killed, I guess the films intention was to show how much of a racer he was and, even after getting shafted by Ford, was still intent on making their car faster & better...<br/><br/>In summary, ignore the historical stuff, you've got Wikipedia for that. Simply turn up the volume and enjoy the best motor racing film since 'Le Mans'. Only with more dialogue. And plot."

","The Ford Motor Company is said to be masters in taking up challenges. In its giant plant, Willow Plant with its one-mile-long assembling line, the company managed to produce B-24 Liberator bombers at the rate of one plane per hour. This was their contribution to the World War 2 efforts to liberate the American soil and their European cousins from tyranny. The company established a reputation for themselves as ""the arsenal of democracy"" by transforming their production lines to make aeroplanes, tanks and trucks for the armies that defeated Adolf Hitler. They were a pioneer of sorts as women worked in the assembly line and were paid equal wages with men. It, wittingly or unwittingly, to also become ""the arsenal of fascism."" for its substantial business deals in Nazi Germany. But that is another story for another time.<br/><br/>By the end of WW2, Henry Ford's grandson, Henry Ford II had taken over Ford Motors. He adopted an aggressive business style. When his bid to buy over Ferrari met a dead end, he went ballistic. He made his personal mission to show his dominance in the motor industry.<br/><br/>In the early sixties, Ferrari was overrunning the racing tracks. For six years, back to back, from 1960 to 1965, it won the Le Mans 24 hours endurance race.<br/><br/>Ford II, through his agents, went on a headhunt to recruit the best racers to beat Ferrari in Le Mans and show them who the boss was. That is where this film fits in. It narrates the story of two American racers - Ken Miles and Carroll Shelby- in a dramatic twist which saw Ford Motor Company finish the Le Man Race in a podium finish.<br/><br/>
This film is not just a run-of-mill offering that depicts the expected David vs Goliath scenario where David comes out tops despite all the disadvantages, and everybody is happy. It offers much more than that. The characters are rich. The chemistry between Miles, a war veteran British émigré who is a lowly mechanic because of his short fuse, and Shelby, a sports car salesman who himself was a race winner, is phenomenal.<br/><br/>What makes it more interesting is the controversy surrounding the final outcome of the race and the mystery surrounding Miles' crash during practice at the end of the film.<br/><br/>They say jealousy and greed are unfavourable traits. Clearly, this is not always the case. Many innovative inventions and groundbreaking feats have been achieved through our rapacious desire to dominate and tower over our fellow brothers."

"shimenpf","8","2","3","23 February 2020"," Ford Vs. Ford
","Fantastic movie. I know nothing about cars yet this film captured me and held me 'til the end. I found myself feeling the tension and adrenaline of the races. The characters are easy to root for, they feel authentic, real and, most of all, imperfect. The conflict comes mostly from the inside of Ford, which was very interesting to me. Ferrari is a secondary source of conflict, way behind the own suit men of Ford.<br/><br/>The only things I'd change are very small. Sometimes, we got intercuts from the adrenaline of the races to Miles' wife and son at home listening to the radio. This was frustrating to me. I wanted to see the races, where the action was, and I felt there were a little too many of these intercuts. Also, Miles' arc felt slightly unmotivated to me. I never understood what made him decide to actually accept and tie the race with the other two Ford cars. Even Carroll Shelby's petition wasn't a very intense one, as to make Miles change his whole personality for it.<br/><br/>All and all, this is a fantastic movie, with a great script and great performances, and it definitely is worth a watch."

","James Mangold directs this historic visit to the 1960s, using the script written by Jez and John-Henry Butterworth and Jason Keller, and the result is a heart-pounding series of fast car racing events that surface as an entertaining film due to the presence of some very fine actors. Not only is it a recreation of the 1966 Le Mans event: it is also a penetrating statement about corporate behavior attempting to drown individual personal achievement!<br/><br/>Briefly, American car designer Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) and driver Ken Miles (Christian Bale) battle corporate interference and the laws of physics to build a revolutionary race car for Ford in order to defeat Ferrari at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1966. The 'Ford' tent includes Henry Ford II (Tracy Letts), Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal), and Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas), and the Ferrari group is lead by Enzo Ferrari (Remo Girone). Significant roles include Ken's wife Mollie (Caitriona Balfe) and their son Peter Miles (Noah Jupe), as well as Shelby's right hand man Phil Remington (Ray McKinnon).<br/><br/>But towering over the entire epic are the acting chops of Mat Damon and Christian Bale, both of whom create fully three-dimensional roles that make the story come vividly to life. The film is overly long and at times self indulgent, but for fans of fast cars - and racing history - this film will more than satisfy."

","""Ford v Ferrari"" is a Biography - Action movie in which we watch how Ford motor company was entered the 24 Hours of Le Mans' endurance race in 1966 with Ford GT40 Mk I. We also watch the American car designer Carroll Shelby and driver Ken Miles battle corporate interference and the laws of physics to build this outstanding car for Ford in order to defeat Enzo Ferrari's fast Rosso-Corsa racing cars which were the dominants in the mid-1960s motorsport world.<br/><br/>I liked this movie very much because it is based on true events, it has many great scenes and much of suspense too. I enjoyed the direction which was made by James Mangold and he did a great job. The interpretations of Christian Bale who played as Ken Miles and Matt Damon who played as Carroll Shelby were simply outstanding . Some other great interpretations that have to be mentioned were Caitriona Balfe's who played as Mollie Miles (wife of Ken Miles), Noah Jupe who played as Peter Miles (son of Ken Miles) and Josh Lucas who played as Leo Beebe.<br/><br/>To sum up, I have to say that ""Ford v Ferrari"" is a great movie to watch with much of suspense, great interpretations and many good scenes that will leave you speechless.

","As someone who enjoys motorsports and LeMans racing in particular I was very eager to see this film. As far as historical accuracy, they just about nailed everything except for the Rolex 24 scene which is set in Daytona, Florida but was filmed at the LA area Auto Club Speedway. This makes sense and isn't a huge issue unless you are a racing fanatic such as myself. As for Ford V Ferrari, at times you really forget that Ferrari are the main antagonists. Ford V Shelby would be a more accurate albeit less marketable title. My issues with the film are that runtime is a little long and few scenes are somewhat cringy(Miles and his wife driving down the road and Miles and Shelby getting into a fight). Its Hollywood so you expect it but the movie could have done without both of those 2 scenes. Still as far as movies about motorsports and sports in general this sets the standard."

","SYNOPSIS:
The true story based on the Le Mans race in 1966 following former Le Mans winner Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) striving to make Ford a serious contender to Ferrari. However, problems arise when his driver Ken Miles (Christian Bale) may not have the image Ford wants.<br/><br/>REVIEW:
James Mangold does here what very few Directors can do and that's make me interested in something I have no interest in. Everything this film was screamed ""YOU WILL HATE THIS MOVIE, JOHN!"" I've never been one to care about cars, or racing and definitely not films focused on that, but wow this film was executed damn near perfectly. Mansgold creates an intriguing conflict and dialogue. To no surprise we also get superb acting from Matt Damon and Christian Bale. Then you have an amazing supporting cast with the likes of Noah Jupe, Jon Bernthal, Caitriona Balfe, Josh Lucas and Tracy Letts. Josh Lucas played the perfect ""douche bag who thinks he's too good for everyone and everything"" and has a very punchable face which made the ending to this film relatively bitter-sweet (if you've seen this film you know what I mean). I was so afraid of this film being what every film with cars is and that's ""turn left, then turn right, then turn left, reverse and do a 180, turn left again"" and I can't even begin to explain how much that irks me, but this film is beautifully paced and is edited so well that I was actually on the edge of my seat waiting to see what the outcome would be.<br/><br/>CONCLUSION:
What I tell everyone is that this is the ""Green Book"" of 2019. Obviously, very different subject matter, however, the very well made, emotional, warm, sad, happy and crowd pleasing type of film worthy of an Oscar nomination. So, regardless if you're a fan of cars or racing I recommend this to everyone. 8.7/10."

"eugenelevine","9","2","3","2 February 2020"," Thoughts about cast, crew and generally
","This was a very enjoyable film<br/><br/>It is a feel-good, underdog wins, suits win only the hollowest of battle victories, good guys when all the wars.<br/><br/>The driving scenes were great, and I don't care if the gear shifting was technically correct. There were a few memorably intense acting scenes: Tracy Lett's reaction to being driven in a great racing car by a great racing car driver. Christian Bale being driven in a station wagon by an absolutely ferocious wife (Caitriona Balfe) stick in my mind.<br/><br/>After watching this movie I wanted to see what else Caitriona Balfe has acted in - I've watched a few episodes of Outlander and have been really impressed by her ferocity on screen. Not merely noisy -- but oozing heartfelt intensity.<br/><br/>Oh - the cinematography, editing and sound were all world class.<br/><br/>As an afterthought--Christian Bale and Caitriona Balfe are two of the handsomest stars I've ever seen. This production discourages seeing them that way. Bale looks lean, hungry, and slightly weird in most scenes; Caitriona Balfe is not much past ordinary in appearance. The other racing movies this one is compared to are about beautiful people who occasionally need to change out of their racing duds so they can send them to the cleaners before dropping by the club for hors d'oeuvres and aperitifs.<br/><br/>The --uh, restrained--comparisons with Rush, LeMans and Grand Prix may be justified, but I fully enjoyed this movie. If you like cars, competition, various versions of excessive testosterone,--a number of interesting cultural interactions, I think you'll enjoy it too.<br/><br/>Not deep, not technically fulfilling, but clear and interesting story-telling, and cinematically beautiful movie-making all the way through."
"nagsaptarshi","9","2","3","2 February 2020"," Material success vs Excellence- Thumbs Up
","Being a hardcore fan of Christian Bale, I rarely miss any of his movies. But his portrayal of the legendary racer and racing car developer Ken 'Bulldog' Miles in 'Ford vs Ferrari' has simply swept me off my feet. This is a brilliant depiction of the early days rivalry between the car giants Ford and Ferrari where corporate egos of Henry Ford II and Enzo Ferrari changed the complexion of the motorcar racing in the days to come. Amidst such hard hitting and nail biting corporate egos, what stand tall are the personal ethos, values and camaraderie of the great racers Caroll Shelby and Ken Miles and their everlasting bonding and love and trust for each other and how the machines they rode redefined the very word 'Excellence' and showed the world that greatness originates from not coming first in a race or grabbing a trophy, but from sheer passion for excellence and value addition to life. Bale as the maverick Miles or Matt Damon as his trustworthy friend and mentor Caroll Shelby deliver one of the finest performances of their illustrious careers. Its so good to get back the great Matt Damon in his pristine form after a prolonged hiatus. His restrained emotions and Bale's over the top passion are the two unmatched gems of this brilliant treasure trove. If you want to be entertained for 140 minutes without a single moment of boredom or experience adrenaline rush throughout, 'Ford vs Ferrari' is a must watch for you. One of the finest works on real life motivation, I would strongly recommend this biopic to everyone who think beyond the parochial feelings of rat race or monetary success. Certainly it is going to bag many awards in the coming months. One of the finest Hollywood movies in the past decade. Miss it at your own risk.

The exhilarating true story behind the 1966 24 hour Le Mans race serves as a story for the crossing paths between Carol Shelby (Matt Damon) and the eccentric British driver, Ken Miles (Christian Bale) and how they come together to take down Enzo Ferrari and show ford off as a top contender.<br/><br/>Director James Mangold takes on the American story that rewrote racing history displaying some of the most exciting scenes we have seen this year in 2019. From the drivers POV to the spectators POV, we are taking a journey with all who witnessed this great victory and the events that lead up to it.<br/><br/>As failing Henry Ford II seeks out an idea to save his late fathers company, he takes initiative to challenge Ferrari in a race of perfection by hiring Carol Shelby, designer extraordinaire of Shelby American. The issue for Shelby is that he can design cars , but he knows the best driver is Ken Miles, Who seems arrogant to him at first. Ken Miles is a car guru who spends his days either fixing cars or racing them. Putting aside there differences, we are found with the dynamic duo who creates the perfect ford GT to shake up the reign Ferrari has claimed for years.<br/><br/>Put two all star actors together and you'll witness the closest thing we can get to time traveling following the bond between miles and Shelby. Matt Damon seals the deal on being a confident determined Shelby while Christian Bale displays another change physically along with his arsenal of character traits that help him depict roles perfectly. Up close and personal cinematic shots kept viewers eyes glued to the screen as we were passengers to Ken Miles amazing race. With this, and a strong supporting cast, and a great musical score to evoke emotion, Ford vs Ferrari scores an 8.5/10. There is a such thing as a perfect lap."

Nice balance of comedy and drama. I don't fully understand the character development of some of the protagonists. The side cast (wife, petty vice president) feels kinda clichÃ©; I like the interaction, even though they don't provide enough conflict. The main antagonist, Ferrari, has some nice shots but they're not a real threat because we're too immersed into the main character's personal struggle for perfection.
That finale, that missing victory, gives a lot of weight to the whole final act and to the good relationships between Miles and Shelby. But if we look at being and end point, it really says much. I'm a bit disappointed yet happy about the overall movie."

That being said, Matt Damon and Christian Bale made the perfect combination, they managed to portray their characters to perfection, they had great chemistry and I hope I get to see them working together again in the future. Once again Bale steals the show, what an actor.
1000% recommended watch. Even if you knew the story or not, this film will give you that thrill. Incredible, very well deserved Oscar nominations!"

","Yes, I could mention the fanatical leave-nothing-to-chance, try-anything-first, do-anything, gear-headed, rugged doggedness, that only sheer will and deep intestinal fortitude that Christian Bale's Ken Miles displayed in his skill and commitment who gave audiences a lesson on how to handle his car to get it done. Or, I could discuss that character appropriation we can always expect from Phenom actor Matt Damon's portrayal of Carroll Shelby that he so graciously offered fans which ascended everything that was steered only by the great Jon Bernthal's Lee Iacocca interpretation as the boundless pit crew lead; they all literally appeared to actually be haunted by these portrayals throughout the story. This come-from-behind tale gave viewers a true appreciation of the infamous competitive history of two top-tiered car manufacturer icons Ford and Ferrari's chronological past... but to me, to me...the love story between Ken and Mollie Miles played by Christian Bale and Caitriona Balfe shined bright like a diamond amidst all of the steel, rubber and tire dust. The unspoken communication they shared, the connection that they had, the space they entrusted and gifted one another to express their individual emotions, ambitions and needs is what real love looks like. Great Job!"

","The GOOD: The cast is phenomenal. Matt Damon is perfect as a chicken farmer from Texas. Christian Bale plays a short tempered British person almost to perfectly. Josh Lucas portal of a ford executive with a determination to ruin the GT is just frustrating enough to be convicting. Jon Bernthal finally gets to play a likeable character who has a job to do at first, then just becomes part of the solution.<br/><br/>The writting is also beautiful in more ways than one. You need to pay attention to the little things, as they tend to come back up later on. Its also poetic in nature, from one scene to another. Thing's that are said, and things that happen have a deeper meaning and you have to be ready with a box of tissues. This shouldn't be considered a spoiler: when Henry Ford II is talking to Shelby about going to war should go down as one of the greatest moments in film history. That conversation represents both characters and the true life story of Ford Vs. Ferrari perfictly!<br/><br/>Not to mention the love story between Ken and his wife feels real. No relationship is perfect; she doesn't want him to quit and shes not going to stand back and watch him throw his life away. The other side of that situation, he wants to be a race car driver, but he needs to put food on the table. I can reallynfeel the love between these characters, and I feel for them.<br/><br/>Set design, props, and costumes were so on point for each character, location and clothing that when the movie was over I felt like a time traveler. This film just did such a great job of pulling you into its world. Not to mention the cars!!! I love how Shelby drove a AC Cobra throughout the movie and Ken trashed the Mustang. Again, this movie does a great job of just keeping you drawn to the plot so well.<br/><br/>The BAD: I felt like it ran long in some places. Especially towards the end. This movie could of, and should of ended after the race. You already ended the movie with captions, why not add a few more. On the topic of the captions; they're to fast. Im not a spead reader, leave them on the acreen fornat least 5 seconds.<br/><br/>
This is fsr and away my favorite movie of 2019! I was hooked from beginning to end. I would even love to see another racing movie based on Lancia's really history."

The wrench part only makes sense if you've seen the movie, although I wouldn't classify this as a spoiler.<br/><br/>It's based on a true story, but there probably isn't any more history to back this up than there was for the Star Wars movies, but we get it.

"JohnRayPeterson","8","2","3","1 January 2020"," For racing fans, motorheads and history buffs. Movie making as it should be.
","F you didn't know who Carroll Shelby was, you don't know about car racing or about automotive performance, period. I didn't know who Kenneth Henry Miles (Ken Miles) was before this movie, so that makes me almost as poor and would-be connoisseur as you, almost. Anyway, this movie is for us racing enthusiasts and also for those who enjoy a good movie, in that the performances of the actors, the script, the direction and technical aspects mesh so well that you get immersed in the story, fictional or not; this movie was not fictional, but almost mythical if you revere the sport of car racing. It still is an awesome movie if you're not a sports car buff, because it shines in depicting human personality and character.<br/><br/>The days when grand prix racing and endurance racing was as much about the iconic drivers as it was about the machines, and both made newspaper headlines, those days have changed. Rarely do either make headlines anymore, other than in specialty magazines. I can't say things have changed that much since the 60's with respect to the drivers but they sure were more demanding on them in that time in history than they are today; thanks to people like Jackie Stewart, the sport is driver safety aware where it was all about the speed and winning years ago.<br/><br/>That emotional drive to win was consuming for the rare few who were at the top of their game and that is what transpired for me in this movie. You'll see two men, Shelby and Miles, played respectively by Matt Damon and Christian Bale, who became best friends because they shared one thing that set both of them apart from others, even though their personalities were different, they were true professionals and the best. Movies are not made about people who aren't exceptional and this movie proves that point as much as it shows exceptional people are also very ordinary and like you and me in all other manners except for that thing which makes them exceptional.<br/><br/>A good movie should take you on an emotional ride, pun very much intended, and this one will do that. As movie reviews go, there are also best ones, and for that sort of review of 'Ford v Ferrari' check out Movie Reviews from the Dark by IMDb's own ferguson-6."

Reviewers giving this low marks obviously missed the point of the movie or more so they didn't understand that this movie was telling the story of shelby & miles, the Ford vs ferrari story is just the background story, a story that is firmly cemented in the annals of history.

"steven-leibson","8","2","3","16 December 2019"," An amazing recreation of mid-century motor racing
","If you know car history, then the ending of this docudrama movie is never in doubt. Damon and Bales deliver excellent performances, but this is a car movie and the cars are the stars. For viewers of a certain age, seeing Shelby Cobras, Ford GTs, Ferraris, Corvette Stingrays, and other iconic racing cars (or their computerized recreations) from the 1960s chew up the tracks feels like putting on old, comfortable shoes. The cinematography and what has to be a ton of CGI (verified in the credits) plus the pounding, distorted, absolutely perfect guitar music really make this movie for me. I remember seeing the movie ""Gran Prix"" in the 1960s. It set the bar for car-racing movies. This movie attains the same level of gritty realism. The theme song for this movie is a gritty, instrumental version of ""Poke Salad Annie"" and it too is perfect for the movie."

This film is no exception. The way he and Christian Bale play off against each other is remarkable to watch. You don't have to be a car fan to like this movie but if you can imagine yourself sitting in the seat of these exceptional machines you will ride every curve and straightway of this movie. It is fun. It is well performed. It is well written. It is great personal drama. I give this movie an 8 (great) out of 10. {True Life Drama}"
"nirajju","8","2","3","8 December 2019"," A historic story told with pace & panache
","Cristian Bale puts his method acting to perfection, getting inside the character of the talented race driver Miles. While Matt puts in a sophisticated performance as a racer-turned-businessman, it is Bale who rules the little-longer-than-needed film time. The characters have been drawn out beautifully in the early part of the movie & the crux of the Ford vs Ferrari rivalry hits the peak during the climax. A special mention goes out to the child actor who portrays Miles' kid for betraying the innocence & excitement of the racing phenomena which swept the early 60s. If you enjoyed Ron Howard's Rush for the personal rivalry of James Hunt vs Nicki Lauda, you should definitely watch out as the giants Automobiles lock horns through the amazing driving skills of its racers. Go for the film in IMAX or 4DX wherever possible, and you would find the time just zip past you."

","It's not a race movie. The racing part, is to give context to the relationship. If you know anything about Carol Shelby you would understand that relationship was everything to him.
I read somewhere here someone complain about the fact that it was "" Utterly predictable"" Ha ha ha. Yes, it is based on a true story. ;)
Were there a few rehashed pedal and stick shift scenes? Yes. Where the race scenes exaggerated with ""Gas pedal"" room to overpass other cars? yes. But overall, it's a movie. The amount of people in real life that actually put the pedal to the floor is a small percentage. If you have never put you car on a race track,,, there is always ""gas pedal"" room to pass other. It just makes it more ""actionny"" for humans that don't race."

The movie just nailed it. There's some kind of seasoning that the actors' performances and the movie itself added which makes every scene enjoyable, rather than a dull plus boring one.<br/><br/>The performances of Bale and Damon, I don't have to say much. Their qualities are above all, especially Bale who had always played his role leaving a unique impression on the audience. This movie was another example of his fine work.<br/><br/>So, whether you're a racing fan or not, Ford v Ferrari will always be an enjoyable offer even for the muggles. 9/10 for a masterpiece!"

Damon and Bale portrayed their characters extremely convincing and kept me engaged until the end, strongly cheering for the maverick underdogs fighting competition and corporate pressure.<br/><br/>This was based on a true story and in the end, pushing yourself to the extreme is the only way to find out who are you and what you are made of on your path to greatness."

","Indeed a watch worth the wait. Nail-biting drama and an out-and-out edge-of-the-seat experience one could possibly want in a Christian Bale and Matt Damon starrer. And the sound effects!!!! Gosh!!! Truly exhilarating and fascinating work of art displayed by the sound design team. Perhaps watching it in IMAX just added to the experience tenfold. Bale was as stupendous as could be; possibly one of the best we've seen him in in quiet a while. Damon was no less astounding in his own right.
It won't be wrong to say that one of its greatest technical achievements lies in the fact that you don't necessarily have to be a ""car-guy"" to be able to commend this marvel. Another commendable fact was that despite being based on a true story, it had us giving a slight feeling of unpredictability at points, which was, in fact, a sight to behold. Also, in spite of being a tad bit long, it never even seemed to lose grip of the plot.The monstrous sound of the roaring engines could be felt throughout the entirety of the theatre, so even if a ""non-car-guy"" feels bored, these blaring sounds won't let him sleep. The final act was a bit of a let-down which was not what I expected to be the outcome.
All-in-all a feature rife with intensity, emotions, breakdowns (technical and emotional) and an over-the-top sound design which suffices for an individual to enable him to say that he is a member of such a cinephilic community that prides itself on being able to witness such level of filmmaking. Long live cinema!!!"
"tocsa120ls","9","2","3","1 December 2019"," How many RPMs was it again?
","Okay, get this out of the way first: 7000 revolutions per minute - the limit of the Ford 427 engine... or better, the limit of the valvetrain. A stock(ish) 427 will start to float its valves above 7k and lose power. This was it... it's not a hard limit, a few years later these FE motors were turning 8-8500rpms, but the screenwriter for some odd reason focused on this minutiae. Everything else is perfect; although we know what happened in '66, everyone in the theater was sitting on the edge of their seats. The sounds were great, the straight-cut gears in the gearbox whining louder and higher as the car accelerates, with the staccato of an almost-no-exhaust V8, all piped through THX speakers is close to a religious experience, especially as very few of us got to hear this monster live.
Acting is on point, finally a movie where Christian Bale doesn't have to fake an American accent, Matt Damon pulls off a seemingly effortless Carrol Shelby - no doubt weeks and weeks of acting work and watching Shelby interviews went into it, but the whole movie just feels like one of those special ones, where the actors just enjoyed themselves."

","There comes a moment in one's (professional) life when one's own passion, drive, skill, and one's immediate team and opportunity - all line-up. Few of us are able to embrace that chance to become the best versions of ourselves and set benchmarks for generations to follow. This movie celebrates that spirit of pursuit of perfection at one's craft both individually and as a team.<br/><br/>Caroll Shelby & Phil Remington built and Ken Miles raced the Ford Shelby GT 40 which defeated the most brilliantly engineered cars at the time - The Ferrari in the most demanding and enduring race in the world - 24 hours of LeMans in 1966 and it went on to win for 4 consecutive years. And to date, it remains the only American car to do so.<br/><br/>Yes, the movie has all the adrenaline pumping, engine revving, nail-biting action that we expect from a race car movie. But it goes much beyond that by bringing out the amazing comradery and personal journeys of Caroll Shelby and Ken Miles. It shows how a small team of committed and talented people who set themselves an impossible target can actually make God (Ferrari) bleed by sheer will power, raw talent, and good old hard work. It also beautifully shows how family believes in you when others give up.<br/><br/>Christian Bale and Matt Damon are impeccable.<br/><br/>Visuals are awesome, all real cars, real drivers, shot from the perspective of the driver - Behind the wheel and on the track. Above all, the perfect harmony of man and machine with endurance is on display here."
"oasomera","9","2","3","22 November 2019"," Best movie out there and probably a true classic
","I was looking forward to a new movie about racing cars and especially one about doing Le Mans because there's a lot I'd like to know about that race in particular. This excellent movie is less about the ins and outs of particular races than about two of the men behind one actual attempt to give America a presence in the toughest race of all. It's a wonderfully American story though one of the men is an expatriate Brit, Ken Miles, played by Christian Bale like he was born to play this role. The part is the true center of the film despite Matt Damon's strong performance and that of numerous supporting players. I will truly be surprised if this movie doesn't sweep all the award shows."
"quasarsq","9","2","3","19 November 2019"," Perfect !!!
","I watched the movie after knowing that James Mangold had directed it. It is one of those movies where after watching it you don't really feel that it was an 2.5 hr movie.It is difficult to compare it with ""Rush"" as the premise is different. Even though the title suggests "" Ford v Ferrari "" but at the core it is really more about Shelby --Miles v Ford Executives.
The movie is able to capture the relation b/n Miles and Shelby as they build a car to race @ Le Mans . As you get to know what Le Mans is you realize the pace of the movie and at the end why is it that you really liked it.The movie is set with mild to Intense racing scenes which can be said as one of the trait of the movie as it doesn't let you on the edge of the seat but rather lets you enjoy sitting back. As to acting with Christian Bale, Matt Damon, Jon Bernthal and other brilliant supporting cast it is what you expect. Even though the screen time is less between Bale and Balfe (Wife ) you will love it.
At the end you will feel satisfied when you come out of the Hall and wish no more with the end and lingering feeling which will stay with you for some time."

","My Review - Ford V Ferrari
Mr rating. 8.5 /10<br/><br/>I don't have the slightest interest in car racing or cars but this story and its characters held my interest for 152 minutes and that in my opinion is the test of good directing by James Mangold ( Walk the Line ,Wolverine Logan) and a great ensemble cast of actors.<br/><br/>Ford V Ferrari is based on a true story like nearly every movie these days and centres around the two main characters Matt Damon as Carroll Shelby and Christian Bale as racing car driver Ken Miles<br/><br/>The bones of the story you can view in the trailer but the flesh and blood is in the great script by Jason Keller and brothers Jez and John-Henry Butterworth who were named recipients of the Writers Guild of America West's 2011 Paul Selvin Award for their screenplay for the film Fair Game (2010), directed by Doug Liman and starring Naomi Watts and Sean Penn.<br/><br/>The story is basically described in IMBD as American car designer Carroll Shelby and driver Ken Miles battle corporate interference, the laws of physics and their own personal demons to build a revolutionary race car for Ford and challenge Ferrari at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1966.<br/><br/>For me it was the characters that got me in not the great action car racing scenes
Matt Damon as usual gives a great performance but it's Christian Bale that steals the film he's a great dad and husband and very funny at times but doesn't suffer fools graciously and has attitude plus to anyone who tries to come between him and his passion of racing. I wouldn't be at all surprised if Christian Bale is nominated for an Oscar next year for this role of course he'll lose it to Joaquin Phoenix for Joker.<br/><br/>Matt Damon is his friend and champion when the self interested Ford Corporate bosses try to edge Ken Miles out as their driver as in their eyes he's not a ""Ford Man.""
Henry Ford 11 played so well by Tracy Letts is a pig and runs his Ford Empire with fear that includes one scene in which he shuts of the machines and threatens his workers . Josh Lucas as Leo Beebe Fords Director of Special vehicles and the executive nemesis of Carroll Shelby and Ken Miles is also great in this perfectly balance ensemble cast of actors .<br/><br/>Ken Miles wife Mollie played by Catriona Balfe gets a special mention as does Noah Jupe as Miles son Peter they are both so convincing and it reinforces my empathy with families of racing car drivers and all daredevil pursuits that they can never be sure if their loved one will come home after a race.<br/><br/>I thoroughly recommend seeing Ford V Ferrari it's one of the best movies of the year."

","With it's fast pace and long runtime, this movie doesn't waste your time. It tells a beautiful story of two men achieving what was thought impossible at the time, and about the people who helped them make it happen.<br/><br/>It was a lot of fun, better than I expected, and emotional. There were some scenes that almost made me cry because the movie made me so invested into the characters. Christian and Matt have so much chemistry it's insane.<br/><br/>My only flaw is that they portray Ferrari too negatively at times, but the story needs an antagonist.

Being a dihard car guy, I believe I noticed a slight flaw in one scene, which is the only reason I didn't give it a 10 out of 10 rating. During an early race scene (1963?) it showed several Corvettes competing, however one of them had a 1967 stinger hood.

","""Sometimes words...they are just not useful.

This was totally an engineer's wet dream, but you don't really need to be a keen follower of motor sports to understand the movie. Rather, you will be compelled to research on it after you make the exit.<br/><br/>Most people will be deterred from watching it, just by looking at the runtime, but trust me, it's totally worth it. Everyone is in such fine form that it makes the watch a really pleasant one. Matt Damon as the iconic Carroll Shelby hits it out of the park. The lady playing Ken Miles' wife was fantastic and that scene where she has a bout of hysteria in a speeding car was definitely my favourite.<br/><br/>Go for this one. It's really a spectacle."
"AudioFileZ","9","2","3","17 November 2019"," Humanity, Machinery, & Filmmaking Collide Gloriously...A Must See
","How is the destiny of mankind interwoven with the machines we create? Quite powerfully in myriad ways I think we'd all agree. That intersection of man and machine becomes singularly pure in the realm of automobile racing.<br/><br/>One of the great true stories is that of Ferrari's snubbing of Henry Ford II's attempt to buy into racing via purchasing Enzo Ferrari's company. Taking the insult personal Henry Ford became a man obsessed with winning LeMans and de-throning Ferrari.<br/><br/>Ford winning LeMans, It's a mission no one at the time thought was possible and it rested upon much more than money, engineering, and sheet metal. Two men played pivotal roles not only having an impossible goal to chase, but fighting a corporate culture with zero understanding of how to get out of the way and let them do it.<br/><br/>These two men persevered under the corporate interference which often hurt as much as bank-rolled their mission. That two-man juggernaut core was Carol Shelby and Ken Miles. Two very different personalities who often clashed yet had a mutual respect for one another much like brothers of different mothers. While the quest to beat Ferrari and win LeMans provides the back drop for the saga, it is the two men, their relationship, and their success which defines the achievement. Ford v Ferrari as a racing movie is great, but it's these two characters that give it the blood of humanity. Matt Damon as Carol Shelby and Christian Bale as Ken Miles are utterly fantastic in bringing these two to life on screen. Especially Bale as Miles, he literally assumes what you'd imagine the real man was like in a kind of ""beyond acting"" if you will. Engrossing.<br/><br/>Speaking of engrossing. The cinematography and realism of racing reaches new levels here. In both sight and sound. Framing of shots, colors that jump, and a stealthy soundtrack that provides great atmosphere while never overtaking shows tremendous craft in filmmaking. The film pulls one in as if there was a personal stake involved. That, again, is the human factor. One which surmounts great odds while taking life chances in order to conquer and succeed. I find little fault with this film and think it will be enjoyed by masses who have little or no interest in racing. Quite simply one enjoyable film whose long length is neither tedious or superfluous. I highly recommend seeing Ford v Ferrari. The fact it adheres closely to the true events make it even more remarkable."
"sophaljonesy","9","2","3","17 November 2019"," Excellent acting, exhilarating race scenes, relatable situations are what makes this movie absolutely ebtertaining
","I knew something great was going to come out from the pairing of Christian Bale and Matt Damon in Ford V Ferrarri and I was not disappointed at all. It had what I expected: interesting characters, great acting, thrilling car races. What I did not expect was corporate culture, which had Jon Bernthal play Lee Iaccocca. This added element made the movie even more interesting because you know the protagonists are already fighting an impossible task of beating Ferrarri while having to battle corporate interference. It is the battle between doers and the suits. Bale is one of the rare actors who transforms in every role he is and you immediately forget he was once Batman driving an insane Batmobile. The same goes for Damon and Bernthal. You completely forget Damon used to be Jason Bourne and Bernthal the Punisher. The funniest part is Bale's brawl with Damon as shown in the trailer. I like how Ferrarri is not vilified in the movie, since I am a Ferrarri fan. But on the other hand I truly root for Bale's Ken Miles and Damon's Carroll Shelby to win. This is a movie about two guys struggling to do the impossible while battling outside interference from non experts. This situation is very relatable. The race scenes are exhilarating. The soundtrack blends with the action resulting in a pulsepounding thrill ride. I am even more amazed that this is a true story, but am sure that without the capable directing by James Mangold, and the excellent performances brought by Christian Bale and Matt Damon, this movie would definitely fail."

I'm not a big fan of Matt Damon and he would not have been my first choice for Shelby, but after viewing the film I cannot say that he wasn't the right choice. The acting was spot on and the story was well told. Likely my favorite racing movie of all time. Entertaining and moving"
"Nobody-27","9","2","3","16 November 2019"," Excellent in every way, and a treat for racing aficionados
","I went to see this film thinking that having Matt Damon and Christian Bale is sure not to disappoint - and I am glad to say I was right. I also wanted to see the legendary story of Ford vs Ferrari, as it happened, on the big screen and got more than I hoped for.
The drama, characters, excellent music, and everything else that makes for a great film can be found here. I loved boh the performances of ALL actors as well as the life-like race cars and how they are driven and how they behave in different situations. If you are not a racing fan, there will be plenty to enjoy, but knowing a thing or two about cars, gearboxes and RPMs helps.
The only thing that I didn't care for were few minor historically innacurrate details, which were added for entertainment value, I imagine. One, here or there, I could live with, but when they are piled up, and don't help the story, they should be left out.
Other than those minor complaints, which is why I give it 9 instead of 10 stars, the film is as close to perfect as one can get."

Seriously, the casts did an awesome job. The vibes of '66, with soundtracks, costumes, artifact, editing everything was so perfect. The ongoing politics inside the Ford was truly cumbersome but beyond everything, it's a masterpiece movie to me."
"cherold","5","1","1","5 May 2020"," Bale is great but the movie is tedious
","I read a review of this film in the New Yorker that said the title was unfortunate because it would make people think it was a sports film when it was more than that. The reviewer was wrong. This is a sports movie, with all the sports movie tropes, and it's all been done better.<br/><br/>The film follows car designers Carrol Shelby and race car driver Ken Miles as they work to help Ford create a car that can beat Ferrari's in a big race. This in itself is odd, in that the movie wants you to see the guys working for a corporate behemoth as scrappy underdogs, which is a bit of a stretch.<br/><br/>This is very much a boy movie, by which I mean it's entirely focused on testosterone-fueled competition ranging from international pissing contests to corporate competition to fist fights on the lawn. You could easily call this movie ""Mine is Bigger."" And much of my problem with the movie was I didn't care whose was bigger.<br/><br/>The best thing in the movie is Bale as Miles. Instead of the typical cocky race driver of other films, Miles comes across as grease-monkey engineer who not only engineers the car but also plans and engineers his entire race. It's a smart, amiable performance that should be in a better movie.<br/><br/>I am perplexed that this movie was nominated for an Oscar against genuinely significant movies like Parasite and Jojo Rabbit. The best I can say of it is that it is less undeserving of the nomination than Joker. I'm also puzzled by all the gushing reviews.<br/><br/>There are some good moments, particularly in the racing scenes, but the film is hugely overlong and everything past the end of the race feels like a needless and maudlin dragging out of something that should have been a zippy 90-minute film.<br/><br/>Not recommended."
"JeffOA","6","1","1","20 April 2020"," Dumbed-down but fun
","Le Mans '66 is a fun movie despite having an overly dramatized plot. In a way this is your usual Hollywood action/drama flick with little to no regard to respecting how events originally occurred. Lifting inspiration from incidents happening around its main people - Miles and Shelby - and integrating them into their story making it more thrilling but also less believable. Ken Miles' life had enough for a whole movie but they rather incorporated made-up drama than telling about his war experience or perhaps showing that the other drivers are not just there as simple antagonists. The handling of the 'Ferrari deal' is also laughable, distorting history for the sake of extra drama. I am the first to point out that Le Mans - the '71 movie - was a kind of special something, going to the extreme with its focus on motorsport while FvF went to the other extreme where human drama is the most important and the writers did not hesitate to alter facts and sacrifice character integrity in order to serve a thrilling story. In my book this is an inferior attempt at a historic biography/racing film."

","Undoubtedly one of the best film of 2019 Ford v Ferrari is a sports drama based on true story as stated in premise. The film showcases the perfect blend of thrill whether it's the race track or the corporate clashes. Racing scenes are all that one can anticipate but the sound and performance by Christian Bale makes those parts of the story very much likable. On the other side the part which I personally liked was the Corporate side of the story that how it all started with simple negotiation with Ferrari ended in humiliation and how it motivates Ford to built its own fastest sports car and in that journey how men in Suits exploits their power with their nonsensible ideas to please their Bosses at the cost of compromising the sheer talent and their due credit. Matt Demon Aced his role as balancing the Corporate and field business and has given proper support as an empathetic friend to Bale to which I say both actually complimented each others role which helped them to pull off the emotional drama which makes this movie an entertaining yet emotional sports drama"
"ibnalmauser","9","1","1","17 April 2020"," Wonderful, moving portrayal of a true story
","I'll be honest, I'm rarely emotional watching movies. Somehow this proved to be an excellent, worthwhile exception. You can almost smell the gasoline and burning tire in the race sequences. Matt Damon and Bale outdo themselves bringing the characters to life. The cinematography is marvellous, and low cameras, zoomed in faces and out of focus long shots bring depth and perspective to scenes.<br/><br/>A visual tour de force well worth enjoying."

This film could easily have fallen into mediocrity, however it just so well made. For the entire film, there barely seems a scene or a word out of place. On top of this, it looks amazing. I can't recall a film that, while not dealing with typically spectacular visuals, just looked so good.<br/><br/>The acting is outstanding, especially Christian Bale, who gives I think his best performance, in a fantastically nuanced job.

"gibfenning","Null","1","1","6 April 2020"," Another Movie That Got Ripped OFF at The AA
","When I was in design school, my professors always reminded me that it was much easier to do a campaign for a condom company than a fence-building company. Thanks Susan. That is true. F V F is a fence company - a movie about cars and racing cars. But, this is a great, well made, creative masterpiece. It never gets corny or starchy. Granted - some of the periphery characters are caricatures, but, the main characters on which we focus feel real and not put on.
In contrast to some of the Oscar pics that seem more like rewards for towing the line rather than artistic achievements, it's good to have a movie that you can watch from start to end w/o questioning what you're watching and still get completely caught-up in it. I loved JoJo Rabbit almost as much (that took a lot from Wes Anderson - a favorite), but a good straight-forward, well written, un-cringy movie like F v F should still be an AA favorite."
"dim_zax","7","1","1","18 February 2020"," Solid, enjoyable film
","Let's get the negatives quickly out of the way. There are a lot of historical inaccuracies in this one and some play major parts in the story. But it is quite impossible to cram 5 or more years of reality, into 150 minutes of film. So, it is a pass for me.<br/><br/>What i really didn't like though, was the racing/action scenes. There wasn't any sense of speed in them. Instead there was a lot of camera trembling, sped-up shots and cgi. That was a real let down in a film that has a car as one of the main protagonists.<br/><br/>On the other hand the actors were all brilliant. From the main man (Damon), to the bad guy (Lucas), to the daredevil (Bale) everyone added significant parts to plot and character development.<br/><br/>The plot was going to be good because the real story had all the ingredients for a Hollywood movie. Danger, emotion and underdog status, along with the sad story of a man capable of greatness, but always on the out of the corporate new world.<br/><br/>And last but not least, the cars were simply fantastic. The Cobras, Mustangs and GT40s from Ford, alongside the main opposition in the Ferrari 330 P3. Majestic!

","Ford v Ferrari is nearly exactly what you expect it to be. In this case, that is not a bad thing. The performances are solid, the action is exciting, the stakes are high, and there is just enough background intrigue to create a meaningful central conflict. It's a crowd pleaser and a thrill ride, with appeal for just about anyone. The film never strives to be overtly political, nor does it push a strong social agenda. No, this is a movie about cars and the people who make and race them, and this is a story about American exceptionalism, akin to the space race or the miracle on ice; the difference being, the stakes are contained: Can Ford build a car that can take on Ferarri at Le Mans? And who is going to drive that beast? It's an America vs Italy story; a story of ""creatives"" - doers - the racers, the mechanics, the visionaries - vs business interests - cautious, profit and image focused. Who will win in the end?"

It looks and sounds fantastic and the two lead performances from Damon and Bale are great .
I loved the side show battle with the suits at Ford .

In America it's called Ford Vs Ferrari and in the rest of the world it's called Le Mans ' 66 .

Also i realized there are many good actors in this like Mat Damon, Christian Bale and more and that made me want to see it more, plus it was something different for a change and also its based on a true story which is OK in my book. Well now after watching it i realized that it was pretty long considering it was 2 and a half hours which is pretty long but in the end it was OK. So after seeing it i actually liked it, and a few hours later it started to grow on me and i liked it even more. At the beginning it starts off pretty confusing and i lot to take in and i lot to keep track of but at the last 30-45 minutes it gets real good and thats what makes me like it the most.

","Ford v Ferrari (5 out of 5 stars).<br/><br/>Ford v Ferrari is an awesome sports drama film that delivered on the racing scenes that puts you right in the drivers wheel. And leaves you right on the edge. James Mangold's direction did it great with its exciting racing sequences which is loud, thrilling, and intense. The drama and story building with Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) and Ken Miles (Christian Bale) are also great and gripping with its story. The script, direction, and performances are outstanding.<br/><br/>The plot follows when Henry Ford (Tracy Letts) wants to try to make the fastest car for the 24 hours of Le Mans race in France. He has Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) try to help and rebuild a Ford GT40 and has a race car driver Ken (Christian Bale) try to test the cars and compete in the 24 hour race. Racing against Lorenzo who is racing for Ferrari.<br/><br/>It is a long movie of 2 hours and 30 so minutes. But it goes by fast with its gripping and sharp script. The characters are great. Carroll designs cars and is unable to race from his heart condition. While Ken is a struggling mechanic, trying to support his family. He brings his son around when he is building sports cars. Ken also hates when the executives and bosses from Ford tries to tell him what to do. Which makes their relationship and partnership unstable. The script is sharp with its storytelling.<br/><br/>The direction is moving with a building story and thrilling race sequences. The racing scenes are pedal to the metal intense. The cinematography in putting the cameras on the streets of racing cars flying by. Or right in the driver side of the car puts you right into the race.<br/><br/>Christian Bale and Matt Damon delivered the performances. They are awesome playing the characters.<br/><br/>Overall, Ford v Ferrari is one of the best movies of the year. It is exciting. The direction, script, and actors did great with the movie. The racing sequences is one of the best put together action scenes. That will leave you on the edge of your seat."

I want to love movies, but it's been years since I've watched one that I really loved. Then came F v F.... This movie is absolutely brilliant! From the acting to the cinematography, even the soundtrack and sound effects, everything is on point.<br/><br/>I've always love racing, watched F1 and WRC when I was young, but didn't know much about Le Mans, let alone the story behind Ford and Shelby teaming up. The story line was captivating, the plot twists were unpredictable. The rivalry with Ferrari was palpable, yet being only a medium for a much deeper story. The paste of the movie is perfect, always leaving you wanting to know what's coming next. The dialogue is rich, the details, credible. It plunges you into the world of racing in quite a convincing manner, with technicalities and politics that doesn't overwhelm the audience. The performance of Bale and Deamon are outstanding, touching at times. You heard it, I almost cried...<br/><br/>I don't know how factually accurate this story is, but I don't care.

","*Ford vs Ferrari*
Certainly a movie for car racing fans, but more so for vintage cars enthusiasts. Christian Bale excels his acting skills as the protagonist as a car tester/mechanic/racer. Matt Damon gives a great supporting performance. However, Jon Bernthal seems to be a wasted cast since his part where his performance matters gets peaked in the first 40 minutes. He appears to have no potential role after that. Nevertheless, watching the drama between team Ferrari and Ford unfold with sleek shining vintage beauties is a treat for eyes and ears. Cinematography, sound-mixing, screenplay, and editing is on point.

","I saw this only because I always see the films nominated for best picture. I don't drive and I know almost nothing about Motorsports. I still managed to be thoroughly entertained by the film. The film deftly blends a story of corporate skulduggery with the racing stuff and manages to tell human interest story about both Miles and Shelby. With so many balls in the air the editor and writers manage to keep the film straightforward and *moving.* This is one the best paced films of the year and the racing stuff is just fantastic as actions scenes.<br/><br/>My only real problem with the film is that Beebe's animosity towards Miles is underdeveloped. They have one scene where they butt heads but it propels a lot of the tension of the story. I didn't realize how critical the butting heads scene was until after the movie was long over. It is the only part of the film that wasn't top notch.<br/><br/>Bale is the best part. Miles is a great prickly underdog. And Bale hasn't every been this endearing in ages. The film ends up having a bittersweet ending and Bale's choices really help the ending land with emotional power. This was a very good film."

"arungeorge13","8","1","1","8 February 2020"," Engaging all the way to the finish line! [+80%]
","Driven by a high-speed bromance between two of Hollywood's finest (Bale and Damon), Ford v Ferrari is a fantastic film both on counts of character development and racing set-pieces. The writers (the Butterworths and Jason Keller) set the film between 1963 and 1966, giving the characters of Caroll Shelby (Damon), Ken Miles (Bale), Mollie Miles (Balfe), Peter Miles (Jupe), Iacocca (Bernthal), and Henry Ford II (Letts) sufficient time, screen-space, and dialogues to be built from the ground up.<br/><br/>Even for viewers who aren't into automobiles, Ford v Ferrari will be an enjoyable watch owing to Mangold's energetic direction and the screen chemistry between Damon and Bale. Their friendship has been written and portrayed with the kind of warmth that everyone is bound to find engaging. There are differences in tastes and opinions, but when the duo gets down to the racing business, it's all respect for each other. Shelby, a notable (former) race car driver and automotive designer, is the DRIVING FORCE and Miles, a World War II veteran is the DRIVER here. The dynamics between them are brilliant and truly a sight to see on the screen.<br/><br/>Ford v Ferrari also succeeds in building up great supporting acts - a tongue-in-cheek Iacocca, a concerned wife in Mollie, a somewhat adorable Petey, a no-nonsense Henry Ford II, a cunning Leo Beebe, and a seething Enzo Ferrari. As much as the film is about the rivalry between the two automobile giants, it's about the drama (a.k.a the little things) too. Like, Miles having a moment with his wife and kid, Shelby contemplating his career, a funny-as-hell tussle between Shelby and Miles, and sleepless nights before the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Speaking of Le Mans, it does make sense for the viewer to have some context on this form of endurance racing to truly know what racers (in this case, Ken Miles) ought to have gone through.<br/><br/>Ford v Ferrari has a thrilling final hour with one of the best-ever racing set-pieces to be captured on film. Mangold truly lets the cars burn the tarmac when they should, in a finale that looks every bit authentic with little to no CGI. This may also be why every crash-and-burn shot feels a lot more concerning than otherwise. There's also the scene set ten minutes before the commencement of Le Mans, with Miles walking into the arena with a teacup in hand to a packed house, Shelby next to him; the duo watch the cars being set-up, the Ferraris pass them by, Enzo's looking down at them from the stands; the tensive mood pervading the entire arena is conveyed beautifully. It's scenes like these that leave a lasting memory.<br/><br/>This is a film that makes you want to look up more of the Le Mans if you haven't already. And that, by default, makes Ford v Ferrari a raging win in my books."

He becomes THE MAN ONE LOVES TO HATE and in top form, indeed.<br/><br/>The whole atmosphere of a gripping script is enhanced with his presence and the way he shows how he can plan underground strategies to try to sink Ken Miles, but in the end -and even if he humiliates Miles- the spectator ends with a bitter flavour remembering his presence.<br/><br/>KUDOS for such a superb piece of acting, Mr. Lucas."

","As a huge fan of Christian Bale, and an even bigger fan of Enzo Ferrari and the journey behind the Ferrari perfection, it was a story which grabbed me from the first frame and held me captivated to the last frame. The element of Ford becoming not only a contender but a winner of the Le Mans, not really a spoiler it's already down in the books, does very little in itself, however the journey and the eccentricness of the man behind the wheel who helped make it possible was the films shinning beacon. Also appreciated the short inserts of Lee Iacocca and his contribution to the Ford racing program. Ford v Ferrari puts a fresh perspective on a moment in history which most would most likely care less about, but it does it in a way which could be entertaining for a whole family. It's the classic underdog story, which that character arc which you would expect, but with an altruistic defiance to confirm and follow rules which add an almost James Dean rebel without a cause type flare to this film. All in all fun film and entertaining."

","I'm not much of a car fanatic let alone racing fanatic but the story had me intrigued enough to go see it and I was not disappointed!<br/><br/>Ford v Ferrari tells the story of how Ford made it's first racing car with an aim to win the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans in France over Ferrari who had won the last four years. At its core however it is the story American car designer Carroll Shelby and British driver Ken Miles who made it happen and their relationship.<br/><br/>Let's start first at where credit is due - with Christian Bale. Another terrific performance and he pretty much steals the show in his portrayal of Ken Miles. Tough to do staring alongside Matt Damon who also delivers a fantastic performance. Yet each role he takes on, Bale seems to be able to do no wrong.<br/><br/>I also really enjoyed the scenes in the car during races and practice runs. The shots included during the 24 Hours of Le Mans race of the track seen both within the car and also of the race, were really impressive. It gave a real authenticity to what it must feel like being in one of those races, similar to how Ride Like a Girl did the same for horse racing.<br/><br/>The film isn't a 100% reflection on actual events, as there is more to this story which I have since been learning about. DO NOT let you stop you from seeing this film! I guarantee you'll get something out of it. It might even peak your curiosity as it did mine."
"zenmilos","8","1","1","14 January 2020"," from ""iQ-movies"" at blogspot
","One of the contenders for the 2020 Oscars is a sympathetic film by the acclaimed director James Mangold about car racing, and which, important to note, fortunately has nothing to do with the ""Fast and Fury"" series.<br/><br/>The title of the film was changed to ""Le Mans 66"" in most countries where it is shown outside the US, although the original name is more appropriate, because the historical facts in the film have been adjusted and amplified, in order to highlight as much as possible the rivalry between two large factories, different in every sense, and first of all in terms of conceptions and philosophies in general, when it comes to cars and the automobile industry.
Either way, both titles are certainly better than the original ""Go Like Hell"" when Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt were reportedly considered for potential lead roles.
This is how we get a very watchable movie, with excellent chemistry between the main actors, Matt Damon and Christian Bale, that, once it starts, can easily be turn a blind eye for all its imperfections.<br/><br/>There is no need to waste words on the details, the movie is simply fun and recommended for viewing. Wishing only that other films seen in competition for this year's Film Academy Awards are more like that."

He tries to save the business from taking a nosedive from competing company, Ferrari by designing a new, faster Ford model with help from his mechanic friend, Ken Miles (Bale) who not only agrees, but wants to drive it as well. When the corporate execs disapprove of Miles, Shelby puts his job on the line to help his friend be the first to drive the car and win the La Mans race.

","There aren't too many movies that have come out in the last decade that were good enough for me to want to watch them again or buy them. This is definitely an exception and its a racing movie. Well, sort of a racing movie. The cast is pretty good. Matt Damon and Christian Bale kill it on their end. Its very compelling emotionally and can definitely make you empathize with the characters. Nice to see a movie that doesn't have a political message or underlying social message in 2019. You can go read the synopsis for this movie to find out what its about, but its a great movie for people that don't even like racing. The characters are predictable and the story is rather predictable as well, but it is based on a true story of which we know the outcome and the setting lends an idea of the kind of people you are going to see. This is probably one of the best movies about racing I have ever seen. You don't learn much on the historical side of things and, honestly, that is probably a good thing. If you are looking for the story without the entertainment then watch the documentary, but if you are looking for a fun and entertaining movie with badass cars, then, this movie is for you. Btw, this movie is visually striking and shot very well."

The characters felt real and managed to capture genuine human interactions and it all built to provide a very emotional ending.<br/><br/>The sets were great and really gave you a feeling of being back in the 60's and there were some very interesting little tidbits thrown in showing how ww2 had left its scar on many people. It did this while maintaining a careful view of its priorities, it wasnt there to tell you what the 60's were but to use it as a backdrop for a real story.<br/><br/>The acting was superb throughout, Damon really gave a strong performance and Bale really managed to convey well the good and bad character traits with real respect for the person he was representing. Also, although Caitriona Balfe was playing a supporting role I think her performance really needs to be called out. Caitriona managed to portray real strength and respect in a female character, she never went around screaming she was better than men, she instead portrayed real emotions, real reactions and genuine heart. I felt her supporting role was very well done too.<br/><br/>Overall this felt like a movie which had some respect for its audiences intelligence and managed to really provide both genuine escapism and tell a very interesting and engaging story. Highly recommended viewing."

","There comes a moment in one's (professional) life when one's own passion, drive, skill, and one's immediate team and opportunity - all line-up. Few of us are able to embrace that chance to become the best versions of ourselves and set benchmarks for generations to follow. This movie celebrates that spirit of pursuit of perfection at one's craft both individually and as a team.<br/><br/>Caroll Shelby & Phil Remington built and Ken Miles raced the Ford Shelby GT 40 which defeated the most brilliantly engineered cars at the time - The Ferrari in the most demanding and enduring race in the world - 24 hours of LeMans in 1966 and it went on to win for 4 consecutive years. And to date, it remains the only American car to do so.<br/><br/>Yes, the movie has all the adrenaline pumping, engine revving, nail-biting action that we expect from a race car movie. But it goes much beyond that by bringing out the amazing comradery and personal journeys of Caroll Shelby and Ken Miles. It shows how a small team of committed and talented people who set themselves an impossible target can actually make God (Ferrari) bleed by sheer will power, raw talent, and good old hard work. It also beautifully shows how family believes in you when others give up.<br/><br/>Christian Bale and Matt Damon are impeccable.<br/><br/>Visuals are awesome, all real cars, real drivers, shot from the perspective of the driver - Behind the wheel and on the track. Above all, the perfect harmony of man and machine with endurance is on display here.<br/><br/>Guys, this is the one to watch on IMAX !"

"adenevens","3","69","278","21 September 2019"," boring, no character development, typical nationalist dialog
","It's not easy to make car racing look interesting on film, as shots of cars going around corners and faceless drivers shifting gears start to feel pretty repetitive. Though the many scenes of fast driving do add some adrenaline, the film has to rely on a dramatic arc that hinges on the possibility of building a fast car and getting the right driver. Unfortunately this dilemma advances all too predictably, and features static characters in cookie-cutter relationships that feature no real tension and no development whatsoever. The characters are drawn well enough to elicit a few laughs at unexpected juxtapositions, but mostly they just go through the motions, and we literally hear the same overblown lines at the end of the film as we do at the beginning, as though the film wanted to remind viewers that nothing actually happens in between. Some nice period touches and decent turns by some supporting actors working with limited material demonstrate that the filmmakers were at least trying, but the flat relationships and tepid dialog keep things moving at a snooze. Maybe watch it on an airplane if there's nothing better?"
"kaneeddy","9","8","22","15 November 2019"," The ultimate racing film
","Ford v Ferrari just adds to the growing list of amazing films to come out in 2019, it delivers one of the most entertaining films I've ever seen, the film is 2 hours and 30 minutes long, but it doesn't feel like that at all because of how exciting and engaging the film is. James Mangold has proved that he is a seriously underrated director and needs to be considered as one of the best working today. The cast is fantastic especially Christian Bale who should be in Oscar talks this year. He delivered what I believed was the best performance last year in Vice and he once again gives such an amazing performance alongside Matt Damon who is also awesome in the film.<br/><br/>The film also explores dynamics such as: A father son relationship and being proud of who you are as a person which were really poignant. The sound mixing and editing is Oscar worthy with the cars sounding so awesome. It also explores all the aspects to racing that are rarely explored in film such as: The strategy behind winning the race, finding the right driver for the car, the business behind the racing and all the politics that are associated with it.<br/><br/>The only nitpicky thing I could find is that some audiences may find the beginning to be a little slow and would like 5-10 mins cut out from the film so that it is a tighter package however it didn't really bother me at all.<br/><br/>Overall Ford v Ferrari treats its subject matter with care, the film has great direction, fantastic acting and explores such interesting themes that I think it transcends the genre so people who aren't even fans of cars and racing will still love this film."

His performance should keep rubes occupied, thinking they have witnessed something genuine, an example of what acting is supposed to be.<br/><br/>Moving on to the story. Naturally, much of this didn't happen. The pitting of big corporatist Ford Motors against Miles the humble car racer was all made up and I guessed it while watching the film - they just put these cliches in knowing that millions of not so bright members of the public will never get tired how many thousands of times they have experienced these tropes. Anything to get people punching their fists in the air and rooting for their hero. Read the facts of the Miles story if you care at all.<br/><br/>The only real recommendable parts of the film and the reason I bothered seeing it, were the racing scenes which are thrilling.

So F v F is the true story of how Ford established a name in racing over a feud with Ferrari while also being a Ken Miles biopic , and James Mangold does both like a master and knocks it out of the park. Christian bale got down to his og English accent and absolutely kills it as Ken Miles with his method acting , Matt Damon too was really good as Carrol Shelby and so were the rest of the cast . The story is an underdog tale about Ford , a company which makes cars for the common man , teaming up with former racer Shelby and his Man behind the wheel , Ken Miles. None of their pasts are revealed or even hinted at and yet you care for these characters , the movie makes you realise that by throwing in a will he die / won't he die based on reaching the rpm limit throughout the entire second act . Also , this movie is masterfully shot by Phedon Papamichael known for walk the line and Ides of March and he makes every frame look gorgeous , which is aided by sleek editing , music and sound design. In the end , Ford v Ferrari is a well directed , masterfully shot , brilliantly acted biopic with neat dialogue , powerful characters , passion towards a goal , a rush of adrenaline , one chameleon called Christian Bale and Ford's marketing strategy ironically said through tons and tons of coca cola product placement."

","First Hit: I love good car movies, and this one qualifies as one of the best.<br/><br/>It's been a while since I've been to a night showing of a film. In picking this evening time and this film, it was both pleasing and irritating to be in a nearly full theater. The fun part is that I often see films where there are less than 15 people in the theater, and seeing an almost full theater gave me hope that others will continue to support going to movie theaters.<br/><br/>The irritation part is the noise that people make during the film presentation. Why someone thinks their remembrances of the period, or what they think about what their seeing on the screen is essential to spout out while the film is playing, is beyond me. The gentleman sitting next to me turned around just as I did the same thing and together we asked them to be quiet. It took us doing this twice for them to get that they weren't at home watching cable TV.
Despite the noise interruptions, this film unfolded in a fun way. Remembrances of the 1960s abounded with cars from the era on the streets. Yes, they were perfectly restored vehicles, but it was easy to gloss over the prettiness to enjoy the beauty of those old cars reflecting their time and place in my life. There were Shelby Cobras, Porsches, Ford Falcons, Mini, woody (fake wood) wagons, Ferraris, and Ford GT 40s.<br/><br/>The film is about how Enzo Ferrari (Remo Girone) turned down Henry Ford II's (Tracy Letts) offer to buy 90% of Ferrari's car production company. In turning down Ford's offer and partnering with Fiat, Enzo made unflattering remarks about Ford and his cars to the Ford negotiation team. Angered by the personal comments, Ford vowed to beat perennial 24 Hours Le Mans race winner, Ferrari.<br/><br/>Chief Ford negotiator, Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal), was then tasked with finding a car builder who will build a Ford-based car to beat Ferrari. Finding Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon), the one-time winning driver of the 24 Le Mans, to make the car, Ford believes they found their man. Henry Ford gives Shelby carte blanche to build this car.<br/><br/>Shelby, in turn, hires his friend and race car driver Ken Miles (Christian Bale), to be his test driver and co-builder. The main reason is that he can trust Miles as he knows cars and feels their abilities and problems as he drives them. Miles is also creative when figuring out how to make cars work better. The downside of Miles is that he's a maverick in his thinking and hates to conform to rules and being told what to do.<br/><br/>Miles is married Mollie (Caitriona Balfe), who's amused by her husband's friendship with Shelby. There are couple scenes that this loving amusement shows up. One thing the film makes clear is that Ken is a loving devoted father who loved showing his son Peter (Noah Jupe) the ins and outs of racing.<br/><br/>The film spends time showing Miles and Shelby developing the GT40 to race in Le Mans, but when it comes time to ship the car off to the race, Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas) Senior VP at Ford, chooses another driver to drive the vehicle at the Le Mans race.<br/><br/>Shelby is pissed, Miles is severely disappointed, and of course, the new driver doesn't feel the car like Miles would have and ends up blowing it apart during the race.<br/><br/>Ford wants to fire Shelby for the failure, but the meeting between Ford and Shelby is fantastic because Shelby convinces Ford that he, Ford, has Ferrari where he wants him, scared. Scared because Shelby's car, with another driver, was faster than the Ferrari, especially on the straightaway at Le Mans. This was a great scene. It's reflecting Shelby's legendary ability to sell anyone on anything.<br/><br/>Ford tells Shelby to fix the car and get it ready for the next Le Mans and that Shelby has control over the driver.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie shows how they develop a stronger, lighter, faster GT40 car. But when Beebe intercedes again about Miles being the driver at Le Mans, Shelby takes Ford out in the GT40 and scares the crap out of him, literally.
Then at that moment negotiates with Ford to let Miles drive. As part of the deal he offers Ford his Shelby American company if Miles races and loses.<br/><br/>It's scenes like this that are fun to watch and reminded me of the time that a friend of a friend, gave me a ride in a Lamborghini Miura, and scared the crap out of me while racing around a sizeable empty factory parking lot at a very high speed.<br/><br/>There were sections of this 152-minute film that could have been trimmed, but I was engaged enough to not care about the lulls of uninteresting or engaging material. Other characters added to this story and made better. One such person was Chief Mechanic Phil Remington (Ray McKinnon). His ideas about creating a way to change the brake assembly were brilliant.<br/><br/>Bale was intensely and independently outstanding in this role as race car driver Ken Miles. His ability to show tenderness and love towards his family and aggressively focused on making the car faster was terrific. Damon was wonderful as Carroll Shelby. The scene with Ford after the first loss and his fight with Miles in front of Mile's home reflected the off-told stories about the legend of Carroll Shelby. Bernthal was good as the famed Iacocca. Balfe was convincing as Ken's wife. Her support and understanding of her husband were excellently portrayed. My favorite scene shows Balfe driving Ken home while pressing him on his whereabouts. Her focused intensity was sublime. Letts was priceless as Ford II. The bullying ways he used around his staff and factory followed by his being humbled by the spin in the GT40 were terrific. McKinnon was excellent as devoted Chief Mechanic for Shelby. Beebe was appropriately arrogant, self-serving, and sharp as a foil to Shelby's vision. Girone was satisfyingly perfect as Enzo Ferrari. Jez and John-Henry Butterworth wrote an expansive script that could have been shortened and made crisper. However, there are some outstanding scenes in the film. James Mangold directed this film. To his credit, racing scenes can get old quick, but the excellent editing and cinematography made these scenes come alive.<br/><br/>Overall: I liked seeing this film for multiple reasons, including that the subsequent Ford built Shelby Mustang GT-350 and GT-500 had parts made by my father's company in the late 1960s."
"NatKaminska","10","4","9","17 November 2019"," Ford vs Ferrari is pure entertainment, an epic sports/western about male friendship&passion for something. Nostalgic tribute to old Hollywood movies that are no longer made.
","The director of the film James Mangold himself claims in interviews that he shot 'Saving Private Ryan' in the reverse, a film that unfolds gradually, and in the third act shows all its beauty, in a monumental scene portraying the course of the great and one of the toughest car races in the world - Le Mans, during which racers drove all day and night.<br/><br/>At first, however, I would like to briefly address the loud and polarizing opinions about this film that have already appeared.
So the ultra-left side (swjs) already thinks that this movie is a step backwards, because it focuses on the friendship of two white men and generally it is a movie packed with alpha men fighting for power. Of course, this is unfair simplification and not true.<br/><br/>This film tells a classic story of David vs Goliath, a story of beautiful friendship between two passionate people. On the surface this is a film about a duel between Ford and Ferrari in Le Mans, but if we dive deeper, it is truly a story about eternal struggle between corporation and artists (which can also be transferred to the film industry itself).<br/><br/>Therefore, people should forget about politics at least once, especially if we are in the world of art, cinema, film, because pushing politics into everything becomes really devastating and toxic, art / films are given contexts that simply do not exist in these specific cases. Ford and Ferrari is a nostalgic return to the old cinema, yes, it talks mainly about men, but also about their passion, family and love. About small- big things that are simple and present in everyone's life, it is a film for everyone.<br/><br/>Other opinions that I heard are that the whole story is too simple and predictable, and the characters are not shown enough off the race track, too little character study. First of all, the allegation about the simplicity of this story is absurd, because the director clearly wanted to make such a film - it's not just a car film, but a classic western as the director himself confirmed in an interview for The Times : ''As much as I felt like I was making a race movie, I was making Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, a movie about friendship "" - he said. And it's true.<br/><br/>This film ticks off every known point in the classic western story, in which you can find a duel between the good and the bad, fight between the charming 'outlaw' poets of the wheel and the great, bad, big bosses of something much bigger. Perhaps, as some say, Mangold's mistake was focusing too much on the conflict of bureaucracy - the racetrack, but as I read in interviews, the script was re-written several times, it was supposed to be an old classic cinema about male friendship and hardships and it works. And yes - from time to time, we need to take a break from the over-intellectualised and psychologically intense cinema and we simply need such pure entertainment, with a dose of pathos, emotions, great collective scenes and two very pleasant acting performances.<br/><br/>And now back to these two main characters. Bale and Damon play two geniuses, one of whom can communicate with the rest of the world like a normal human and belong to a larger community (Damon's Shelby) and the other (Bale's Miles), is a total freak, an outsider incompatible with anyone and anything except maybe his wife and son, exuberant eccentric. But it is exactly this '' separateness '', internal life, loneliness and quirks of Miles, that can lead to the defeat of the invincible Ferrari. These two make the film from beginning to end and the chemistry between them is great. The duo dynamics provide us with a few really hilarious scenes, one of which deserves special attention - the fight scene near Miles's home. Bale and Damon are excellent comedy-wise in this scene, as middle-aged daddies pathetically trying to knock each other down with bread or a trash can lid.<br/><br/>For me, these two performances deserve recognition, because Damon and Bale did what they could with the script they got. They both did a lot of work.<br/><br/>However, if I had to choose one, I would choose Bale. Bale plays Ken Miles, the maverick British racing driver really brilliantly. His energy, the entire digging into the psychology of the character, but also into his physicality - Christian is a master of total acting. Pay attention to the work of his arms at the cinema - just like Miles, and yet there are so few video clips with Miles. Bale's acting is not at all 'too big', Miles is just like that in this movie - explosive, impulsive, full of passion, but also has a tart language without a filter for those who want to manipulate him. Also, let's not forget that Bale spoke personally to Miles's son Peter, as he prepared for the role.<br/><br/>Miles was a bona-fide eccentric, and his cockpit monologues have something of Top Gear about them.<br/><br/>""Learn to drive, you pillock!"" he roars as someone cuts him up. ""More of that please, giddy up!"" he shouts when the car responds. ""This feels like a bag of squirrels!"" he yells when it doesn't. Miles was from Birmingham, but Bale's version has more than a touch of Yorkshire. He is basically an unholy hybrid of Jeremy Clarkson, Alan Partridge and Geoffrey Boycott.<br/><br/>""Christian had this remarkable list of Brummie expressions he made on a wadded-up piece of notepaper"" Mangold said in The Times interview ""I'd like to frame it. People said that Miles liked to talk to himself while he was driving and we hadn't really written any ongoing mutterings for him. So between takes when he was in the car, Christian had this piece of paper: 'Your face is redder than a spiked arse . . . let's not go round the Wrekin (Black Country slang for going the long way).' "" I find this anecdote hilarious.<br/><br/>According to the director, double-decker rigs allowed Bale and co to be filmed in the cars while they were driven by professional drivers sitting on the roof. ""So the actors are moving through space at 100 miles an hour, they're amid other traffic all being driven by pros, but they're allowed to act, remember their lines, take notes."" Or, in Bale's case, swear like a trooper.<br/><br/>Bale's character is certainly, heightened (but as I wrote this is Miles in this story) hurling wrenches as freely as he chucks insults. Mangold thinks the performance expresses ""a lot of the joy in Christian's soul. So many of his roles, in a very direct contradiction of who he is in life, are just very grim. The playfulness rarely gets a chance to shine.""<br/><br/>With Phoenix, as with Bale and Daniel Day Lewis, ""you're not even sure where the acting stops"", Mangold said. ""There's a kind of danger.'' and he added : ''Matt, Christian, Joaquin, Russell Crowe, Vanessa Redgrave, Robert De Niro: they come to the set to play. They're the opposite of tricky - they want to be directed and they've worked with many great directors, so they have a great deal of trust.''<br/><br/>And for all these reasons, for me Christian Bale is actually the most fascinating actor in today's film world. He is the most unique and unpredictable actor of modern actors. He always turns left when everyone else turns right, and vice versa - goes straight when the others turn. His choices are quite unusual, they never go with fashion, with mainstream.<br/><br/>In the previous year, he played without hesitation in the very polarizing '' Vice '' and there is no doubt that he angered many on the right side of the political scene, and today he plays in an old-fashioned western - sport film about purely male friendship, which, as I can see, has already annoyed some feminists and ultra-leftists.<br/><br/>But Christian only goes his own ways, just like Ken Miles, and chooses roles that challenge him, not because of political correctness. As he has shown more than once, he does not care who he can anger with his dark, witty, sardonic and self-deprecating sense of humor (you can see it in many interviews) and I absolutely love it.<br/><br/>Finally, that's why Christian is a brilliant actor, one of a kind, but also a chameleon - because I've read thousands of comments online about him and no one actually has a clue. But James Mangold, who is friends with Bale, gave a great IndieWire interview about the film and Bale, one great quote: '' I felt the role was close to Bale and prayed he would do it. He's a model to me of artistic perseverance and flexibility. He'll text you with thoughts and free associations about the character. It's all incredible food. He's a wonderful father, loving husband, great friend. He's not interested in being famous. He drives a pickup truck, he's grounded in the world, he raced motorcycles but had to stop when he got hurt, when he had kids. There are so many parts of Ken in Christian, who's a perfectionist. He's trying to achieve something for himself. It's magical to direct someone like that because they draw you into their own idealism. You feel that energy; it permeates the set''.<br/><br/>Like Once Upon a Time . . . in Hollywood, Le Mans '66 is about ""the transition moment for men in the Sixties as the world is changing from underneath them"", Mangold says. With their nonchalant machismo and hands-on practicality, Miles and Shelby are an endangered species, as Leonardo DiCaprio's and Brad Pitt's characters were in Quentin Tarantino's movie. Mangold seems a bit like that too. Not a dinosaur, but one of those muscular all-rounders who would have thrived in the golden age of Tinseltown.<br/><br/>He smiles. ""I'd be very happy 50 years ago, in the Hollywood system."" He says he's trapped, but he has always been ""a wanderer in terms of genre"", from cops to cowboys, asylum inmates to country singers, superhero pensioners to retro racers. He thinks his versatility has been ""almost to his detriment"". Nonsense. Mangold is just that quaint, old-fashioned thing: a really good director.<br/><br/>Let this be the ultimate encouragement. Ford vs Ferrari is an epic, old-fashioned cinema, no CGI, they had car replicas, for that reason only it's worth watching in the cinema, on a big screen."
"sriramthestranger","10","4","9","17 November 2019"," Absolutely Amazing!!
","The plot is given straight away with Henry Ford II insulted by Ferrari and vowing to win the Le Mans race by building a race car. But what makes this movie amazing is the narrative and performances from Matt Damon and Christian Bale that makes you feel you are in the driver seat. The scenes where the culture at Ford affects the innovation and Shellby's pitch to put Ken Miles behind the wheels are wonderful and makes the movie realistic. The narrative is very engaging and doesn't bore you a bit. Special kudos to the sound effects team as their work reminds you of the movie when you hear the 'vroom' sound in the lanes.

","I give this film three stars only because it wasn't my type of movie - I am certain folks who are into racing and action films will truly enjoy it. I saw it because it got nominated for multiple Oscars, and because a friend of mine assured me I would like it. Unfortunately, the combination of my lack of interest in the subject matter coupled with the rah-rah Go America message (at the expense of the Italians, naturally) was a bit too much. I do love Christian Bale and Matt Damon as actors, and the technological prowess on display was impressive (sound, editing, CGI, etc.), so I am still glad I saw it. I also appreciated the fact that it was based on a true story and that the Ford Motor Company and the characters involved came across realistically as the less-than-admirable individuals they were."

"rfrankssr","10","3","6","15 December 2019"," Firts rate film with a first rate cast
","This is why I go to the movies. James Mangold has always been a favorite Writer/Director of mine and he delivers perfectly with this 'buddy' movie about one of the greatest drivers of all time with one of the greatest car designers of all time. Bale and Damon are spot on , though it's hard for me to decide which one turned in the best performance, because, as of this writing, Bale has locked the Golden Globe and SAG nominations. The rest of the cast just added to the incredible story of Ford taking on Ferrari at the 24 Hours of LeMans.
For racing enthusiasts, this is pure adrenaline, several scenes during the race sequences that made me jump back in my seat. Phedon Papamichael's cinematography is amazing. There is a scene where Miles (Bale) takes his son out to the LAX runway and explains to him the perfect lap. It was such a touching scene (it plays later in the movie) because of the way Papamichael lit it. It sent chills down my back.
In conclusion, a must see film for anyone, racing enthusiast or not. One of the best race films ever and one of the best pictures of the year."

"iquine","10","3","6","14 December 2019"," Meaty Racing; Meaty Acting
","(Flash Review)<br/><br/>All cinematic facets were hitting on all cylinders. Ferrari had been winning the 24 Hour of Le Man's race again and again and again. Enzo Ferrari rejected Ford's offer to merge companies which angered Henry Ford II and he decided to challenge Ferrari's Le Mans dominance by building a better racecar. Carrol Shelby was put in charge of building and designing the car and racing program with the help of Ken Miles as driver/engineer. Watch as they battle it out on track and in the garage. Can the American behemoth snatch victory from the innovative Ferrari? This film nailed the engine and racing sounds and had very good racing effects although I feel Rush was a bit better. Complimenting that with deep character emotions made for a well-rounded film. Christian Bale was dialed in as quirky and unrefined Ken Miles, which the film emotionally hinged around, and Damon was pure Matt Damon and able to tease out genuine feelings; enough that a tear was shed. Even the supporting characters had genuine emotional moments. All in all, this was top notch with a briskly paced story."

"Lomax343","8","3","6","2 December 2019"," Even non-petrolheads will love it.
","I saw this at a mystery screening at my local cinema. When I saw the title card, I was dismayed. First because I have no knowledge of, nor interest in, motor racing. Second, because from the start I was expected to root for Ford, when in all sporting events involving an American team and a non-American team, I always root for the latter as a point of principle.
I'm glad I stuck it out, as the film had me sold almost from the start. How true or accurate it is, I neither know nor care, as I was totally involved in the story. Yes there are cliched elements (the interfering company executives etc), and there were rather more dramatic gear-changes than we really needed - but the film revolves around two terrific performances from Matt Damon and, particularly, Christian Bale as a man who not only lives and breathes motor-oil, but regularly showers in the stuff as well.

","Part of me wonders if I have stronger connection, a deeper investment to this film and the material as a born and raised Michigander that grew up immersed in automotive culture despite never really being a car person. Ford isn't just some company, it was a cornerstone of our economy and even our cultural identity. I say this because I got a legitimate rush out of this movie and when Ford is battling Ferrari I find myself wanting to get up and cheer them on.<br/><br/>Furthermore, Bale and Damon should be in more movies together. The chemistry and the performances they deliver are exceptional. That's not to say the rest of the cast isn't pulling their weight, there are good, convincing performances all around, which does wonders for the immersion into this story.<br/><br/>Also aiding in the immersion is the cinematography. Auto racing bores me in the real world and yet while watching this movie I found myself gripping the arm rests around the hairpin turns. As far as I'm concerned, that's an achievement of this movie, that it really draws me into what's going on.<br/><br/>The only real drawback is in the ""villain"" who, at times is just extra awful. Aside from that though, I loved this. Definitely recommend it and, more than that, I absolutely think it's worth seeing in theaters for the full experience."

James Mangold's direction is spectacular, the film's cinematography is jaw-droppingly brilliant, the editing is masterful, and the score of Marco Beltrami and Buck Sanders is excellent.

","Often times this time of year it's tough to find a crowd pleasing film. The blockbusters are rare and the Oscar movies are everywhere, albeit typically a ""downer"" or more ""thought-provoking"" than something you're on the edge of your seat for. Ford v Ferrari certainly accomplishes the latter with two winning performances, sharp direction from James Mangold, and a cheer worthy true story to base it around. Heck, this movie even had some laugh out loud humor, something Christian Bale's filmography isn't full of. I would love to see him try straight comedy at some point. In all, Mangold has another win on his hands with one of the best films of the year. Here's hoping it's honored during awards season!<br/><br/>8.9/10"
"Vic_max","Null","3","6","20 November 2019"," Ford's foray into 1960s endurance racing
","You can't but help but root for Carroll Shelby and Ken Miles ... they're kind of the real racing die-hards being used like pawns by Ford management of the time. The movie leads up to the dramatic 1966 24-hour endurance racing event in Le Mans, France.<br/><br/>What a great story! It brings together luminaries of the time like Enzo Ferrari, Henry Ford and Carroll Shelby in a fascinating true historical event. We also learn of a name that should be honored in like, namely Ken Miles. The movie has great characters, action, suspense and an amazing ending.<br/><br/>For me, one of the coolest scenes in the movie is when Henry Ford II takes a ride with Shelby in the GT race car. He is overwhelmed with awe of what cars have become since his grandfather's time. The GT is no model-T.<br/><br/>The 2.5 hour run time breezes and it's hard not to be glued to the screen the whole time. The movie's a winner in my book."

The photography was as it should be and wonderfully put together. I saw this at an I MAX sitting at the back and with accompanying soundtrack made my day.

"ellic1","9","3","6","20 November 2019"," A fresh idea out of Holloywood
","I've been down on Hollywood lately. In that regard this film was refreshing.
This film puts an interesting perspective on LeMans, and how the US got there with the GT40.
I grew up in the 60's. I was 15 when this race occurred. Carroll Shelby was a God and the GT40 a dream.
It was a time when things could get done in this country. JFK said we're going to the moon.....we did. Carroll Shelby wanted to eat Corvettes on the track and he did with the Cobra. Henry Ford II wanted to beat Ferrari and with Shelby and Miles and the GT40 he did. Pull out the stops, damn the corporate committees, just a ""git 'er done"" mentality.
It's a fun film that doesn't get lost in the racing. It is a story of friendship, attitude, determination and yes, Le Mans.
It is also a fantastic ode to some the greatest icons of Automotive history, Shelby, Miles, Iacocca, Henry Ford II.

"jdesando","Null","3","6","18 November 2019"," My fav of all time, NOW!
","""It isn't about speed."" Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) to Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal).<br/><br/>Just as that statement from the world-class car designer is a poignant reminder of the complexity in car racing of the mid '6o's, so too is it about the newest car-racing thriller, Ford V Ferrari. The film combines some of the best racing ever seen on screen with the best of buddy adventures.<br/><br/>It is now my favorite (I previously favored Steve McQueen's Le Mans), reminding me of a great Western mixed with a great duo, such as Paul Newman and Robert Redford from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. There's even a scene of the two heroes facing off the suits like a Western gunfight about to happen.<br/><br/>Matt Damon as Shelby is at his best cajoling Christian Bale, consummate actor, as legendary driver Ken Miles. Together they fight and joke accompanying their goal of beating the Ferrari juggernaut at the 24 hour Le Mans of 1966.<br/><br/>With Tracy Letts playing an imperious but insightful Henry Ford II (""This isn't the first time Ford Motors' gone to war. We know how to do more than push papers. Go ahead, Carroll. Go to war.""), the cast is incomparable, forwarding the suspense inherent in the testy cars and power races behind investors and manufacturers. Director James Mangold and the successful writing team keep the 2/12 hours moving thrillingly with a consistent sense of humor and manic competition between Italy and the US and driver versus driver.<br/><br/>Ford V Ferrari is the best character-driven action of the year and my favorite race car film of all time.<br/><br/>""We're lighter, we're faster, and if that don't work, we're nastier."" Shelby<br/><br/>If that doesn't sound like a snarly, character-driven Western, then you've never seen The Magnificent Seven."

","James Mangold is a great director and has given us amazing films like Walk the Line and his last film Logan which has impressed us immensely. His newest film, Ford v Ferrari, is another entertaining and well made film that adds to Mangold's filmography.<br/><br/>Ford v Ferrari tells the story of car designer Carroll Shelby and driver Ken Miles who build a race car for Ford in order to defeat Ferrari at the 24 hour race known as Le Mans in 1966.<br/><br/>This movie is one of the best of the year which audiences and car enthusiasts will enjoy throughout. You can tell how much care and effort was put into this project once you watch the film. The racing sequences were really well shot and a blast to witness. None of it felt fake or seemed like a CGI fest because of how practical everything seemed. It must have been really difficult to film those scenes but the crew pulled it off beautifully. The overall look of the movie was gorgeous. It really captured the essence of the time period this film is set in which contributed to the authenticity of everything shown.<br/><br/>The acting from everyone was amazing. Matt Damon gives a solid performance and his partner in crime, Christian Bale, also provides the same result. Both stars have great chemistry with each other and are a joy to see. Jon Bernthal was also great as well as the rest of the supporting cast.<br/><br/>The film clocks in at 2 hours and 30 minutes but it didn't feel like that all. The first half did drag a little bit as it mainly consisted of business meetings and proposals but it doesn't affect the pacing much. Once the racing starts, the time flies. James Mangold does an excellent job directing especially during the racing scenes which flowed well and was easy to watch. He adds a level of intensity to them through the visuals rather than using loud music or crazy slo-mo which I admire. The screenplay had great moments of character and a surprising amount of funny dialogues. Not once did it feel boring.<br/><br/>I have to admit I wasn't expecting Ford v Ferrari to be THIS good! The characters were engaging, the acting was spot on, the races felt intense and the aesthetics were great. If this film were to be nominated at the Oscars, I wouldn't mind. Hats off to everyone who worked on the movie as they gave it their all."

","Simply put, I LOVE this movie. Bale and Damon are next level, Mangold's direction is at his best, and the supporting cast is brilliant. If you do not know the story before going in, DO NOT RESEARCH. This was a story I had no idea about before hand and it blew my mind watching it unfold. If I have maybe 2 flaws, I wish some sympathy could have been put on Ferrari, as they seem like the stereotypical ""bad guy"" in the movie, and the 2nd half-hour does drag just smidge. Overall, in the words of Christian Bale's Ken Miles-- ""It's bloody brilliant!"""

"TimMeade","9","3","6","17 November 2019"," So Good, You'll Cheer on Ford Over Ferrari.
","Released in the U.K. and other markets under the far better title, Le Mans '66, Ford v Ferrari is an exhilarating biopic telling of Ford's attempts to challenge and outdo the beloved cars of genius Enzo Ferrari in the world famous French 24 hour motor marathon.<br/><br/>Seeking the prestige of the Ferrari badge, Henry Ford II (Tracy Letts), is humiliatingly rebuffed in his attempt to buy a controlling interest in the Italian motor manufacturer. In a fit of pique, he orders his executives to create a car that can turn the tables on Ferrari. Retired racing car driver now designer, Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon), is engaged by Ford executive Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal) to do just that. Shelby in turn recruits the cantankerously bloody-minded British racing driver Ken Miles (Christian Bale) to put his foot to the floor and hopefully secure the chequered flag. The project is to be overseen by Ford Senior Vice President Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas).<br/><br/>The film is centred on the dynamic between Shelby and Miles, their awkward relationship and history of confrontation ameliorating as they are both driven, no pun intended, to achieve victory. Their efforts are constantly frustrated by the unhelpful and self-serving Leo Beebe following his own agenda.<br/><br/>Direction from James Mangold (Walk the Line) and cinematography from Phedon Papamichael are both first rate. The racing scenes are truly immersive and you smell the octane. Screenplay from the British pair Jez and John-Henry Butterworth with American Jason Keller, never gets bogged down in technical detail, it simply allows the story to flow, a story so engaging that the running time of two and a half hours never flags; it's not just for petrol heads. And it says much of Matt Damon's progression as a film actor that he easily holds his own in his many scenes with Christian Bale. Irish actor Caitriona Balfe as Miles's wife Mollie provides a strong foil to her husband's headstrong ways.<br/><br/>Is the film slightly formulaic with stock characters? Maybe so, perhaps. Henry Ford II is shown as a bombastic bully, Leo Beebe an unctuous Uriah Heep-style sycophant. But when all other aspects of a film come together, who cares? Besides, most people love pantomime villains. And whether unwittingly or not, the film shows that maverick genius needs the boring business acumen and the politics inevitably attached to succeed. Both Shelby and particularly Miles are shown as pretty hopeless in their business dealings, neither would've got a car anywhere near Le Mans without the bean counters from Ford. The film is also mercifully free of modern day political analogies, concentrating instead on telling its tale without distraction.<br/><br/>I have a feeling this film will become a perennial public holiday favourite.<br/><br/>4.5*"

"vinsond21","9","6","16","14 November 2019"," Riveting reenactment of a remarkable race
","Back in the 1960s, Ferrari's racing team was the one to beat on the track. This is the story of how Ford Motor Company took on Ferrari in 1966 and won, with the help of automotive designer Carroll Shelby and race driver Ken Miles. The Ford team constructed the formidable GT40 which emerged victorious at the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Those who were previously unaware or oblivious of this juicy bit of history will find themselves captivated by its reenactment on celluloid. The film runs two and a half hours, yet it does not drag, thanks to a tight script and solid performances, superbly-edited racing sequences along with a music score that enhances the action onscreen. Matt Damon once again proves why he is one of the finest actors of his generation; he is absolutely spot-on in his portrayal of Shelby as a man with passion, confidence and determination. I love watching him in movies like this one and also Invictus. Christian Bale's performance as Ken Miles, while a little more mannered, still manages to beautifully capture the character's extremes of tenderness and cockiness. Also noteworthy is Tracy Letts as Henry Ford II; he shows that the magnate can have a commanding presence yet break down upon experiencing an epiphany. Ford v Ferrari brings a nugget of racing history to life through this well-assembled movie which is worth catching especially on the big screen."

The dialogue written perfectly well.<br/><br/>The cast performance was great and engaging. Matt Damon and Christian Bale did a great job as their character. I really enjoyed their chemistry in this movie. They nailed their character perfectly without any flaws.<br/><br/>The action sequence was great and perfectly shot. No CGI,no shaky cam, and not messy cut. That's what I can describe for the racing scene. You really need to experience better on cinema by the way.<br/><br/>The cinematography looks beautiful especially during the Le Man's race scene.<br/><br/>Overall, this is probably best racing car movie since Rush."
"milesgreg","3","7","20","4 December 2019"," Bale is a caricature
","I kind of, sort of, walked out of this movie. Not because it was terrible or anything but I just didn't care about the characters. The movie also wasn't very ""cinematic"" although I'm not entirely sure what I mean by that. Now, I am not interested in racing but if you compare this movie to Rush, a movie I waited to see because I wasn't interested in the subject matter, it's night and day. I really enjoyed Rush. It exceeded my expectations by far. This movie was not very good.<br/><br/>The thing that bothered me most was Bale's performance and it might be the worst I've ever seen him do, although that's a pretty high bar. He plays a caricature of someone, not an actual character. And he ruins it for me because the whole family dynamic is awkward. There's 0 chemistry and it doesn't seem real in the least. I couldn't take him or the movie seriously. The scene when his wife is swerving all over the road and yelling at him was weird and out of nowhere. The son barely says a word.<br/><br/>The movie is way too long. Every scene seemed to be the same after two hours. Let's have more shots of Matt Damon's character standing in front of the sun. Let's start every scene out with some classic guitar playing for nostalgia's sake to get you excited. The only good scene was when Bale's character talks about the perfect lap, that's it."

","Disappointed ! Matt Damon might be a good actor but the script he was given is a dud. Childish arguments repeating throughout remind me of the 1968 Elvis movie Speedway more than a story depicting greats like Carol Shelby and Henry Ford 2. Having said that is is structured so that once you are sitting there watching you want to see the outcome, even though you know how it ends. There must have been 20 minutes wasted looking at the side of Christian Bales head while driving, with a competitor in the background moving back and forward in an unrealistic manner. The Butterworth boys would have done well to actually go to a race track and watch at least one car race. How many minutes watching a foot on a brake pedal and accelarator do we need to waste ? Surprisingly one of my friends has been to this movie 4 times, but he is a car guy, not a movie buff. It will appeal to Donald Trump voters I suspect."

"WorldWideKenya","8","8","25","7 November 2019"," A brilliant display of car racing, mechanical design, and the will to win.
","This is a great biopic that tells a compelling story between the American and Italian car makers in one of the toughest races in the world. As a person who likes cars and has a passing familiarity with Le Mans and car mechanics, I thought this move was excellent for people who only had a surface level knowledge of these things and had plenty for every type of movie goer.<br/><br/>Damon and Bale are obviously excellent, with Bale donning a proper English accent and lots of eccentricity and Damon pulling off the forced retired racer and now car designer smoothly. The supporting cast was extremely well done, with special call outs to Tracy Letts, who played an absolutely excellent Henry Ford II and had one of the best scenes in the entire movie. His ability to display such a wide range of emotions really sold the audience to how invested he was in this character. Caitriona Balfe as Mollie Miles, Bale's character's wife, was also excellent. She has a few of her own scenes where she steals the show and is the perfect compliment to Bale's character's own ad hoc lifestyle at times.<br/><br/>In fact, most of the scenes involving Ford Execs were so good that they warrant their own biopic with their own characters. The political battle between Ford's VPs was interesting and infuriating at the same time, showing repeatidly that they are their own worst enemy.<br/><br/>In terms of direction, this movie was executed well. Conscious decisions were made to have Italian dialogue not translated in certain scenes, allowing the audience really understand visually the scenes without giving it away. Most shots are very clean and the driving sections are well done to build tension while also not becoming boring.<br/><br/>The movie does throw a lot of you in terms of details, mentions of gearboxes, lift, brake roters, tire swaps, etc... all show that a proper gear head would enjoy the jargon. The Ford GT40 in general really shines here and takes center stage multiple times in the film. There is one particular scene where Damon's character take the car for a spin and you really do understand the absolute power behind the car and its eventual final designs that lead it to be successful.<br/><br/>At over 2.5 hours, this movie does not leave anything out and truly does tell the compelling story of the Americans at Le Mans. Overall the movie comes well recommend and is definitely worth a watch."
"christopherdunn","5","4","10","29 November 2019"," Making Faces
","Well, now I know that the way to succeed in racing is get by your rival and give him a dirty look. Great acting and this movie looks fantastic, let down by the script. And anyone who thinks Ferrari was the ""underdog"" really didn't follow racing in the 60s. Yeah, Ford outspent Ferrari, but money doesn't equal wins, or Ferrari would dominate F1 today."
"alexf-25-270614","7","4","10","25 November 2019"," A good movie, just not a great car movie
","Let me preface this by saying that I am quite a car guy. Not the type whose entire life revolves around cars, but I own a sports car and enjoy the odd track day. This means suspending my disbelief in a car movie is always a hard thing...<br/><br/>... but this movie certainly doesn't make it easy! For a car-movie aimed at car people, it was strange to find it packed with inaccuracies and car cliches. The idea that a car explodes whenever it rolls or makes contact with a hard object had finally died in most of Hollywood's mainstream products. Why bring it back in a car-movie?<br/><br/>Here are a few others:
-Ken's car seems to be so fast that he can catch up from with everybody whenever he decides to. Why isn't he winning in the first place?
-There's this cliche that racers can overtake each other in a straight line by deciding to press the throttle harder. Again, why aren't they already doing that?
-Brake fade and braking points obviously don't happen that way, and swapping out a knuckle assembly to cool the brakes is like buying a new phone because the home button is dead (oh wait...). Ford did come up with a quick brake-change solution (which almost every new car uses), but it looked nothing like this.
-the 7000rpm ramble present from the opening lines of the movie (and the movie's overall interpretation of RPM) is rather detached from reality. Different engine architectures behave differently at different RPMs, trying to pin that on a single value is strange and unneeded
-Sorry but car guys would never use ""her"" to refer to their automobile! It's not a ship!<br/><br/>With that out of the way, on to the movie stuff:
-the writing team tries very hard to make the story overly dramatic, by utilizing lazy writing tricks (the Daytona bet, for example), which really shouldn't be necessary considering how fascinating the base story already is
-Christian Bale is a very good actor, but he really overdoes the Ken Miles character. There is close to no footage of the actual guy, so he had the opportunity to build whatever character and mimics he felt like. Why he chose to go so incredibly over the top (both in accentuation and behavior) is beyond me
-There's a lot of CG going on during the races. Quite a lot. It is not badly executed, but was it really necessary? There are historic races at Le Mans they could have taken footage from rather than leave us in the uncanny valley<br/><br/>It's not all bad though. The story's a highly interesting one, and Matt Damon's performance is very good. His relationship with Ken Miles is touching, and having them compete against their own headquarters makes for a great double-sided challenge. And while the production's runtime is on the longer side of things, it never feels so.<br/><br/>To sum things up, it is a more than decent movie (hence the 7/10 rating), and probably does a great job at translating what car racing feels like to people who aren't into it or know little about it (my wife had a really good time and enjoyed the movie's constant suspense, as well as its visuals and performances, so it's got to be doing something right!). However, it's neither Oscar-Winning, nor even remotely accurate when it comes to car stuff."

","The thing I kept hearing about 'Ford v Ferrari' was that even if you're not into the car racing side of things there is enough other stuff going on to keep you entertained. I can confirm that was not correct information. This movie is two and half hours long and the entire thing is about motor sports. If you don't like motor sports, this film will not be to your liking. You can appreciate things about it like Matt Damon and Christian's Bale's fine acting, but overall this will likely not be a pleasant experience for you.<br/><br/>The film has been nominated for Best picture at the Academy Awards. I was a little surprised by that. I think it speaks more to a weaker year in terms of good films than anything else. This would easily be the worst of the nine nominated films and the least likely to win. It ticks none of the boxes required to compete for the win and is simply there as filler. If Bale had been nominated in an acting category I would have seen that as a more worthy nomination.<br/><br/>The biggest problem I had with the film is that we are asked to side with Ford. Ferrari are shown to be scumbags - the only problem is that Ford are as well. So why should we root for them? Simply because we are told to? That was incredibly poor writing and something that was hard to get past. If you are smart enough to realise that Ford aren't worth supporting then you are left with 150 minutes of film runtime about something you couldn't care less about. The ending was cheesy and out of character, the film was predictable and the tone was uneven and hard to settle in to. This is not a film I would recommend seeing unless you are a motor sport fanatic."

","Peacefully gazing into the dusk sky, racer savant Ken Miles, played by Christian Bale, lies on the race track next to his son Peter, played by innocently radiant Noah Jupe. Ken describes the experience of being one with his racing car: ""Everything slows down"". Ken says introspectively, ""You see everything."" That's the freedom and joy of doing what you love.<br/><br/>Director James Mangold's ""Ford v Ferrari"" tells the story of Ford Motor Company's challenge of Ferrari in the legendary 24-hours race at Le Mans in 1966. Matt Damon plays Carroll Shelby, the American car designer, who Henry Ford II, played by believable Tracy Letts, asks to engineer a car to beat Ferrari at Le Mans. Carroll's volatile friend and elite driver is Ken.<br/><br/>Carroll was the only American to ever win at Le Mans. But that was the glorious past. Presently, Carroll has a failing heart valve. His racing days are history. Now, he's the very successful businessmen, selling his designer cars to dudes, who don't appreciate his art, his love.<br/><br/>In the movie's opening narration, Carroll describes driving his car at 7000 rpms. He's in the zone. His epiphany, ""The only question that really matters: Who are you?"" As much as ""Ford v Ferrari"" is about the landmark automotive racing milestone, I was touched most by the story by Jez Butterworth, John-Henry Butterworth, and Jason Keller in its poignant look at what we love, what is that meaningful to us.<br/><br/>Christian Bale and Matt Damon have authentic screen brotherhood in the pursuit of their ideal, dedicating the best versions of themselves for what they truly love, that being racing. In the bigger picture of James's ""Ford V Ferrari"", 'racing' could be whatever is that meaningful to you. Christian and Matt give one of most their moving and humane performances. They're both Oscar worthy.<br/><br/>At the 'dog and pony show' for Ford's unveiling of their Mustang car, Matt's Carroll accepts Ford's job to engineer a car to win at Le Mans. Charismatic Matt recalls the wisdom of Carroll's Father, who advised to do what you love, then ""it's no longer a job"". Matt poignantly says, ""Find what you have to do..."" Amen.<br/><br/>Carroll sees the best in Christian's Ken. Ken is the 45 year-old World War II Hero, who's broke, and running his own automotive repair shop. His beautiful wife Mollie, played by strong compassionate Caitriona Balfe, is supportive of Ken, but so weary of working other jobs to keep the family afloat, including son Peter.<br/><br/>Although, not classically studied Ken is the engineering savant. He amazingly diagnoses the imperfection of any car by just driving it. Yet, he's the strident smartass, who is blunt in his assessments to everyone. That runs amok with superfluous Ford Executive VP Leo Beebe, played by slickly good Josh Lucas.<br/><br/>Predictably, Leo's egomania tests Carroll's loyalty to Ken, who might be the best race driver on Planet Earth. That might be the lone narrative downside. Also given this historical retelling, we kind of figure out how things go. Just saying.<br/><br/>Phedon Papmichael's cinematography mesmerizes. Phedon captures the visceral impact of speed and danger in every turn in the larger expanse. Still, I was moved in the close up of Christian's visage on the speeding straight away. The calm serenity. Ken gets who he is.<br/><br/>My favorite scene: Ken looks at the picture Peter drew of the racetrack. Christian's Ken meticulously describes what he has to do in each individual turn. Peter looks at his Dad in wonder. That's ""the perfect lap"". Peter asks, what if you can't race ""the perfect lap"". Ken smiles, ""You keep trying."" Because that's what you do for what you love. That's what makes ""Ford v Ferrari"" so very special too."

At this point we are less than 15 minutes into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.<br/><br/>Couple of comments: this is the latest film from director James Mansfield (The Wolverine; Logan). Here he brings to the screen the heated rivalry between two very different giants in the car industry: Ford and Ferrari. The movie starts promisingly, but pretty soon we are bogged down in all kinds of corporate background and infighting that play out for way too long. Honestly, the movie could've been trimmed by 20 to 25 minutes in the movie's first half, and would not have lost any of the movie's essence. Matt Damon en Christian Bale are terrific in the lead roles of Shelby and Miles. The actual racing sequences are entertaining and loud, very loud.<br/><br/>The movie opened wide the previous weekend, too great acclaim and box office success. I saw the movie in its second weekend of play, and the Sunday early evening screening where I saw this at was attended very nicely. Positive word of mouth will likely result in continued strong business in the weeks to come. If you have any interest in car racing, or are simply interested in a well-made and entertaining movie (even if a bit overly long for its own good), I readily suggest you check it out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD or Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion."
"oscaralbert","8","3","7","20 November 2019"," The film studio behind this flick does a great job . . .
",". . . in graphically documenting another sad chapter in the saga of America's Most Fiendish Family. Edsel's whelp (Hank #2) stands in as FORD V FERRARI's most hiss-worthy villain, as he viciously drives beloved World Racing Champ ""Ken"" to a premature, fiery death in a faulty Ford car. Perhaps it's a wise decision by the filmmakers to forego a prologue showing Hank #1's gun thugs patrolling the world's first auto assembly lines, with orders to shoot any workers who dare talk to each other. Maybe it would be beside the point to depict members of this Corrupt Corporate Fat Cat Family chilling with Der Fuhrer, and providing technical support for the latter's infamous Blitzkrieg. Possibly it would be too much of a tangent to incorporate references to Edsel's Revenge, when Hank One's favorite son was NOT given a starting spot by the Detroit Lions, prompting this petty grudge-bearing conniving clan to BUY the team with the intention of making it the focus of national derision forever. However, what FORD V FERRARI actually DOES put up on the screen should be enough to convince anyone (beyond the demonically-possessed ditto-head Pachyderm core supporters) NEVER to get behind the wheel of a fraudulent Ford!"

Cinematography, sound efects, visual efects and soundtracks made the experience so realistic. Christian Bale and Matt Damon are both GREAT actors and in this movie their performances are Oscar-nomination worthy ( especially Christian Bale ).

","Batman v Superman, Freddy vs. Jason and Kramer vs. Kramer, there's been plenty of battles of the heavyweights depicted before in Hollywood however, none of them have been as fast or as furious as Ford v Ferrari (or Le Mans '66 as titled here in the UK), an adrenaline fuelled race to be the best from director James Mangold.<br/><br/>American car designer Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) and driver Ken Miles (Christian Bale) battle against the corporation and themselves to build a revolutionary racing car for Ford to challenge Ferrari at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1966.<br/><br/>Le Mans '66 does what every great sports film should do in making you care about the characters first and foremost while the sport actually takes more of a backseat. The racing is, of course, rather prominent however, thanks to a great screenplay and James Mangold's direction, Le Mans '66 becomes a thoroughly entertaining ride of courage and determination that makes for such compelling viewing.<br/><br/>When the race sequences do come mind, they are as impressive as you can get, the ferocity of the competition really jumping off the screen, accompanied brilliantly by Marco Beltrami's pulsating score. It really is edge-of-your-seat thrills delivered at a blistering pace, the stunning visual effects and close proximity to all the racing action truly making this a cinematic experience to remember.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, Le Mans '66 features two great lead performances from Matt Damon and Christian Bale, both lighting up the screen whenever present, particularly when sharing a scene. Throw in some strong support from the likes of Jon Bernthal and Josh Lucas, and Le Mans '66 becomes an even better film with a great ensemble on board.<br/><br/>What makes Le Mans '66 work so well for me is that you don't have to be major racing enthusiast to find something to enjoy, James Mangold making an incredibly accessible film for all to enjoy. I found myself enjoying it as much as Ron Howard's Rush a few years back, which is not a bad thing, at all."

","ALMOST everything about this movie was so good. The acting, the dialogue, the sound design, the cars! It also just looks so beautiful. Whatever is shown on screen matches with the tone at all times, and the colours are gorgeous throughout. The sound track was also really good, especially during the race, and the race scenese had clutching my palms the entire time.<br/><br/>The thing is, though, the story is just so weak! To me, the ending is just super depressing without reason. A tragic ending like that should feel deserved, but it didn't. If the movie ended with Miles losing first place, it would been a bittersweet ending, but I felt like they had to just shove his death in there. (Why is there a major plot point in the falling action?) I usually get so emotional during movies, but I literally felt nothing here.<br/><br/>They changed the story so much already, couldn't they have just changed it a lil' more to make narrative sense? I really wanted to like it because I'm such a big fan of the actors, but the more I thought about the story, the less sense it made to me."
"movieman6-413-929510","8","4","11","16 November 2019"," Passionate people compete against business people to achieve the same end result.
","Le Mans '66 is a new sports biography directed by James Mangold, director of Logan and Walk the Line.<br/><br/>In the film, the American car designer Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) is asked by car company Ford if he wants to make a racing car for the company, so that they can participate in car racing so that they can also sponsor their company in this car world. Ford also hopes to be able to compete more with the Ferrari car company. They try to do this during the 24-hour Le Mans race. To have a good chance against Ferrari, they also have to find a suitable driver. Carroll proposes to ask British driver Ken Miles (Christian Bale) to race for Ford. Ken Miles has a passion for cars and racing, but is also somewhat rebellious. For example, he does not seem the right driver to promote Ford in a positive way with their brand and new racing cars. Shelby and his race crew see that Ken is the only one who has a real chance to successfully drive the Ford race car and a real chance to win the race. Shelby and his crew now have to decide to stay true to Ford's rules with another driver, or to keep the race with Ken Miles as a driver, so they have a chance to win the 24-hour Le Mans race.
For a true story, James Mangold knows how to tell the film in an interesting way. You also don't need to have any knowledge about car racing or the true events of Le Mans '66 to be able to follow and understand the story. You will receive the necessary information in the film. If you are familiar with all or a few of these things, there is more to enjoy in the film, because there are enough jokes and comical references in the film for the connoisseurs. The race scenes are also filmed as if you were in the car as a driver or passenger as a viewer. Thanks to the sound effects of the racing cars, it also feels as if you are actually watching a race or you are actually participating in the scenes in the car.<br/><br/>The film is not really about the battle between car companies Ford and Ferrari. This is part of the film, but the film is more about the fight that the car designer and racer have against the company's board members, which they must keep satisfied. This film shows so beautifully how people sometimes have to choose to continue to follow their passion and own thinking. Or that they neatly follow the rules of the company and the manager, even if they have to put aside their passion and their own ideas. Apart from the race, they also know how to create excitement in the film with the different choices that the characters face. As a viewer you usually do not know which choice is the best and which is ultimately taken by the characters. The film also shows how heavy people are who are slightly different from society due to poor health or a developmental disorder such as PTSD. Despite In the face of these handicaps, they still have to follow certain rules of society, which is not always easy for them.<br/><br/>The acting is also good and credible in the film. Christian Bale steals the film as Ken Miles a car and racing enthusiast, who looks with critical eyes at how others treat their cars or drive their racing. He knows how to share his critical opinion in comical ways with the other characters in the film. For this role he deserves to be nominated for various film prizes such as an Oscar. Matt Damon also does good acting as a car designer and later as the boss of a racing crew, trying to keep both the rebellious driver and the strict Ford board members happy. For this, he must choose one of the two, which often leads to conflicts. Although the two sometimes go against each other, they still have good chemistry thanks to their shared passion for cars and racing. The rest of the cast such as Josh Lucas, John Bernthal and Ray McKinnon also provide appropriate acting as members of the race crew or corporate management."

I can only say thank you, to the both of them, thank you very much!<br/><br/>The film Ford vs Ferrari was truly exciting from start to finish (line), and I loved every second of it. Just as other great racing films prior, like the classic Le Mans with Steve McQueen, and Days of Thunder with Tom Cruise, it brings out the best of automobile racing. These films all capture the essence of motor sports, each in their own way, showing what it takes to be a winner, including the dangers of speed that follows.<br/><br/>The film gets a perfect 10 in my book as I felt completely entertained throughout the whole film. I am not rating it on absolute historical accuracy, or total perfection when it comes to the art of filmmaking, but as an enthralling, riveting, really awesome, kick-ass movie for all to enjoy. It may be a bit much jargon for those with less interest in cars or racing, but stil, one hell of a flick!<br/><br/>R.I.P. Carroll Shelby and Ken Miles!"

","A film that centers around the two central characters and their two central performances: Matt Damon's Caroll Shelby and Christian Bale's Ken Miles. As such, these were the two performances that the entire film would rest on, fortunately, Matt Damon and Christian Bale both give wonderful performances in this biopic. Ford v ferrari had these brilliant performances as well as an interesting story that is at its core about two men who are fighting for their passion being warped into the 'dick measuring contest' between two large corporate car manufacturers.
As such, the film is brilliantly titled as to reflect the fact that at the end, the story that is recorded will always be the competition between Ford and Ferrari, overlooking the true heroes of the story, Ken Miles and Caroll Shelby. Ford v Ferrari does a great job introducing audiences who may not be familiar with the subject into the world of cars, not over explaining but, simplifying and focusing on what is important making is a very easy viewing. Overall, Ford v ferrari had two memorable performances and was an emotional and insightful ride into the story of these two men."
"masonfisk","10","2","4","10 December 2019"," A CAR RACE FOR THE AGES...!
","James Mangold's (Logan/3:10 to Yuma remake) latest is a fun tale of the rivalry between the Ford car company & Ferrari on who's vehicle would win the infamous 24 hour LeMans race back in the 1960's. Ford enlisted Carrol Shelby, played by Matt Damon, to solve their dilemma which in turn caused Shelby to recruit his best friend/enemy Ken Myles (returning Yuma star Christian Bale) as his driver. Both mavericks in their own fields, Shelby the car maker/seller & Myles the perfectionist racer used their combined talents (& embattled histories) to take on the illustrious task of dethroning the mighty Italian carmaker (who at that point in history made beautiful cars but was in debt). Easy job, you think? You'd be wrong since Ford's underlings & marketing gurus may have had the right ideas on how to make a car look pretty (the '64 launch of their immortal Mustang is featured) but their know how on what made a engine tick properly was lost on them which fuels the constant fire between Ford & Shelby who wanted final say so on the men to race their cars (Miles was pegged as a problematic lone wolf) while Shelby knew he had the right man for the job. Never taking the Cliffs' notes approach to the material but savvy enough to make the car jargon fun & inclusive, this film fires on every cylinder (forgive my car punniage!) staying entertaining & even riveting when we know from history who wins the race. All the actors are in fine mettle including Jon Bernthal, Josh Lucas, Ray McKinnon, Caitriona Balfe (from Starz's Outlander) & a special mention to Tracy Letts (playwright of Osage County) for his hilarious portrayal of Henry Ford II."

Using 2 drivers, they race for 24 hours rain or shine. Obviously, the drivers are very important, but the building of an ultra high performance car that is driven 100% flat-out for 24 hours is the engineering challenge.<br/><br/>The movie also tells the fascinating story between Ford and Shelby.

Clearly, the Shelby name means something to people looking for performance.<br/><br/>About 60% of the movie is amazing car racing footage. Having said that, one of the most impressive scenes to me is when Shelby gives Henry Ford II a ride in the Ford GT. Fords reaction, is incredible, and an amazing piece of acting. You might look at Henry Ford II as a stuffy Business Man, but deep down inside he is still a ""Car Guy"" and he was blown away with the extreme performance of a 220 mph car.<br/><br/>I consider myself a movie buff, I have over 3000 DVDs and Blu-ray's in my collection. I ONLY watch a movie one of two ways. In a movie theater or on a disc from my collection. I never stream. Most of my movies are from the 1930s to 1950s. But, Ford v Ferrari is nothing less than a masterpiece. If it was your job to edit out the boring parts from this movie, you could only eliminate 30 seconds, maximum.<br/><br/>A movie like this is best seen on the big screen, the really big screen."

","+Great story telling
+Fantastic cast and performances
+Not a car fan but loved the drama and suspense<br/><br/>-Not entirely factual but does lend itself to be explored outside of the film"
"Jeremy_Urquhart","7","2","4","1 December 2019"," Long but mostly engaging, even to non-car fans
","I'll come right out and say that cars are one of the least interesting things in the world to me (perhaps only behind The Royal Family, fashion, and reality TV). If a car has four wheels, starts, and can maintain the speed limit: I'm happy. So it's unlikely I would have gone out of my way to see a movie so heavily focused on making and racing cars had it not been for the cast, the solid track record of director James Mangold, and the positive reviews.<br/><br/>On the topic of those reviews- I'm not as enamoured with the movie as many seem to be, but I find this movie relatively easy to recommend to anyone who's willing to give this movie 2.5 hours of their life. This running length is mostly justified- it's a fairly large story but I feel it could've ideally been 20-30 minutes shorter, and for all the hubbub The Irishman has been stirring lately because of its epic length... I feel like that one justified its running time more.<br/><br/>So the length and the subject matter weren't ideal for me, but highlights did include Bale's performance (wasn't he hugely overweight less than a year ago for Vice? This guy's commitment to the physicality of the roles he plays is INSANE), the racing scenes (they're tense as all hell, especially if you're like me and don't know the actual history of the events depicted), and the sound design. This movie has a really good chance of sweeping the technical awards at this year's Oscars, the same way movies like Gravity and Mad Max: Fury Road have done recently.<br/><br/>Give it a watch I'd say, even if you're not a car nut. If you have a great home theatre and sound setup it's not a must watch at the cinema, but if not, it's a good one to see on the big screen."

"pswanson00","10","2","4","17 November 2019"," My opinion: Motorhead necessity
","I've had a mild obsession with the GT40 since I got to see the winning car up close in 1966, just a few days after the race, so I am not an impartial viewer. Giving such a movie 10 stars may seem excessive, but for this type of film I think it's perfect. The characters, both central and peripheral, are performed perfectly, and the film includes the best in-car race footage since Grand Prix. Side note: the sound systems in modern theaters have often caused me enough discomfort to cause me to put in ear plugs, but the sound of a full-race 427 at high rpm didn't bother me at all."

"rgkarim","9","2","4","16 November 2019"," Gas Up And Get Set To Check Out This Rivalry
","When it comes to cars we like them fast and furious, or at least for many that is the dream as handling the monster speed can be overwhelming. So that's where racing comes in, a means to extend one's self into the faceless visage of a Nascar or Formula One in hopes of seeing their heroes win. Yet, what goes into a racecar? For the die-hard fans and car enthusiasts they understand the mechanics behind it, but for fans like me, well there is a lot more under the hood of the vent. Today's movie is all about the battlefield of racing, though perhaps more of a look into the window of the past in the international racing venue. Tonight we look at the rivalry between two big car empires, in their battle for supremacy as I review:<br/><br/>Movie: Ford Vs. Ferrari (2019)<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>LIKES:<br/><br/>Surprisingly Decent Pace
Funny
Plenty Of Character Integration
Seeing the Rivalry From Many Sides
The Technical Jargon Mixed Well
The Musical Score
The Sound Effects
The Heart
The Finale Of Racing<br/><br/>DISLIKES:<br/><br/>The Predictability
Loudness
The Drama Vs. Reality
A Little More Integration Of The Wife
The Ending After The Race<br/><br/>SUMMARY:<br/><br/>Biography dramas usually don't run at a pace that entertains me fully, but Ford Vs. Ferrari succeeded in this endeavor and put the pedal to the medal in storytelling. The elements of describing the business deals, politics and even development of the car are all a carefully blended together to be engaging without being overbearing for this reviewer. It finds a way to make all this business jargon funny, putting just enough spite, attitude, and stubbornness to work and masterfully relieving the dialog heavy plot. What impressed me even more though was seeing the character integration into this film, finding ways to make characters I care about and how I hoped the policies would not shoot them in the foot, which is key to helping me stay invested in a drama. Bale in particular was my focal point, his character having the most lines cast out and the central engine that drove this car. He plays the part well, adds that charm he brings to many of his roles, and then melds with the rest of the teams. Throw in all the dialogue filled with the jargon and you had me feeling like I was part of each group in the decision to battle the big boys.
However, despite all the heart of the film, most fans are going to want to know how the special effects department works in this film. Good news, for America's love of making things loud, bold, and powerful continues on this look back into the past. For guys like me, the musical score at times amps up the elements with its background noise augmenting the scene and making my skin goosebumps rise in that emotional way. Now add the layer of the sound editing and effects and you get the major effect of this movie. Those who love to listen to their engines roar as they fly down the street, or identify the clicks of the perfect transition to the next gear are going to love this movie. All those elements brought together with the theater sound drop you into the driver seat and gets the blood pumping. Finally, combine that with the visuals and you've got yourself a movie that somehow takes what many consider a dry sport of turning left and instead give you the dynamic element of being in this life or death thrall. When combined with the story, it's magic and gives a purpose to remain entertaining, which can be very difficult in a racing movie without gimmicks (comedy of the Love bug or action of the Fast and Furious).<br/><br/>Despite the realistic nature of this film though, it still has some elements I would have liked to see curbed. One, the predictability of the film is still there from the foreshadowing alone, though if you know the history of this movie's plot you'll of course predict the ending (which I didn't). Despite the appreciation for the special effects, yours truly has sensitive ears, so the full volume of the engine roaring can be a little painful/ingratiating if not careful. These minor components aside, the movie's constant question of drama vs reality comes into question, and I feel there was a lot of magic integrated into the film compared to the reality. It adds entertainment, but I wonder just how much of this was true to paint the characters a little more notably, more so Matt Damon's character or the arrogant vice president. In terms of further character integration, I would have liked a little more of the wife, who though was involved throughout the film, felt there was a little more she could have had in here to really pull the film to full circle. My biggest dislike though was the last twenty minutes of the film, which I will not spoil. The film had another point that I felt would have been better to end, and while I understand why they did the last part in terms of closure, the last 15-20 minutes could have been edited down where I think the true story ended, wrapped up with a nice information card montage they do. It's times like these where the last piece is placed that sometimes throw me the wrong way, but I will of course recognize the honor and work they did do in those final moments.<br/><br/>The VERDICT:<br/><br/>Overall, Ford Vs. Ferrari delivered what I expected and more. It was a drama/biography that was not boring to watch, with a pace that like the car continued to work and immersed you into many aspects of the war between these two. A fantastic balance of story with technical prowess is going to be the entertaining factor for much of the audience and looking at the people around me during my showing should impress the target audience. Sure, it's predictable, a little time bloated, and loud, but the only factors are potentially the movie magic blowing things out of proportion and the potential ending that really had me bugging. Otherwise, outside of not being the most original idea or the most dynamic telling of a story it works for a trip to the theater.<br/><br/>My scores are:<br/><br/>Drama/Biography/Sports: 8.5
Movie Overall: 7.0"

","This was brilliant. Watched with the wife last night, was rare to find a film that we both agreed was good. Great performances from Bale and Damon, although I was a bit distracted trying to place Bale's accent to begin with but a quick Wikipedia search did away with that (Brummie). The racing scenes are incredible, it feels like you're there, the tension is amazing. As a lifelong racing fan loved seeing a film get the driving so right. It's a simple story but sometimes that's all you need, and even though I knew how it ends, the film somehow made me forget. Good to see a female character in a film like this being as in to the racing as the men and not just the worrying wife at home. There's some genuine laughs too. If I had any complaints it would be that it was a bit too Hollywood, but that's a small gripe. Really enjoyed."

"Special-K88","Null","0","0","13 May 2020"," a great showing with moments of pure thrill
","Supercharged sports drama based on the true story of retired American racer-turned-entrepreneur Carroll Shelby and fearless, confrontational British driver and mechanic Ken Miles who are employed by Henry Ford II and tasked with ""going to war"" against auto magnate Enzo Ferrari, who in the 1960s refuses to concede his position as the dominant manufacturer with the 24 Hours of Le Mans fast approaching. Fittingly, the relationship between Shelby and Miles escalates through a series of masterfully shot, white-knuckled racing scenes. With the duo of Damon and Bale you get fire and ice, and director Mangold's staging of the high-octane competition is remarkably good, but this is also a very personal story that explores the behind-the-scenes world of motorsports in ways you wouldn't quite expect. The length of the picture makes it hard to maintain a consistent level of adrenaline-pumping excitement, but it's quite a ride nonetheless, and as an added bonus gives the talented Damon another opportunity to employ a Texas drawl, and the inimitable Bale to once again be transformative onscreen. ***"
"DeBBss","9","0","0","12 May 2020"," Finally! A Great Car Movie
","It has been a long since we got a car movie, let alone a good car movie. Watching Ford V Ferrari is a blast for car enthusiasts. You can tell the screenwriters knew everything about a car's anatomy, which I appreciate, as it really immerses you into the story. Everything in Ford V Ferrari is flawless, the acting, the cinematography, the tension, and the screenplay. It's entertaining and emotional, it has the best of both worlds.<br/><br/>The script was written extremely well; it pulls you into the story and you become emotionally attached to the characters. You feel uncertain every time Ken Miles races because racing is so unpredictable, and you don't want anything to happen to Ken because Ken was developed so greatly as a character. Although Ford V Ferrari is a very long movie, it's never boring because the pacing is great and you know exactly where the story is taking you. The story is constantly building up, so the final race is insanely intense. Another thing I like about the script is how the antagonist isn't Ferrari, but Leo Beebe, a Ford corporate. This makes the movie have a constant rivalry between the protagonist and antagonist; it also makes Ford V Ferrari more original.<br/><br/>The acting was solid all around. Christian Bale's performance was amazing; he makes Ken Miles so relatable, and when Ken Miles eventually dies, it's heart wrenching because you know it's coming. The delivery of the lines by Christian Bale just sells the character, and he delivers the line like a real person would in such a competitive atmosphere. All the characters were written with actual thought put into them. That's why the rivalry between Beebe and Miles is so authentic; they think differently although they're on the same side. I like how a lot of the runtime is spent with Miles' family, making you more emotionally attached to Ken and his family.<br/><br/>The sound editing was top notch. You hear the engine, the gears switch, the tires screech, and the brakes clenching. It's mixed together so well and it makes the experience way more realistic. It's so satisfying hearing everything work together so perfectly. The cinematography is beautiful, and it highlights the beauty of the cars and the landscapes that surround the vehicles. What's so crucial to making a film feel like it's in a specific time period is the color palette and atmosphere. Ford V Ferrari captures the atmosphere of the 60's perfectly, and it gives you the nostalgia of it's time period, even if you weren't around during the 60's.<br/><br/>Overall, Ford V Ferrari was fantastic, and it will go down as one of the best racing movies of all time for me. I loved every bit of it, it's a true homage to the sport and people who risk their lives to be the best. Ford V Ferrari is a must watch for car enthusiasts, and even though some people don't care about cars, Ford V Ferrari can still entertain you by the tension and great storytelling."
"tomfeller","9","0","0","9 May 2020"," Historical movie about the Le Mans race of 1966
","I am old enough to remember back in 1966 when a Ford car won the 24 Hours of Le Mans car race. Henry Ford II (Tracy Letts) had gotten into car racing as part of the company's marketing effort for the Mustang, and Le Mans was considered the ultimate race because the cars were going as fast as 200 miles per hour over a 24 hour period. It took place not on a racetrack but on regular country roads. Ford engages sports car designer and former Le Mans winner Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon), who once drove for Aston-Martin, to build them a car capable of winning the race. Shelby had retired from racing because of a heart condition, so he recruits English car racer Ken Miles (Christian Bale) to be the principal driver of the car, called the GT40. The film is very entertaining, the period details seemed right, and the car race scenes are excellent. It was the Oscar winner in the film editing and sound editing categories and nominated for sound mixing.
The dominant racing car up to that time was Ferrari, and the rivalry between Ford and Enzo Ferrari (Remo Girone) became personal after the latter rudely rejected Ford's merger proposal. Other conflicts are between Shelby and Miles, who are old frenemies, and between the two of them and the top management at Ford, especially Josh Lucas as senior VP Leo Beebe. Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal), then vice-president of marketing, does his best to mediate. Damon and Bale are good, but Caitrioni Balfe as Miles's wife Molly is large wasted. Letts turns in the best performance in the film as Ford trying to live up to his grandfather's legacy."

","""Ford v Ferrari"", based on the 2009 book ""Go Like Hell: Ford, Ferrari and Their Battle for Speed and Glory at Le Mans"", is adrenaline-fueled entertainment, not just for a for racing fans but non-racing fans too. What makes this movie so great are the performances of all the cast, but especially M. Demon and C. Bale - who gives a rock-solid performance that shows the intensity and determination of his character. Damon as - a quite memorable character too, is superb as - 'Caroll Shelby' as he fights for what he believes. But actually, what really makes this film even better is the chemistry that Demon and Bale create together. It feels like they've been friends for life. If the film has a fault, it's that it stops short of showing us what exactly drives both men. The racing scenes are superbly realized, kinetic and thrilling, although there's often a little too much fast-cutting pedal-shots.

","Motor racing films always ooze swagger. I hate motor sport, but the films a la baseball always deliver. James Mangold has a good back catalogue, and i feel he has a decent stab at this.<br/><br/>Le Mans '66 is an exploration of this odd-couple relationship, fascinated with ideas of masculinity. And if you can get past Bale's odd 'Brummie' accent it mostly works. The spectre of death lingers in every frame. The racing scenes are anxiety-inducing, with the camera keeping low to the ground bringing smashed-up cars careening into view.<br/><br/>Yet the film's greatest trick is saved for the final reel. For much of its running time, you're fooled into thinking Mangold had made a grand sporting ode to the American dream. And then the rug is pulled right out from underneath your feet. Le Mans '66 may revel in the high life, but its finale feels devastatingly hollow."

But it speaks to an ideal that many of us remember: when the U.S. created quality automobiles, when many people had work, and when being competitive in areas of production was important. It's pre-NASCAR, and driving LeMans is a different type of racing."

The storyline involving Miles's family was also executed very well and helped in further developing his character. The hard work done by Miles, Shelby and their team, in order to win the race at Le Mans as well as the constant interferences from the executives, form the central narrative of the movie. The movie portrays the contrasting perspectives of both these sides quite well. The racing sequences were directed magnificently by Mangold and keeps you at the edge of your seats.

"Heisenberg999","8","3","8","19 November 2019"," This film is the definition of fun experience
","From the director of ""Logan"", ""Walk the Line"" and ""Identity"" comes a true story about Ford's attempt to take Ferrari from the throne of Le Mans.
This film is an embodiment of a careless and fun experience. Because of the perfect pacing, the film manages to keep you engaged and entertained for 2 and a half hours.
This film could be separated into two sections. The first one is a preparation for the minor races and the big finale. The second section would be racing itself. The first two acts are about the relationship between Damon's and Bale's characters. Although, it's not anything new or spectacular, their relationship was very well executed and you could've believed that they were good friends. They didn't show that at all times, but you could feel it because of the tight script which elevated both of their characters. Besides their relationship, the film focuses a lot on a behind the scene conflicts in a Ford company. Yet again, because of the script that ended up being very interesting. The rest of the film focuses on a racing, and I was actually surprised by how much runtime racing took. The grand finale takes almost a whole third act, and because of the way it was filmed, you don't even notice that. When the film gives you the opportunity to immerse yourself into a racing contest, it doesn't let go of you. That brings us to the best part of the film, and that was the way it was filmed, and also the whole production design. It's impressive that they managed to almost completely avoid the usage of CGI. Instead, they shoot the racing sequences in the cars whilst driving. When you're shooting that in a practical way, it's easier to get the audience invested. You notice appealing camera angles, immersive sound design, production design and all the details that went into designing this film. One of the reasons why did they choose that approach is James Mangold, who is the creator of that idea. He had a vision and he accomplished to achieve it. He's slowly becoming one of the most versatile directors working today. He touched almost every genre there is, and yet, he did not make a terrible film so far. Besides his visual decisions, he managed to pull out incredible performances from the whole cast. Matt Damon and Christian Bale were incredible. Damon in a bit subtle role and Bale in a showier role, both of them delivered. It's a shame that both of them are being campaigned for a leading category at the Oscars, so they are probably going to cancel each other's votes, but nonetheless, they were at the top of their game. Besides them, I would like to compliment Jon Bernthal, who in his short time on the screen put a damn good performance.<br/><br/>This film is definitely one of the better technical achievements of this year. If you're interested in seeing this film, check it out whilst it's still in cinemas. Watching it in cinemas certainly elevates the experience, and it emphasizes the huge amount of attention to details."

My wife loved it, but she does drive a 429 hp AMG E53 cabriolet, so she's definitely an honorary car guy.<br/><br/>See it in a good theater with a full sized screen and top sound so you can experience the amazing race cinematography and feel the roaring engines in your chest.<br/><br/>Christian Bale gives one of his his best Oscar worthy career performance as Ken Miles, from a long list of career Oscar quality performances in movies like Vice, The Big Short, The Fighter, and American Hustle.<br/><br/>A must see future iconic movie right up there with James Garner's Grand Prix and Steve McQueen's LeMans.<br/><br/>Now, every time I get into my 2009 911 C4S, I want to wind it out in second gear to over 7000 rpm's just to hear the engine scream."

","Ford vs. Ferrari is a retelling of the Ford company's attempts to compete with Ferrari in building racing cars and win the Le Mans race and the designer and driver behind getting the tasks done. This is just a really well put together, well written movie that looks at the passion for something in contrast with the constraints of the business world.<br/><br/>The direction on this is tight. It looks nice and the pacing is pretty smooth for a two-and-a-half hour movie. Director James Mangold (Logan, Walk the Line) really knows how to make scenes visually interesting, throwing in little stuff. Though there isn't really that much racing in this, the race at Le Mans really pays off your expectations.<br/><br/>Matt Damon and Christian Bale are the leads in this, the former being the guy who tries to work within the system and the latter being the guy who can't. Matt Damon gives a fine performance, but it's Bale who steals every scene he's in. The famously versatile actor completely sells the character of driver Ken Miles, both brash but charismatic. I'll be very surprised if he doesn't get an Oscar nomination. To be honest, the casting even to the smallest characters is pretty darn good. Props should be given to Tracy Letts as tough, intimidating boss Henry Ford II.<br/><br/>The only weak spot I found, and it's more of a knitpick, is that they could've cut down on the scenes of Miles interacting with his family. It's good stuff, but it can be a little repetitive.<br/><br/>Overall, I highly recommend this."

","There are movies that give you 100% of what you expected and there are movies which exceed expectations in every way possible and blow your mind away. Documenting the le Mans race of '66, this team has delivered a vintage classic that is as classy as a scotch straight out of the cask after maturing for decades!<br/><br/>Set up in the 60's, the Ford Motor Company is in pursuit of a new design that will take them back to the glory days. Henry Ford II (Tracy Letts) gets a path-breaking idea from his marketing team to design a Race Car, like the legendary Ferrari. After failing in an attempt to buy out Ferrari which is broke, Ford decides to build a race car on its own and commissions Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) for the job. Shelby takes the help of Ken Miles (Christian Bale), a hot-tempered British racer who is struggling to make both ends meet. While Miles's addition to the team adds tremendous improvement to the design, the Marketing Head Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas) wants him out of the team. How Shelby and Miles manage to achieve the American dream of winning against a Ferrari at le Mans is the remaining plot.<br/><br/>What fascinates the audience is that the movie starts like a documentary and picks up pace in no time to make everyone watch it literally at 7000rpm. Whether a person is into cars or not, the detailing given to every aspect of a race car and how it is tested and done is prone to give a 'car-gasm'. Christian Bale and Matt Damon will definitely be serious contenders for the Oscars along with Leonardo Di Caprio, Brad Pitt and Joaquin Phoenix this year. Their transformation into the role is top class. Another noteworthy character is Josh Lucas portraying Leo Beebe. While he is pure evil as a personality, he is a pure genius at what he does and how he gets it done. Thank God for this is just not a 1hr30mins affair. The movie runs for a good 2hrs32mins and it was still not enough.<br/><br/>Pure Gold!!!"

"arrowsplit","4","3","9","17 February 2020"," Suspicious About The Authenticity Of The High Ratings
","First of all, you expect a conflict between the two adversaries mentioned in the versus that happens to be the movie's title, right? Nope...Wrong. This movie is all about Ford and the struggle of creating GT40. All the conflict and drama awaits you in the Ford section. Ferrari name is like a clickbait in lame internet portals: ""You won't believe what Enzo Ferrari said when Henry Ford tried to buy Ferrari"" :P<br/><br/>We literally see almost nothing from the Ferrari side. Well, I don't blame them for this cheap hoax because firstly I know from my very own experience that no one grew up with dreams of owning a Ford. We dreamed of Ferrari. Far fewer people would watch this movie if only the Ford name was mentioned in the title.<br/><br/>Leaving this ""title nonsense"" behind, I can confidently say that two of my favorite actors Damon and Bale have both presented decent but slightly poor performance compared to their average. Plot is weak and painfully predictible even if you haven't heard of a machine called ""car"" before. In addition to that, unnecessary length gave me this crazy idea that if I would cut this movie into 3 second long pieces and reunite them in the order of 1-3-5-7 and 2-4-6-8, I would probably have 2 half length, almost identical movies without losing full version's essence. That would be my director's cut I guess. Long story short, you won't miss much if you don't watch it but if you like this specific genre, it wouldn't hurt to spare 2,5 hours of your time.

"Horst_In_Translation","6","3","9","21 November 2019"," A must-see if you are interested in racing (history)
","""Ford v Ferrari"" is a new American/French co-production that is mostly in the English language and this could be one of the big players this award season. The director is James Mangold and with ""Walk the Line"" being a personal favorite (also because of the subject) and ""Logan"" that I also really enjoyed, I was definitely looking forward to his newest project. Mangold was not part of the writing team here this time, but it was nonetheless three people, namely the Butterworth Brothers and Jason Keller. But while none of them are rookies amymore, the only really experienced one here is the older Butterworth. Still looking at the film's massive running time of 2.5 hours, slightly over even, it is not too surprising that there are three writers credited. Must have been a really long script. Now as for the cast, it is basically two names only: Oscar winners Christian Bale and Matt Damon. There are experienced supporting actors in here too and you will maybe recognize their faces such as Bernthal, McKinnon or Letts (plus surprisingly familiar faces from NCIS and Prettly Little Liars in minor roles), but nobody comes remotely close to the star potential of the two in the lead. But they are both Team Ford here and not one of them Ferrari as you could have guessed from the title. Now this is major car racing movie, perhaps the biggest since Rush from over half a decade ago and if you liked that one, then probably you will like this one here as well. However, we are not inside Formula One this time, but instead the focus is on a competitive racing occasion mostly that is probably more famous in the United States and less famous here in Germany. I am talking about Le Mans or (if you want the long version) the 24 Hours of Le Mans, even if there are references to other races too like the one Bale's character needs to win in order to be allowed into Le Mans by Mr. Ford.<br/><br/>So the movie is packed with racing references. However, there are other subjects too like family life, company policies and also the fact that riding sports cars will always be linked very closely to danger, maybe life-threatening danger even. Well certainly the latter. Even today, it is a dangerous sport and back then, it was even more the case. There is that memorable reference on several occasions that as long as you are getting out of the car you are fine. Otherwise... But lets not include further spoilers. Let me just say that the film of course stayed close to reality, so they had to include these developments at the end and certain other parts as well, even if a lot in here was fictitious and added for drama purposes. Which is okay. I knew I was not watching a documentary. For example, while Leo Beebe is not fictitious, but also based on a real person, I genuinely wonder how much about him in here was actually exactly like they showed it. If I was from his family, I probably would not be too happy about the way they depicted things. Aside from that, I thought it was slightly shallow and not too inspired how they depicted him as the antagonist, also with his sucking-up to Mr. Ford for example. The idea behind how he manages to ""steal"" Bale's character his glory was good though and nice not to have a really happy ending. Now let me also add a few words on the two central characters. As for acting and depth, it is really all about Bale, much more than about Damon. We do not even find out about Damon's family backgrounds and really the only thing we do find out about his background is very early on that he was a successful driver as well, but had to end his career because of health concerns and went into engineering then. And all his baitier scenes are basically also empowered by other characters like the carte blanche moment. It's not a too well-written character and I don't think Damon will get a lot of awards recognition here. If any at all. As for Bale, he may get more because he definitely has the better material and there is no denying he is also the more gifted actor. However, he is as always walking the fine line between really going all in and creating something great and going over-the-top and maybe for his character here he tried to make him too special. But maybe it was just my perception. Or the writing. For example when they are telling the guy about how it is not against the rules to change the brakes, it was a bit painful to watch how Bale was acting in that scene. But he has good moments too no denying and I don't think many actors would have played the part better. Still I did not find him (or Damon's character) as likable as they wanted me to. So all in all, I enjoyed the watch here. The film does not get close to Mangold's (what I mentioned early on), Bale's or Damon's best, but this is just because their best is so amazing and not because this one here would be bad or anything. On the contrary. It is fairly decent and felt shorter than 150 minutes. I give this film a thumbs-up, albeit not a 100% enthusiastic one. Go watch if you like the subject or either of the two lead actors or both would be even better. I am writing this as somebody who does not care too much about racing anymore and never cared about Le Mans, so you definitely don't have to in order to appreciate this film. It has from beginning to end some really nice attention to detail (just wanna mention one scene near the end when Mr. Ferrari briefly pays his respect to Bale's character and there are many other scenes, also slight fun moments like the stopwatch etc.) that makes it certainly worth checking out. Go for it."

","I hate car racing but this long movie - nearly 3 hours - held me fixed to the screen. Superb acting, astounding cinematography and a great story made it worth every cent.<br/><br/>And the cars; this was a time when cars were not seen as being evil as climate alarmists tell us but both works of art and amazing bits of machinery. But the real essence of this story were the men who built and raced the cars.<br/><br/>I recently wrote a review for the reboot of Charlie's Angels which was filled with snowflake issues and PC writing. A fun franchise had been ruined. Ford v Ferrari however demonstrates that Hollywood can still put out a great movie which hasn't been ruined by woke points of view. There were no little girls competing with the men in this incredibly tough occupation and boy did the movie benefit from that. Carroll Shelby, played by Damon and Bale as Ken Miles, both legends of racing and cars were spot on in a masterfully directed bit of recent history. Having said that Catriona Balfe was superb as Bale's wife.<br/><br/>One of the year's best."
"afinelzi","8","3","9","16 November 2019"," Shelby and Miles
","I only know a little about cars and I effing love it! Ford v Ferrari is a movie that non race cars fans can experience such thrilling historical moments and I'm sure they'll enjoy it.<br/><br/>I heard that this American sports drama was adapted from a memoir called The Carroll Shelby Story which was published in 1967 by Pocket Books. The memoir describes his days as a race car driver, the challenges, the victories, and the crashes--the worst of which he describes as an ""explosion."" The memoir also discusses the genesis for the revolutionary car he created, the Shelby Cobra. In Chapter 21, Shelby describes his life changing win at Le Mans in 1966 with driver Ken Miles against rival car manufacturer, Ferrari. (Anyway, this passage contains a little bit of spoiler, although in fact, it's not. It's merely a flash info I got from <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carroll_Shelby"">wikipedia</a> right after I got out of the cinema and mesmerized).<br/><br/>I like the idea of how Shelby and Miles are really the heroes of the story. Their relationship in the movie is spot on, portrayed really good by James Mangold and his team. My only complaint about this film is that, unfortunately, their in-depth story (relationship and adventure) wasn't dug deeper. We get to see the huge intrigue between two corporations. But that doesn't ruin the whole story. This drama is based on true event of an unsung hero. I didn't know all the true story until I watched this epic biopic the other night. I'm happy that I learned something from this movie. Even Matt Damon himself--in one of his interviews along with Christian Bale--didn't know the real story till he read the script. The way I see it, this film's not about winning or losing; this is all about ""achieving the goal"". I'm so impressed. It's totally worth to watch. No, it's actually a highly recommended film of 2019. Go ahead and see it in imax for better experience!"

The adr was super noticeable and terribly implemented.<br/><br/>Watch this if you are into racing or this story in particular, but for me it felt like a futile attempt at sweeping the Oscars."

","I watched the documentary and read up about the Le Mans race in 65-66 that happened when Ford beat Enzo and Ferrari in the 24 hour race. So with that in mind I knew the story well enough to notice they left some things out and added some drama to move the story along. I enjoyed seeing Christian bale and Matt Damon on the screen together. Wasn't sure it was going to work but hey they got it too. Overall I'd recommend reading and watching some more stuff on the actual event. This movie doesn't do the story justice... but definitely a fun movie, slow at parts but amazing to see the story of how Ford rose to greatness (well kinda) in a time when cars needed to change. Worth a watch for car finatics or history buffs!"

The company was in need of some good PR in order to restore it's reputation. As with all fact based movies you are always left wondering which parts are true and which are artistic license.<br/><br/>The movie tells the story of how the Ford team try to beat the all powerful Ferrari team. Matt Damon plays Carroll Shelby who heads up the team. His friend and lead driver is the rather unlikable Ken Miles played by Christian Bale.

"gavinp9","8","2","5","20 November 2019"," Well-made and enjoyable racing biopic
","'Ford v Ferrari' - underwhelming title, but exceptionally put-together sports biopic about the 24-hour endurance Le Mans motor race in 1966. If that puts you off, the good news is that the film's not all about racing - probably only ~30% - with much of the focus on Shelby (Damon), Miles (Bale) and Miles' wife, Mollie (Balfe) and son, Peter (Jupe). There's also the tension with Ferrari, where Ford executives Iacocca (Bernthal), Beebe (Lucas) and Ford (Letts) are trying to take the racing crown from Ferrari (Girone) and Agnelli (Cirfiera)<br/><br/>It's nice to hear Bale using his actual English accent and the rapport he has with Damon carries the film. All the actors are good, but their relationship is what has you caring about what happens, rather than just the cars. The pacing is quick and it feels faster (pardon the pun) than 2.5 hours. This would be as good as, if not better than, 'Rush' and 'Senna'.<br/><br/>Great directing from Mangold (coming off 'Logan') throughout, with a nice balance of family time, racing scenes and the car politics. The fact the 24-hour race is condensed to less than 20min and feels both quick and like it's been a marathon is a true feat. If you don't know the story, don't Google it and let the ending be a surprise. There's good editing, cinematography, authentic 60s cars and soundtrack throughout."

"gcsman","7","2","5","17 November 2019"," A fun outing, solid throughout
","Just back from the theater after seeing Ford vs. Ferrari and it's totally enjoyable. It never dragged and never really felt rushed either. Matt Damon and Christian Bale are two of the most watchable moviestars we have on hand these days, and their interaction can easily be seen as the bedrock of the movie.<br/><br/>The racing scenes? We get pretty well all you could wish from the famous 1966 races at Daytona and LeMans where the Ford GT Mk II made its mark in racing history. I think in screen time they add up to almost an hour's worth of the 2:32 runtime of the movie, and they're filmed as well as (or better than) any other racing movie I can think of. Full disclosure here though: I personally think auto racing is obscene most of all because of its flagrant waste of fossil fuels, and anyone who argues that it's responsible for all kinds of auto design improvements is just blowing smoke. If and when this whole sport dies its inevitable death, good riddance.<br/><br/>But OK, this is a movie review -- how about the cast? Matt Damon is just fine as always. He doesn't exactly have ""range"" -- he just plays himself in any movie (like Tom Cruise) -- but that's just fine. I have no idea if Carrol Shelby is really like that, but Damon is so comfortable and engaging in whatever he does that it always works. Christian Bale is much more of a technician, a method actor, and I'm sure he worked hard to nail the eccentric Ken Miles, the race driver and engineer/mechanic who values the pure experience of the business on absolute terms. It's fascinating to see him work.<br/><br/>Two or three of the minor parts stand out. Catriona Balfe (best known for ""Outlander"") plays Miles' wife and gives her some depth -- much more than just a placeholder. And Tracy Letts (as Henry Ford II), Jon Bernthal (as a young Lee Iacocca) and Josh Lucas (as the smarmy, vindictive corporate suit Leo Beebe) are all good. I don't have any idea how much of the infighting and scheming within the Ford corporation shown here is realistic, though I suspect much of it must be fictionalized to amp up the drama. But it makes for an engaging night out. Have fun!"

"rannynm","10","2","5","16 November 2019"," Pure Adrenaline Rush From Start to Finish
","Ford V Ferrari is a pure adrenaline rush from start to finish. It's an absolutely thrilling film that fires on all cylinders.<br/><br/>Ferrari dominates the annual 24-hour race at Le Mans for much of the 1960s. Ford decides to throw their hat in the ring, in hopes that a victory at Le Mans will raise their struggling sales. The former racer turned car designer Carrol Shelby (Matt Damon) and his difficult, but passionate racer pal Ken Miles (Christian Bale) are both brought on to help Ford craft a car to get to the finish line.<br/><br/>Beneath the technical polish and gloss of Ford V Ferrari, the friendship between Shelby and Miles is the heart of the film. Christian Bale and Matt Damon are a large part of what makes this film work so well. This is their first movie together and yet, they interact with the ease of old friends. Their performances complement each other. You get really invested in this on-screen duo with an absurd amount of charm exuding from the screen.<br/><br/>We all love a good underdog and this film is a classic underdog story. Ford V Ferrari isn't just about the race at Le Mans, but more about the human struggles encountered to get there. Pride and jealousy constrict Miles and Shelby at times, but the rigid corporate system of Ford Motor Company poses a greater challenge. Ford V Ferrari is an expansive, mesmerizing real-life story that feels perfect for the cinematic medium.<br/><br/>Ford V Ferrari puts you in the driver's seat with the racers, but not in the way I was expecting. The stellar sound design and mixing are some of the best and extremely transportive. They give the racing sequences not just an immersive quality, but a transcendent one. James Mangold's direction is excellent. He gives you sequences that put you on the edge of your seat and capture your gaze. More so, Mangold has a strong grasp on pacing. The film knows when to slow down and emphasize character and emotion and when to boost its engine and hightail it to the next scene. In a film this long, it's remarkable that it feels as breezy as it does. Even if you know this story start to finish, the skill, technically and narrative in which it's told make this ride one easily worth taking.<br/><br/>I recommend Ford V Ferrari for ages 7 to 14 for language. Even if you're not a race car fanatic, there's a good chance you'll love this film. I happily give it 5 out of 5 stars. This is easily one of my favorites of the year."

"burlesonjesse5","7","2","5","16 November 2019"," VIEWS ON FILM review of Ford v Ferrari
","Christian Bale is one of the most ironclad, reliable actors on the planet. You pair him with the equally reliable Matt Damon and the well cast, sleazeball-ing Josh Lucas and you get a spot-on, co-starring team. Damon and Bale don accents and trade torque/throttle in Ford v Ferrari (my latest review).<br/><br/>Ford v Ferrari's true story goes like this: A car designer named Carroll Shelby (Damon) and a hard-edged race car driver named Ken Miles (Bale), try to best Enzo Ferrari's souped-up automobiles via the 1966 Le Mans. In truth, Ford v Ferrari is a longing film that ends on a down note but it's not without a touch of energy and the almighty whimsical.<br/><br/>Ford v Ferrari's running time flies by even at 152 minutes. Most of these minutes involve mild emotion undercut with some heart-pounding, endurance race sequences. If you like a superior sense of time and place, then Ford v Ferrari will give you your mid 60s fix. And if you wanna see a more sophisticated version of say, Days of Thunder, then Ford v Ferrari will make you forget about that commercialized, Tom Cruise vehicle (no pun intended).<br/><br/>Directed by New Yorker James Mangold with its vroom vroom scenes shot at ground level, Ford v Ferrari is the type of flick that needs to be seen with the best movie theater sound system possible. Mangold knows how to film racing action no doubt. He avoids all the Fast & Furious BS and instead opts for minimal flash and loads of stash. Yup, it's about the clamor here. You can hear the fuel burning, the tires screeching, the engine humming, the studs spinning, and the racers rubbing. It's decibel, ear orgasmic.<br/><br/>Now Ford v Ferrari does fail to fully flesh out its 2-3 main characters (that's rare for a 2 and a half hour pic). And yeah, the film's first half has a lot more collared, dramatic momentum. Still, with smooth direction by James Mangold, some capable editing by Michael McCusker, some sleek rides, and a bleached out, beach blanket be-bop look, Ford v Ferrari provides the viewer with an old-world night at the cineplex. Call it ""stampede for speed"". Rating: 3 stars."

"kenstallings-65346","8","2","6","17 March 2020"," Solid biopic
","Overall, this is a well produced and well acted biopic. The historic story of how Ford was motivated to take on the 24-hour endurance racing circuit is very interesting, especially given how Ford came from nowhere to not just enter the circuit, but almost immediately dominate it for the four years they competed.<br/><br/>Those details of how Carol Shelby and his chief driver Ken Miles teamed up to produce an historic pairing is well told, with one glaring exception. There is a decided effort to portray the Ford executives as clueless and entirely lacking in human attachment. Worse, most of those scenes are entirely contrived, and plain wrong.<br/><br/>There is one very nice scene of Henry Ford II speaking with Shelby about how it wasn't the first time that Ford went to war in Europe. The rest of the portrayals of Team Ford takes on a predictably negative and entirely stereotypical formula.<br/><br/>Apart from that, the interactions of the rest of the cast is both interesting and faithful to the truth. Ken Miles was robbed of an historic first of sweeping the big three of the endurance races in a single year, and this film shows how that went down.<br/><br/>The end scene between Shelby and Miles' son was especially poignant and worthy of the film. Add in highly effective editing and musical score that achieved a high degree of synergistic power in portraying the ""perfect lap,"" and that alone makes this film highly worth watching."

But the real treat for me was actually seeing the delivery of a first class Brummie accent by Bale. I note that a couple of other reviewers have said he spoke with a 'UK Northern accent' (nope, we're Midlands!) and a Cockney accent (seriously?!!). As a True Brummie I can honestly say this is the first time I have watched a film and actually seen someone act and speak like the people I know and see every day. It was so great to watch a film without the irritation of someone over-egging the accent and capturing the Wry humour. And the accompanying script was spot on for colloquialisms too.

","This is a very well made film, from the writing all the way to makeup, hair, and wardrobe. What stands out for me is the writing, which is crucial. There's very nice character development which introduces us to the 2 leads and shows us who they are. Rather than just ""getting into it"" with no introduction, we get to really like the leads and want to join them on their journey and want them to succeed. Without this, all you have are pretty faces, production value, vfx, chase scenes, and gun play.<br/><br/>The icing on the cake is an epic moment that punctuates the one leads character arc. It's a moment that almost elicits tears.<br/><br/>If you want to watch a great movie, which are few and far between, this is it."

","Ford v Ferrari (titled Le Mans '66 in the UK and other territories) is a biographical American drama film directed by James Mangold and written by Jez Butterworth, John-Henry Butterworth, and Jason Keller. It stars Matt Damon and Christian Bale, with Caitriona Balfe, Jon Bernthal, Tracy Letts, Josh Lucas, Noah Jupe, Remus Girone and Ray McKinnon appearing in supporting roles.<br/><br/>In 1963, Enzo Ferrari was approached by the Ford Motor Company about a possible purchase. Conversations were unilaterally interrupted by Ferrari when Enzo realized that the deal included the purchase of Ferrari's racing program, a program that won the Le Mans 24 Hours in 1958 and every year from 1960 to 1965. Le Mans is the most The world's oldest sports car endurance race, held annually since 1923. Troubled by being rejected, Henry Ford II drove his racing division to build a car to beat the Scuderia Ferrari.<br/><br/>The film tells how automotive designer Carroll Shelby and race car driver Ken Miles lead a team of American Ford engineers and designers to build a race car that can beat the legendary Ferrari. Finally, they produce the Ford GT40 for a 1966 Le Mans 24 Hour showdown.<br/><br/>Ford v Ferrari excels at evoking the pure thrill of racing - 'a body moving in space and time', as one character put it - and is compelling enough in those moments to argue that nothing beats the thrill of competition.<br/><br/>Matt and Bale stand out in their performances by becoming a duo and I remembered the movie Fast and Furious from the characters of actor Vin and Paul.

I knew little about the facts behind ""Ford v Ferrari"" before walking into the theater, but afterwards I couldn't get enough of reading about the real characters portrayed so well by Damon and Bale. In ""Ford v Ferrari"" these two are in top form: Damon's charisma and Bale's quirky genius spark amazing chemistry that carries the entire movie.<br/><br/>This movie is masterfully directed by James Mangold: the cinematography is awe-inspiring and the racing sequences are among the best I've ever seen. As a filmmaking achievement, ""Ford v Ferrari"" is outstanding. I do have a couple of problems with the movie: certain elements of the plot were predictable, and a few scenes here and there weren't fully developed so it was somewhat difficult to understand what'd just happened. But these are only minor flaws with the script that are outweighed by great performances, beautiful cinematography, and terrific racing sequences that should set the standard for future racing movies. 8/10."
"blanbrn","8","2","6","16 November 2019"," Great story of determination, will, and living life in the fast lane all while developing friendship.
","""Ford v Ferrari"" is a well done and in depth long drawn out biography that does give good focus to the auto industry and how power and greed intersect with it. As it tells the true story of the legendary race in which Ford challenged Ferrari and would come out on top as an automotive leader.<br/><br/>The scenes are tense and heart pounding often gripping with tension as the gear shifts on the lane, yet things also shift in life for industry and the characters involved. As showcased are the power struggles and corporate problems of industry like greed and doubt however when the Ford GT is developed it breaks the company free to win around the curb of the tracks!<br/><br/>Most compelling and interesting is seeing the friendship form between car designer Carroll Shelby(Matt Damon) and hotshot race driver Ken Miles(Christian Bale) as despite the drama and thrill of the 24 hours of Le Mans in 1966 a bond and lasting and listening friendship is formed between the polar opposites! Overall good touching film of showing how fast speed won over many with love and friendship the film was really paced well and mixed with fun and drama for a near perfect finish lap!"
"ferni-tierni","10","1","2","2 May 2020"," Passion and Art vs Corporatism and Bureaucracy.
","The immersion of this movie in the racing scenes was stunning, incredible, extraordinary. I sensed Ken Mile's (Christian Bale) desire to obliterate all records and set himself as a Legend in Le Mans. Rarely do movies submerge me into a state of mind that gives me psychosomatic experiences. Those races are large portion of the movie and just like for the pilots we feel their relativity vicariously. The movie is a concerning two hours and thirty minutes, but in no point, in the entire movie, does it get dull, boring, redundant. We get a story-telling that is passionate, nuanced, idiosyncratic, and moralistic. Kudos to James Mangold.<br/><br/>A beautiful highlight of the movie was the shots at the Le Mans. The viewer gets a sense of what Ken Miles is experiencing. We also understand a modicum of both the intuition and knowledge of the pilot as he is attempting to measure and calibrate the reaction times and distances. His son Peter Miles (Noah Jupe) and Mollie Miles (Caitriona Balfe) were an important inclusion in many of those scenes to remind us that despite his relentless desire for success, he was still a multi-dimensional character with decency and compassion, despite his crazy antics.<br/><br/>The plot follows a perfect pace to provide us with the necessary details to understand the contention between Ford and Ferrari but also make it short enough to not lose our attention with too many character building or dialogue. We immediately recognize the temperament, character, values, and ambition of both Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) and Ken Miles as they attempt to circumvent bureaucracy, corporatism, greed, and mediocrity. I would have enjoyed more emotion from both protagonists, but the tone that was set was maybe emulating the real life story of both, even in their character and personality.<br/><br/>The movie reaches a resolution that can leave a bittersweet sensation to many, but the process to reach the moral of the story, many of the times can be more turbulent than expected, sometimes is far more complicated than visualized; there were definitely a lot of factors at play in the unfolding. It is refreshing to see that the protagonist, who was undoubtedly, could even be said obsessed with success, ultimately did not care for the plaudits and trophies of Le Mans. One can say that the process of becoming better was the alluring feature in his experience of racing cars."
"ssengupta1198","9","1","2","1 May 2020"," A pure cinema with a brilliant story.
","Ford v Ferrari is a 2019 American sports drama film directed by James Mangold and written by Jez Butterworth, John-Henry Butterworth, and Jason Keller. The film stars Matt Damon and Christian Bale, with Jon Bernthal, Caitriona Balfe, Tracy Letts, Josh Lucas, Noah Jupe, Remo Girone, and Ray McKinnon in supporting roles.<br/><br/>The plot is based on a true story, two men - American car designer Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) and British-born driver Ken Miles (Christian Bale), take on the racing team of Ferrari at the 24 Hours of Le Mans race by building their own. Carroll Shelby and Ken Miles were dispatched by Henry Ford II and Lee Iacocca with the mission of building the Ford GT40, a new racing car with the potential to finally defeat the perennially dominant Ferrari racing team at the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans race in France.<br/><br/>The plot is built on the automotive battle between two corporations, but director James Mangold narrows it down to two person character study. Both Matt Damon and Christian Bale understand their character's strong personalities and use it to fuel the dynamic between their respective characters. Christian Bale is brilliant and mesmerises the audience yet again playing Miles - a volatile underdog that Ford doesn't want on their team. Miles is at the heart of the film, and Bale is almost magical to watch. Matt Damon is far more fleshed out character as Carol Shelby and gets his big moments on screen which he makes the most out of. Their combination and chemistry is exhilarating; you can't help rooting for the two when they're on screen, even without any cars involved. Speaking of which, James Mangold directs the racing sequences to convey not just the frenetic energy, but also to further the character arcs.<br/><br/>Besides the two leads, the supporting cast contributes brilliantly to the film as well. Jon Bernthal is solid, and so is Caitriona Balfe as Mollie Miles, but the most heartwarming relationship is between Miles and his son Peter, played by Noah Jupe. This pushes the pedal on the screenplay, which keeps it thrilling and, surprisingly humorous enough to ensure there's not a dull moment in its two and a half hours runtime. Motorheads and racing fans are guaranteed to love 'Ford v Ferrari', but even the casual moviegoer will get a brilliant 'against-all-odds' story as well. 'Ford v Ferrari' at the end of the day is what one might say a real cinema, the kind of solid, satisfying, non-pandering movie that might seem endangered nowadays."

"tkarlmann","10","1","2","13 April 2020"," Forget the 'title' this film is way more important than it.
","This film is ALL about Ken Miles, who tragically passed away, shown briefly near the end of the film.
It is an injustice to name this film ""Ford vs Ferrari"". The film depicts Ken Miles, without whom, perhaps, none of the wins would ever have been made by Ford.
Now, I'm not an avid car enthusiast. That said, I do recall, from my relatively advanced age, that cars from that era, from Ford and other US car-makers, were not that well made. Because of this, later, the Japanese imports had much better fit & finish than US cars did. This is hilariously brought out in this film -- where the Ken Miles character cannot get his race car door to close! Then, one of the pit crew comes over with a Big Hammer (almost like Thor's) and Closes the door!
Yes, OK, there is some in the film about Ford vs Ferrari; but there is more about the Big Shots at Ford wanting to do things ""Their Way"", rather than the Correct Way -- purported by Miles & Shelby.<br/><br/>This is what big corporations always do. Then when there is a success, based on the skills of others, they cannot pat themselves on the back enough!<br/><br/>The fact that I really don't see myself as a race car or even a sports car enthusiast, and that I've rated the movie a ""10"", should tell you something. This life is NOT about corporations; it IS about People! For this film, that Person is Ken Miles. OK, certainly Carol Shelby too. Kind of like an Earp&Holiday-esque sort of thing with heavy emphasis on Ken Miles.
Oh, you want some description of the acting, do you? Well, I'll just say that the acting was so good, it never got in the way of telling the Ken Miles story. That should be enough praise for the actors. Look Ken Miles up on Wiki."

","'Ford v Ferrari', or 'Le Mans '66' as it is titled here in the UK, is a very enjoyable and extremely well-made racing drama film. It gets the balance between storytelling and action just about right, ensuring it is both entertaining and informative/educational as a true story and biography piece.<br/><br/>My knowledge of racing and cars in general is rather limited, and I certainly had no prior knowledge of Ken Miles before watching this film, but 'Ford v Ferrari' does a great job at being accessible to all audiences rather than just those with an interest in this area. It's easy to follow and you need very little knowledge of motoring to understand what's going on.<br/><br/>Christian Bale and Matt Damon are excellent in their roles. Bale in particular impressed me with his accurate Brummie accent, which can't have been easy to pull off. 'Ford v Ferrari' is great - recommended for everybody, but for racing fans it is definitely a must-see."

","Le Mans 66<br/><br/>'Le Mans 66' or 'Ford Vs Ferrari' depending on where you are from is up there with the best racing car movies.
James Mangold delivers an exciting movie for those who like all things petrol powered and also for those who want to be invested in a gripping story.
The script is tightly bolted down and accelerated by two charismatic lead performances from Christian Bale and Matt Damon.
The story tells of how the Ford motor company took the fight to Ferrari at Le Mans after a business deal went sour.
Ford where on the cusp of acquiring the Italian sports car maker but after negotiations broke down they decided to take on the impossible task of beating Ferrari at their own game.
Damon plays legendary driver and car maker Carol Shelby who is tasked with building a credible machine whilst Bale is sublime as the man who will drive it, the straight talking race hero Ken Miles.
As aforementioned the script is good but it's the chemistry of the two leads that will captivate the audience.
Director James Mangold is coming from a high note after the excellent 'Logan' and the action scenes in 'Le Mans 66' have the same razor sharp precision as his last blockbuster.
The car racing sequences are handled expertly and never become 'Fast & Furious' unbelievable.
They're grounded in reality making the danger all the more apparent.<br/><br/>In terms of audio and visual quality 'Le Mans 66' is delicious in Ultra High Definition.
It may not always be 4K crisp. There's a vintage feel to the picture quality.
The onscreen image is packed full of detail with High Dynamic Range helping the motor masterpieces sparkle. Yet there's still a little film grain to convey that this movie is set in the past.
Audio is also splendid.
Bass is thunderous as the cars race through your listening environment.
This is a film worthy of a good home theatre set up.
Each speaker getting plenty to do with sound effects and musical score coming to the forefront.<br/><br/>'Le Mans 66' is a must for fans of the genre but it's also just a plain good old movie all round.
Mangold has blended the drama with the dynamics to deliver a solid piece of movie making."

","What a great movie! I loved it all the way, needed some time to lose Damon and Bale, but it was such a thrill to watch those two go at it together. But there were two actors who stood out even more,Caitriona Balfe and Noah Jupe. But especially, without selling short an escellent performance by Balfe, Noah really impressed me. Sometimes you just know you witnessed the birth of a new movie star, and to me, with Noah, that is the case and I truly hope I will be proven right the coming years!<br/><br/>I'm entirely unfamiliar with his list of movies, checking him out some outtakes on YouTube might already confirm my notion about him.

","It's been a long time since I saw such a great movie. The two starring actors are actors I particularly like. The characters portrayed by Bell are so good. The characters stand up soon after appearance. The look, tone, acting skills are really explosive, and Matt is also very good. I guess it is a change in history. I guess Bell will die, but I do n't know when it is, so I watched in the second half. I was afraid he would hang up without paying attention. Fortunately, after running the game, although it was best to compromise, it was also very good. His wife said that he had matured, and the carnival before he slowed down was probably the last time he was presumptuous before he matured. At that time, I believe he knew the pressure of his life and his wife and children to raise. Enjoyed great glory and became a great driver, but he still chose to do his duty as an ordinary father and husband, keep the job and support his family. Although he was put together in the end and did not win the championship, it didn't matter, at least all Everyone knows that he is the first. A person who does n't like the racing theme very much, it looks good, looks good, looks good!"

","James Mangold happens to be one of my favourite directors, and not just because of what he was able to do with the Wolverine franchise. I love his ability to infuse a sense of heart into every frame. It helps that he's working with great actors and manages to coax their best performances out of them.<br/><br/>Granted, Christian Bale's accent is all over the North of England, but ultimately it doesn't matter, because you believe him as this passionate and difficult race car driver. This is also one of Matt Damon's best performances. It's easy to see why this was nominated in 2019 for best picture because it's both crowd-pleasing and a rock-solid piece of filmmaking.<br/><br/>The supporting cast shouldn't be discounted either. Tracy Letts, once again, turns in a stellar performance, and Jon Bernthal plays against type as Lee Iacocca and it pays off.<br/><br/>Some may dismiss it as a ""dad"" film, but for me, it's the finest ""dad"" film in awhile."

"leonblackwood","5","1","2","26 March 2020"," Does exactly what it says on the tin. 5/10
","Review: As I'm not a massive racing car fan, I wasn't over-excited about this movie, but the cast was impressive and the story was intriguing. The director portrayed the 60's period well, and the cars were amazing, but the whole racing car theme became a bit tedious after a while. All of the technical jargon went straight over my head, but the attention to detail, in terms of the cars and the tracks, was on point. The acting from Christian Bale (Ken Miles) and Matt Damon (Carroll Shelby) seemed average in my eyes, mainly because I didn't know the real-life characters that they were portraying, so I didn't know how accurate it was. With that aside, the chemistry between the characters was great, and there were some scenes, which didn't have anything to do with racing, which was enjoyable, but the main core of the movie seemed a bit too safe to me. There weren't any standout moments that stood out, and I wasn't left feeling that I wanted to find out more about the characters. I know that the' race is an important part of American history that will always be remembered, but I personally lost interest once Carroll and Ken joined forces. I did feel the intensity during the races, which made me stick with the two and a half hour movie, and I did find the ending quite shocking, but it's not the type of movie that I will be watching again. That's not to say that it's a bad film because it does exactly what it says on the tin, but it's just not my cup of tea. Average!<br/><br/>Round-Up: This movie was directed by James Mangold, who also brought you Heavy in 1995, Copland, Girl Interrupted, Kate & Leopold, Identity, Walk The Line, 3:10 to Yuma, Knight & Day, The Wolverine and Logan. He's due to direct 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea: Captain Nemo and the new Indiana Jones project, but with the Coronavirus in our midst, no one really knows what's going to happen to the upcoming projects that are in pre-production. Judging by his filmography, he has made some impressive movies to date, and with this movie going down well with critics worldwide, the only way is up for this established director. The only reason why I wasn't that impressed with this film was because of the subject matter, but it's well made and the box office takings prove that it was enjoyed by many.<br/><br/>Budget: $97.6million Worldwide Gross: $225.5million<br/><br/>Genre: Action, Biography, Drama, Sport Cast: Matt Damon, Christian Bale, Jon Bernthal, Caitriona Balfe, Josh Lucas, Noah Jupe, Tracy Letts, Remo Girone, Ray McKinnon, JJ Feild and Jack McMullen. 5/10"

"kirbylee70-599-526179","10","1","2","9 March 2020"," A NEED FOR SPEED
","One of the most favorite genres of film has always been the sports film. Inevitably those films almost always revolve around the struggle of the little guy against the giant, be it the favorite team to win or the corporation trying to stomp out the individual. One of the least popular sub genres in this category has been the racing film. Only a handful have been successful. To that list we must now add FORD V FERRARI.<br/><br/>The film opens with driver Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) winning the Le Mans in France in 1959. Due to health issues he can no longer drive and sets up his own car company, Shelby American. Years go by and at Ford's owner Henry Ford II (Tracy Letts) is upset because Ford has yet to come up with a successful sports car. Prompted to push for something new Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal) suggest they look at the youth marker which appreciates foreign cars.<br/><br/>Ford attempts to buy out the now bankrupt Ferrari but it's merely a ploy for Ferrari to raise their value before selling to Fiat and insulting Ford. This pushes Ford II to appoint a team to create a new car to race on the circuit, especially at Le Mans. The man Iacocca suggests lead that team is Shelby.<br/><br/>But Shelby has people to bring along as well. One of those is Ken Miles (Christian Bale), perhaps the best driver in the world but one with a reputation for being difficult to work with. Early on we see this when the two have a disagreement. But if anyone can pull the best out of Miles it's Shelby.<br/><br/>They go to work, assemble the best there is at designing their new car and find themselves butting heads with the Ford team at the start. This team uses computers and gadgets to measure things. Shelby and Mile's team knows their car, inside and out. A bit of ribbon and duct tape and they can prove the point they want to make as opposed to scouring through hours of computer data. This results in them all working together towards a common goal.<br/><br/>This team creates the first major racing car for Ford, the GT40 Mk I. But not everyone at Ford headquarters is on the same page. Executive Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas) is more concerned about advancing his career and does what he can to throw a wrench in the works figuratively. He convinces Ford to not include Miles on the team. Miles predicts that none of the Fords in competition at Le Mans will win and his prediction comes true.<br/><br/>When Shelby is called on the carpet by Ford to explain why they lost to Ferrari, he explains in no uncertain terms that it wasn't the car that was the problem as much as not having the right driver. To prove his point he makes a deal with Ford. Let them continue to work on the car and if Miles can't win the race at Daytona, he'll sign over his entire company to Ford.<br/><br/>Miles does win and it looks like everything is a go for both Shelby American, Ford and Miles. But once again Beebe inserts himself in a position he knows nothing about. He's wrangles his way into the head of the foreign racing team for Ford and seems bound and determined to put Miles in his place rather than allow the team to succeed.<br/><br/>It all boils down to the second year at Le Mans with the new Ford GT40 Mk I and Miles onboard as one of the drivers. The 24 hour race commences and it isn't long until Beebe tries to derail the team. This time though Shelby refuses to bow down and keeps things moving properly. Now it's up to the team and Miles to make Ford a name to be reckoned with in the racing world.<br/><br/>Racing fans will know the outcome of the film. Not being a race fan I came at the film from a different perspective. What I walked away with was having watched a movie that was amazing from start to finish. The film might include some amazing race photography but it doesn't focus only on that like many racing films do. Instead it tells the story of two men and their struggles to achieve a united goal of winning Le Mans in a car that they were responsible for creating.<br/><br/>Both Damon and Bale add two more roles to their already long list of accomplishments. How neither won for their performances here is beyond me. The heart and soul of these two men is on display here in the film and it draws the viewer in rooting for them until the final moments of the film.<br/><br/>I missed this one in the theaters, not really wanting to see it that bad. They should have promoted it more. It was truly one of the best films of the year and deserved more attention. With it available on disc now is your chance. This should be the one you look for this weekend."

","A popular film among audiences and winner of 2 Academy Awards, Ford v Ferrari appears to be a sleeper hit of 2019. It tells the true story of Caroll Shelby (Matt Damon) and Ken Miles (Christian Bale) as they work to get the Ford Motor Company a seemingly impossible victory at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1966. The performances from Damon and Bale are very good, giving us two easily likeable characters. It has these two determined men as they face opposition not only from the demand of making the fastest car in the world, but also from executives from the Ford Motor Company. Despite what the title may think, Ford is made out as a villain of sorts, even more than Ferrari. This isn't as much the story of Ford's upset of Ferrari as much as it is Shelby and Miles' upset of Ferrari.<br/><br/>What's best about this film is that it isn't as much a Rocky-esque underdog story as it is a story of passion. Ken Miles was satisfied with the outcome of Le Mans, even though he got cheated out of his rightful place at #1. He got his chance, he knew in his heart that he won, and that's what matters to him. Not only that, but there's the passion of Shelby to make the car to win the race while the corporate people at Ford just want the glory associated with winning. It's as much ""Shelby and Miles v Ford"" as it is ""Ford v Ferrari.""<br/><br/>The racing sequences are practically perfect, even from the perspective of someone who doesn't watch car racing. They're intense, fun to watch, and show excellent camera work. Most importantly, they capture the thrill of the race, aided through the movie's editing, which is as fast paced as the cars themselves. The film's editing is perfect. It didn't get the Oscar for nothing. Speaking of Oscars, it also won one for Sound Editing, which was also well deserved. The sounds of the race do their part to add to the thrill, a perfect combination of flawless editing.<br/><br/>Ford v Ferrari is an excellent film that serves as one of the most satisfying films of recent years. It's a perfect blend of story, character, and fantastic racing sequences. This is a must watch for car buffs, but also a definite recommend for anyone."

Brilliant work of actors also!"
"wennbergja","7","1","2","1 March 2020"," An Old-Fashioned Race Car Drama
","A slick, thrilling look back at the golden age of auto racing. Ford v Ferrari is an old-fashioned film, not only due to the fact it takes place in the mid-60's but also in the way it is directed, the story being told, and the experience delivered in the theatre. The film is a tip of the hat to old-school movies about people with real-life problems. Well-directed, well-written, well-delivered."

","I'll start by saying that I am more of a casual fan of racing (Love rally racing though) , I do adore cars however. ( I adored seeing the Chevy racing team with their Corvettes early on in the movie)
Even if you have no love or interest in either of these, it should still not dissuade you from seeing this movie.<br/><br/>The acting is top notch, as you would expect with Bale and Damon at the helm, but the whole cast is stunning. The story is based on the 1966 '24 Hours of Le Mans', and the resounding duel between the all-American, yet struggling Ford racing team and the already legendary Italian Ferrari team.<br/><br/>I won't go to much into the plot but, I left the cinema for the first time in awhile feeling fulfilled by a movie, the visuals are excellent the cars and settings accurate and there was clearly oodles of love and adoration poured into this movie.
The racing scenes are the highlight, they are incredibly tense and gripping,making the rivalry between the 2 companies come to a very satisfying boil and conclusion.<br/><br/>If you don't understand the love many of us have for cars and racing, this movie will make you understand. It makes me truly happy seeing the passion and love for motor-sports and cars in general being shown by the characters and clearly present in the writers. Bale's performance in particular, almost makes you want to pick up wrench and head for the garage yourself. These characters live and breathe cars and you can feel it.<br/><br/>Highly recommended to all audiences.<br/><br/>Please Hollywood, more passionate film making like this."

And then there's Christian Bale. This was a Matt Damon movie, you know, till Bale comes on-screen. He swoops in like the thief he is, and steals the screen from Damon!
If you love your car, love how this machine becomes one with you, understands even the little bits of adjustments you make, and obeys, this movie is for you. If you just let your car run free, let it be the master, you will love this movie. Hell, if you don't love cars, I dare say you will love this movie."

A film with an impeccable sound mixing, a thrilling OST that submerges you into the race and conveys a feeling of weightlessness, freedom and victory I hadn't felt in a long time.<br/><br/>I profoundly recommend it to everyone reading this, specially for racing fans, as I've heard it's really faithful to the true story it's based on."

","I doubt auto racing can be made to be any more engaging to me than in this, which is to say I'm not fascinated by men in sports cars driving around in circles, but ""Ford v Ferrari"" is a ripsnorting ride. Despite its two-and-a-half-hours runtime, it's never dull, and the whiplash cutting and vroom-vroom sounds are wholly deserving of their Oscars. Casting two of the most likable actors around, Matt Damon and Christian Bale, both of who try on different accents, in the leads helps, too. The title, ""Ford v Ferrari,"" winds up being rather misleading, though, as the picture shifts gears more along the lines of Ford suites v Ford gearheads. That at one turn, Henry Ford II frightfully weeps as a passenger in a race car suggests where the movie's sympathies rest in that competition. The pissing competition between two bosses of car manufacturers takes a backseat to this inter-corporate one-upmanship and even that is of less interest than chasing the adrenaline junkies speeding around corners and risking death for glory. Rather simplistic for a Best Picture Oscar nominee, although not for its technically splendid production, but it's undeniably popularly entertaining."

the time line is out. ford started this project without shelby, shelby came later after ford lost his first two tries at le mans. miles drove in the race the movie said that he had to stay home for.
where are all the other cars? for a hundred million dollar budget, they could have at least used some stock footage to show all the other cars in all the other classes that are involved also.
where was the winner's podium? ford and all others protesting that miles should be awarded first prize.
why was ford and his crony made to be villians? after all, it was his company, his cars and his race. why add the fake conflict?<br/><br/>ive seen movies using all the facts from history without distortion. i thoroughly enjoyed them more knowing what i was watching was completely true. and if ive ever enjoyed a movie then later found out the facts were distorted, it ruins the entire experience."

"jaredpahl","8","1","2","8 February 2020"," 2019: The Year They Started Making Them Like They Used To Again
","Ford v Ferrari is of a type. A certain brand of mainstream, middle America, crowd-pleasing movie about people that audiences love and critics begrudgingly accept. Movies of this type used to come around a few times a year, and they'd end up at the top of the box office at years end. That concept is completely foreign to an industry held hostage by giant TV series, custom made for a devoted but niche group of fans. We've forgotten that big blockbuster movies can be for everyone. Because for all the gibes about it being a ""Dad Movie"", Ford v Ferrari has the well-rounded, old-fashioned, slick, star-driven Hollywood entertainment that goes down smooth for anybody.<br/><br/>It makes an almost too perfect comparison with the movie's star car, the Ford GT40. Somewhere between its impersonal factory-made cohorts and its sophisticated and refined rivals is a solid, powerhouse machine built with rugged American drive and ingenuity.<br/><br/>From the acting, including one of Christian Bale's best ever performances and a series of surprisingly charismatic supporting work, to some of the most sensational racing scenes I've seen, Ford v Ferrari is strong filmmaking all the way through. Granted, mainstream Hollywood stuff like this inevitably smooths over a lot with cliche. We get a fair share of dopey dialogue and a particularly annoying child actor, but director James Mangold is too good to let the film succumb to its formula.<br/><br/>This is red-blooded, American, alpha-male excitement, of the kind we've come to forget even exists anymore. It's heartfelt enough, smart enough, and fun enough to make its standard issue underdog trappings feel genuine. And just like that, a huge swath of ignored audiences across America are heard again. Give us more movies like this!<br/><br/>85/100"
"joachimokeefe","6","1","2","8 February 2020"," Looking in the rear view mirror, with blinkers on.
","How (sort of) the gigantic Ford Motor Company bought itself victory over the tiny Italian company Ferrari at Le Mans in 1966. Heroic warrior/engineer/designer/entrepreneur/drivers Ken Miles and Carroll Shelby (and Miles' wife, who would seem from this to be an android) struggle, mainly with corporate interference, to put one - well, four - over on the Italians. And while it's a stirring tale, they don't play fair, truth be told.<br/><br/>But hey, winning is everything, isn't it. Isn't it?<br/><br/>It says that 15,000 jobs were provided by the production, meaning that the credits are slower than Ken Miles' Le Mans lap record.<br/><br/>To look at the film, 99.9% of those jobs were to white males - well, it was the 1960's. FvsF isn't interested in any socio-economic truths from the 1960's that would get in the way of a nostalgia-fest. (That makes it very old-fashioned).<br/><br/>Not only FvsF a convincing recreation of nearly 60-year-old scenery, venery (look it up) and machinery, it's a convincing recreation of early 1960's corporate and environmental laissez-faire as though that was a really good thing.<br/><br/>Well it was a good thing if you were one of the entitled then, and are so now. I hope you don't watch this film and not realize that times have changed; this is not a story of noble aspirations, it's a story of American industrial might post WWII (and Korea and during Vietnam) trying to recapture the buzz of liberating Europe.<br/><br/>It's a 'good movie', but unimaginative, conservative and derivative. Essentially an uncritical tribute, made by today's equivalent of an industrial behemoth, to a golden age of industrial behemoths that was dying when these events happened. Watch once, don't be indoctrinated, and forget."

","I'm not a great fan of car racing but director James Mangold's work delivers on all fronts for a thoroughly enjoyable cinematic experience. Besides, it's also a great human interest story. The entire cast performs well but the main 2 actors are ahead of the rest. As always, Christian Bale disappears himself into the character and gives an outstanding performance. Matt Damon gets to show quite a range from confident showman to a rarely seen vulnerability. Cinematography by Phedon Papamichael immerses the viewer into the racing action. The editing is outstanding and also the sound design is excellent - it makes your heart race faster as you hear the roar of the Ford GT 40. Some of the races are simulated by stuntmen. And some are created through computer graphics. But the real and computer graphics footage are indistinguishable because of the camera work and editing.
It's one of the most energetic and memorable films of the year. Mangold is an ace director."

I agree with a lot of people who have reviewed this movie: this movie will make you want to learn now to drive stick shift! It was so awesome and the racing felt intense and badass. Christian Bale is a wonderful actor and Matt Damon was superb! Damon deserved to be nominated for an Oscar for this movie. Both him and Bale had really good chemistry. The only negative thing I will say is that there was no backstory to how both of their characters met. You assume they already knew each other at the start of the film. Other than that, loved the film and is one of my favorites."
"Benjamin-M-Weilert","9","1","2","7 February 2020"," An almost perfect movie about the synergy of competitive man and engineered machine.
","Full disclosure: I'm not a ""car guy."" Sure, my education was in Mechanical Engineering, and I can appreciate well-crafted machines, but I see cars as mere tools to get from point A to point B. Consequently, I don't have much interest in car racing and didn't initially want to see Ford v Ferrari (2019). Luckily for me, this film was chosen as one of this year's nominees for Best Picture. After watching it, I can clearly see why. For someone who isn't into cars or racing, I was completely enthralled and entertained by Ford v Ferrari.<br/><br/>This movie is a tour de force when it comes to several filmmaking aspects. It expertly used its sound design, music, and cinematography to give the raw tension of racing highly-engineered machines meant for one thing only: to go fast. In fact, I only had two qualms with this movie on the whole. First, the ""marketing guy antagonist"" seemed a little cliché, even if I'm sure there was plenty of truth in what happened. Second, there are only so many racing sequences I can take before they all start looking the same. I understand there were a lot of individual races-many of which lasted for an eye-watering 24 hours-but it almost becomes tedious to see the same portions of the racetrack again and again.<br/><br/>As for the acting, I felt Christian Bale and Matt Damon hit it out of the park with their performances. I felt emotional connections to their motivations and their frustrations with being unable to accomplish the impossible. Overall, the story is gripping and intense, with a fantastic twist near the end that I won't give away because it was such a gut punch. I'm glad that I had the chance to see this movie in the theater just for the pure spectacle of it on the big screen with the power of the sound system bringing every rumbling engine to life.<br/><br/>An almost perfect movie about the synergy of competitive man and engineered machine, I give Ford v Ferrari 4.5 stars out of 5."
"farez","9","1","2","6 February 2020"," One of two best Racing Films ever...
","My review for Ron Howard's ""Rush"" enthusiastically placed it at the top of the heap for ""racing genres"" if that is such a thing. That film was excellent even if you are not a racing fan.<br/><br/>Well now that I have seen ""Ford vs Ferrari"", I am having a difficult time choosing which one is better. I'm going to lean towards Ford v Ferrari because of the performance by Christian Bale as it is fresh in my mind and certainly a great character and acting job. I love his rebelliousness and genuine love for the machine...the way he communicates with it intuitively as if it was alive, Iis great stuff. At first I didn't think Matt Damon was cast well for the part of Carroll Shelby. From what I know (and I did meet him once) he was more of an outspoken cowboy, but I have to say Damon was excellent and his performance grew on me. Not as good as Bale who stole the show, but still excellent. The Lee Iacocca character was also slightly miscast but still, a very entertaining performance.<br/><br/>I liked how the period corporate culture of the US car industry was portrayed, with strong personalities and business practices of that era. It was especially entertaining when the Ford boys were they trying to match wits against Enzo Ferrari.<br/><br/>As to the racing and car stuff, it was great. Period authenticity was respected even in the scenes in France. The growling soundtrack and sweeping score just works. I enjoyed the innovative camera work of the racing scenes. The Ford GT40 was a miracle of brute American know-how against the refined Italian machinery of the legendary Ferraris.<br/><br/>Based on factual history (with a little artistic license thrown in), the story is compelling and left me very satisfied.<br/><br/>In my opinion, ""Rush"" and ""Ford V Ferrari"" are the two best racing movies ever."
"jasontheterrible","10","1","2","5 February 2020"," Shockingly Good If One Can Discount the Ending
","Never have I given a film a 10 without an ending that was satisfying and worth the wait, but this is a real film made with real film. That raises the enjoyment of it so dramatically that I made an exception. It is true to the original story based on several biographies. Matt Damon and Christian Bale look and sound like the real characters. The acting of everyone is superb. You can watch it for the acting and most of the story alone or you can admire the beautiful look of real film: the rich color we took for granted in the 60s, 70s, and 80s. Most movies since the 90s look terrible. It is unfortunate so many have gotten used to bad looking films. For example take the Seth Rogan film ""50/50"" as an example of how worthless good stories are with the dystopic glare and bright, diffused white light of video. They are colorless. ""Sex and the City"" is another good example. In that 2008 film the ocean is a dirty brown in one romantic scene!<br/><br/>This film is for everyone: car or racing lover, or not. I am neither, but was enthralled from start to finish. It was not just the beauty of the color using real film and genius photography, it was an amazing script. It is a good story but
the end of the real life hero Ken Miles is sad and weighs the film down."

Everyone will enjoy this film whether they know of the history of Carroll Shelby and Ken Miles or not. With such a simple title as ""Ford vs Ferrari"", you'd think that it's all about the cars and true, to some extent it is, but its also about the strengths and vulnerabilities of two unique individuals who were determined to develop an American made race car (the Ford GT40) to win the 24 hours of Le Mans race in 1966. It goes through their personal struggles, their triumph, and ultimately the fate and the effects of their actions on the racing scene as we know it. The combination of Matt Damon, as Shelby, and Christian Bale, as Ken Miles, was perfect. Absolutely perfect. No other actors could have taken on these roles and so profoundly brought them to the big screen. This is a film that will go down in history as a masterpiece of film-making."

What's good:
1. The screenplay is great and so is the direction. There are many great scenes and the director Jamed Mangold is able to make us feel exactly how he wanted to.
2. The performances by all the actors are great. Christian Bale gets the most heroic part of Ken Miles and he shines throughout the movie. Matt Damon's part is less heroic but he also does a good job. Jon Bernthal, Josh Lucas and other actors have also done a good job according to their small roles.
3. The second half of the film is highly entertaining.
What's bad:
1. It is an underdog story and has certain predictable scenes that many underdog stories have.
2. There is only one female character Caitriona Balfe and her role is pretty small although she gets one good scene.

Definitely recommended for moviebuffs for the thrilling and touching experience. Could've caught it in theater that'd have been great but in case if it's going to re-release gonna get my ticket ðŸ’¯.

","The one thing that Hollywood is really good at is competition which you might find surprising since Hollywood is a far-arsed, monied town and you would think 'competing' wouldn't even enter into their vocabulary, (except, of course, during Awards Season), yet when Hollywood sets its mind to it and makes a film about competing, (think ""Rocky"", think ""Aliens""), they are unbeatable. Their latest competitive movie is ""Ford v Ferrari"" and it's a contemporary classic in which every single piece fits perfectly into place just like the pieces of the classic cars on display. In this country it's called ""Le Mans '66"" so even if you didn't know it was about the car companies Ford and Ferrari you would still know what it's about and when it takes place.<br/><br/>Starting off with a superb screenplay from playwright Jez Butterworth, John-Henry Butterworth and Jason Keller. terrific performances from the likes of Christian Bale, Matt Damon, Jon Bernthal, Tracy Letts, Josh Lucas and Caitriona Balfe, brilliant editing, luminous photography all under the guiding hand of James Mangold this is a crowd-pleaser of the first magnitude and you don't even have to like cars to enjoy it, (though it helps). What you do have to like, however, is competing and who doesn't get an adrenelin rush from competing? It also helps if you like Christian Bale and Matt Damon. Bale's character may not be the most likeable bloke in the world but but this faultless actor is terrific in the role while Damon is fast becoming the go to actor of choice when it comes to playing craggy, steel-jawed heroes of a certain age, (surely his Oscar is just around the corner). The ending may be a tad predictable but the journey to it is one hell of a ride."

","GRADE: B+<br/><br/>THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.<br/><br/>IN BRIEF: A terrific sports film expertly crafted and a highly entertaining moviegoing experience.<br/><br/>JIM'S REVIEW: Hollywood's fascination with the race car genre can be seen with varying degrees of success. Famous actors have felt the need for speed in their careers starting with James Garner in the Oscar-winning Grand Prix (1966), Paul Newman in Winning (1969), Steve McQueen in Le Mans (1971), Burt Reynolds in The Cannonball Run (1981), Tom Cruise in Days of Thunder (1990) and Chris Hemsworth in Rush (2013),...not to mention, the highly profitable The Fast and Furious series. Even The King of Rock and Roll, Elvis Presley, revved up in some of his crowd-pleasing movies. Yes, it's definitely a man's world and the testosterone runs high. Now we can add James Mangold's exhilarating joy ride of a movie, Ford v Ferrari, to the list. His film is one of the best sport action films about racing ever made. Gentlemen, start your engines!<br/><br/>Ford v Ferrari shows the competitive world of auto racing. Based on a true story, Mr. Mangold sticks mostly to the facts, although he spins his tale a bit to heighten the tension between two racing mavericks, Carroll Shelley, (Matt Damon) a former driver and car designer, and hot-headed British driver Ken Miles (Christian Bale) and the suits at the Ford Motor Company and their interferences with them as their sponsors. Everyone's goal is to beat the No. 1 foreign sports carmaker, Ferrari, and put Ford on the map as a major competitive force in the global market.<br/><br/>The story is not your strictly race car movie with fast cars circling lap after lap. The plot does adhere to a predictable formula although the results aren't always that telling. The screenwriting team of Jez and John-Henry Butterworth and Jason Keller fashion a tried-and-true tale of underdogs fighting against the system, a them vs. us story that works. They wisely do not just rely on the action scenes and take the time to build characters and relationships in between the many terrific racing sequences: the family dynamics of Carroll's wife and son, the budding bromance between Carroll and Ken, the racer and his pit crew, the white collar executives in contrast to the blue collared working man, American know-how vs. European elitism, the psychology and engineering that is involved with this sport. The film tackles bigger issues than most sport movies aspire.<br/><br/>Actually, what added to my enjoyment of the film was my lack of knowledge about the real life events and the people involved. Far from being a race car enthusiast, my expectations about the movie were low and I was pleasantly surprised by this film's visually sweep. Credit the strong production values, fine acting, and masterful direction by Mr. Mangold.<br/><br/>Foremost is the incredible editing by Michael McCusker and Andrew Buckland. (Their cross-cutting of race car action and personal drama is a glorious showcase of intense images seamlessly crafted, especially the nearly half hour climactic sequence of the 1966 Le Mans race.) Phedon Papamichael's cinematography is stunning in every angle, FranÃ§ois Audouy's period production design is spot-on, and the sound by Donald Sylvester, Paul Massey, David Giammarco and Steven A. Morrow brings tension and the needed authenticity to the movie. Marco Beltrami and Buck Sanders' music score heightens the suspense most effectively. This is technically superior filmmaking, a well-made sports movie about the love of the sport.<br/><br/>Mr. Mangold's direction is solid if underrated. He crafts his film with style and substance. He also assembles a wonderful cast. Some may not be physically right for their roles but they deliver convincing performances throughout the movie. The chemistry with the two leads is a wonderful mix of contrasting personalities. Mr. Damon uses his likable screen persona and throws in some subtle angst and frustration to his character. Mr. Bale has the showier role but really excels in the film's quieter moments between him and his family. Both are excellent. Caitonia Balfe and Noah Jupe play Carroll's loyal wife, Mollie, and his adoring son, Peter, and they ably provide the human drama. Josh Lucas makes a very compelling villain. Rounding out the ensemble are Ray McKinnon, Remo Girone, JJ Feild, and Jon Bernthal as Lee Iacocca. Tracy Letts has a memorable spin as the tyrannical Henry Ford II in one of the film's best scenes.<br/><br/>Buckle up, moviegoers! Ford v Ferrari is an action-packed thrill ride and one of the most unexpected pleasures of 2019."

","Ford v. Ferrari isn't only the best racing movie of the decade, it's also one of 2019s years strongest films, and I'm just as surprised as you are reading that. I went in with relatively high expectations just due to the director, and I came out with a whole new appreciation for the sport. Mangold puts you front and forward in the action, with some really impressive shots, the technical aspects alone make this one worth watching. But at its core this is a character driven piece with two career best performances from Bale and Damon as Shelby and Miles, who not only have their own issues to deal with, but also that of the big Ford corporation, and a race they are not willing to lose. This film has a bit of everything, from the personal tolls this project has on Miles and his wife and kid, to the exciting 24 hour race, or the inner workings of big business and what crooks they can be, Ford v. Ferrari is a perfect crowd pleasing movie, and overall one that I personally can't wait to watch again.<br/><br/>I give Ford v. Ferrari 5 stars out of 5"

","I was really looking forward to watching Ford v Ferrari and I wasn't disappointed. The plot is engaging and based on a true story and the two leads have great chemistry. Rush also a racing film is one of my favourite films in recent years.<br/><br/>I loved the story and the bureaucracy they showed at Ford, which has parallels with large companies in the present day. The action is tightly edited and the race sequences are thrilling and exciting.<br/><br/>My only recommendation would have been to trim the run-time a little, as the first half of the film has a lot of set-up and exposition which could have been condensed.

","I am not a car person. I don't like the smell of them, I don't particularly like driving around in them, and I couldn't care less about petty differences between car companies. That being said, Ford v. Ferrari managed to win me over.<br/><br/>It took a subject matter I had no interest in and got me invested with endearing characters brought to life by great performances from Bale and Damon. This is a perfect movie to watch on a Sunday afternoon; it's predictable every step of the way, but it leaves you satisfied and even a little sad to say goodbye to these characters you've grown to love.<br/><br/>The only other James Mangold directed films I've seen were his two Wolverine films, and while Ford v. Ferrari is no where close to the quality of something like Logan, it does have that same emotionally honest quality that Mangold's other films have. FvF is fun, it's got a good pace to it, and it put a smile on my face. Sometimes the most predictable story is also the most satisfying."

In Ford vs Ferrari, we see a world of Alpha males who spar off in the corporate world and race track. Ford is belittled by Mr Ferrari and the Ford vs Ferrari feud begins. We see a corporate world of sharks with harsh words and a struggle to survive. On the race track, there is Damon (Shelby) and Bale (Miles) two alpha males who get into a fight but still are friends. Miles' Wife explains to Miles in one line: you survived W W 2 in a tank on D day all the way to the end of the war, after that experience nothing else scares Miles. Driving 220 miles was nothing, but an adrenaline rush. Shelby bet his company so Miles can drive. Era of risk takers with dirty tricks on the race track, mixed with guts and determination.
Ford vs Ferrari is a movie about a generation who pushed, and risked at a different time before safe spaces and the twitter mob. 8 stars."

"vballistic","8","1","2","1 December 2019"," The movie so misunderstood
","""High speed's and thrilling bumper to bumper sequences aren't the only things this movie has to offer. With it's touching bromance and charismatic characters Ford v Ferrari is an homage to the truly great Hollywood films of old, as it brings to life a great cinematic representation of one of racings most historical events and truly becomes a must see for everyone.""<br/><br/>On the surface, Ford v Ferrari is portrayed as a touch and go film for motoring enthusiasts, but after seeing the film that couldn't be further from the truth. Director James Mangold who's name is widely appreciated after films such as Logan and 3:10 to Yuma has really proven to the audience racing films are no longer just for a certain audience, but can be enjoyed by all in this exhilarating biopic. The movie really stands out through its main characters' bromance between Carroll Shelby and Ken Miles played by Matt Damon and Christian Bale, delivering some of their best acting yet.<br/><br/>The movie opens up with Matt Damon's Carroll Shelby winning the grueling 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1959 for the Aston Martin team before explaining that the victory was short-lived, as Shelby's racing career comes to an end due to heart complications. After being forced into retirement Shelby focusses on his vehicle design and sales career whilst at the same time the audience is introduced to the big boss of Ford: Henry Ford II played tremendously by Tracy Letts. This scene sets up the entire drive of the film as the big boss explains to all of his working staff that ford is coming to an end at the hands of bad business and poor vehicle manufacturing leading to Fords diminishing reputation. From here the movie kicks into gear as the idea of buying out Ferrari runs across Henry Ford from the marketing man Lee Lacocca (Jon Bernthal), but goes south and a rivalry is born as Ford wishes to beat Enzo Ferrari (Remo Girone) at his own game. At the 24 hours of Le Mans, which Ferrari has dominated over the years.<br/><br/>Matt Damon produces one of his best performances throughout his acting career within this film. Showing the audience a very likable, charismatic and enthusiastic Carroll Shelby who will stop at nothing to overcome the challenge laid out to him by ford. Another nice addition to this film is Ken Miles' wife Molly (Caitriona Balfe), who stands out as a badass in her own right as she knows what makes Ken really shiver in his boots, and in one great scene really makes the soon to be famous racing driver crap his pants. This movie holds a plethora of great characters and fantastic acting that will definitely have the academy keep a keen eye out heading forward towards the Oscars.<br/><br/>Another fantastic outline within this film is its score composed by Marco Beltrami and Buck Sanders which really captures the feeling of racing, from the intense drumming and guitar riffs to the loud trumpets of victory the score doesn't feel the slightest out of place as it sticks to the instrumentals that you would find in such a time period.<br/><br/>As much as this film is great there are some flaws that audience members will definitely take away with them. One glaring flaw is this films run time clocking in at two hours and thirty-two minutes. The film at some instances does feel like it begins to drag on a little, but this does thankfully become resolved as once the boredom begins to settle in it shoots back up to a thrilling pace which does seem to be great, but maybe a cutback on some of the more slower scenes would really help this film shine more within the audience. Another glaring flaw I noticed wasn't necessarily the movie itself, but it's marketing. The marketing seems to highlight one thing and one thing alone, and that is it's a car film. I understand yes it is essentially a car-based film, but it is also so much more with a great narrative about true success and fighting for a goal as well as just what it means to show fantastic sportsmanship. However, most of these highlights within the film are overshadowed within the trailers and previews with just racing which leads to only one certain audience really discussing this film, that audience being motor enthusiasts when in reality this movie is for everyone.<br/><br/>And finally, we come to the verdict of this film. As much as I enjoy this film I understand that people have differing opinions so instead of giving out a solid number out of ten I will leave a quick overview so you can decide whether to see the film for yourself. This is a high stake sports film with intense scenes and loveable characters that show great development as the story goes on. The film has an enigmatic score and really captures the feeling of racing in the 60's that really puts you on the edge of your seat as the characters resonate with the audience making this experience something amazing.<br/><br/>Written by:

"fmh_markbuys","9","1","2","30 November 2019"," You feel and taste the adrenaline!
","The movie Le Mans '66 is based on a actual happened story. In a nutshell, the Ford motor company was in the market to buy Ferrari in the early 60's However Ferrari utilized the offer of Ford to get an even better offer from FIAT. An unexpected strategic move which pissed off Henry Ford II in that way, he wanted to take revenge on Ferrari by beating their cars on the black side where Ferrari was dominant for years in a row. So therefore the race engineering group Shelby got involved in order to design and construct the perfect race-car which is able to put an end to Ferrari and its years of overwhelming victory force.
The key-players in this movie are Matt Damon who plays Shelby and Christian Bale who plays Ken Miles.
Le Mans 66 is showing in a somehow funny way how the Ford GT40 was re-invented and perfected for racing at Daytona and finally Le Mans. Funny to see how racing was done back in the good old days and how things got so changed throughout the years. For instance: the pitlane was not separated by a big wall at Le Mans, but was actually on the racetrack. Safety features such as.....which safety features??! In those days racing cars were designed with paper and pencil and constructed with hammer and screwdrivers, no robotics or any micromanagement tooling. Analysis of race data was done by engineers and racing drivers, not computers.
In the movie Le Mans 66 you feel like you are actually in the 60's. You feel the power of a 7ltr engine, the adrenaline rush of the drivers you can taste yourself. The only thing missing is the smell of gasoline and of exhausts. I say: Great movie!!!!"

","Ford v Ferrari is one hell of a ride and a fantastic movie from start to finish.<br/><br/>It's directed by James Mangold, he did Logan (2017) and Walk the Line (2005), and stars Matt Damon, Christian Bale and Jon Bernthal to name a few. When I first heard about it, all I knew was Mangold was in charge, and Damon and Bale were in it and I was already interested. And now that I've seen it...it's amazing.<br/><br/>Probably the best aspect of this movie is the directing. Mangold does a terrific job here and the movie looks and feels superb. There are sequences that'll just move you to the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>The performances are great as well, especially by Damon and Bale. Both their characters are an absolute joy to watch and the chemistry between them both is excellent. Bale's portrayal of Ken Miles is probably my favourite part of the movie. The character is just terrific and hilarious on the screen.<br/><br/>The start and first act of the movie may be a bit slow for some people (I understood why but still thought it was fine). Other than that, I don't really see a flaw or issue.<br/><br/>Ford v Ferrari is definitely one of the best movies in 2019.

"CANpatbuck3664","8","1","2","27 November 2019"," Ford v Ferrari is Well Made and Performs as Smoothly as the Cars it Idolizes
","While I'm going to have a couple of complaints from the script later, I want to highlight that it really does a great job developing 3 of the central characters to the film. Carroll Shelby is painted as driven but realistic, one eye on the prize and the other at keeping his team in line. He's passionate about his work but he's learned the hard way that his time in the driver's seat might have passed. I liked that he wasn't just a starry eyed dreamer and was fairly savvy about the challenges ahead and what doing business with Ford meant. Miles has similar traits, he loves to drive but reality hasn't always been kind to him either. He's very animated next to Shelby, both in his expression and his body language. But he has a deep knowledge of automotive work (makes sense, he's working as a mechanic when he's not racing) and a will to keep going. Miles and Shelby make a fantastic team, they form almost a yin and yang bond. I also thought Mollie Miles was a refreshing character. She's more active in the story than just a bystander, her love for her husband and her understanding of how amazing her husband's work was drawn with a light touch and I found their relationship to be genuinely sweet. The core players in this movie aren't just types (unfortunately that doesn't bleed over to the supporting characters... more on that later) and I think James Mangold and the screenwriters (Jez and John-Henry Butterworth, Jason Keller) did a good job presenting them as flawed but realistic people.<br/><br/>You're going to want the drama when watching a racing movie. Its inherent in the risk of the sport and there's plenty of it here. But you're also going to want to watch some racing sequences. This movie has lots of tense and tightly filmed scenes with the cars and they lived up to the billing in that respect. They're exciting and they also do great job weaving them in to service the plot (the scene where Shelby drive Henry Ford around to show him how dangerous racing can be was a favourite). There's the triumphant moments but there are also bits that underline the gravity and there's some big wrecks that also serve their purpose. The set decoration, the costuming and the cinematography are all on par and nicely put together (consistent with a big budget production) and I have nothing but praise for Ford v Ferrari for its visuals and the action<br/><br/>There's not only 1 A-list talent in the lead here but you have 2 of the best actors working in this movie and like I implied in the title, their performances hum along like the cars in the movie. Bale is the more expressive of the two, he's a fantastic actor and he completely throws himself into this role. He's known for being fully committed and the movie benefits from Bale's on screen antics. There are plenty of funny moments with Miles but Bale also knows how to grit his teeth and scowl just right when his character is pushing for that extra second off his time. Matt Damon is just a as good as Carroll Shelby, w0hile Bale walks the line between effective and overdoing it, he's more understated. But he's charming, his accent is on point and he's a compelling performer. I hadn't seen Caitriona Balfe in anything else but she absolutely held her own next to Bale and Damon. She's the most underrated performer in this and I was very impressed with her work. I liked Jon Bernthal, Noah Jupe and Tracy Letts in their respective supporting parts as well.<br/><br/>Ford v Ferrari performs like a car right off the assembly line but it did have a couple of minor issues that could have required a pit stop. I'll admit that the movie got me with an ending twist but otherwise the overall arc of the script is pretty predictable. You get the expected highs and lows, it never really shocked me or shifted into the next gear if you will. I can't get angry at a movie for being too well executed for what it wants to be but I could have used a couple of decisions that would have taken it off the beaten path. This also applies to the supporting characters. Leo Beebe has no dimension other than being a power hungry sycophant, Henry Ford II does nothing but scowl and growl and Peter Miles has little other to do than be concerned about his dad. For a movie that has so much put into it, it also would have benefited from a little extra added to those characters to flesh them out a little.<br/><br/>Ford v Ferrari crosses the finish line and it does so in style. All the facets of being a great sports movie are there with the acting, the camera work and the character development are all on point. I think it could have gone even farther but it is a good execution of a film in this genre and I can't fault it for that. I would actually grade this out at somewhere between a 8-9/10 but I have to round down in this case. I would definitely recommend seeing this on the big screen, it would add a lot to the action and help you enjoy the cinematography just that much more."

"Brad_G35","8","1","2","26 November 2019"," Exhilarating. Watch it even if you aren't a car fan.
","I was around cars as a child because of my dad and grandfather. I never took an interest in them though. I feel like this is the type of movie that could inspire an entire new generation of youngsters that want to race for a living.<br/><br/>Christian Bale is excellent! Matt Damon is excellent! The sound design and editing sticks out to me on this movie and it's almost sure to win Oscars because of that. The cinematography does a great job of immersing you in the races and making your heart race! It'll be interesting to see what other films step up to compete in cinematography. If none show up, this will likely take that category too(Although I hope Parasite takes it).<br/><br/>The script is good but I did find myself a little bored during parts of the character development scenes. Christian Bale is always Christian Bale but I do think Matt Damon was the stronger character here. I love Bale's movies and I'll always see them but Christian Bale reminded me of how he is for his role in The Fighter so in Oscar respects it's kind of an already been there done that kind of thing.<br/><br/>This movie brings up competition for me. While it seemed to be heavy back then, I'm curious how much of a cut-throat competition it is nowadays.<br/><br/>While this story favors America, I do think when it comes to industrial things or car-related things... American ingenuity is going to win out every time when it matters."

"helenbassett","10","1","2","26 November 2019"," Le Mans '66 Film Review - James Mangold Directs Ford v Ferrari With Matt Damon & Christian Bale - Not Just For Petrolheads
","James Mangold directs as Tracy Letts, playing rich dickhead Henry Ford II in Le Mans '66, (Ford v Ferrari), throws a spanner in the works, and tells his staff to come up with an answer to falling sales, or walk. And Jon Bernthal's Lee Iacocca puts his wheel nuts on the line, and tells Ford that no one aspires to buy a Ford. James Bond, (that degenerate), does not drive a Ford! Hell they all want Ferraris. Because they are thoroughbred sports cars winning the Le Mans 24 hour race. And Henry, thank god for Lee, actually thinks it's a good idea. So armed with a cheque book and pen, Lee flies to Italy to make Ferrari an offer. Maybe Remo Girone's Enzo played them, because he accepts another inflated Fiat offer. Not sure if it was already on the table, it would appear not. But with Ferrari in play Fiat took a swipe. And by the way Henry Ford is a fat pig Enzo tells Lee, as a parting shot. Who then repeats what he said to Henry. Rightly pissed Henry decides that Ford Motor Cars are going to build their own sports cars. And beat Ferrari at their own endurance race game.<br/><br/>But how? Well with Matt Damon's Carroll Shelby for a start. And the winner of the 1959 Le Mans has form. Retired due to a heart problem, in 1966 he's now building AC Cobras. Such a beautiful car. But to build a car to take on Ferrari is a different animal. And needs a pure racer, in the form of mouthy mechanic Christian Bale's Ken Miles, who's looking for the perfect lap. A wrench may be the sum of their abiding brotherly love for each other.<br/><br/>I cannot say I'm a fan of motor-racing, but Le Mans '66 had me on the edge of my seat, with definitely no drag in the 150 minute run time. But Ken Miles was not Ford's first choice of driver for their new GT40. Josh Lucas is the nasty Leo Beebe, soon to be Ford Racing Director, and determined to keep him off the team. He and Ken get off to a bad start with the unveiling of the new Ford Mustang. And Ken does have the sort of temperament to say anything on camera. That makes the Ford suits a little uneasy! But you have to love Christian Bales's bluntness. I feel sure this is another Oscar worthy performance from Bale, among a very talented cast. And he spars well with wife Mollie, played by Catriona Balfe, and Noah Jupe is his adoring son. But Ken has to drive because it's in his blood. Fuelled by British tea. And he has the courage to drive a car at 218mph in the Le Mans Mulsanne Straight. The GT40's top speed, as Ferrari looked on. Let's just hope the car can hold it together, with a throaty engine shoehorned in. And pray the brakes don't give out. As Shelby says, at 7,000 revs man becomes machine, and James Mangold makes you feel every one of them.<br/><br/>But Ford's entry into Le Mans was not without disaster. And when Henry Ford II is idling in the slow lane on the track with Shelby one day, he puts his money where his mouth is. And through the tears, tells Shelby to go to war. The driving seat is now 48 year old former tank driver Ken's to lose. But first he has to win the 24 Hour Daytona.<br/><br/>I cannot pretend to know much about the technology of the car, but I thought Ray McKinnon's Phil Remington adding go faster strips was great fun. They were really for the aerodynamics of the car! But what a rocket blast. Behind the scenes below explains better with Christian Bale.<br/><br/>With cinematography by Phedon Papamichael, amazing photography and a cracking storyline, James Mangold proves that a driving based film can have massive appeal to all. A terrific job."

"slightlymad22","9","1","2","26 November 2019"," Top 5 Movie Of The Year
","I just got out of Le Mans '66 (Ford V Ferrari)<br/><br/>I'll admit, right off, I do not like racing movies for two reasons 1, I have no interest in motor racing and 2, the movies always have the same problem, boredom (the cars go round and round) and predictability (the hero wins) but i'd heard good things about this one and it's James Mangold (Copland, Logan, Walk The Line) so I went to see it.<br/><br/>First off, it is not really about the company of Ford versus the company of Ferrari, maybe that's why it is called Le Mans '66 in the UK. Carol Shelby (Damon) is hired to create a car to win Le Mans '66 by Ford, he insists on having Ken Miles (Bale) help him and be the driver. The suits at Ford do not want Miles driving and attempt to drop or undermine him every chance they get, as Shelby and Mild try to design said car in 90 days en route to Le Man's '66. So really it's Shelby & Miles versus the suits of Ford, whilst Ford wants to beat Ferrari.<br/><br/>I loved the performances, Bale and Damon are both great, Bale just steals every scene, he is the heart of the movie, you root for him, he is the underdog, because Ford don't want him as the face of the company!! You never root for Ford, truthfully, I never cared about the Ford V Ferrari thing at all. I just wanted Bale and Damon to succeed. Despite being nasty to the Americans at the beginning, at least Enzo Ferrari cared about what he was doing and the sport of motor racing and he had some honour. Henry Ford didn't care about the car or the sport. He just wanted to turn around decking sales and was mad at Ferrari over an insult.<br/><br/>I think I enjoyed it so much as it didn't really focus on the racing aspect, if you are expecting a racing movie, you will be disappointed. It focused more on the making of the car and the various relationships. You don't need to know about racing to enjoy this movie, it's about the characters.<br/><br/>Everyone knocks it out of the park!! Not just the main actors the supporting actors too, Josh Lucas is in this and of course he is a d*ck, isn't he always!! I mean I really hated him, I couldn't wait to see him get knocked out!! Ray McKinnon is great too, every time he was on screen, I was trying to place him, an IMDB search reveals he was Bradley in A Perfect World.<br/><br/>If I had one complaint, and it's only minor it's Jon Bernthal, he is great, it is his idea for Ford to enter the world of racing, he chose and is Damon's biggest supporter and then he just disappears or is relegated to the background or if he is in shot not speaking , he is an important part of the first half of the movie then he doesn't speak for the second!!<br/><br/>Top 5 movie of the year for me."

"ssnake_z","10","1","2","25 November 2019"," The Perfect Lap
","FORD v FERRARI
RATING: 4.9/5<br/><br/>Yeah, Ford v Ferrari is definitely my favorite movie of the year. It's been years since i felt like i was watching actual movie stars on the big screen. It was great to have that feeling in the theater again, thanks to Christian Bale and Matt Damon. Same goes for the supporting actors. There were no phoned in performances, everyone showed up to play, even the kid. Not to mention, the 2 1/2 hour run time just flies by, as the film jumps from situation to situation. The story is tight. No subplots, no fat to really trim. This movie knows exactly where it's going and the road it needs to take to get there. No detours, probably because it's based off the true story of when Ford beat the dominant Ferrari at the prestigious 24 hour Le Mans race back in 1966. The movie is actually called ""Le Mans '66"" in some countries. It's considered the Super Bowl of racing, for many race enthusiasts.<br/><br/>Anyways, the film takes place in the 60s but it feels very modern because they spend all their time either racing or working on cars, giving it almost a timeless quality. I was iffy on the musical score but after watching the movie twice, i noticed the score would get me anxious during the race scenes (4DX is the preferred way to watch this movie). My leg would start shaking and I'd get this feeling that i had to go fast. As someone that likes driving fast, that's pretty impressive, so the score definitely does a great job of immersing you in these races, and not overpowering the scenes. Cinematography is spot on. There's a moment where they're racing at night, in the rain, and it just made me super anxious. If you've ever driven in hard rain before, going 60 mph or more, you should be able to grasp the concept of how dangerous it is going over 150 mph, with other cars trying to pass you. This is a great looking movie.<br/><br/>I'm really struggling to find negative things to say about this movie, so I'm going to address some of the negative things I've heard in reviews I've seen.
<ul><li>TOO MANY WHITE PEOPLE:</li></ul>Yes, the movie is filled with white men, and one white woman, so there's not a lot of diversity here, if that's what you're looking for. Remember, it's based off a true story that takes place in the 60s, ""Mad Men"" era. Knocking a movie for trying to be accurate to reality is just not smart at all.
<ul><li>NO CHARACTER GROWTH:</li></ul>Someone said there was no real character growth in the movie. In the final race, a big thing happens for one of the characters, that practically took a lifetime of growth as a person for them to accomplish. It's even acknowledged by other characters in the movie. It's just nonsense to say there was no character development.
-????:
One reviewer was hoping to see the engine built from the ground up and was disappointed that's not what they got in the film. I mean, the story being told wasn't about the car being built from scratch. The Ford Racing program already existed before Ford ever decided to take on Ferrari. This was about Ken Miles and Carol Shelby being brought on board to do the impossible with what was already there at Ford. This reviewer wanted a different movie.
<ul><li>CLIMATE CHANGE:</li></ul>Yeah, that reviewer was full of it. LOL<br/><br/>Ultimately, even if someone is not into racing, i think the concepts in the movie are extremely accessible. There are so many themes going through this movie, you're bound to find one that you can get behind. The story of man and machine, creators v. big business, innovation against time, being the best versus being a team player, etc... there's a lot of commentary going on just beneath the surface. The movie is a great snapshot of the American Spirit. It takes place around the time America landed on the moon. Around the time when American exceptionalism was arguably at its height. The Ford GT40 is practically a representation of the American Spirit, America potential. The impossible made real. It's magic, and so is this movie.<br/><br/>SIDE NOTE:
Ford decided to go back to Le Mans in 2016, for the 50th anniversary of the Ford GT40 win in 1966, and they won! Like i said, that car, that racing program, is simply magic."

"mohan59","8","1","2","24 November 2019"," Very enjoyable and entertaining
","This is a pleasantly surprising film. Partly because of the narrative - I was expecting a pro-Ford take on the celebrated rivalry, after having seen the Amazon documentary (I think it's called the 24 hour race or something). I was proved wrong.<br/><br/>By choosing to focus on the two primary characters (superbly portrayed by Matt Damon and Christian Bale), James Mangold's gamble pays off handsomely in this tale of man and machine against all odds. Ford vs Ferrari is as much as Miles-Shelby's dogged perseverance against stumbling blocks from their own backers as it is against their iconic European counterparts. Their partnership is chalk and cheese - the diplomatic Shelby complementing the ""difficult"" Miles but it works remarkably well. There is a good reason the American calls the Brit ""Bulldog"" as Miles' tenacious pursuit of the perfect lap motivates people around him to go further. The action and humor prove an effective blend in driving the narrative forward. The cinematography, score and sound design are expertly done, capturing the intimacy of characters' personal lives as well as the frenzied restlessness of race days.<br/><br/>In terms of performances, Bale and Damon have a terrific chemistry and Mangold exploits it shrewdly. While Bale tends to overact in some scenes (his facial expressions border on the ridiculous sometimes), he nails the eccentricities of a war veteran-turned-race-driver character to perfection. Unlike others, I did not find his accent surprising, but his preparation and dedication to his craft continue to leave a lasting impression. That said, this film completely belongs to Damon. He has the best scenes, the best lines and the meatiest character. His Texan drawl may not be pitch-perfect, but his control and restraint form the essence to the story as well as a ideal icy foil to Bale's hot-headed, fiery persona. The supporting cast is quite decent, though I was disappointed to not see the John Bernthal get more screen time.<br/><br/>Ford v Ferrari wins not because of the titular rivalry, but inspite of it. A very enjoyable and entertaining racing film."

The movie managed to tell us a complete and heartbreaking story that involved conflicts on different levels. Miles (Christian Bale) and Shelby (Matt Damon) against the interests of Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas), Ford vs Ferrari, the expectations of Henry Ford II, the feeling of being a great racing driver but also a great role model for your son.

"doudoudette","8","1","2","24 November 2019"," A Masterful Account of the Chronicles of Ford v. Ferrari
","It is the 1960s, Ferrari is reigning as king of race cars, while Ford has gained a reputation for mass production of uniform road machines. When a buyout goes sour, the biggest grudge match, or the longest, is about to catch the world by surprise.<br/><br/>As someone unaware of the dramatics of the racing world, I hesitated about going into the cinema for it. Ford v. Ferrari already sounds like a pissing contest between corporates. Well, it definitely is something of that nature, except the backstory and the act itself proves to be much more thrilling than you'd imagine. The amount of 1960s corporate suits didn't bother me at all. The cast is stellar, without a doubt, Matt Damon is so incredibly in control of his talent, capable of convincing the audience he IS Carroll Shelby, even if Damon himself is not a car guy at all. This says much about how good the screenplay is, based on a book of all real events. Christian Bale is as usual, on a ride with his A-game. The distinct mannerism of the racing Hall of Famer Ken Miles is immortalized through Bale's careful craft, borne of his unshakable dedication to the art of cinema. In fact, the whole cast shines so brightly through the movie, from Josh Lucas, Jon Bernthal to Outlander's Caitriona Balfe, each woven into the main narrative in an organic yet unneglectable way without much drag or distraction. Also, using all real racing cars instead of SFX for the important car racing scenes definitely pays off on the big screen. The camera angles are brilliant in capture those 200 million-dollar cars in motion. As a girl, I love the racing segments!<br/><br/>More than just a car movie, the 2.5 hours boasts with comedy, thrills, and dramatic revelations that in the end, all make sense during the climax. To me, there wasn't a moment wasted, and my second viewing became even more entertaining, ripe with ""a-ha"" moments. I am definitely gonna pick up the book it's based on, Go Like Hell by A. J. Baime. Can I also just note how wonderful the soundtracks are? Without a doubt, the engine sound is probably more center-stage in the film, making the just-right amount of epic score and songs much appreciable along the way."
"PotassiumMan","8","1","2","24 November 2019"," Thrilling race car film will succeeds with flying colors
","Christian Bale and Matt Damon co-star in this vigorously-executed depiction of Ford Motor Company's full-on attempt to compete with Ferrari in the 24-hour race in Le Mans in 1966. This race is expertly recaptured in some of the most well-executed race car scenes in history. Along with exceptional period detail, there is also a riveting soundtrack to help the pacing.<br/><br/>Bale gives a feral performance as Ken Miles, the combustible British race car driver who test-drove and helped develop the first Ford vehicle that could go head-to-head with Ferrari in Le Mans. Matt Damon gives a down-to-earth performance as Carroll Shelby, the retired race car driver who worked together with Miles and Ford on the groundbreaking race car. Tracy Letts is an authoritative presence as Henry Ford II, who was initially reluctant to get involved in the race car enterprise but eventually saw a new opening for the automaking giant.<br/><br/>The film's narrative is guided by the sure hand of James Mangold's direction. Although the film proceeds initially at a deliberate pace, you gradually become invested and develop a firm rooting interest. Bale and Damon play well off each other and become a heroic duo fighting for both American interests abroad and against corporate chicanery within the Ford Motor Company. All in all, the film will take your breath away. It is proof that sometimes good old-fashioned storytelling aided by strong performances are all you need. Enthusiastically recommended."

","Ford V Ferrari is about Ford wanting to win the le moz race. To do this they hire some of the best in the business, but to win the race they go through many problems.<br/><br/>Since I found out about this film over the summer, I have been really looking forward to it. I couldn't contain my self since the first trailer came out. It is a movie with Christian Bale and Matt Damon. When I walked out of the theatre was happy with what I got. It wasn't a perfect film, but I still was happy and enjoyed my time in the theatre. The acting was the best part of the film. You obviously know that a film with Matt Damon AND Christian Bale is going to be really good. Those two are a great pair and should work with each other in many more movies.
The cinematography was surprisingly good. They had some tough tasks and they executed them really well. The race scene were spectacular. James Mangold nailed these scenes. The last two races were real nail biters. They got your heart pounding for the whole time. In the last race James Mangold decided to put some comedic relief. I am glad he did that because my heart would have came out of my chest if he didn't! The only flaw I saw with the film was the first act. It felt like it could have been made better. It dragged a little bit and it just wasn't as solid as the rest of the movie. It wasn't terrible it just couldn't hold up from how good the rest of the movie was.<br/><br/>Overall, Ford V Ferrari was a great film I would recommend in theaters for sure."

","What an amazing movie and stellar performance from Christian Bale. In fact the whole movie is not about LeMans or Ford, but about this wonderful character Ken Miles. After seeing the movie I guessed it was all exaggeration Ã  la Hollywood, but after doing some digging I came to the conclusion it was all historically correct. He was really that brilliant test/racing driver and engineer, mainly responsible for the development of the GT40. Disliked by the Ford management because of his attitude and outspoken opinions and robbed from his LeMans victory by these same people. Besides the story, the racing is visually stunning and the CGI crashes make you duck in your seat. A masterpiece you should watch on the big screen. Only criticism is the stupid Fast and Furious like shifting and turbo noise when the engine is pushed towards 7000rpm. Why Hollywood, why?"

","Not just for Enzo Ferrari, but also for Henry Ford II, Shelby, the cars, the tracks, and especially, the star of the show, not-a-people-person Ken ""Bulldog"" Miles. I learn so many deep lessons from it. Like the race itself, every shot, every act, every background music was delivered with vision, ambition, courage, hope, and willingness to take and overcome any kind of risk and challenges on its path. Matt Damon delivers it, Christian Bale kills it (not the british accent tho, it's a little bit weird) and the ending..... the ending, !! it broke my heart, but what can I say other than reality (sometimes) sucks? Every movie fan would like it, every race car lover would love it, and there's me, who enjoy every second of two and a half hours of it, from title to the end credits."

Although the trailer makes you think it's all about Ford and Ferrari, the movie is actually the story of Ken Miles. Wich was, in my opinion, much more interesting.

","Overall, it's an entertaining story for those who know little of the actual timeline of events but the full story would have taken a six hour movie to be accurate. So they've taken a decade-plus series of events and compressed them into a one year tale that's filled with excitement and drama.<br/><br/>For 60's racing fans, and antique car buffs in general, there is plenty of eye candy that should satisfy, although I'm sure many of the race cars shown are most likely CGI; it's hard to tell anymore."

"k_grall","8","3","12","15 November 2019"," Actual racing provides a visceral, visual punch, which I appreciated
","This is a sports movie that I want to compare with Borg v McEnroe and perhaps Rocky. And this movie just falls a little short of those movies, for me. Perhaps it is that car-racing requires such complicated mechanics in a team-effort to be successful, as compared to a simpler pathos in one individual's endeavour.<br/><br/>Also, I am wary of a film trying to bring me in with its *wink**wink*intheknow knowlege of cars and jargonist language about cars. It's meant to explain things to a viewer and bring them in, and mock the characters that ought to be mocked (because we're intheknow, and they aren't). For some reason, I was aware of and resisted such attempts. Alongside my experience here, the storyline was adequate and just escaped being hokey, and the characters were adequately pitiable and relatable.<br/><br/>What I was really impressed by was the foregrounding of the LeMans lap, and then visually punching us with that pre-knowledge when the actual race was on. The scenes were visceral and this boosted my rating.<br/><br/>I thought the edit and shots taken and varied between close-up and other were all done well. Would love to compare shots with Logan, Walk the Line or Copland, just to see.<br/><br/>Matt Damon does his best Tommy Lee Jones impression with his voice, I thought. Just throwing that out there.<br/><br/>An alright film, and probably better than other car-racing films. Car-racing? why not, just for this story."

I have always been critical of the 1971 Le Mans movie mainly due to the seemingly tacked on love story presumably put in on the behest of the studio to make it a movie rather than a documentary of the 1970 Le Mans race.<br/><br/>However now that I have seen the latest Le Mans movie I have a nostalgic yearning for a movie with a pointless incomprehensible love story sparingly threaded in between fantastic racing footage and non CGI stunt work.<br/><br/>Which is the complete opposite to what you get in Le Mans 66 which has instead threaded rather sparsely CGI heavy Le Mans racing footage in to a Bale/Damon star vehicle<br/><br/>At nearly 3 hours long it feels like watching a less than classic year at the 24 hours of Le Mans in its entirety, the story of how Henry Ford 2nd anger at Enzo Ferrari's apparent deception in Fords attempt to buy Ferrari is over simplified and rushed which would leave a viewer who had little or no knowledge of the true story behind the film baffled as to why Henry Ford was enraged enough to throw so much money at the GT40 project.<br/><br/>Anyway eventually about just over half the movie run time we get to Le Mans in 1966 and we start to get what we paid for 'classic cars racing in a classic race' albeit CGI'd to the max.<br/><br/>My advice wait for the movie to get on the streaming sites so you can fast forward through the porridge."
"jamesjustice-92","6","2","7","26 November 2019"," Not a rivalry movie
","When you see ""v"" or ""vs"" in the title of the movie you naturally assume that it would be about a rivalry between the two of the main heroes and this movie can disappoint a lot considering it's absolutely not about that. But if you put aside a misleading title you can have a lot of fun along the way. Matt Damon and Christian Bale are a hell of a team and you enjoy every second of their truly outstanding performances. Bale delivering his lines in his native British accent nails it perfectly whereas Damon's attempts at southern accent executed not always flawlessly but still very good; overall the movie feels really unimportant, with no clear meaning behind it - it is a part of the big company's history and not much of a story in my opinion. We don't see the characters grow, their backgrounds don't change; the only thing that's impressive besides the two main actors are race car sequences but we can watch the sports channel for that which makes this all in all good movie absolutely unnecessary to watch."
"Pjtaylor-96-138044","7","2","7","17 November 2019"," Get your kicks at Le Mans '66.
","'Le Mans '66 (2019)', known simply as 'Ford V Ferrari' in America, is a sports biopic that aims to tell the story of the two men who forged Ford's first racing car. While it initially seems as though it's going to get lost in the corporate politics of car manufacturing, it soon becomes clear that it's far more concerned with its two leads and their strained-but-loving dynamic. By doing this, it skirts the usual biopic issue of cramming a hundred-and-one life events into a two-hour run-time whether they're really relevant or not. Basically, it crafts a compelling narrative from its 'real life' story, adapting things in a very satisfying way. The lead performances are up there with the best of the year, a chalk-and-cheese duo who light up the screen whenever they're on it. Bale, especially, is fantastic, sporting an accent and a slimmer frame in his typical chameleon way. Another star is director Mangold, whose assured direction makes for an engaging experience both on and off the race-track. The racing scenes are the thing's highlight, though; they're fast, suspenseful and technically sound. The piece manages to get you invested in the inner workings of such driving, and such cars, even if you've never given it a thought before. This allows everyone to be on the same page for the stunning finale, which is certainly an edge-or-your-seat sequence. The affair makes a point to take a step back now and again, slowing down for often overlooked character moments and rumination on the hidden beauty of racing. Indeed, it feels like a car fan's dream, dipping into the intricacies of bespoke car manufacturing while featuring a bevy of sleek vehicles, to boot. It isn't exclusively for this crowd, however. The story is resonant and the characters are well-rounded. It is a bit straight white male centric, having only one female character and relegating any people of colour to background roles. It feels old-fashioned in that sense, like a film from the period in which it's set. While better representation would be appreciated, its absence doesn't feel like a product of malice so much as an attempt to convey some sort of 'period realism'. Its plot does feel rather 'us v them', primarily because it associates Ford with America and Ferrari with Italy. Ford, the man, even seems to have a racial motivation, although this could be an unintended result of an early xenophobic comment. Really, though, the decision to position a massive corporation as an underdog is simply to fuel better drama. Still, these are pretty much the picture's only major flaws. It's a good movie that fans of its focal sport should get even more out of than I do. 7/10"

","James Mangold is slowly becoming one of the greatest directors working today, with a string of incredible films in a row, which include 3:10 to Yuma, Logan, and now Ford v Ferrari. There seems to be a debate amongst cinephiles which the better film is between Logan and Ford v Ferrari. Whilst Logan is an incredible film, I actually prefer Ford v Ferrari.<br/><br/>The two actors which really stand out in the film are clearly Christian Bale and Matt Damon, as Ken Miles and Carroll Shelby, but I also really liked Jon Bernthal and Noah Jupe in the film. That being said, there wasn't a bad performance across the board and everyone fit nicely in their roles.<br/><br/>The actual narrative of the story was directed in such a gripping and compelling way, and I was locked in the whole time. This is based on a true story, but I was experiencing what happened for the first time while watching the film and it had such an impact on me. I really like films of this nature, which deal between the rivalry of two people or companies.<br/><br/>The cinematography was beautiful, and I have to give major praise to the sound. This was especially noticeable in the last half an hour, and it really added to the excitement of the finalÃ©.<br/><br/>I don't have any real criticisms with the film, other than the fact that I think the second and third act are much better than the first. I still found the first act to be great, but the film is quite long and I definitely thought that it picked up the pace nicely after the first act was done.<br/><br/>Overall, Ford v Ferrari is an incredibly well-directed film, with powerful performances, an exciting ending, and some of the best visuals and sound from any picture in recent memory.<br/><br/>SCORE: 95%"

","But pobably even better if you're really into cars, but good anyway. There is a lot of technical car stuff, I wonder what someone with a true understanding of racing and car engineering thinks/feels watching this movie, how much is on point? Beacuse it's some technical talk going on and stuff like that, about cars and racing. I personally don't know anything about it, I like racing video games but don't actually know that much about cars. But there is some beautiful cars in this movie, really mesmerizing. Acting is good too, on most accounts, especially Bale off course, but he already proven to be a great method character actor by this point, it will be intresting to see what he does next in his career. The story is off course very predictable if you already know the true story, which I actually did, but it was very good watch anyway, inspiring and tragic. Cinematography and sound outstanding. Also some humor and drama which both worked.<br/><br/>But the most beautiful parts of this movie, that I will carry with and that I didn't know that it would actually have a good impact, is the brotherly friendship between Miles and Shelby. Also their passion and drive. And the comment: ""you can't win a race with a committee."" Amazing and true about so many things, too many opinions of too many people that want to control a thing to what they want it to be, never works. It usually does the opposite of what it is set out to do.<br/><br/>Anyway, beside the big tragedy of Ken Miles, a real character and a genius it seems he was a tale of victory and success. All in all, a very good movie. I think it's even better if you truly know car stuff though, but it's good either way. I would recommend this movie to anyone."

","A good movie I watched in 2020 is also the best racing and sports movie I have seen in recent years. From the very beginning of the movie, Ken's respect for the game, his understanding of the car, and his grasp of every corner, all showed the highest professional quality of the athletes. I saw the supremacy of sports in him, but it was very helpless. Sports is a game between pure capital. In the eyes of capitalists, sometimes winning or losing is not the key. The most important thing is how to use means to ensure the maximum benefit. There is no winning or losing. Only the pros and cons are completely contrary to the spirit of sports. Ken also made several psychological struggles in the car on the last lap. At such a fast speed, he still had to make a choice of thoughts. He was really helpless in tears. On the other hand, in order to compete with absolute speed, even if the vehicle is out of control, Enzo Ferrari is basically on the scene throughout the game. The Italians themselves are worthy of respect;"

","I was never interested in racing movies but as i love the main actors i thought about to give it a chance. They didn't disappoint me. Got lot of background information about all this racing stuff and cause it's a biography i also notices lot of interesting things about cars, Ford, Ferrari etc. Even when you don't like racing, the acting is so authentic from Bale & Damon, you will love it. Furthermore i was surprised about Tracy Letts, loved his performance als Henry Ford II. Of course there are also a few car races in the movie.

"syqcs","8","1","3","20 March 2020"," Ford v Ferrari
","The director didn't praise Ford by belittling Ferrari. On the contrary, Ferrari is a very respectable company. Ford's executives are selfish, hypocritical and sophisticated. When Le Mans announced that the championship was McLaren, everyone went to cheer for McLaren, only Enzo Ferrari took off his hat to salute Ken. Enzo Ferrari, 68, was a real racing fan after watching the whole race in Le Mans, and Henry Ford left in a helicopter after watching half of the race and didn't come back until the end of the race. Leo, Ford's vice president, always wanted to get wind and rain. Ken was not as respectful to him as other people, which made him feel very unhappy. So he had to retaliate Ken by mean of despicable means. If Ken can win the Le Mans championship, his face is also gilded as a vice president, but he would rather not gilded his face than be willing to be better. This is the highest level of baseness - to harm others but not to benefit yourself. It's not better drivers than Ken who beat him. It's business operations and bureaucracy. It's a dark system of humanity and corruption. The biggest enemy of drivers and athletes is not competitors, but those enterprises and people who violate the spirit of sports."

Yet when I nearly stopped watching, it wasn't because I was bored nor because there was something wrong with the film, it was because it was so intense, I was getting too stressed out.

"bankofmarquis","9","1","3","25 November 2019"," Great chemistry between Bale and Damon
","Most people are attending - or staying away from - the new James Mangold film, FORD v FERRARI because it is a ""race car flick"". But to label it as just that is doing a disservice to this film, so if that is what is keeping you away from this movie, think again, for this film is much more than a race car film.<br/><br/>It is, at it's core, a film about friendship and loyalty in the face of adversity and is a very serious contender for multiple awards this Oscar season.<br/><br/>A long gestating film project (Director Mangold first came across this property in 2010), FORD v FERRARI tells the tale of the Ford Motor Company's attempt to unseat the Italian car company, Ferrari, as an elite race car producer by defeating it on it's own turf - the 24 hour race at LeMans.<br/><br/>Entrusted to make this dream a reality by Henry Ford II (Tracy Letts) is (now) legendary race car designer Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) who turns to his reckless friend - and top race car driver - Ken Miles (Christian Bale) to help put this project over the top.<br/><br/>Will this duo succeed? Will Ford topple Ferrari? Can Shelby help smooth the rough waters that the temperamental Miles will, inevitably, create? What do you think?<br/><br/>But it is the journey - and not the destination - that is the joy of this film, for under the watchful, steady eye of veteran Director Mangold (WALK THE LINE) this film is much, much more than the cliched journey of a maverick bucking the system to, ultimately, prevail. It is a study of friendship and loyalty under intense pressure and Mangold finds the right balance between showing hardcore racing and the friendship and camaraderie of Miles and Shelby.<br/><br/>Mangold, of course, smartly knew that the success (or failure) of this film will rest on the chemistry between the two leads of this film - and he cast them well. Matt Damon brings his usual charm and easy-going attitude to Carroll Shelby, making him the heart and anchor of this film - we see the events unfold through his eyes - and he is a an easy stand-in for the audience during the proceedings and is someone that we are happy, and comfortable, to spend the 2 1/2 hours of this film with.<br/><br/>This is good, for he is strongly complimented - and challenged - by the hard intensity that Christian Bale brings to his portrayal of Ken Miles. This real-life racing car legend is driven (pun intended) to excellence, and does not suffer fools gladly. We spend a good amount of time in this film with Miles staring intently out the window of his race car and no one does smoldering, staring intensity better than Bale. This is another Oscar-worthy performance by an actor who has made a career of Oscar-worthy performances and has me asking - is he the finest actor working today? He certainly is in the conversation.<br/><br/>Bale and Damon play off each other very well, their chemistry seems real and we believe that these are 2 old friends working together. This is the first pairing of these two, and based on these results, I would guess that we'll be seeing these two in a film together again.<br/><br/>They are joined by strong supporting work by the likes of Letts, Jon Bernthal (portraying Lee Iacocca) and Caitriona Balfe (as Miles wife, Mollie). Only Josh Lucas (as the a-hole antagonist of the film) fares less well as his character is written in one note and Lucas just plays that note.<br/><br/>The racing scenes are well done - giving us the visceral intensity of what it must be like in the car, and in the pits, of a major race experience. But it is the friendship between Miles and Shelby that really is the engine that drives this film.<br/><br/>Letter Grade: A<br/><br/>9 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)"
"marcusfernandez-28887","10","1","3","25 November 2019"," Look out there. Out there is the perfect lap. You see it?
","Ford v Ferrari tells the incredible true story set in the 1960s, the movie follows the renowned ex racer, Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon), a short tempered and mildly arrogant but extremely talented driver Ken Miles (Christian Bale) as they attempt to beat the Ferrari, the fastest car at the time with a Ford in the famous 24 hours of Le Mans.<br/><br/>Arguably one of the most talented directors working today, James Mangold is a steady hand at the helm of this two-and-a-half-hour experience. The film's brilliance is however not the result of any single cog working to perfection but every moving part working in tandem to build a flawless machine. The direction, the editing, the performances, the score, the production design, Ford v Ferrari very literally fires on all cylinders.<br/><br/>With a film centred on race cars and the thrill of 7000 RPM, turning the film into an unofficial Fast and Furious sequel is an unfortunate possibility. Mangold however sought something deeper than the action with this film, something more profound. At its heart Ford v Ferrari is about character and a powerful friendship. Ken Miles is a brash, often rude driver and car mechanic, a man whose real home is behind the wheel or under the hood. Shelby is a man haunted by his days of glory yet determined to push his cars across the finish line. Meanwhile the Ford Motor Company desperately searches for a revival in business, they eventually find hope for their company on the racetrack, challenging the mighty Ferrari in the 24 hours of Le Mans. Shelby, the only American who has ever won the Le Mans and Miles, the only driver who could give Ford a fighting chance tirelessly begin their work building the ultimate speed machine. The real story in this journey is the friendship between these two men and the tireless pursuit for excellence.<br/><br/>Christian Bale once again disappears into his character, after portraying Dick Cheney in Vice, Ken Miles is a starkly different character especially physically and yet again Bale pulls off an incredible physical transformation proving once again his unbelievable commitment to his craft. Miles goes through perhaps the most elaborate emotional arcs of any character in the film, a passion for cars, a family to support, and an intolerance for the polished self-importance of big corporations. Bale conveys the sophistication of this character with ease, he becomes Miles enchanting the audience with a brash charm delivering a performance that is nothing short of Oscar worthy.<br/><br/>Carroll Shelby is perhaps the one man who really understands Miles, the only man who sees the real brilliance of Miles and perhaps the only true friend Mile has. Damon gives this performance the force it deserves portraying a great American car manufacturer who believed in excellence and who truly understood what it took to carry home a Le Mans victory. Shelby is the audience's character, we see experience the film in his shoes, we understand the difficulty of the decisions he is forced to make, we feel the victories, the defeats and the pain with Shelby and Matt Damon brings that emotional range to his performance which again is worthy of the highest honours.<br/><br/>When the film does hit the racetrack, when the audience is put behind the wheel, the film reveals a whole new adrenaline rush. The races are jaw droppingly brilliant. The film gives the car fanatics exactly what they want and more, the growl of the engines, the burning rubber, the screeching metal, the thrill of the race, it's all dialled to eleven. The sequences are masterfully shot, the camera is low and tight, interiors are close to the driver, we feel their heart pound as they knock the car into fifth gear, the exteriors shots are close to the ground, we see the sparks and rubble fly, we feel the heat. The grit and danger of a race is perfectly portrayed, nothing is predictable, no one is safe. Mangold creates a claustrophobic, tense yet realistic portrayal of a race giving the audience some of the greatest race sequences perhaps of all time.<br/><br/>Ford v Ferrari is one of 2019's most entertaining experiences while telling a compelling and emotional story at the same time. There is not a moment the film takes its foot of the gas, no missed opportunities, no weak performances, no broken moments. The film is clear contender for the best of the year and is certainly worthy of the title, not only is it a cut above most of the year's filmography but it will likely stand the test of time to cement a place in Hollywood's finest moments. In a powerful moment with his son Ken Miles says, Out there is the perfect lap. You see it? As far as movies go, Ford v Ferrari is the perfect lap."

The fistfight between Shelby and Miles made me laugh out loud in the theater. I heard some other laughs in the audience. I'm surprised that I understood it, since I don't know much about Le Mans (I'm an F1 mega fan). The scenes with Mollie and Peter are also nice. I especially enjoyed it because I watched it with my dad (another motorsport fan). The jokes are also enjoyable, even if they aren't meant to be jokes. Matt Damon and Christian Bale acted well. My favorite scenes were the ones where after Miles drove a car, he'd go into some mega explaining mode about how the car needs to be improved. He'd say things like ""Oh, the steering is too loose,"" or ""The engine needs to be bigger,"" or ""The car is way too damn heavy!"" Those made me laugh a lot. I recommend this to anyone 13 and up.

"andrewroy-04316","7","1","3","20 November 2019"," Go in expecting an exhilarating racing story and not a thoughtful human story, and you'll be thrilled
","There is a lot to love and a lot to be frustrated about in Ford v Ferrari, which seems to be becoming a trend in Mangold movies (except The Wolverine - there's truly nothing to love in that horribly misguided movie). It is certainly an exhilarating car movie and underdog sports movie at its core, and the racing scenes are gorgeous and put the audience right into the driver's seat. It's a tight script which particularly shines in its dialogues between Shelby and the Ford execs or Ken. Bale is absolutely amazing, stealing every scene and injecting joy into all of the racing scenes.<br/><br/>The biggest flaw of the movie is its apparent disinterest in its characters. Shelby is a great example of this - with the background we get early, I wanted some allusion or discussion of how he's devastated he can no longer race but loves being a part of the journey with Ken. None of that was ever implied, and that also gets at a larger and apparently controversial take: Damon's performance was disappointing. He was completely opaque and detached, never successfully selling me the anger with Ford or the love for working with the cars the way Bale did. Some lens into the psychology of the main characters and why racing meant so much to them would've been great. The race ending was fine in showing executive duplicity, but would've been better if we knew anything about the other Ford racers (and truthfully many explanations were left unsaid about how the process worked). The ending, while completely fitting in script, was rushed and sudden, making it less impactful than it deserved.<br/><br/>It's still fun as a sports movie, leaving no moments of boredom while it flies through it's 2:32 runtime, but for a movie that tries to hit emotional notes and focus on its character interactions, I'm perplexed at how no investigation of their characters or themes of dedication to a lifelong passion existed whatsoever. A fun and good movie, but should've been a great one."

A movie of such technique, panache, storytelling and outright acting prowess that catapults it into the realm of The Classics.<br/><br/>Ladies and Gentlemen, James Mangold and his team of craftsmen have delivered this rare jewel of a movie.<br/><br/>A linear journey into the lives of racers (Shelby and Miles), executives (Iacocca and Beebe) and visionaries (Ford and Ferrari), locked in a battle for racing supremacy, raged in the grandest of arenas: Daytona, Sebring and Le Mans. A battle where each screw, each bolt and each suspension inch can make or break the journey to the top.<br/><br/>A battle that is waged by figures terrifically played by a fantastic cast of actors, first amongst them a performance for the ages by Christian Bale as Ken Miles, who clearly signifies that he is on the prowl for another slew of awards. Matt Damon shines as Shelby, although he reaches summits mostly when interacting with the aforementioned Bale. The Miles family also benefits from excellent performances, that of Noah Jupe as his son being among the most touching one given this decade.
Commenting at length on the rest of the performances would take too long, but there is not a single solitary performance that is off or even slightly broken. Of special mention is those of Tracy Letts as a gruff but driven Henry Ford II, and a ""bravo"" for the ages for Remo Girone, who does Enzo Ferrari incredible justice with such a short screen presence, conveying the pride, passion and dignity that characterized the life of the Modena-born engineer.<br/><br/>This review would not be complete without commenting on the meat of the movie: the racing sequences. These are going to enter in the history of moviemaking as ""magnum opuses"" of the genre, with the gorgeous lighting, crisp editing, roaring sound effects and effectively timed musical addendums turning the 20-minutes-or-so Le Mans racing sequence into a masterful art work in and of itself, no small feat.<br/><br/>In retrospect, and quoting Kingsley Amis, we are in the presence of a flawless masterpiece""."

","As I'm not a huge car racing fan I was a little hesitant about seeing Le Mans '66, but this is not a racing film, well it is and it isn't, so if I enjoyed it, despite the racing, I'm sure that most others would too, and racing fans even more so.<br/><br/>The mark of a good film is being so engrossed in it that you don't even realise how long it is, which is exactly the case with Le Mans '66. In fact I was astounded when I was told how long it was afterwards.<br/><br/>Unlike some other shorter films, which have occasionally dragged on, the two hours and 42 minutes of this film flew by leaving me completely sated.<br/><br/>It's a great story, especially knowing it's a true one, but bear in mind it's not a documentary but a movie, so there's going to be some artistic license.<br/><br/>Some incredible acting made me warm to some individuals and abhor some others, exclaiming out loud 'you bleep'. The intensity and rush of the race to race, and the racing itself drew me in and made me eager for them to achieve their goals.<br/><br/>The film succeeds in every way a retelling of an historic event should, making you care, informing you and entertaining you.<br/><br/>My advice, get yourself in gear, race down to your local cinema, and settle in for a for a darn good ride along."

"hayfords","9","1","3","19 November 2019"," Almost perfect motor racing film
","The US title is closer to the film. It's not really Le Mans 66. The story and its telling is brilliant. As someone who has been to Le Mans and used to race cars, I can say that it doesn't convey the atmosphere or the general background noise. The pits in the film are authentic down to the dark concrete corridor at the back. The new pits are nothing like the older pits. As a story it is superb, but lacks what is needed to make a fantastic motor racing film."

","It's hard to compare Rush (racer biography by Ron Howard) I suppose Rush race scenes were more intense, but the 2 leads didn't have chemistry like Bale and Damon in this one. Their friendship, colleagues and families really helped carry the story for 2.5 hours.<br/><br/>The story is relevant in both auto race and corporate history. The director did a great job bringing the audience to this specialized industry with effective narratives so we could all enjoy the ride without feeling lost.<br/><br/>There were so much to digest in the dialogues and so many good action scenes to admire that I would recommend watching it again! p.s. try covering your ears in the theatre, because I overheard spoilers in the hallway (*__*) not cool~!

"dpg-87522","8","1","3","18 November 2019"," One of the best movies of the 2019.
","Ford v Ferrari is one of those few movies based on well-made real events, which means that most of these types of movies concentrate more on telling the event that happened and completely forget about telling a good story based on facts. real with interesting characters, funny moments, visually entertaining scenes, etc. And that is exactly why Ford v Ferrari is such a good movie, it does all of the above and more, and all that is topped off with the incredible performances of Christian Bale and Matt Damon and the chemistry they manage to do between the two. The film does not lack action or humor, both are perfectly leveled, humor is not silly this is introduced in a good way, something that other films of this genre do not understand, in real life there are comic moments, people laughs, not because it is a film based on real events means that there can be no comedy, of course it can as long as it is within reason, just as the action is great, neither more nor less is not forced or anything like that, and those would be the main elements that make the film visually attractive. The film does well not to put the protagonists aside, it gives the characters a touch of personality which makes them interesting, while telling their story, but let's be honest the real protagonist is Ken Miles (Christian Bale) because the film focuses more on his personal life, than that of Carroll Shelvy (Matt Damon), since it sets him the goal of overcoming himself physically and psychologically, and Ken is a true race driver, to hell with Dominic Toretto I want Ken Miles. But despite all that the character of Matt Damon is not far behind he also tries to overcome either because of his health problems overcome that he will not be able to compete anymore, and building a car faster than those of Ferrari at any cost. The film did well by not showing Ferrari as an evil company to win, it is only a battle of companies, even when Ken wins the race at the end Enzo Ferrari (Remo Girone) shows his respect, one competes against another not because one is good and the other bad, but because of what all companies want money, they want to have the best product to sell, although we support Ford not because they are good or something, but by perspective, we support Ford because the protagonists are with Ford, we would support Ferrari if the protagonists were with Ferrari, in fact the closest to being a villain in this movie would be Leo Bee (Josh Lucas) who is on the side of Ford, and I say the closest because it really is not bad within reason, he just has personal problems with Ken, he doesn't like it, he doesn't want it. And speaking of Ken, I loved his death, I say it moved me, but I say I liked it because it was a great element added to the movie, I think this because it was not something that was removed from the sleeve, the problem of the brakes and of not being able to get out of the car, it had already been used previously in the film, which gives a great touch to Ken's death, it happened once I managed to survive, another happened but this time he wasnt so lucky, The address, although it is not the best in the world, is great, there are several scenes that I can't think of as they were recorded, obviously if there were one with another with special effects, but in other words it is the best part of Mangold. Actually the only complaint I have to this movie would be Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal) is not that I did not like the character on the contrary I like it, but the problem is that in the first act you are introduced as 3rd protagonist, but As the film progresses, it loses prominence, taking away its place of 3rd protagonist. In conclusion Ford v Ferrari is one of the best movies of 2019, which I really think should be nominated for best film, with a good story, interesting characters, epic moments, great performances, a great direction from Goldman and apart from its best movie, I think this movie is a good 9/10."

"PyroSikTh","8","1","3","18 November 2019"," Engaging Story, Thrilling Racing, Great Acting
","Ford is failing as a company and in a last ditch effort to drive sales back up, they decide to expand their racing division. Rather than spending years and untold millions perfecting their own racecars, they decide to buy out Ferrari, but all they get are manipulations and insults, starting the infamous rivalry between Enzo Ferrari and Henry Ford II. In retaliation, Ford enlist the help of Carroll Shelby to build them a car that can blow Ferrari's out of the water. And so was born the GT40. But a racecar is only half of it, they need a driver too, and Shelby's choice in Ken Miles is too hard a sell for the Ford executives.<br/><br/>So which suits better, Ford v Ferrari or Le Mans '66? Honestly there isn't much of a movie without either. The Ford/Ferrari rivalry is what drives the first half of the movie, while preparation for Le Mans is what drives the second half. Throughout it's more of a Ken Miles biopic. I guess ""Ken Miles: The True Story"" wouldn't have sold many tickets though. And while Carroll Shelby does appear a lot, he's not explored as a character anywhere near as deeply as Ken Miles is. We don't learn anything about his home life, we don't get to see him wrestle with his demons, and the film's coda almost entirely revolves around Miles' affect on everyone around him.<br/><br/>Ken Miles is the star of the movie, there's no doubt about that, and Christian Bale is unsurprisingly great in the role, slipping in like a chameleon, like he does with every character he plays. He's a down-on-his-luck auto-mechanic who can't even pay the bills, and despite his good connections in Shelby and his unmatched skill as a racing driver, his quick temper and difficulty to work with keeps him rooted in the amateur circuit. That is, of course, until Shelby gets the offer from Ford to give them the Le Mans win. It takes one failed year at the race for Shelby to convince the higher-ups at Ford that they need an expert driver who has hands-on experience with the GT40 in building and testing to really get them the win.<br/><br/>Acting is fairly top-notch across the board, and it's hard to say Bale stole the show when almost everyone else keeps up so well. Matt Damon offers no surprises as Shelby, with his strongest scenes at the very end. Jon Bernthal gets a little shafted in the second half as Lee Iacocca, but he gets plenty of time to shine before then, particularly in the negotiations with Ferrari. Josh Lucas is deliciously punchable as Leo Beebe, the Ford suit put in charge of the racing division, who is portrayed here as having no clue about racing, is constantly against Ken Miles' involvement, and even costs him the win at the end in the name of a photo opportunity. Caitriona Balfe is great as Miles' wife, who takes no crap from her husband, and supports him wherever she can. Tracy Letts is also pretty good as the no-nonsense, stoic Henry Ford II, with his stand-out scene being in a GT40 prototype crying his eyes out. At first you think it's due to pure fear of the speeds he's experienced, but then you realise they're happy tears having restored faith in his racing project, and then they evolve again into sadness and regret that his father, Henry Ford senior, was no longer alive to experience such a pinnacle achievement in automotive machinery. It becomes a surprisingly emotive scene purely thanks to Letts' performance.<br/><br/>Le Mans '66 also has merits in the technical department. It's like crack to a driving junkie, particularly anyone with even a passing interest in 60s sportscars or the racing scene. I've always had a passing interest in cars thanks to my mum and dad both being rally drivers in their younger years, so Le Mans '66 definitely struck a chord with me. The roar of the engines is palpable and infectious, and seeing all sorts of snazzy classic cars driving around was a delight. As I understand it a lot of the GT40s, Shelbys, and Ferraris, including 330 P3 and 275 GTB used in the movie were real, only employing CGI and dummies for crashes, giving the whole experience a feeling of authenticity.<br/><br/>The only criticism I particularly have revolves around the film's coda, showing Ken Miles' death and the effect it had on some of the characters. It felt unnecessary and meant the film ended on a considerable downer. It would be like if Bohemian Rhapsody followed up the LiveAid performance with Freddie Mercury's death and the various members of Queen reacting to it. The ending of the Le Mans race was enough of a downer for Ken, having the victory stolen from him thanks to a technicality in a publicity stunt, and then the next scene they kill him off on a test track in front of his son. Sure, he died doing what he loved, but it felt like a bit too much of a one-two punch. Ending it just after the race as he graciously accepts second place would have sufficed. This is really more of a niggle and personal taste more than anything though. It might work for you.<br/><br/>In all Le Mans '66 was an enjoyable cinema experience. It hit all the right notes for a casual car fan in myself, and I'm sure it'll hit them all for fanatics who lived through it like my parents. But for those without any interest in cars, there's still plenty here for you. The acting is fantastic, the story never lags, and the race sequences are thrilling from beginning to end. I give Le Mans '66 a solid 8/10."

","Playing out the real life story of how Henry Ford the 2nd vowed to get revenge on Ferrari after a failed takeover bid that left him feeling humiliated, so decides to crush the Italian team at the infamous 24 hours of Le Mans endurance race.<br/><br/>Note : In the UK, the film title is 'Le Mans '66.<br/><br/>This story has been told by Amazon Prime's 'The grand Tour' too, and they had the good sense to keep it short to around fifteen minutes and included more technical information that this movie lacked, which would have helped to build a more rounded picture, this picture is aimed at appealing to motor racing fans in general, technical information is part and parcel of being a fan, it is not solely about the drivers, this film feels dumb down a little too much for it's own good.<br/><br/>The film, good presentation and accurate feel, Matt Damon plays the part of a man forced to give up racing due to ill health and focus on something else related quite well, Christian Bale is excellent as rough around the edges racer Ken Miles, it is nice to see Jon Bernthal as something other than a brutal thug that he is often cast as, Caitriona Balfe provides an excellent supporting role.<br/><br/>However, the film is too long at two and a half hours, a good twenty minutes could have been cut from this without removing from the core story, the relationship between Carroll Shelby and Ken Miles is the core focus at the expense of the more important finer details, such as the film's main protagonist Ferrari and his team of drivers, and instead pays attention to the boring politic's of Ford's executives, namely Leo Beebe trying to win the race his way when Carroll actually knows what needs to be done.<br/><br/>Overall the film is good, but it is something better enjoyed at home rather than a movie theatre, I don't regret going to see it, but I was not blown away by it either."
"rockman182","7","1","3","17 November 2019"," Ford v Ferrari(2019)
","I love a good film based on historical events. I knew I had to see this in IMAX format as soon as I heard about it. I'm not the biggest gear head but I do know the talent of the cast involved and the director involved so I knew we would be getting something worth watching. Having seen this in IMAX now, I will say that this film needs to be seen in that type of high quality to feel the rush, intensity, and thrill of the races. This film is a bit long in the tooth but a great watch.<br/><br/>The film is about the real life events of Caroll Shelby working with Henry Ford the Second to build a fast race car that would beat the best Ferrari has to offer. Shelby has a limited time frame to work with and enlists the help of hot headed Ken Miles, an exceptional race car driver who is initially at odds with the Ford company. The film follows their bond and their progress as they not only build the car but go head to head with Ferrari during the 1966 Le Mans race.<br/><br/>The film's racing sequences are some of the best in a car themed movie I have ever seen. Heightened by the theater experience everything was eye catching and intense. On top of that you have two extremely charismatic leads who do very well in their roles. The film also has humor here and there. Its a very interesting and inspiring story and you don't have to be a car fanatic tot enjoy the film. James Mangold's quality behind the camera shows with every detail captured.<br/><br/>My main complaint for the film comes from its running length. its a long 2 and a half hours and at times feels its length. I couldn't help but think a good half an hour could have been left on the cutting room floor. Its a one time watch through and through but a great effort. I think the film will be up for some of the more technical aspect Academy Award nominations. If you are a film lover, you need to see what is arguably the best racing movie ever.<br/><br/>8/10"

","""Ford v Ferrari"" is a film that has a very high overall score of 8.1...meaning that folks love the movie. As for me, I don't share this same level of enthusiasm. To me, it's an okay film with some nice driving sequences. I prefer films like ""Le Mans"" or ""Grand Prix""...mostly because the ending isn't as obvious and fore-ordained. In other words, if you know about the history of the famed Ford GT, you KNOW how well it did in the race that takes up almost half of this film. Still, the driving sequences are nice (not done with CGI) and the actors try their best....although the script occasionally (or more than occasionally) plays fast and loose with a few of the facts. Overall, very watchable but not a great history lesson and a film where you KNOW that the GT will eventually prove better than the Ferrari...otherwise, what would be the point of this film?!"

","Ford v Ferrari (AKA Le Mans 66 in some European countries) is a story based on the rivalry between Ford and Ferrari in the 60s. It's a sport biopic of sorts with the characters of Ken Miles played by Christian Bale and Carolle Shelby played by Matt Damon of course being real individuals. The story of course exaggerates lots of things for the sake of dramatisation even more than other films so it isn't necessary a typical biopic. The film is directed by James Mangold who directed the masterful film ""Logan"" but the film certainly feels drastically different from Logan. Still, I came in with high expectations because James Mangold directed it and plus all the oscar buzz around the film.<br/><br/>Firstly, the story is very compelling and engaging for a film about racing cars. The human drama between the Ford executives and the main characters is very natural albeit cliche. However, the director manages to balance out the racing with the human drama naturally so that none become too overwhelming or boring. Despite being titled ""Ford v Ferrari"" the film is more about the clash of Miles and Shelby against the meddling executives. The heart and passion of Miles/Shelby with the cold and calculative business choices of the executives is really the heart and soul of the film with some added bonus of intense racing. There are a lot of poignant and genuinely heart warming touching moments but with some funny moments and that is not normal for these type of films. Secondly, Both Christian Bale and Matt Damon give great performances with strong chemistry between the two that makes the friendship more believable. The supporting cast Jon Berthal, Caitriona Balfe,Tracy Letts give good performances as well and definitely do well in making the world more alive. Special mention to Josh Lucas who I say is the REAL antagonist of this film by somehow being suave but absolutely detestable. Thirdly, the race scenes are incredibly done and intense with great wide shots and none of the shaky camera garbage. The film really excels at creating exciting and thrilling auto action which is in part thanks to excellent score by Marco Beltrami and Buck Sanders. The score captures the electrifying race scenes but also uses score and music from the 60s to elevate the era the film is set in.Likewise, the sound and sound editing in this film are done perfectly as I could feel the engine turning or when the gears change. It's just really good.<br/><br/>I do have some issues with this film and the first is the amount of cliches used by this film. The monologue at the beginning being used at the end again, Ken Miles being the typical cliche underdog character from a sports film, the montage with the amount of failures, the main character knowing more than the experts and machines etc. The cliches are done masterfully but it did surprise me a lot about how many cliches were in this film. My other minor issue has got to be the run time which is at 152 minutes. The pacing of this movie is mostly fine but there are certain points in this movie after they build the car where it just kind of drags. These are mostly in the scenes where there are paperwork or meetings where it just feels a bit too long for no reason.<br/><br/>Other than some minor nitpicks, the movie is almost near perfect. The film is carried by great performances with thrilling car scenes but some genuinely touching and funny moments. The movie drives you along a road of contrasting emotions that leads you to an exciting finishing line. Give this film a watch."

","The trailers for ""Ford v Ferrari"" are very stylish. I thought the entire film would be as stylish and that I'd like it, even though I knew it was mostly a guy flick about cars. Well, not so much.<br/><br/>""Ford v Ferrari"" is a lot of vroom vroom, men with motor oil on their faces, guys punching each other, guys clapping each other on the back, guys bonding over car guts, guys drinking beer, guys giving each other death stares, guys insulting each other, guys daring and double daring each other, guys modifying car hoods, car brakes, car doors, and car weights, and some more, a lot more, vroom vroom.<br/><br/>There is a woman - just one - and she mostly stands off to the sidelines looking fondly, proudly, and tearfully at her man. Yeah, I got bored, but I woke myself up for the final stretch.<br/><br/>""Ford v Ferrari"" depicts Henry Ford II's effort to defeat Enzo Ferrari's cars at the 24-hour Le Mans race in France during the 1960s. Christian Bale gives a fun performance as Ken Miles, the WW II veteran and race car driver who drove the Ford car at Le Mans. Matt Damon is rather bland as Carroll Shelby, former racer, engineer, and Ken Miles wrangler. Tracy Letts, the playwright who wrote ""August Osage County,"" gives an understated but arresting performance as Henry Ford II.<br/><br/>Josh Lucas, who was so good as the romantic lead in ""Sweet Home Alabama,"" plays a villain version of Leo Beebe, a Ford executive. I knew nothing about Beebe but I found his depiction in the movie to be cartoonish. The Philadelphia Inquirer ran a story headlined ""Philly Friends Of Leo Beebe Say 'Ford V Ferrari' Gets The Ford Exec Wrong."" The article quotes a slew of people who knew Beebe and who say he was a great guy. Shame on ""Ford v Ferrari"" for turning him into a cartoon bad guy in what may be the only movie to feature him as a character. And please make Josh Lucas a romantic lead again.<br/><br/>Overall, a good movie, but not so good that it could keep me, not a car lover, fully engaged. The lengthy scenes of Bale as Miles driving for 24 hours around the track at Le Mans gave me a sense of why racers enjoy what they do."

","My family are big motor sport fans so I had to see Le Mans 66 or as it is mainly known Ford V Ferrari and this film was an experience and one of my favourite films of recent memory. The premise of the film sees two ambitous drivers try to create a Ford to defeat Ferrari at the 24 Hour Le Mans race. Christian Bale plays the lead in the film and he is fantastic in this film, he is so charismatic and charming and you truly care about his character in the film. An Oscar Nomination is waiting for him for sure, his chemistry with Matt Damon is brilliant and one of the best duos in recent memory. As said Matt Damon is great in the film too, he compliments Bale so well and his loud personality really works for this film and there is most definitley an Oscar nomination ready for him. Jon Bernthal is in this film and also does a great job, he is pretty likeable in the film and I felt like he was a character we were meant to like and sympathise with. The rest of the cast also do a great job, they all fit there roles brilliantly and feel like they fit into the movie flawlessly. The story is fascinating, seeing these two companies go to war over building a car is great, and seeing the different personalities clashing, it feels real and like these people are working on something that really matters. The script is great, a true mix of humour and drama, it makes everybody in the film feel very realy and interesting. The style of the film is breathtaking, the race scenes keep you on the edge of your seat and build the tension superbly, the film never really slows down and keeps you on the edge of the seat. Overall this is a pretty amazing film that needs to be seen by all film fans and will be remembered as a classic."

","James Mangold's 'Ford v Ferrari' is a fun two-and-a-half hour ride down memory lane, circling the lives of legendary race car driver Ken Miles and equally esteemed car designer Carroll Shelby.<br/><br/>The film gets off to an uninspiring start, introducing the main characters using quick-hitting scenes that turn each into an eye-rolling archetype. Shelby is the inspired engineer. Miles is the irascible wildcard. Henry Ford II is the cutthroat Man of Industry ... and they even give him a sniveling bulldog lackey.<br/><br/>The second half of the film picks up the pace and is considerably more engaging. Mangold does a fine job filming the racing scenes, choosing just the right balance of different viewpoints and cuts. Beyond that, he thankfully spares audiences from the awful ""shaky camera effect"" that some filmmakers would've used anytime they wanted to ramp up the action on screen.<br/><br/>Given that the '24 Hours of Le Mans' race is indeed twenty-four hours long, Mangold also excels at keeping an even pace down the final stretch, not relying too much on either the racing or the off track drama, but rather striking an even balance between the two."

"grantpaulsen","6","1","13","15 November 2019"," An enjoyable Oscar bait movie
","Ford v Ferrari is clearly comes from a place of heart and a very talented director. The car races in this movie are dramatic, incredibly tense, and very well shot. There's a lot of production value and effort that went into making this film and it shows. The directing was probably the best part, no real issues there. I love James Mangold as well as almost all his films, so I'll always support him and I can't wait to see what else he does. This film was pretty strong from a technical standpoint, the cinematography, the editing, the sound mixing & editing, and the visuals were all great. The acting was pretty great, especially from Christian Bale. I really enjoyed Matt Damon and his performance, as well as the endlessly fun, charming, and believable friendship and dynamic that he shares with Bale. I liked his character and I think he had enough development for what screen time he had, but at the same time his character didn't feel that special or unique, but I did enjoy his character. In terms of acting though I think Matt Damon gets pretty outshined by Christian Bale. That just goes to show that he's one of the best actors working today, he worked on this film coming off of Vice, and if you've seen that movie then you would know that he looks radically different in this film. It's kind of amazing how much and how quickly he can lose and gain weight or a role. He's an actor who can disappear into his characters and he never feels like he's acting, and he can play such a wide range of characters, I mean this guy played Batman for crying out loud. He fully dedicates himself to all of his roles and he's one of my favorite actors who will always have my undying gratitude. In fact this might be his best performance that I've seen from him in a long time. His character is very well developed and the vulnerability on display is captivating to say the least. The film is very fast paced for the most part and it was pretty fun to watch. It got a little boring at times, and there were some points in the middle that lost my investment, but other than that this film kept my attention for the majority of the run time. And yeah the story is a little drawn out, not everything in this film was necessary or justified, they could've trimmed off maybe 20 minutes. My last issue is that it's one of those movies that is pretty pandering in terms of it's message and it's story, it's fairly cookie cutter and predictable. And it's one of those films that is just screaming that it's going for Oscars and it's very obvious, it's kind of an Oscar bait movie is what I'm trying to say. But despite some issues I really enjoyed this film, it's not amazing and I'm in no rush to see it again, but I'd recommend seeing this one in theaters, because the sound and visuals are so immersive that it makes this film a very theatrical experience. See it with a good sound set up as well."
"thatsgottahurt-1","7","1","13","14 November 2019"," Good but predictable.
","I generally steer clear of most biopics due to the staging of ""special"" moments, ripe with poignant dialogue and meaningful looks into the distance. In truth, life just isn't like that. It doesn't serve up the momentous on cue. The important and life altering moments often drift by, not recognised until much later. Having said that, this film has more than its share of these moments, but it's still an enjoyable and well told story. The leads are good and the narrative compelling. The racing action is gripping and while there are a number of stereotypes in the supporting cast, it's still well worth the money to see it."

","It's not often that I hand out a 10/10. This film earned it for staying as true as it gets to the REAL life events and characters without compromise. There are many things that an avid motorsport enthusiast who knows their history will spot. But even the errors or speculative occurances in this film are passable, and that's what made this great cinema. It's so close to the truth that those discrepancies become minute and decay as you ride along with an amazing cast. It's hard to imagine anyone else playing these historic figures because they nail it spot on. Feel free to watch any interviews with Shelby or Miles - Damon and Bale sell their performances as fact. And not one actor in this film did not complete a great job. I will say the special effects are stunning, as well as sound design. Obviously the creators of this film worked very hard with Ferrari and Ford to capture and display this amazing piece of history. I as a racing fan cannot laud this film enough. I knew it was perfect when my wife and daughters, who have little to no interest in the pursuit of speed and records, all immediately attached and engrossed theirselves with this momentous tale."
"david-meldrum","7","0","2","13 April 2020"," Generic, Often Lazy, With Striking Visuals And Race Sequences
","I did not receive the gene that fires interest in cars. I do not drive; I have no passion, not one iota for cars and engines and mechanics. I don't understand them and don't particularly want to do so. Which is why this film had little attraction for me.<br/><br/>But it was Easter weekend, and it was on cheap to rent, and at wife's recommendation (who had seen it in the cinema), we watched it. I still have no interest in cars and engines, having watched it. There were parts of the dialogue I didn't understand a word of - or more correctly, I understood most of the words, but not the order they were used in. Those parts of the script I did understand seemed often to be lazy and far too much on the nose. Christian Bale's performance is odd to the point of being unintentionally laughable; replete with Mary Poppins-like Britishisms which sound out of place even coming from this British actor, whose accent in this film is hard to take seriously. On the other hand, Matt Damon is quietly brilliant, very possibly his best performance in many years; unshowy, subtle and investing his character with a depth the script never reaches.<br/><br/>There remain other inadequacies in the film: a ludicrous brawl between the two lead characters, and a pathetic reduction of women to roles which support or prop-up the men, peering through curtains, fetching drinks, adorning visuals. Why are cars always referred to in the feminine? It became more obvious to me here; because it enables the men who drive them and build them to continue to exploit them and shape them around their needs the way they do with women in their lives.<br/><br/>In the end, this is little more than a genre sports film, following all of the standard story beats of sports films to a conclusion I knew was coming as a sports fan with only a very passing knowledge of motorsport. It's a true story, but no less generic for it. But it does work - motorsports are the most cinematic of sports, not least because we have much of the film grammar of them drilled into us by car chases and the like. The racing scenes are adrenalised, gripping and alarming - the louder your sound system and the larger your screen, the more you'll enjoy them. They are beautifully directed; and throughout the whole film, the cinematography is subtle but strikingly beautiful. There's much to enjoy and entertain, perfect for a holiday weekend. But it will fade from the memory quickly, the only lingering question being why it garnered so much attention on cinematic release at the expense of far superior films from female directors."

It doesn't have endless show motion imagery. Instead, this is a straight-forward, well made film where pretty much what you see is what you get. And I loved that! The action scenes were very realistic. During all the action/racing scenes, the film also dished up a good dose of drama and suspense - and I loved the subtle humor, too! There are no comic relief characters, no slapstick humor; just very funny one-liners and incidents. There's also only the required amount of characters.<br/><br/>This is an interesting film that will appeal to a wide audience, and is not primarily aimed at car or racing enthusiasts. The film offers so much more. The father-son relationship was beautiful and touching. It also offers a good insight into Ford Motor Company's history. The editing is quick, as you'd expect from a film that revolves around speed. The finale is really great. I enjoyed this film."

","My wife and i watched this at home on DVD from our public library. Excellent picture and realistic racing sounds, but no extras on the disc.<br/><br/>While it is based on a historically accurate story many of the scenes and dialog had to be invented but the filmmakers did a superb job to make it interesting. While the movie is long at about 2.5 hours it is never dull. Much credit goes to the two actors in key roles, Damon and Bale who are at the top of their acting games.<br/><br/>By the 1960s Ford was established as an automotive giant but Henry Ford II wanted to defeat Ferrari on the tracks. Willing to spend almost unlimited funds he turned to Carroll Shelby, racer and designer who in 1959 became the only second American to win the 24-hour race at Le Mans.<br/><br/>Aside from fighting the excessive layers of Ford corporate management, much of the movie regards the relationship between Carroll Shelby (Damon, sounding like a young Tommy Lee Jones) and driver Ken Miles (Bale). Together they accomplished the tasks and propelled Ford racing cars to international fame.<br/><br/>A really good movie, an excellent chapter in auto racing and an interestingly told story. For those who want to learn more about the controversial finish in 1966 do a web search for ""Foul play in Ford 1966 Le Mans 24 Hour photo finish?"" to find interesting articles.<br/><br/>Also the 2016 documentary called ""24 Hour War"" covers the same subject but with a different focus, including the history of each company and direct input from many who were involved in Ford's project 50 years earlier. Worth a watch if you can find it.<br/><br/>As an aside, this movie includes the introduction of the Ford Mustang in the 1960s. That brought back nice memories as my college graduation gift was a gently used 1965 Mustang, red with three black racing stripes down the middle, and with the 289 CI motor with 4-barrel carbs and a 4-on-the-floor shifter. Man that was a nice running car."

After watching this film, I felt like I just ate a little too much pizza--it was good but it maybe too long. The story is fairly standard and somewhat uplifting, the performances were pretty good (refreshing to see Christian Bale in a British accent), and the visuals were good. However, I felt the climatic race and ending to be anti-climatic. Maybe it's because I'm not really familiar with racing, I kind of expected something more exhilarating like the Podrace sequence from Star Wars episode 1. Now the last moments of the race and the results were fun to watch-personally the film could've ended there. Now the ending, without spoiling too much felt too obligatory and could've just been cut. Sometimes events could merely be mentioned or even be written in the end credits, that's what the ending in this film was like. Overall, good film but not worth a repeated viewing."

"itsbobr","9","0","1","12 February 2020"," A Most Complete and Well Told Racing Strry
","This is based upon a true story<br/><br/>In the 1960s, Ford wanted to merge with Farrari, but that didn't happen. Henry Ford II (Tracy Letts) to get some revenge on Farrari (whose cars dominate the La Mans race in France) now wants to build a race car to beat Farrari in the Le Mans 24 Hour endurance race. Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) is contacted to build that race car. Shelby did win the LeMans race, but health reasons now keep him from racing. He is also a car designer. Shelby's best driver and racing engineer is Ken Miles (Christian Bale) and both he and Shelby build that car, a GT40 Mk 1 high performance racing car.<br/><br/>This is a very complete racing story, and probably one of the best ever. Of course, politics enter into this and Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas) the Head of Ford Racing wants his own drivers to do the racing and not Ken Miles who Beebe feels is not Ford quality material. Shelby has no choice in this until Ford loses some races and he confronts Henry Ford II and gets his way. Or so we think as that almost changes later on too, but Shelby makes a very high risk bet with Henry Ford II in order to get his way.<br/><br/>The first meeting scene with Carroll Shelby and Henry Ford II is pure gold. Listen carefully.<br/><br/>We see a lot of very fast racing and - to be honest - a lot of this racing rivals the racing in some of the Fast and Furious movies. Kudos. Keep in mind the editing is a very big part of any racing movie and the editing here is spot on. More Kudos.<br/><br/>We also see the introduction of the Ford Mustang in 1964. It really wasn't talked about or even mentioned, but Lee Iacocca was the person that put Ford in the minds of young drivers who were the sons of World War II vets and this went a long way improving sales to rival Chevrolet.<br/><br/>Notables: Catherine Baife as Mollie Miles, Ken Mile's wife; Noah Jupe as Peter Miles, son of Ken and Mollie; Ray McKinnon as Phil Remington, Shelby's Sales/ Auto Manager; Remo Girone as Enzo Farrari, Joe Bernthal as Lee Iacocca.<br/><br/>A very good scene is when Ken punches Shelby who is trying to apologize for not taking Ken to France the first time because Leo Beeble wanted his drivers and not Ken. After the punch Shelby counters and they go at it until they become so tired they just rest there fully exhausted. All this time Mollie was watching the fight and goes into the house and gets both a cold drink.<br/><br/>All in all a very enjoyable and complete racing story. The movie was nominated for Best Picture. It did receive the Oscar for Best Film Editing (told ya) and for Best Sound Editing.<br/><br/>Stay tuned at the end to see what happened to Carroll Shelby and Ken Miles. (9/10)<br/><br/>Violence: No.

I had some real emotional moments watching the racing (it's almost inevitable if you watch beginning to end) and I found this movie reasonably entertaining.<br/><br/>It's a masculine tale beginning to end - the only female character of note is Mollie (Caitriona Balfe) as racer Ken Mile's wife, who for the most part seems to be in the movie as an afterthought. This movie treads a well-worn path as it unfolds almost exactly like every other car racing movie ever made, from ""Grand Prix"" (1966) to ""Days of Thunder"" (1990) while still managing to set itself apart from all of those, even if only in some minor details. Damon (as Carroll Shelby) manages to be a rock steady influence throughout the entire movie, applying his good-old American know-how to temper the hot-headed but brilliant racer Ken Miles (Bale). This movie has few or no surprises, but still manages to be a good watch from beginning to end.<br/><br/>If you happen to be a fan of car racing, this is probably a must-see movie.

"mazedm","8","0","2","1 December 2019"," Flawed but highly entertaining
","I have read several of the reviews posted here for ""Ford vs. Ferrari,"" and I generally agree with most of the criticisms: too long (15-30 minutes could have been cut, in my opinion), too many cliched scenes, and a very cliched character in the form of Leo Beebee, a Ford executive, who is clearly supposed to embody evil, soulless corporate greed (in case you have an IQ under 50 and can't figure that out within the first two minutes that character is on screen). Finally, I agree that Christian Bale's accent sounded cockney as opposed to Brummie--and I'm an American. Speaking of accents, I am surprised none of the nit-pickers here has mentioned something else I found slightly annoying: the character of Ken Miiles' son is portrayed by a boy with a strong English accent, but Miles' son was growing up in California and therefore would have had an American accent. Maybe the producers just thought a kid with an English accent would sound more appealing to audiences. (The child is a good actor, at any rate.)<br/><br/>All that aside, even a huge movie snob like me found the film highly entertaining, and the length bothered me less than in other overly-long movies. (I believe most Hollywood movies in recent years could benefit from losing at least 15 minutes, frankly--Black Panther and Wonder Woman immediately spring to mind, although there are many others.) I did not go to see this expecting a documentary but rather to be entertained. I will add that I attended it with my brother, who is a former automotive journalist and therefore, to put it mildly, a real ""petrolhead,"" While he commented that there were definitely historical inaccuracies in the film, he genuinely enjoyed it as well. (Since leaving automotive journalism behind, my brother has worked in Hollywood, so that probably helps; he does not have any expectation that a Hollywood release is aiming for historical accuracy, since he knows that business well too.) However, I can understand why other automotive and/or racing obsessives might be more bothered by the film's flaws. If you are simply looking for well-acted, fast-paced (well, during the on-track scenes) fun, I highly recommend this."
"flickernatic","8","0","2","1 December 2019"," Above average motor racing drama
","Enthusiasm for this movie will no doubt vary according to your interest in motor racing and the cars and drivers that make it. If, like myself, the sound of a 4.7 litre V8 on full song is akin to Beethoven's 5th, you will not be disappointed. Otherwise there is still much to be enjoyed here.<br/><br/>The story revolves around Ford Motor Company's ambition in the 1960s to build a legendary racing car (the GT 40) capable of beating the venerable Ferrari team in Europe at the Le Mans 24-hour race. Loosely based on the real events, the thrills of speed, brilliantly portrayed in some superb racing footage, are complemented by the human drama as the racing team struggle with the monstrous Henry Ford 2 (superbly played by Tracy Letts) and his cronies and their own personal relationships. Matt Damon and Christian Bale make a great contrasting pair as all-American racing maestro, Carol Shelby, and cantankerous British racing ace and master engineer, Ken Miles, with tremendous performances from both. The strains of top-flight motor racing are excellently depicted via Miles' relationship with his supportive wife, Mollie (Catriona Balfe) and adoring son, Peter (beautifully played by Noah Jupe).<br/><br/>Everything proceeds at a cracking pace and, unlike some car movies, the visuals are not overburdened with flash-and-crash CGI intrusions.

"chasemykleby","7","0","3","30 November 2019"," Ford v Ferrari makes for a somewhat entertaining spin on the traditional sports biography.
","""Ford V Ferrari"" Review
(7.5/10)<br/><br/>Between its thrilling racing sequences and underlying commentary, Ford v Ferrari makes for a somewhat entertaining spin on the traditional sports biography.
On paper, a movie about the Ford company's efforts to defeat its rival Ferrari at the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans probably only sounds interesting to either racing enthusiasts and/or anyone who actually knows what a 24 Hours of Le Mans even is. Thankfully, the final film, Ford v Ferrari transcends its biographical trappings to deliver an enjoyable viewing experience for gearheads and race-car novices alike. And with director James Mangold calling the shots, the biopic is mostly successful in getting at the heart of what makes this story interesting - namely, the struggle between commercialism and creative integrity.
At its core, the Ford v Ferrari script credited to Jason Keller and Jez and John-Henry Butterworth is part American corporate myth and part real-life story about a ragtag group of artists in their profession who're trying to stay true to their vision while working for a company that's far more concerned about public image and selling their products to the masses. Of the two, the latter element is more compelling than the former and gives the film a beating heart, even when it's all too apparent where the story is going next.
Ford v Ferrari knows what matters most are the people who come along for the journey. In this case, Damon and Bale have excellent chemistry as Shelby and Miles, and their dynamic gives the film much of its flavor, whether they're bonding over their shared passion for racing or coming to blows in what's typically a very funny fashion. Their personalities are well-complimented by those of Ford's business suits, with Letts and Bernthal doing excellent work as always and Josh Lucas bringing on the smarm as the Ford executive Leo Beebe (who proves to be the biggest thorn in Shelby and Miles' side).
The race-car sequences and recreation of the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans are the primary attractions as much as anything else here, and Ford v Ferrari very much delivers the goods in this regard. Mangold and his DP Phedon Papamichael shoot these scenes with a steady hand, allowing viewers to actually see everything that's happening while still experiencing the sheer exhilaration that comes with being a body that's ""moving through space and time"".
Trouble is, it's all so very predictable. Miles loses his seat, but you don't think for a second that he won't win it back. Miles is losing the race, but you don't for a second think he won't pull it back. What these men achieved, in such a short space of time, was nothing short of miraculous. But that doesn't necessarily translate into an engaging story, and for much of its punishing run-time, Ford v Ferrari fails to get out of third gear. Like a race car without an engine, Ford v Ferrari looks good on the surface, but fails to motor for its 150-minutes. There's fun to be had watching the Ford executives clash, and the driving scenes are shot with real artistry and skill, but they're interspersed with scenes of true inertia. So while Le Mans might be the most exciting race on the planet, a film about that race is a very different proposition, with Ford v Ferrari lacking urgency and thrills, and instead simply chugging along in underwhelming fashion."
"educallejero","7","0","2","29 November 2019"," Like Fast and Furious, but a real movie
","With an amazing production, great acting overall and a story filled with punches for those that don't know what happened (like me), it gets the job done and creates a very entertaining movie.
But I do think the story is too big or epic for its own good.
It feels not long enough to tell the whole thing, but also too long with boring moments or elements. Pass of time is poorly managed and it bothered me quite a few times.<br/><br/>The races are perfect though. Visually stunning. And with together with all the car related stuff, made up for the best part of the movie in the perfect second act.
The acting, awesome. But is Bale, who gets the flashier role, that steals the show.
The movie is also quite funny, although not constantly. But when it makes a joke, it lands.<br/><br/>I still think is a bit overrated though, because almost none of the emotional plots landed for me, and at times it felt a bit clichÃ©d."
"JNowak1999","8","0","1","28 November 2019"," Nice to see Bale and Damon on screen again!
","It's not too often that we get to see some familiar faces (or names) on any film title released in recent times. A few examples would include Shia Lebouf (A Transformers Actor from the Bayverse) appearing in The Peanut Butter Falcon, Jesse Eisenberg's appearance in the Zombieland Sequel (For the obvious reason that it's been a whole decade since the first one came out), and Ian Mckellen (For the fact that Flushed Away was the last real big film starring Ian Mckellen).<br/><br/>But all of that aside, Both Christian Bale and Matt Damon both did exceptionally well portraying both Ford stars that made the GT-40 become the next best thing in Ford Motor Comapny's legacy and popularity. Yet despite the year 1966 for being the second year of the Mustang, the GT-40 was the overall key to victory against Ferrari. The races needed to win were most certainly well-constructed to the point that it acted more like a VR experience than watching an actual race take place.<br/><br/>Regardless, however you see this in theaters (Or otherwise), I'd greatly give out a recommendation to this in any way!"

The second half feels more like a traditional sports movie, with the emotional pay-offs and suspense and heartache and twists and turns.

"Lewis_Heather787","7","0","2","24 November 2019"," Not as fast paced as you might think!
","Got to admit that this film was one of my personal most anticipated films of the year. The story itself which I only knew very few details about sounded really interesting, a David vs Goliath type of story. James Mangold's name was also a major attraction to the film, a seasoned film maker with some really good films. However the biggest draw of all was the cast and in particular Christian Bale...........who I will admit is my favourite actor of all time...............and oh yeah Matt Damon isn't bad too!<br/><br/>I'm gonna be completely honest straight up I strangely didn't like this film as much as I thought I was going to..............maybe my expectations were too high?? However I am in some way surprise with how the film turned out, its a much more character driven film than I thought it was going to be!!! Le Mans only takes up the last 45-30 mins of the film which is not a lot, but I don't think that is a criticism at all.<br/><br/>James Mangold has made as good as looking a film as I thought he would, from start to finish it is beautiful to watch. He manages to really immerse you in the time period almost straight away and makes you buy into the characters right from the get go. The film does show that Mangold really did do his research, the amount of care and attention the detail really shines through in the races. The more impressive part of the film is the good balance between the fast paced racing and the more slow character driven parts of the film, both of which complement each other really nicely. The tension in the race scenes really works because they are built upon really good character development and also development of their relationships, which is best shown between Bale and Damon. You care about them.<br/><br/>Bale and Damon are both fantastic actors in my opinion so it is no surprise that they are really really good in the film.........Oscar worthy I'm not so sure but did it need to be.........No. Their on screen chemistry really shows that the actors must have had fun on set because they seem to have a really good connection during the film, its like watching two friends. Other shoutouts Tracey Letts, Jon Bernthal and Josh Lucas all really strong performances. I think the best part is the pit crew and the close relationship they have with Bale and Damon is a real gem of the film.<br/><br/>The action scenes are brilliantly choreographed and simply put you in the drivers seat, some real nail biting racing that is a pure joy to watch. Considering that I didn't know how the story was going to end it really was..........heart pounding!!<br/><br/>The film for me almost got an 8 out of 10 because the ending has such emotional punch, which is extremely effective. The fact that Miles didn't win the race and the death of Ken Miles so it was a complete surprise to me when they happened................the film handled the death really well and actually the final scene was a really nice close to the film. However the only thing stopping me from giving it an 8 is the re-watchabilty of the film, for some strange reason I don't see myself itching to watch it again straight away.........maybe its because its a long film and it is a slow paced film for the most part.<br/><br/>Overall even though I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would, its still a really good film 75% out of 100, its almost at 80% but not quite. Definitely recommend it just for the story of Shelby and Miles even if you don't like racing or cars..........this is a much more character driven film than you'd think!"

","When you see this movie, do not expect it to be high octane action or a fast and furious movie. This is about making history. Just being part of the journey. Seeing their passion about the car, speed, the feeling of it. Matt Damon And Christian Bale puts on their best performance. This is a slow burn of a movie. Learning about what works and what does not. They face challenges, setbacks, and problems. This movie is living the dream and fighting to get it. The problem of this movie, it has certain scenes where it can be cut short. Also sometimes I hear a lot of mumbling. I can't hear their words clearly. I don't know, maybe it's me. The point I am making is, it's great but I don't know if I want to watch it again. I probably forget about it in a couple days. Because it's not memorable. You may disagree. But that's my opinion."

","Great movie with a top notch performance by Christian Bale and Matt Damon, a fun ride with some very well shot an directed race sequences. It follows the true story of the Ford company expanding themselves financially and Bale's character training to win the 1966 Le Man's cup. It does run for quite a while. 2 and a half hours but it rarely drags and is entertaining and heartfelt the whole way through. Also a pretty funny movie to with a bit of comedy sprinked here and there but definitely has it's serious moments too.<br/><br/>The movie is definitely a period piece and the movie nails it for the time period it is set in. It's some really well though out production design and visual choices for the atmosphere of this movie. Some very nice car models are put to good use in the movie which are very appealing to the eye. Overall a very well made movie about the competition between two monumental car companies and the tale of a man with his passion for racing"

","FORD V FERRARI<br/><br/>The battle between Ford and Ferrari has not gone down as one of the previous century's most important or serious, but, it does provide a nice backdrop for this entertaining drama.
FORD V FERRARI focuses on Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) a one-time Le Mans champion race car driver (1959) who was forced into retirement. He helps design new vehicles including hot-headed journeyman driver Ken Miles (Christian Bale). When the Ford motor company contacts Shelby in 1964 with the idea of helping them design a car that can beat the vaunted Ferrari line of winners at Le Mans and it's charismatic owner Enzo Ferrari (Remo Girone). Shelby enlists Miles and his band of mechanics and friends to take on the task.
Of course, working for the huge Ford corporation means also dealing with corporate interference. Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal) is portrayed as the benign intermediary between Shelby and The Man -- Henry Ford II (Tracy Letts). VP Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas) is the 'heavy' -- the kiss ass in the company who only looks out for himself. The company politics angle could have been interesting, but Ford and, especially, Beebe are cartoonish villains. Letts and Lucas do the best they can, but, just come off as buffoons more appropriate for a sit-com than the big screen.
Fortunately, when the action sticks to the racetrack, the movie mostly hums. Francois Audouy's Production Design is sharp and captured well by Phedon Papamichael's cinematography (although, like with NEBRASKA one wishes he'd tone down the digital 'grain'). It's a well-done physical and aural (David Giammarco's sound design is aces) production all around. The large cast acquits itself well. Damon is very effective as the driven but level-headed Shelby. Bale gets the showier role and relishes it. Caitriona Balfe brings some perk to the stock role of Miles' patient wife.
James Mangold Directs with a sure hand. His insistence on accuracy (for the most part) and actual vehicles and locations rather than a surfeit of CGI gives the movie some grit and verve that helps make up for the 'sports film' cliches which hamper the screenplay (three writers). Mangold is a pretty strong writer himself (LOGAN, COP LAND), so it's unfortunate he apparently didn't have much input there. The epilogue is surprisingly melancholy and lifts the movie from the standard -- Rah! Rah! straight to the credits finale -- most sports films settle for. The maturity only highlights how lite much of the rest of the movie is. FORD V FERRARI is the kind of A List big budgeted drama that is rarely seen any more. It's enjoyable, but, a mediocre script keeps it from finishing higher."

","In America this movie is titled Ford vs. Ferrari, that is essentially the big hook of the film, film critic Mark Kermode said in his review that this is very similar to Rush, in that the characters come first, and the cars come second (or some people say the other way around). From the trailer I saw I was definitely going to watch it at the cinema, directed by James Mangold (Walk the Line, Knight and Day, Logan). Basically, in1963, Ford Motor Company Vice President Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal) proposes to Henry Ford II (Tracy Letts) to purchase the cash-strapped Ferrari in order to boost their car sales by participating in the 24 Hours of Le Mans. However, Enzo Ferrari (Remo Girone) walks away from the deal, after Fiat offer a more lucrative deal that allows him to retain his ownership of Scuderia Ferrari. Henry II is furious and orders his racing division to build a car to defeat Ferrari at Le Mans. For this task, Iacocca hires Shelby American owner and retired racing driver Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon), he won Le Mans in 1959, he was forced to stop due to his heart condition. In turn, Shelby enlists the help of Ken Miles (Golden Globe nominated Christian Bale), a hot-tempered British racer and struggling mechanic. Shelby and Miles test the Ford GT40 Mk I prototype at Los Angeles International Airport, finding all its design flaws and making the necessary improvements until it is ready to race. Ford do not see Miles as their ideal driver, due to his abrasive attitude, they opt to send Phil Hill (James Tyler Paulson) and Bruce McLaren (Benjamin Rigby) to the 1964 Le Mans instead. As predicted by Miles, none of the Ford vehicles finish the race. While Henry II sees this as a humiliating defeat, Shelby explains that the GT40 reached higher speeds than Ferrari, instilling fear in them on the Mulsanne straight, before it broke down. Shelby and Miles continue development on the GT40 Mk II, but Miles is nearly killed when the car's brakes fail during testing. In 1966, Ford Senior Vice President Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas) takes over the racing division and intends again to continue the program without Miles. But Shelby gives Henry II a ride in the car and wages his own company on the line to convince him that if Miles wins the 24 Hours of Daytona, he will be allowed to race at Le Mans. Shelby American enters Daytona, but Beebe has a second Ford entered with NASCAR team Holman-Moody supporting it. While the Holman-Moody team has quicker pit stops, Shelby has Miles push his car to the limit, resulting in him winning the race. At the 1966 Le Mans, Miles struggles with a faulty door during the first lap, team engineer Phil Remington (Ray McKinnon) fixes the door, bashing it with a mallet. Miles catches up with the Ferraris and begins to set lap records. His wife Mollie (Caitriona Balfe) and son Peter (A Quiet Place's Noah Jupe) watch and listen to the action as it unfolds.
Miles. While racing with Ferrari driver Lorenzo Bandini (Francesco Bauco), Miles experiences another brake failure, but the system is replaced during his pit stop. Enzo Ferrari protests the move, but Shelby convinces the race officials that the brake change is legal. Miles and Bandini once again duel on the Mulsanne Straight, but Bandini's engine blows, and Ferrari are completely eliminated from the race. With three Ford teams in the top-three positions, Beebe orders Shelby to have Miles slow down for the other two Fords to catch up with him and provide the press with a three-car photo finish. Miles is initially against this decision, continuing to set new lap records near the end of the race, but decides to let Ford have their way on the final lap. Ultimately, McLaren is declared the winner on a technicality, but Miles is grateful to Shelby for giving him the opportunity to race at Le Mans. Ultimately, McLaren is declared the winner on a technicality, as one of their cars crossed the finish line just ahead. Although devastated by this decision, Miles is grateful to Shelby for giving him the opportunity to race at Le Mans. Two months after Le Mans, Miles is testing the J-car at Riverside International Raceway, Miles experiences another brake failure and is killed in the resulting crash. Six months later, Shelby pays Miles' family a visit, Mollie watches as he gives Peter a wrench that Miles threw at him before winning an SCCA race at Willow Springs in 1963. Ford would continue its winning streak at Le Mans in 1967, 1968, and 1969, becoming the only American manufacturer to win the prestigious race. Miles was posthumously inducted into the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America in 2001. Also starring JJ Field as Roy Lunn, Jack McMullen as Charlie Agapiou, Benjamin Rigby as Bruce McLaren, Alex Gurney as Dan Gurney (playing his own father) and Ben Collins (formerly The Stig in Top Gear) as Denny Hulme. Damon as the man putting everything into making the winning vehicle and Bale as the loose cannon British racer unafraid to say whatever he thinks are both perfectly cast. It is most interesting true story, corporate company Ford wanting to regain their mojo by winning the 24-hour race, conflicting with the maverick petrolheads, fantastic chalk-and-cheese characters. You grow to like the characters in the slower moments, then you go to breakneck speed in the twists and turns of the racetracks, the race sequences are indeed fast paced with nail-biting crashes, all fantastically edited and with terrific sound design, overall it is an exciting and most enjoyable sports drama. It won the Oscars for Best Film Editing, and Best Sound Editing, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture of the Year, and Best Sound Mixing, and it won the BAFTA for Best Editing, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, and Best Sound. Very good!"
"HillstreetBunz","8","0","1","21 November 2019"," Bumpy start, exciting on the turns, brilliant race to the finish.
","Ok well... I found a fair bit of the script (especially in early scenes) way too expositional. Some characters rather one dimensional (e.g. Leo Beebe).
It doesn't help that Josh Lucas has the kind of eyes/looks that are too distracting, he should just be a model! Central casting was clearly in the hands of someone with a 'type', which meant the players sometimes looked like an Annie Leibowitz Vanity Fair centre spread of the fashion worlds glitterati.
The director seemed to want to include the 'Englishness' theme (properly recognising the British influence on racing at this period and elsewhere) a little too much, so Miles and Mrs Miles sometimes seemed to be trotting out shorthand for the same.
I know Bale was (is?) English, but his choice of regional accent (though it may have been factually correct, I don't know) jarred a little for me.
All that said, I did think Bale (who I don't ever really 'like' due to an inherent lack of warmth) was very good (as he usually is) and well cast; Damon was superb (AA nominee superb) in a more complex and nuanced role. Likewise Tracey Letts playing Ford, whom I know from the excellent 'Divorce'.
One thing that I never understood was that despite the film suggesting Ford was coming from a standing start, suddenly with no explanation a car arrives from England which is clearly the core of what became the GT40....what?!
I loved the style and the pace, the colour and the cinematography etc, and I thought the race scenes and the general race milieu were brilliantly depicted. I have seen The Times (London) critics dismissing the film as old fashioned etc, and as I say it has some clunky dialogue and characters get tells, but if it is old fashioned in any way, it is that it tells a story about people and their complexity and what it takes to deliver the extraordinary, rather than reiterate some fear based drivel about how the world will be saved by a morally ambiguous superhero in Lycra. So thank God for that.
Rather like many a good race, it had a bumpy start but got better and better and by the end I was gripped, standing on my feet and cheering (metaphorically). See it on the big screen and enjoy the race atmosphere."

","From the director of Logan comes a full-throttled, high-octane & adrenaline-fuelled sports drama that recounts the rivalry between Ford & Ferrari for the dominance at Le Mans endurance race in 1966. Ford v Ferrari (also known as Le Mans '66) is no doubt stylishly filmed & furiously paced but it also travels a rather safe route for the most part and isn't as memorable as its genre's finest offerings.<br/><br/>Directed by James Mangold, the film centres its plot on Carroll Shelby & Ken Miles while rivalry between two big corporations plays second fiddle to their stories. The racing segments are plentiful and are shot with kinetic flair. But the attempt to make the drama all macho & cool does not always deliver the best results as it dilutes the seriousness the film was aiming for, and appears as if it's trying too hard to grab our attention.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, the relation between man & machine is captured with purity, and that bonding remains intact from start to finish. Instead of two corporations battling it out for supremacy in endurance racing, the story derives its conflict from disagreements that arise within Ford's racing crew & corporate executives. This element does keep the interest alive but the dramatic portions do not pack the same grip & punch that the racing scenes do.<br/><br/>Matt Damon & Christian Bale are brilliant in their respective roles of Shelby & Miles, both individually & when sharing screen together. Damon is focused in his rendition while Bale embodies his role in ways only he can, thus adding another terrific input to his résumé. Overall, Ford v Ferrari is a competently crafted & technically polished biopic that narrates the real-life events with gusto and is fun, thrilling & entertaining enough to satisfy both racing enthusiasts & casual filmgoers. Certainly worth a shot."

Noah Jupe, who plays Bale's son Peter is also superb. The race photography and sound are wonderful - you really do get sucked into the exhilaration of it all. The only thing missing is the smell of the petrol fumes. I was slightly dubious that I could ever want a Ford (think: box, square, dull, Henry Fonda) to defeat a Ferrari (think: sleek. red, classy, James Dean) but in the end, I sort of did. 2½ hours just flies by.

","The movie was well made and from that I have read, mostly historically accurate. It had great actors, the ferrari's looked gorgeus along with the other cars. If some parts of the races were cgi (most likely some were) they weren't recoqnisable.<br/><br/>It felt a bit off that the Italians were clearly made out to be the bad guys, with the drivers facial expressions among other things. Also we didn't see anything from Ferrari outside the racing scenes. I also would have really liked to see a bit of the cars design process, but no, the car just suddenly appeared out of no where and then we went on from that fixing the problems it had. Miles's wife's sudden mental breakdown in their car also felt off and was a bit strange. The movie generally left a lot of stuff unexplained, even though it was 2,5h long. Every time when the cars were racing music was playing in the background, I would have liked to have sometimes only hear the cars engines with no music."

This movie is based on a true story about the fierce rivalry between Ford Motor Company and Ferrari.

They hired Matt-playing Carroll Shelby-to build them a fast car to beat Ferrari. Jon-playing Lee Iacocca-is a negotiator for Ford. Josh is a Ford executive that does not like Matt's pick for a driver, Christian-playing Ken Miles. It is an interesting story of an American car designer trying to beat the European champions.

It's a straightforward drama but at times, to my surprise, the movie is downright hilarious! There are two scenes where I couldn't stop laughing. Those low angle wide shots will give you eyegasm.
Bale and Damon's tempestuous friendship on screen is the real highlight of the movie made believable by their wonderful performances.

","This was a lot better than I thought it was going to be although I had some issues that held this film from being really good. The first 30-45 minutes were just uninteresting to me. It was well acted but there was nothing that was keeping me interested. Once we get to the point where they are modifying the car, it gets pretty great. Christian Bale and Matt Damon do great jobs but Bale steals the show. Bale is perfectly cast and is fantastic as this angry race car driver. Both Damon and Bale have perfect chemistry and play off well with each other thanks to a pretty good script although not a perfect one. Most of the other actors did a pretty good job also. There is also some good chemistry between Bale and Noah Jupe who plays Bale's son. They also have some genuinely touching moments together. The only character I didn't like was Jon Bernthal's character. I thought he was extremely one dimensional and irritating. I thought the racing sequences in the film were fantastic. They are incredibly well shot and paced. Even though the film is based on true events, I still felt exhilarated and was on the edge of my seat. The Le Mans sequence was one of the best sequences in film that I saw so far this year. The sound mixing is pretty great also. It immerses you within the races which makes those sequences so much better. I felt the last 10 minutes of the film was pointless. I thought the film was gonna end after this desert scene that I won't spoil but it kept going on. The music was also pretty bland. Even after just seeing the film, I don't remember any of the music. Some of the other technical aspects that I liked was the cinematography. During the racing scenes, it was great and during the rest of the film, it was pretty good. The film has a couple visual effects scenes that I thought looked pretty good. Overall, Ford v Ferrari is a pretty good film with great racing sequences, great acting, and some good cinematography even if the first 30 minutes and last 10 minutes were generally uninteresting."

"RobertoLeoni","7","0","1","17 November 2019"," A Western with modern knights who ride engines
","(translation from Italian) American films all have their roots in the Western: the man who faces others, the man who faces nature, the man who faces the great challenge. In this film the great challenge takes place with two extraordinary protagonists: Matt Damon and Christian Bale. Because this film to express its epic is implanted on the model of the Western and on these modern knights who ride the steel and ride the engines, but the structure and narration are those of the Western. The merit of the director is that he has found this formula. In a show business which is now flawed and calibrated by digital, he first rediscovered an epic realism - as he had already done with Logan, his previous film - that brings us back with this strength and courage. The film is important for its realism: cars and races shoots delude us that we are really there, because they are not simply digital, they are true and perhaps enriched by digital, but not fake and electronic. You can almost hear the cinema seats vibrate in the race. I have been and am a passionate driver so I found myself immersed in the cars of the 60s. I had had some of them and I reviewed them like old loves. I told to the person sitting next to me that I suffered as a lifer forced to watch an adult movie in prison, because seeing again the forms of those cars, hearing the engines roar of cars I had, remembering the feelings and emotions I felt was poignant and beautiful. So, my review is definitely partial because I couldn't get away, though I tried to be cold, from the charm of these engines. By the way, we talk about mythical cars because there are the Le Mans 24 Hours Ferraris, which therefore are absolutely extraordinary and there are the Fords made for this challenge. Indeed, the root of the film is this. There is a famous line by Henry Ford I - in the film there is his nephew Henry Ford II - who in 1909 created the first inexpensive automobile because he introduced moving assembly belts to make various mechanical parts and his assembly line was revolutionary, a production system called Fordism. Ford had his own way of making it clear what was his marketing concept: ""Any customer can have a Model T painted any color that he wants - Model T was Ford first model - as long as it's black."" His grandson Henry Ford II is the protagonist of the challenge against Enzo Ferrari. Everyone knows the myth and strength of Ferrari. While Ford Motor Company was born in 1909, the racing team Scuderia Ferrari was born in 1929, but in 1937 Alfa Romeo for which Ferrari developed race cars decides to regain full control of its racing division and immediately after the war in 1947 Enzo Ferrari founds Ferrara S.p.A. which is the most successful team in the world with 15 World Drivers Championship titles and 16 Constructors. So clearly Henry Ford II realizes to have a titan next to him and despite having the biggest automobile industry of the time he must face a Goliath who has no slingshot, but a bullet, or rather a cannon in his hand and therefore can beat him at any time. However, the power of money, strength and will in the film are also born by Lee Iacocca, his marketing expert, who starts the challenge. Although actually it is said that one day Henry Ford II wanted to drive a Ferrari and after a lap, when he got off, he said: ""It's a perfect car, that damn Ferrari must have hired God to design it."" In this kind of respect there is all the film yeast, the spring that triggers the story, making Ford decide to beat Ferrari on Le Mans race. 24 diabolic and terrible hours, whatever the weather: with the fog, with rain, with cold for 24 hours at a time the cars must run at infernal speed, reaching the famous, desperate, terrible 7,000 rpm. At 7,000 rpm it immediately goes out of phase and the cars grab, so you have to be constantly careful. The one with the most resistant rider wins with the best pilot, with the best car, more reliable, more powerful. These two elements combined must shoot in this hellish carousel for 24 hours, challenged by other terrible pilots with other diabolical cars. All against all in this eternal lap. The night goes down and you must run, the fog rises and you must run, rain comes and you must run, there is the sun that breaks the stones and you have to keep running. This is the 24 Hours of Le Mans and who wins there it's like he came out of hell. From 1960 Ferrari had won 5 times in a row and at this point it's up to Ford to beat him choosing two knights as Shine. In a western movie they would have been two gunslingers: one who has fought so many challenges, but is temporarily disabled - in a western movie he would be wounded in one hand or he would have the classic shoulder injury while his friend tells him ""Come on, we'll make it"" - and must train another gunslinger for this challenge, perhaps younger, perhaps less experienced, maybe as good as him, but irascible, not controllable. Therefore this couple joins to face this challenge by transforming it - and this is thanks to director James Mangold - in a talent challenge against marketing because it's not just Ford against Ferrari, but also the eternal challenge that is always there between artistic flash and prosaic reality. Ford makes this race to sell cars, so he must win but he must sell, while instead Ferrari makes the race for his pride, just to win. So this great challenge begins."

","Damon and Bale are terrific but and average Wacky Racers episode has more character depth. Racing exciting enough, even if Bale seems to have learnt how to drive by watching Talladega Nights. Far too long, but at least you can top up the popcorn and miss nothing."

","Generally enjoyable but could have benefited from a 20-minute trim.<br/><br/>Also, in many of the racing/practice scenes, the cars seemed to be doing about 70 while showing us speedometers indicating 200. With all the CGI in this movie, it wouldn't have taken much more of it to add a real sense of speed.<br/><br/>Good performances, decent script. Give it a go."
"varun-25071997","7","0","6","15 November 2019"," Christian Bale and Matt Damon save this predictable Drama
","Both the lead actors of Ford V Ferrari are some of the finest actors of this generation who have been struggling to find a hit since 2015. But this film has given them a much needed hit and potential Oscar nominations. Mangold has delivered a very good follow up after the blockbuster Logan. This film scores high on production values compared to other action / racing films which is a huge plus point"
"emelschwartz-87386","8","0","5","15 November 2019"," It's good value if you base it on film length!
","Wow, this movie is looooooong
Some good acting.
Saw it today in an X screen (wrap around) which didn't really add to what's a good movie already.
Some characters seem a bit contrived but that aside a good set of acting from Damon and Bale"
