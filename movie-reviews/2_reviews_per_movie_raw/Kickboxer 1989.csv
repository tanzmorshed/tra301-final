"Captain_Couth","7","33","39","11 October 2004"," Revenge of the 80's: Jean-Claude Van Damme, Superstar.
","Kickboxer (1989) was another in a long line of star vehicles for the ""Muscles from Brussels"". In this picture J.C.V.D. plays the younger brother of a unbeaten American kick boxer who lusts for some real competition. So he decides to go to the home of Muay Thai kick boxing, Thailand. There he realizes that he doesn't know squat about the true art of kick boxing. He learns a painful lesson. His younger brother decides to learn Muay Thai and avenge his brother's honor.<br/><br/>Not a bad movie. Entertaining and a good time waster. But for some reason the producers decided to franchise out this series. The rest of the films are a mixed bag at best. The more they made the least interesting they became until the final results were unwatchable. As always with these films the first film is usually the best of the bunch. Jean-Claude plays his character with a thick euro-accent (I forgot how they explained it). He's physically impressive so it's kind of hard to swallow his naiveté about fighting and what not. Or well. Fun for all.<br/><br/>Recommended."
"ivo-cobra8","10","87","111","12 March 2018"," The best of Van Damme my favorite martial arts classic film of all time
","Kickboxer (1989) is one of the best martial arts films that Jean-Claude Van Damme ever made. I am a huge fan of Van Damme, I absolutely love this film to death! It is a cult classic film that Jean-Claude Van Damme made in to a star. Hard Target is Jean-Claude Van Damme's favorite number 1 film of mine this is my second favorite film of his. Bloodsport and Kickboxer are Van Damme's best films of the 80's he ever did. Since he edited Bloodsport himself and Cyborg flopped, Van Damme went and make this film that even today it is one of his best films of his career.<br/><br/>After an US Champion Eric Sloane (Dennis Alexio who was a kickboxing champion in real life) and his brother Kurt Sloane (Jean-Claude Van Damme) travel to Thailand, Bangkok to fight the Thailand Champion Tong Po (Michel Qissi). In the ring the fight is different than in America in a Muay Thai style and Eric get's hurt and paralyzed for life by Tong Po. Van Damme is angrier and vows for revenge, so he meets this guy Vietnam vet retired Winston Taylor (Haskell V. Anderson III) who helps Van Damme on his mission. With the help of the Thai master Xian Chow (Dennis Chan) who becomes his teacher, trains him and getting him ready for the fight of his life. <br/><br/>What can I say I love this movie to death, this movie kicks ass. It is great choreographed, it has no wires, just real action. Real fights they were all choreographed from Jean-Claude Van Damme him self. I love that the location was shot in Thailand and not in America. The director Mark DiSalle did a wonderful job directing this beautiful movie. David Worth was good by helping co directing it. Music was made from Paul Hertzog who made the music montage for Bloodsport. Trough inter film we se Van Damme training I love that, I love how Van Damme trains in the Stone City. The whole training montage was inspired from The Karate Kid and Rocky IV. Kickboxer defines my childhood I grew up watching Van Damme as a kid and Kickboxer is still my favorite film. Tong Po (Michel Qissi) is one of the best bad guys of all time. <br/><br/>On the end of the film we se the last fight with Kurt and Tong Po in the ""ancient way"", with a broken glass which it is a beautiful well choreographed. I love how Van Damme kick's and defats with martial arts Tong Po one of the best fights in the movie I ever seen. Van Damme dances while been drunk and kicks Freddy Li's fighters to the ground. Van Damme kicks a fighter in a tournament and deafets him in a kickbox match. I love the songs played in the film: Never Surrender, Fight for Love and Streets of Siam by Stan Bush. This movie spawned 4 sequels and 2 reboot films but no one of those films come near this movie. Don The Dragon Wilson can suck Van Damme's dick for challenging him Don your movies suck. Steven Seagal get your fat ass out of Van Damme way because Van Damme would have kicked your face with his technique to the ground on the dirt. <br/><br/>10 out of 10 Kickboxer is my all time favorite Jean-Claude Van Damme martial arts film and kicks ass, it is a cult classic film of all time. I love the cast, the direction I love everything about this film. I love this film to death."
"joliet-jake","7","38","47","30 December 2004"," pretty good movie
","this is the one of my favorite van dam movies. I think that it is also one of his best films. We watch his character train throughout the movie for a fight at the end. The martial arts throughout are very well done. This is one of those films you can watch every time it is on TV. If you like martial arts movies you will probably enjoy this one. The movie though is all about the final fight. Like many other films of its type. All in all van dam is great and if you want to see a film based on the martial arts that doesn't have Druce Lee or Jackie Chan or Jet Li in it then this movie is one for you. The story is pretty simple but the fight scenes are worth it so go for it. 7 out of 10."
"Movie Nuttball","10","39","49","9 October 2003"," Great Van Damme movie! One of his best!
","This is one of Van Damme's best films! I thought his acting was really good especially when he was crying. Michel Qissi and Dennis Chan very good good. There is a lot of action in the film. Tong Po's introduction was cool! The music by Paul Hertzog was good. Kickboxer has three sequels and I think the the second movie is arguably better than the first one and this one is excellent! If like Van Damme's other great movies such as Bloodsport, Cyborg, Hard Target, and Sudden Death then I recommend you watch Kickboxer!"
"sveknu","7","20","24","3 January 2006"," Great van Damme movie from the good old days
","This is a splendid movie. It's van Damme exactly as I want to see him, with great martial arts action, a decent plot (even if it's not original at all), cool characters and a great 80's soundtrack. The movie is somewhat different from Bloodsport. Of course there are similarities too, like an evil fighting champion that van Damme is fighting. But this movie hasn't nearly as many fights as Bloodsport. Instead, it's more focus on training here. The training scenes are visually very good, and with really cool background music. Even though I had expected more fighting instead of this, there's no doubt that this is a great movie in it's own way."
"The__Watcher","9","44","59","13 January 2001"," Explosive Martial Arts Move!
","This is one of the best martial arts movie ever made. It's got ""Damme"" good soundtrack , ""Damme"" good story line and ""Damme"" good training. The last fight is the best I've ever seen. I've seen 2 different versions and they're both good. This is a must watch Van Damme movie."
"martymaster","Null","23","30","21 January 2002"," The only good Kickboxer movie in the series.
","It has been made a lot of sequels in this series,but this one is the only that is worth watching. It is kind of like Rocky,in the sense that he traines all the movie for a fight in the end. The fight scenes are hardcore and the one at the end is quite cool. This cant be compared to the best movies of Jackie Chan and Jet Li,but it is still a good martial arts movie.<br/><br/>One of Van Dammes best to date."
"malkane316","7","8","9","5 May 2005"," Quick Reviews!!
","Probably the most famous of Van Damme's early work, kick-boxer is another simple story of revenge, and a showcase for his skills as a martial artist. It has some good fights, and some interesting moments showing the difficulty of training and trying to achieve your best while not losing your focus. Although it suffers from some cheesy acting, dialogue, music, and a highly disturbing dance scene, this is a must for Van Damme fans, and those with an interest in martial arts movies who don't want to stray too far from the West.<br/><br/>Van Damme stars as Kurt Sloane, the younger brother of a flashy American Kickboxer. They train together, but his brother Eric seems to be more interested in looking like a good fighter than actually finding the ability and skill to be one. Eric takes part in a fighting competition and is crippled and almost killed by Tong Po, and fearsome Kickboxer with a great rage and discipline. Kurt decides to avenge his brother, but no-one will train him as they believe Tong Po is too popular and strong. Eventually he finds a trainer in the middle of nowhere who teaches him to reach his full potential and push through the barriers which he never though he could surpass. He also meets Winston Tyler who provides some laughs, and Mylee who provides some style. Of course it is the fights that matter, and the revenge plot is safe enough to give the fights reason. Rather than cheap montages, we see the tough training regime Kurt goes through, and see Tong Po kicking a cement wall to build up the strength and invulnerability of his foot. Sounds odd yes, but how else would we know he's a hard lad? Anyway, a good film for fight fans, light-hearted and fast and worth watching.<br/><br/>7.5 out of 10"
"Mr_JM84","9","20","27","25 October 2005"," Great action movie
","I have rented this movie out numerous times and i love watching it every time, its a movie that i just cant get enough of and is a movie that i would someday like to own on video or DVD.<br/><br/>The story is pretty simple it's about a man named Kurt Sloan played by Van Dame, who's brother Eric Sloan gets brutally crippled after fighting undefeated Muhay Thai kickboxing champion Tong Po, Kurt Sloan then meets Xian played by Dennis Chan who latter agrees to train Kurt so that he can be good enough to fight Tong Po and beat him to get revenge for his brother.<br/><br/>This is by far my favourite martial arts movie, it has lots of great fighting and action and also contains some lovely scenery of Thailand which the movie is set in and was filmed in.<br/><br/>A highly recommended movie for all martial arts action movie fans."
"dee.reid","7","14","19","9 May 2006"," Jean-Claude Van Damme goes Muay Thai-style!
","Nah, you're not interested in ""Kickboxer,"" the Jean-Claude Van Damme martial arts movie set in the exotic and mysterious Thailand and focuses in on the brutal sport of Muay Thai, are you? You're not going to miss Van Damme's hammy acting, his trademark splits, or his harsh (although according to some sources, inaccurate) training and portrayal in and of the Thai sport of Muay Thai, are you?<br/><br/>Of course you do. The Muscles From Brussels goes Thai in this 1989 adventure, with the Belgian actor exploring the martial arts fundamentals of Muay Thai, the national sport of Thailand, which has gained wider recognition in the West because it's the de facto fighting style for mixed martial arts and Thai-native newcomer Tony Jaa seeks to promote his tiny country's greatest commodity for a worldwide audience. But this is a Van Damme movie, first and foremost. True he's no great actor, but there's something about his work here that makes me want to watch ""Kickboxer"" again and again.<br/><br/>First things first, what is Muay Thai? As already stated, it's the national sport of Thailand, where the fighter will condition his body so that his arms and legs become weapons capable of delivering blows, kicks in particular, that are three times as powerful as that of any ordinary martial artist. He'll also use his feet, fists, shins, and elbows too. If one wants to go all out, two guys will get in a ring and have themselves a rope-fist fight, where the fighters' wrists are bound in rope and covered with broken glass. Isn't that mean and nasty?<br/><br/>To begin ""Kickboxer,"" Van Damme is Kurt Sloane, brother of Eric (Dennis Alexio), the top kickboxer in the United States. Tiring of the generic competition of his native soil, he travels with brother Kurt to Bangkok, where he hopes to dethrone the current champ Tong Po (Michel Qissi), who has a reputation for fighting dirty. Kurt first sees this towering mountain of flesh and muscle kicking the hell out of a support beam in the locker room; that's the first clue to Kurt that Eric shouldn't get in the ring, but he's not listening.<br/><br/>And Eric fights anyway, against baby brother's warnings.<br/><br/>To make long stories short, Eric takes quite a beating in the ring but a series of illegal blows delivered after Kurt throws in the towel cripple Eric for life. So what went wrong? According to some sources, American Kickboxing is a watered-down form of Muay Thai, so it's no wonder Tong Po got the upper hand so quickly on Eric, who despite his excellent training and peak physical condition, only landed a few lucky punches on the towering fighter. Apparently, Muay Thai is strictly for street fighting, not something for refined martial artists like Kurt and Eric.<br/><br/>To teach Tong Po a lesson in humility, Kurt contacts American Winston Taylor (Haskell V. Anderson III) to seek out a venerated Thai master, Xian Chow (Dennis Chan), to learn the art of Muay Thai, and so the training begins. Kurt first puts aside his already-planted Karate training and strengthens his body, kicks tree stumps until the scar tissue prevents any kind of feeling aside from invincibility, learns a little about Asian spirituality, and even flirts with Chow's niece Mylee (Rochelle Ashana). What it all culminates in, of course, is a no-holds-barred ""Rocky IV""-style showdown using the ancient rope-fists between Kurt and Tong Po.<br/><br/>As someone who knows next to nothing about Muay Thai (in fact, much of what I know comes from Wikipedia and the special features section of the ""Ong-Bak: The Thai Warrior"" DVD), I found ""Kickboxer"" to still be quite entertaining. It's brutal stuff, really, so it's no wonder Muay Thai is gaining such greater notoriety in the United States. As Kurt Sloane, Van Damme is good (despite his acting limitations in showing emotions), his performance notwithstanding, and none of the other performers are really worth speaking of either, but Tong Po is a nasty villain and his one speaking line ""You bleed like Mylee; Mylee good f**k"" sends chills down the spine.<br/><br/>The fights are another thing and are what this feature co-directed by Mark DiSalle and David Worth seems to specialize in. The fights are spectacular (as with any martial arts movie that features Van Damme doing his trademark splits and 360-degree flying spin-kick), which does include one sequence where Kurt gets drunk, starts dancing, and takes on the patrons at a bar.<br/><br/>This ""Kickboxer"" - it's a kick, just don't let it ""kick"" you in the head too much with its lackadaisical script and lame-brain plotting.<br/><br/>7/10"
"NightmareOnElmStreetFan","10","4","4","8 February 2019"," The story about White Warrior - the best kickboxing fight martial arts film ever Van Damme's best movie my fifth personal favorite
","Seriously one of the best martial arts movies that Van Damme ever did. I really love Kikcboxer to death it is a cult classic film. The movie is like Rocky in a revenge style. I am huge Jean-Claude Van Damme fan I grew up watching his movies. Hard Target is Jean-Claude Van Damme's favorite number 1 film Van Damme is from Belgium Europe. His character was born in Belgium so he is practically based on Van Damme's life. My fifth favorite Van Damme film of all time his best one.<br/><br/>It was beautiful wonderful directed by Mark DiSalle who directed wonderful this movie. Jean-Claude Van Damme's performance is one of the best in the movie. I love his character so much as Kurt Sloane. I love how he trains trough whole movie the movie is like ""The Karate Kid"" but uses Muay Thai style in the training sequence. Jean-Claude Van Damme directed the fight scenes he was the choreographer of the movie. I love the music score by Paul Hertzog who also made a music score for Bloodsport Van Damme's first lead role movie. This was Van Damme's last movie in the 80's he did. We got now 7 Kickboxer movies because there were 4 sequels and 2 reboots so we got 7 Kickboxers. This movie did not need any sequels and it did not need to be remade. It should have been a stand-up alone movie. It is the best one of all 6 movies that come out none of those films come near this movie.<br/><br/>I love the fight scenes that were really choreographed no wires, no CGI all practical done for real. Real actions. I love Van Damme in the Maylee store kick's 2 guys from Freddy Li beating them like a real martial artist, he kicked them ass. I love the finale in which Van Damme kick's and defats with martial arts Tong Po one of the best fights in the movie I ever seen. Van Damme dances while been drunk and kicks Freddy Li's fighters to the ground. Van Damme kicks a fighter in a tournament and defeats him in a kickbox match. You have also 2 dogs in a movie one is Kiki in which Xian Chow owns him and one is in the opening sequence and I love dogs. I am an animal lover and I respect Van Damme and love him so much. Van Damme love dogs and I love dogs too, I am so glad he let dogs in his movie yay. I love you Van Damme so much. His my second favorite action star with Sylvester Stallone. The whole training montage was inspired from The Karate Kid and Rocky IV.<br/><br/>I love the songs played in the film: Never Surrender, Fight for Love and Streets of Siam by Stan Bush. Seriously I grew up watching this movie even me kicked in a door with my knee pretending to be a palm tree in which Van Damme kicks it. When Xian Chow provokes Van Damme, he kicks palm tree to the ground. Michel Qissi was excellent as the villain Tong Po he also played in Bloodsport Suan Parades with Van Damme and he also reunited in Lionheart again with Van Damme. He was the only with Dennis Chan who returned for the sequel with Sasha Mitchell. Dennis Chan as Xian Chow was awesome as Kurt trainer but in which he performed that Tai Chi style that was a stunt double sorry but I recognize a stunt double.<br/><br/>Haskell Anderson as Winston Taylor was awesome as bad-ass Vietnam vet retired a retired US Army special forces I love the guy in this movie. Former world kickboxing champion Dennis Alexio was great as Eric Sloane. All fights were done for real. I liked Rochelle Ashana as Mylee who played Kurt's love interest.<br/><br/>Kikcboxer is my fifth favorite martial-arts film definitely Jean-Claude Van Damme's best film. It is in my top 10 Van Damme favorite films."
"monkey-man","7","16","23","29 July 2005"," One of Jean-Claude Dammes best movies
","This movie is really good and its about a Kickboxer and his brother who go to Thailand to fight the Thai Kick boxing champion and the American Kickboxer loses and ends up being paralyzed and then his brother gos and gets kick boxing training in a remote part of Thailand to revenge his brother.There are heaps of good scenes in this movie like all of the scenes of the city Bangkok and of all of the beautiful temples and the great fight scenes in the end of the movie.This movie stars good actors like the great action star Jean-Claude Van Damme,Dennis Chan,Dennis Alexio,Michel Qissi and Haskell V. Anderson The III.Kickboxer is one of Vam Dammes best movies and so are the movies Blood Sport,Nowhere To Run,TimeCop,The Quest and Hard Target.Over all this movie was good with NEVER a boring scene and my rating is 7 out of 10."
"bunjiworm","8","8","10","9 February 2006"," Underrated
","I think this film is way underrated. Films don't always have to be clean - in the sense that every transition runs smoothly, or there's untold holes in the plot. The fact of the matter is - this movie made me feel emotions : hate, anger, disapproval, revenge, happiness, and relief.<br/><br/>Now, although that means nothing to you, it sure as hell means something to me. That is the joy of movies - that pretence can simulate emotions so well.<br/><br/>Now, to me, Van Damme is not really a great actor. But the good thing is - he was part of the preproduction process so - the story is precious to him personally, so he gives a better performance than most films.<br/><br/>Bloodsport is a dumb Hollywood replica of this movie. This is truly a great film, and the music by Paul Hertzog helps a great deal - a really great deal.<br/><br/>The only thing I disapprove of is Van Damme is playing an American with a Belgian accent."
"avatar-42","Null","7","9","2 February 2002"," Very good movie
","Well not as good as Bloodsports, but i think this is the next best movie of van damme, very good action.<br/><br/>A Classic scene when van damme is dancing in the bar drunk, thats one part i will never forget too damn funny!! that part is worth the price of the movie"
"bowmanblue","7","3","3","10 May 2017"," A true classic (somehow)
","When it comes to those musclebound heroes who were so popular in the eighties/early nineties, you kind of remember their breakthrough roles. 'The Terminator' is still a classic to this day and you can see how it catapulted Arnold Schwarzenegger into super-stardom. The same can be said for 'Rocky' and 'Die Hard' for Sylvester Stallone and Bruce Willis respectively. It was fair to say that Jean Claude Van Damme hadn't done much before he starred as the lead in 'Kickboxer' (and a brief turn as the Predator before he threw a hissy-fit on set doesn't count – seriously, look that up). In 'Kickboxer' he plays a ballet dancer who turns professional kickboxer to avenge the crippling of his (also kickboxer) brother in the ring at the hands of a psycho. No, really. That's the plot.<br/><br/>Okay, so you can expect a certain amount of training, in-ring fighting and romantic love interest thrown in there for good measure. That's all taken for granted in pretty much any film. However, all these tropes can't hide the fact that Van Damme isn't really that great actor. Okay, so he's hardly improved dramatically over the years, but he's definitely got better to justify his casting as a lead. Here, he can barely look like he understands other characters' lines, let alone form a facial expression that relates to them. I guess what I'm trying to say it that, even if 'Kickboxer' isn't the worst film ever made, it's quite hard to see how this was a springboard for his rise to stardom.<br/><br/>I suppose he was cast simply because of his looks (which my girlfriend tells me are pretty hot back then – not to mention other areas of his anatomy!) and his ability to throw a kick or two. That, he can do for sure. Yes, the film-makers may have felt the need to overlay a sound effect reminiscent of you hitting a sponge sofa really hard over every punch, but you can tell he's really got the moves in the ring.<br/><br/>'Kickboxer' is a classic. Everything about it should make it bad – reading back over this review I can see how scathing I sound. And yet, after watching it, I really don't feel like I've wasted my time and even enjoyed much of it. Yes, it's quite silly in places and the songs played over (alleged dramatic moments) sound like something Trey Parker and Matt Stone would spoof in 'South Park.' Plus the overall story plays out like a slightly more violent 'Karate Kid' movie, but it's still fun. You'll have seen it all before and know exactly where it's going, but if you're a fan of JCVD, or are just happy to sit through martial arts movies or general eighties overblown cheese, you should find some enjoyment here."

Full of what makes a great Van Damme film. We have splits, the spinning kick and some excellent dress sense. But what makes Kickboxer such a great film is 1.) When Van Damme says ""I was sent by Mr Xian for his eh grocheries"" truly magnificent. 2.) The scene where Van Damme is drunk and is dancing. Utter genius.<br/><br/>

","Somehow, this film ends up being hugely enjoyable, no matter who watches it. There is something for everyone.<br/><br/>If you like martial arts, Jean Claude Van Damme's technique and physique is exceptional; if you like foreign travel, there are plenty of scenes in Thailand; if you like embarrassingly-bad 80s synth-pop, you will cry laughing at the soundtrack; but the stand-out moment in the whole movie has to be the dance scene in the bar. Some issues: <br/><br/>1) what the hell is he wearing? <br/><br/>2) How do you watch this scene without cringing?<br/><br/>JCVD choreographed all the fight scenes, so I guess he must have choreographed the dancing too. Either it's a brilliant piece of acting, or he really does have too high an opinion of his dancing ability! Surely one of the funniest sequences in movie history..."
"dauplaisej","7","4","5","2 April 2005"," Muay Thai Muy Bien
","Jean-Claude Van Damme turns in a solid performance as Kurt Sloane - the younger brother who seeks revenge against the demoniacally sadistic Bangkok bad guy, Tong Po (Michel Qissi), who paralyzes Kurt's older brother - Eric - implausibly cast and ineptly acted by Dennis Alexio. The simplistic explanation for the siblings' lack of resemblance to one another in terms of class, ethnicity - and language is too hilariously weak to warrant revealing. Although the film is rife - and ripe - with trademark eighties cheese, the Muay Thai fight sequences are adroitly choreographed, shot and edited. This film is a must for Muay Thai buffs and offers plenty of unintentionally, but nonetheless highly comical relief. Without a doubt, the best of the three Kickboxer films --- but also quite possibly the one possessed of the very worst soundtrack."

The myth Van Damme can't act persists, but is disproved in this fantastic movie.

","The original movie ""Kickboxer"" from 1989 starring Jean-Claude Van Damme is a true 80's action classic, Van Damme stars as Kurt Sloane brother of American Kickboxer champion Eric Sloan(Dennis Alexio)they find them self traveling to Thailand to challenge there worldchampion in Thai kickboxing Tong Po, the fight begins and Tong Po is not only domenating the whole fight, but in the end delivers a lethal elbow to Eric back to paralyze him for life, Kurt(Van Damme) is now on a vendetta against Tong Po to revenge his brother.<br/><br/>
Kickboxer is one of Van Damme's best films(not as good as bloodsport though)The Storyline might be weak, but the film as said is a true 80's action classic,and all in all Kickboxer(DVD edition) is a 'must' for all action fans. The DVD itself has exellent picture and sound, there's not soo many features on the DVD(would have been nice to have the original movie trailer on it) but i does provides biografi for both the main actors as well as directors.(followed by several direct to video sequels)."
"johnny_riot","8","5","7","22 February 2006"," Van Damme excels in Kickboxing
","This film was excellent. The fighting scenes by Van Damme was utterly inspirational, especially when he fights to avenge his brother's crippling from the master of kickboxing.<br/><br/>Overall, the film's base is fairly good, with particular emphasis to the overwhelming fighting scenes and the eventual training of martial arts.<br/><br/>The film compares to many other of the Muscles From Brussels films, including 'In Hell', although this film rates as one of the best i have witnessed with him in a lead role. I would definitely recommend viewing this fim, for pleasure or teaching."
"Truman-10","Null","5","7","11 October 1999"," One the the greatest films ever made
","Kickboxer is a hauntingly beautiful portrayal of brotherly love, expressed through the ballet of kicking people as hard as you can. Watch as Jean Claude Van-Damme's brother is ruthlessly and evily almost kicked to death, and how JC himself heroically almost kicks the culprit to death. Van Damme deserved an Oscar for the way he portrayed his grief and anger through one blank facial expression. People say Hollywood treats it's audience like idiots, but they delivered a wonderful film here for people who want to see other people being KICKED REALLY, REALLY HARD."

","Having just watched Kickboxer for the very first time last night, it is still very fresh in my mind.  He is such an amazing guy, flexible to boot and at the obvious peak of his career. The only thing that plagued my mind, was the awful music interludes which were dotted into the plot, with Jean-Claude, walking around aimlessly, eighties music blasting, lyrics that would make Michael Jackson cry....... Anyway, I really enjoyed the movie.  It was a lot of fun!"

"Maziun","6","2","2","11 September 2018"," The Muscles from Brussels goes to Thailand
","This is one of best Van Damme movies right there with ""Bloodsport"". In some ways I like ""Kickboxer"" even more than ""Bloodsport"". It's a simple revenge story that makes a good use of Van Damme's fighting skills. In this movie we explore the martial arts fundamentals of Muay Thai. It's the national sport of Thailand, where the fighter will condition his body so that his arms and legs become weapons capable of delivering blows, kicks in particular, that are three times as powerful as that of any ordinary martial artist. He'll also use his feet, fists, shins, and elbows too. It's the de facto fighting style for mixed martial arts.<br/><br/>The acting here is a mixed bag. Van Damme is very hammy and Dennis Alexio has no talent at all . On the other hand Dennis Chan is a good copy of Mr. Myiagi from ""Karate kid"" as Xian Chow and Haskell V. Anderson III is fun as Winston Taylor a retired Vietnam War veteran. Let's not forget about Michel Qissi who is unforgettable as the main villain - Tong Po. Tong Po is mistakenly billed as playing himself (on the film's credits). Qissi can also be seen in two other Van Damme movies ""Bloodsport"" and ""Lionheart"". He also appeared in sequel to this movie - ""Kickboxer 2"".<br/><br/>There are some really cool scenes here - Van Damme training with the dog , the drunk fight in the bar , Van Damme and the palm , final fight with the hands bound with glass. The soundtrack here is unfortunately forgettable and can't compare to the one in ""Bloodsport"".<br/><br/>I give it 6/10. ""Kickboxer"" is a cheesy , lighthearted , entertaining little action movie. A small classic. Co-directed by Mark DiSalle and David Worth it's well paced with nice fight scenes. The producers decided to franchise out this series. Other movies are unwatchable. Stick with this fun little time waster."
"alexanderdavies-99382","7","2","2","8 August 2018"," Van Damme has finally arrived!
","Along with ""Bloodsport"" from the previous year, ""Kickboxer"" sealed it for JCVD. 
 The fight scenes - more graphic than usual - are some of the best I've seen throughout Jean Claude Van Damme's career. 
 We are witness to the martial art of Muai Thai, the Thailand equivalent of kickboxing. It is shown to be a particularly brutal and bloodthirsty style - just as the public like it in this film. 
 Being filmed on location in Thailand certainly benefits the proceedings, because it gives ""Kickboxer"" a bit of realism.
 JCVD is the avenging martial artist after his brother is crippled for life whilst defending his title. Van Damme is subjected to about the most gruelling training experience of his life and you have to see it to believe it.
 The villain of the piece looks a bit of a scary dude. His power behind those kicks is enough to make you wince. The violence is pretty full on as you would expect. However, there is room for some lighthearted moments and these don't intrude or interference with the story.
 Films like ""Kickboxer"" highlight JCVD as one of the best martial arts film stars of the 90s."
"DeuceWild_77","8","2","2","5 September 2017"," ""Never surrender, never say die, you got the heart of a Hero""
","As a 40-ish now, i was there (& aware) when Jean-Claude Van Damme became an action star with the mega-hit (& masterpiece of the genre) ""Bloodsport"", a movie that only saw the light of the day, because JCVD fought for it to be released. <br/><br/>""Kickboxer"" was his next project, now as established leading star and this time also as the co-writer & the director / choreographer of the intense (& realistic) fight sequences bringing with him the successful team behind ""Bloodsport"": Mark DiSalle & David Worth (here as co-directors) plus the executive producers Menahen Golan & Yoram Globus, the two heads of the, at the time prolific, Cannon Group. <br/><br/>The story is simple: after K.O'd every opponent in the American Kickboxer League, the confident, but pompous champion Eric Sloane (played by Dennis ""The Terminator"" Alexio, a real life heavyweight kickboxing champion) accepts a match in Thailand, but by the rules of Muay Thai, against their undefeated and ""national treasure"", Tong Po (played by Van Damme's real life buddy, Michel Qissi). Eric's entourage consists only of his supportive younger brother, Kurt (Jean-Claude Van Damme) as his personnel trainer. When the savage techniques in the ring of the bloodthirsty Po, causes his brother to became paralyzed, Kurt vows for revenge and with the help of a former American Marine (Haskell V. Anderson III) & a Muay Thai secluded Master, Xian Chow (Dennis Chan), they must prepare him for an underground fight that may cost Kurt's own life... <br/><br/>Re-watching ""Kickboxer"" nowadays it's like drinking from an old Scotch bottle, a fine & genuine product of its time, when action & martial arts movies had, in fact, heart & soul and the viewers enthusiastically cheered for their subdued heroes on the screen and booed the stereotyped (but always effective) villains. <br/><br/>""Kickboxer"" may not be the most original flick of its genre, it had the obvious influences that came from ""The Karate Kid"" to ""Rocky IV"" and JCVD's previous ""Bloodsport"", but for sure this movie delivers way high on the entertainment / excitement level. Even if the critics (as always) disliked it, Van Damme is good in the main role and proves again that besides his martial arts' skillful techniques, he surely can act and sweat charisma way better than most of the nowadays cardboard cutouts / wooden / soulless 'action stars'.<br/><br/>On the technical / artistically level, ""Kickboxer"" looks good for its tight budget: very competent photographed (some of the shots are even beautiful filmed); the choreography of the fights is raw & realistic; the soundtrack mainly performed by Stan Bush is motivational, catchy, cheesy and a pleasure to sing-a-long; Tong Po became an unforgettable baddie in the ""action movies' best villains"" universe & last, but not least, Van Damme's drunk dancing & fighting thugs at the same time, it's one of the most iconic scenes from the 80's action flicks.<br/><br/>""Kickboxer"" is a movie that is worthy of its own cult status and deserves to be forever revisited."
"tarbosh22000","6","2","2","10 June 2013"," Kickboxer is truly a video store classic!
","Eric Sloane (Alexio) is a champion kickboxer in the United States, so, seeking new triumphs in the ring, he travels to Thailand. With his brother/ringman Kurt by his side, he feels he cannot lose. That is, until he faces off against the most fearsome fighter in Thailand, if not the world: the dreaded Tong Po (""himself""...actually Qissi) Despite Kurt warning him to not get in the ring with him, Eric pridefully ignores his brother and fights Tong Po. The evil Po mercilessly beats Eric so badly he paralyzes him for life. Seeking revenge for his brother's crippling, Kurt sets out to learn Muay Thai and beat Tong Po in the ring. No school will accept him, so, working on a tip from ex-Special Forces Vietnam vet Winston (Anderson), Kurt goes to the Thai countryside to receive lessons from master Xian Chow (Chan). Chow puts him through his paces, but ends up falling in love with Mylee (Ashana) in the meantime. Gangster Freddy Li (Lee) has bet millions on the upcoming fight, AND Tong Po assaulted Mylee, AND he wants to get revenge, so with all the pressure building, will Kurt defeat Tong Po? Here's another Van Damme classic from the golden year of 1989. Most people, even if they're not action fans, are at least aware of Kickboxer. Even a David Letterman ""Top Ten List"" of the day featured the topic ""top ten things overheard while waiting in line for Kickboxer"". Underground fighting movies had hit the mainstream and had their brief moment in the spotlight. And Van Damme was spearheading the trend, thereby becoming one of the faces of the action movie movement of the late 80's/early 90's. While Kickboxer falls squarely in the middle in terms of the quality of his Punchfighting era (the best being Bloodsport, 1988 and the weakest being The Quest, 1996 - as always it's open for debate but that's our opinion), it has a ""much imitated, never equaled"" kind of feel to it and even though it's a little on the long side, it never really gets boring.<br/><br/>It may be a bit of a stretch to believe Alexio and Van Damme are brothers, but, that aside, in the movie, Eric disregards Kurt's advice to not fight Tong Po, thus reinforcing the old saying ""always listen to your Van Damme"". But the brothers in Bangkok do share a genetic sense for fashion, as stonewashed denim vests and half-shirts seem to be the order of the day. But Van Damme steals the show in the wardrobe department when he unleashes what can only be described as a tanktop with suspenders for straps. And for no explained reason, for the final face-off with Tong Po, they are BOTH wearing silly loincloths that leave criminally little to the imagination. How did they both know wear a freakin' loincloth to this particular battle? Presumably they didn't talk beforehand and arrange it - it's surprising they both weren't embarrassed, like two women who wear the same outfit to a party.<br/><br/>There are some excellent and picturesque Thai locations, there's a great song at every turn which smartly keeps the energy going (most of which are by AOR artist Stan Bush), and at one point one character says to Van Damme, ""I'm not signing your death warrant"". Seeing as the movie of that name came out the next year, could this line be an inspiration? Also in 1990 came a similarly-themed movie to Kickboxer, The King of the Kickboxers (1990), where Keith Cooke takes over the rural Thai trainer role. But one thing that movie does not have, nor any of the myriad ""training sequence"" movies that followed in its wake has, is one very important element: the ""Van Damme"" dance. Yes, part of Kurt's training is to go to a roadside cafe, get drunk, then bust a move with some local ladies. The movie pretty much stops - as it should - so we can see Van Damme get funky on the dance floor. Not since Breakin' (1984) where he claps along to the beat in his wrestling singlet have we seen his expertise with rhythm. Definitely a movie - nay - a career highlight for JCVD. He should have danced more in his movies.<br/><br/>One other note: like how in Best of the Best 2 (1990), the name ""Brakus"" is constantly and continuously said throughout the movie, here the name ""Tong Po"" is the constantly-said name. These writers were sure proud of their bad-guy names. While the popularity of this movie led to the inevitable flood of sequels (where Sasha Mitchell replaces Van Damme), this original is truly a ""video store classic"" and a worthy movie in its own right."
"hitchcockthelegend","8","2","2","30 July 2012"," Just listen. With your mind, your heart, your whole being.
","Jean-Claude Van Damme stars as Kurt Sloane, who after witnessing his brother getting crippled in a Muay Thai fight in Thailand, sets about learning the art himself so as to enact revenge on the sinister Tiger Tong Po who illegally put his brother in the wheel chair.<br/><br/>Ah look, I don't see any point in writing about the market that Van Damme movies sit in, I think everyone knows that there isn't going to be great acting in these movies, the plotting will be straight and simple and the resolution will be prescribed to get a whoop and yee-haw response. I would think that as much as some highbrow film fans roll their eyes and look down their noses at these type of action movies, they do at least acknowledge the fighting artistry and choreography on show. They, you hope, stay away and leave the ass kicking fans and nostalgists to wallow in their cheese and beaten body pulp kingdoms. I mean why would an arty film lover seek out an early Van Damme movie anyway?<br/><br/>I love Kickboxer, I really do, when I first caught it on release I could be found trying to do some of those wonderful Van Damme moves, rewatching the key moments over and over again, enjoying immensely the adrenalin rush that comes as we go slow-mo and Jean-Claude goes about dismantling uber bastard villain Tiger Tong Po (Michel Qissi). Now, well over twenty years later, I still get that rush, I can't do the moves, mind, I nearly put my shoulder out just punching the air in triumph as a mullet headed Dennis Alexio sticks his thumb up from his wheelchair, but all the thrills are still there, the skills on show still amazing. Hell, there's even a pet thread of substance, damn those animal threads, that cool dog better not get killed! Grrrrrrrr.<br/><br/>Of course now, viewing with older and wiser eyes, you can see the clunkiness of the script, the lame-brained plotting and excuses for Van Damme to flash the flesh and show his dexterity. There's even one of the worst dance sequences ever put down on film, so bad I can't believe I never laughed out loud at the cinema all those years ago. Yet it's still a wonderful movie, often exhilarating, the thematics of second chances (Haskell V. Anderson III having a great old time of it as Winston Taylor), revenge and different cultures, these impact greatly on the picture. Then there's Dennis Chan as Xian Chow, giving Pat Morita a run for his money as the most fun cinematic Martial Arts trainer, the real location photography in Thailand, the training sequences and of course we get to learn about the ancient sport of Muay Thai. There's a lot of good here to off set the saggy cheese.<br/><br/>There are some truly awful Van Damme movies out there, case in point Cyborg which was released the same year as Kickboxer, and without doubt the quality of Van Damme movies improved in the 90s as his stock began to rise and the budgets went higher. But this is a goody for his fans to lap up, a film to sit alongside Bloodsport as one of the two best action movies from his early body of work. And I love it so. 8/10"
"s-cordwell","7","2","2","12 July 2007"," Truly 80's Van Damme
","This film has all the hallmarks of a classic Van Damme martial arts/art-house movie. The opening credit sequence is pure genius, going along the river in a power boat, Van Damme wearing a sleveless denim jacket, his on screen brother wearing a floral shirt, sleeves rolled up, permed mullet and moustache flowing in the wind. I particularly enjoyed watching van damme put his arm around his brother as they sailed through the river, very homo-erotic. The cheesy 80's song to accompany this scene is like the cherry on the cake, with lyrics like ""I Don't Care What You Think, I Could Kill If You Blink"", we know we're in for a treat with this movie.<br/><br/>As usual with Van Damme films we are shown in the most subtle of manners how he developed his Belgian accent. We discover that Jean Claude was raised in Europe and learnt Ballet whilst his brother was raised in America by their father. I made the presumption the parents were divorced.<br/><br/>Watching Jean Claude learn Mui Thai with Master Zian was awe inspiring and gave a true insight into the 'old ways' of mastering this martial art. He did not need to visit a Mui Thai school or perhaps indulge in a few evening classes. No, it involved having his legs pulled apart with ropes, kicking down palm trees, coconuts dropped onto him from a great height, raw meat tied to his legs so dogs would chase him, being kept underwater whilst performing various kicks and finally training in the ruined temple where he could hear the noises made by the ancient warriors.<br/><br/>The best scene in the film is set in the waterfront bar, where Zian gets Van Damme drunk. Van Damme shows John Travolta a few moves, whilst wearing black patent boots, trousers pulled up to his waist and a tight vest top, he dances by doing the splits, wiggling his torso and randomly clapping his hands. The soundtrack is superb and the girls he is dancing with look totally lost, which is again, all part of the brilliance. The following fight scene is astounding, with Van Damme kicking 2 guys at once in mid air, kicking a short guy ramming him with a table, into the water and slapping someone with both hands on the side of the head. Bruce Lee, eat your heart out.<br/><br/>I particularly enjoyed the scene with Freddy Lee in his Miami Vice style mansion and pool, full of bikini clad women.<br/><br/>The clothes in this film are pure high fashion, sleveless denim jackets, high waist banded trousers with black vest and skimpy brightly coloured sports shorts.<br/><br/>The final battle is a classic, Van Damme manages to land 5 or even 6 hits per punch onto Tong Po after nearly being shredded to death by his opponents glass clothed hands. <br/><br/>Again, at the end, the credits roll with another fantastic soundtrack with lyrics like ""Never surrender, never say die, you've got the heart of a hero"".<br/><br/>This film borders on a comedy, and the more seriously it takes itself, the funnier it gets. Ignore the sequels, this is the one to watch."

Then, Kurt is seeking vengeance and he's only helped by an American ex-soldier(Haskell Anderson) and an expert trainer named Xian(Dennis Chan).

This is a colourful, Thailand set and quite budget movie; leave no clichÃ© untouched , though the fighting are well staged . Van Damme performance reveals to be more of the Chuck Norris, Stallone style than the Stanislawski school of acting. Karate expert Van Damme co-wrote the script along with the producer-director Mark DiSalle .The breathtaking fights are magnificently choreographed and directed by Van Damme. Exciting scenes , such as Van Damme training over temple of stone, sympathetic fights in the bar and spectacular combat against tiger champion Tong Po and the crowd shouting, 'great white warrior'. The motion picture is professionally directed by Michael Worth and Mark DiSalle who tried repeat success with Jeff Speakman but he didn't achieve. The result is a strong entry for action buffs, though strictly for Jean Claude Van Damme fans.

","Kick boxer was a good movie, but to me not the best. The story line was what I thought very good. The way Kurt (Jean Claude) trains in the movie is very inspirational. It reflects on the way ancient warriors trained. I thought this movie would have more fighting but there are only like 4-5 fight scenes. I've seen this movie about 5 times since I think it's good, but if you just like the fight scenes, you shouldn't buy it, but maybe rent it.<br/><br/>Plot: Eric (Kurts brother) thinks he's the best kick boxer in the world. Overall, the best fighter in the world. He brags non-stop about how good he is and he just wants to prove it. A reporter suggests he goes to Bangkok where kick boxing originated. There, his brother learns a lesson (Don't want to spoil anything) in which makes Kurt want to get revenge.<br/><br/>Overall: Very good movie, but not his best. If you like fight scenes I suggest you watch Van Damme in his movie Bloodsport. This movie didn't have as much fights, but was very inspiring the way they express Muay Thai (fighting style they use)."

","I normally agree with IMDB ratings, but this is an exception - it's definitely under-rated. Yes the story is a bit cheesy, but thats not the reason you watch something like this. Van Damme at least attempts to add a bit of depth and humility to his character rather than just playing the invincible Steven Segal type. It all moves along at a good pace as well, with several good fight scenes, the climatic fight is superb. The perfect Saturday night with mates films - you'll find it hard not to cheer Van Damme on.<br/><br/>One thing I will say against it however is the soundtrack is absolutely awful.

"aram81","6","1","1","5 June 2020"," You know exactly what you are getting with Kickboxer
","Kickboxer is your typical hand-to-hand combat revenge story; Jean-Claude Van Damme's Rocky IV. The opening act gives us the tragedy, and the menacing and indestructible villain (Tong Po) that our hero must conquer. The middle section is dominated by one training scene after another and finally the film concludes with the big fight to settle the score. It should not come as a surprise to anymore that the acting is really bad across the board. Van Damme, who at the time was still very much wet behind the years and would improve marginally during his career, does not emote any real emotion or any semblance of believability in his performance. Throw in some 80's music, cheesy dialogue, a couple of funny moments and some nice shots of Thailand and you got yourself Kickboxer, a take it or leave it proposition. If you do not mind all of the cheesiness, highly predictable plot and bad acting, then you will most likely enjoy the film. For everyone else, stay away, because this is most likely going to bore or annoy you."
"jonsefcik","5","1","1","16 May 2020"," Extremely cliched, full of stereotypes, but enjoyable
","I like how the movie's called Kickboxer, but it's about Muay Thai, and Van Damne resorts to karate and taekwondo techniques in the ring. That leads me to a big problem with this movie: Van Damme's character doesn't really have arc. He starts off as an accomplished karate practitioner (like Van Damme himself) and doesn't seem like he needs any more training to beat Tong Po. The movie tries to make it seem like he's not flexible and has to work his way up to a complete split, but earlier in the movie he practiced his form in various types of kicks, and at one point not only throws a side kick above his head, but chambers it up and down in a slow and controlled manner. As someone who's trained in various martial arts for years, I know from experience that throwing a side kick that high requires a lot of flexibility and control, and Van Damme's technique is impeccable from the start.<br/><br/>But this is Muay Thai, not karate. For the sake of the story, Van Damme should have to learn clinching, elbows, and roundhouse kicks to the thighs to beat Tong Po. Instead, we have two scenes of Van Damme in the ring, a warm up round where he annihilates the dude, and the final match between him and Tong Po. Both times he wins with hook kicks, side kicks, traditional punches, and other karate/tkd techniques.<br/><br/>Beyond that, an even bigger problem with the film is how shallow the writing is. Tong Po is written to be literally the most unlikable bad guy ever; he's unfair in the ring, collects protection from the townspeople, and rapes our generic love interest. I keep calling Van Damme Van Damme because, while he's an impressive martial artist, the dude can't act his way out of a wet paper bag and lacks the screen presence of someone like Bruce Lee, Chuck Norris, or Michael Jai White. At least he's better than Steven Segal. The only memorable character is our Mr. Miyagi stand in Xian Chow, who's genuinely charming and likable. I'd say Kickboxer has more competent story structure and technical aspects than his previous vehicle Bloodsport. Bloodsport at least knew it's story wasn't it's strong point, and made a good third of the runtime tournament matches. It still has issues like a thin plot and lots of bad dubbing, but it's more enjoyable to sit though than Kickboxer. Whichever you think is better will ultimately come down to personal preference."

","Great Movie. Best fight scenes. JCVD at his best..!"
"BandSAboutMovies","7","1","1","7 July 2019"," Van Damme starts off strong!!!
","Every time I do an in-depth film week, there comes a moment when I go from ""most of these movies aren't very good"" and ""they just have the same tropes over and over again"" to ""I love this movie!"" It's digital Stockholm Syndrome and it happens almost every time. It happened at some point during Chained Heat during my Linda Blair week. And now, at some point during Kickboxer, I fell in absolute head over heels love with Jean-Claude Van Damme movies.<br/><br/>This reminds me of a moment in my childhood. It was probably 1979 and local TV independent station WPTT-22 was advertising the heck out of kickboxing, proclaiming it as the most violent new sport around. I became nearly manic with intensity, needing to see this kickboxing for myself and Saturday night at 10 PM, when it would air, felt like months, not days, away. Every single TV and radio commerical stoked the flames of my nine-year-old demand to see these fights. The reality? Just white dudes kicking one another slowly in matches that were no more intense than an average boxing battle. The fight that was inside my head? Well, that would be this movie.<br/><br/>This is but the first of seven Kickboxer films, but it's a doozy. The good guys are as good as it gets, while the bad guys are the absolute worst people to ever walk the face of the Earth.<br/><br/>Kurt Sloane (Van Damme) is the younger brother of Eric Sloane, the United States kickboxing world champion. Eric is played by Dennis Alexio, who only appeared in two other acting jobs: the TV series Super Force and as Toshi Lum in Picasso Trigger.<br/><br/>His life story should be a movie, as he started his professional kickboxing career by winning seventeen consecutive fights with only a single fight lasting more than one round. He then battled Don ""The Dragon"" Wilson to a loss for the WKA World Super Light Heavyweight title on NBC before continuing to move up in weight divisions and even boxing professionally for a year.<br/><br/>After slowing down his career - if you can call it that, he won eight different titles - by fighting lower level K-1 fighters and gaining a rep for avoiding top level fighters, Alexio retired after winning the WAKO Pro World Heavyweight Full Contact Championship. But his crazy life wasn't over yet.<br/><br/>In 2003, he was first convicted of bank fraud. Charges like that would come back to haunt him, including failing to pay past child support. A decade later, Alexio and his wife were charged with thirty-six counts, such as filing false tax claims, wire fraud and money laundering, as well as charges of sending false documents with the goal of obtaining gold bars and coins worth hundreds of thousands of US dollars. He was finally convicted of twenty-eight of those counts and now resides at FCI Safford, a low-security federal prison in Arizona.<br/><br/>Let's get back to Kickboxer.<br/><br/>After yet another successful title win, Eric decides to go to Thailand and build on his legend. After all, that's where the sport was born. Eric doesn't even train, thinking that he can defeat anyone. But his brother discovers that his opponent, Tong Po (Van Damme's childhood friend Michel Qissi, who is absolutely the greatest villain of all time) is a maniac. The dude kicks concrete pillars with his bare legs and has a stare that confirms that he is a murderer.<br/><br/>Kurt begs his brother not to fight, but Eric laughs it off. Po murks him round after round, beating him into the ground with ease as the crowd basically laughs at the two gaijin infiltrating their world. Even after Kurt throws in the towel, Tong Po kicks it out of the ring and elbows Eric in the back, turning him into a quadriplegic before tearing his title belt to shreds. And get this - there are two more matches to go. This wasn't even the main event!<br/><br/>Kurt is now stuck as a stranger in a strange land, with a brother near death, unable to speak the language. Winston Taylor, a retired US Army special forces member, helps them get to the hospital where they learn that Eric will never walk, much less kickbox, again.<br/><br/>Kurt vows to get revenge and is introduced to Xian Chow, a trainer of Muay Thai. Basically, this training involves him torturing our hero, so if you'd like to see a muscular young boy from Brussels get trussed up by an older Asian daddy that wants to teach him the ropes, you can watch this and still feel pretty manly about it. I kid - although that sequence at the beginning where the shirtless brothers cavort about Thailand seems a little romantic.<br/><br/>Somehow during all this Kurt falls from Xian's niece Mylee and helps her battle the crime lord Freddy Li. Xian then convinces Freddy to book a match between Tong Po and Kurt in the ancient tradition. That tradition? Hemp ropes all over the fists, coated in resin and dipped in broken glass while the ring has metal chains instead of ropes and fire is everywhere. This is the exact moment I lost my mind and began screaming at the screen as if this were a real fight that I was watching live and no longer a multipack DVD that I bought for $4.<br/><br/>Freddy Li arranges to have the fight fixed and gets $1 million from syndicate bosses to bet on the outcome. To stack the odds, Eric is kidnapped so that Kurt will do the job. Think that's bad? Tong Po also assaults Mylee. Remember how I said these guys were the worst humans in almost any movie not starring David Hess?<br/><br/>Xian tells Kurt to go the distance in the fight before losing, which gives him and Taylor time to save Eric, who appears just in time to chant ""Nuk Soo Kow,"" or white warrior, along with the fickle crowd who turns on Tong Po. Kurt goes buck wild and easily bests the maniac who started the match out by eating broken glass and bloodying up his own tongue.<br/><br/>While Tong Po is listed as playing himself, please know that that is really Michael Qissi. This isn't a Zeus/Tiny Lister deal. His voice, however, was dubbed by Jim Cummings, who is also the voice of Winnie the Pooh and Darkwing Duck. However, don't celebrate just yet, as the actor was accused earlier this year of animal abuse, drug addiction and physical, mental and sexual abuse by his ex-wife. After knowing that, it adds some real cringe to the line that Tong Po yells during the fight: ""You bleed like Mylee! Mylee...good CENSORED!"""
"danielsiouffi","9","1","1","25 May 2018"," A legend amongst Van Damme's earliest movies
","A legend amongst Van Damme's earliest movies. Michel Qissi here plays the very first version of Tong Po, a feared and overwhelming enemy fighter. A character that could give you the chills. A movie that is mostly concentrated on fighting action but specially on a man's personal need to become stronger and tougher. A movie that shows the importance of improving oneself, showing the need to practice, to learn, to work and to expand.
These qualities in a movie are today sorely lacking in new cinema. We find less and less stories explaining these importances.
Would welcome back this Genre.
Thank you JCVD and Glenn Bruce for giving us this legendary story."
"goreilly40","7","1","1","8 July 2017"," A rare type of movie....
","Quite a lot of martial arts movies I've watched in the past have all committed the same offence, no plot, or a plot that could only be described as absurd and unrealistic. Kickboxer however is different, its story-line is plausible and makes sense, yes it maybe a little textbook but it makes for a good story. JCVD as Kurt Sloane, the little brother out for revenge plays the part really well, and you can see his character and training develop as the movie goes on. The antagonist, Tong Po is also done really well by Michel Qissi, who instead of being just an opponent for the main character, displays some genuine villainous traits so you have a real reason for not liking him. As a follower of Muay Thai, I found the fighting scenes to be somewhat unrealistic and OTT, like the Rocky movies, likewise the severity of the injuries the characters seemed to recover amazingly quickly from, also the movies depiction of Thailand itself wasn't something I agreed with but its a movie, not a travel documentary. All in all I'd say this movie is worth owning and worth a watch if you like both martial arts and coming of age movies."
"Leofwine_draca","8","1","1","10 August 2016"," Standard revenge film with a fantastically violent climax
","This simplistic yet effective exercise in action from Jean Claude Van Damme offers up pretty much everything you could want from such a film; there's drama, tension, romance, some really sleazy bad guys, a cruel, frightening villain and, of course, oodles of macho violence to enjoy. It plays a bit like BLOODSPORT, but with added plot which gives the film a better structure. Less fight scenes and more character development make this the better film.<br/><br/>Okay, so it has dated badly. Being a late '80s film, it's full of cheesy pop songs which pop up at every opportunity, as well as the expected leotards and track suits. Van Damme is probably the best actor in the film, giving you some idea as to the depth of the acting talent on display here. The older actors are more likable and the chief villain, Tong Po, looks extremely menacing, but everybody else is forgettable. Van Damme struggles with a thick accent but is on top form in terms of physical fitness.<br/><br/>Up until the last twenty minutes, this is pretty bland stuff. Some amusing training scenes showing Van Damme being exerted to the limit and a couple of fight scenes break up the momentum but it's standard all the way. Then the final battle commences and the film becomes superb. Just after you hear the line ""...hands soaked in hemp and resin and dipped in broken glass"" do you realise that this is going to be something good, and it doesn't disappoint. Exciting, adrenaline-pumping, and very extreme, it's a shame the rest of the film doesn't live up to this climactic showdown. Tong Po really does get his just desserts here as he faces a brutal pummelling from Van Damme before getting his skull cracked against a stone pillar.<br/><br/>Apart from the final fight, this is average Van Damme, with little in the way of budget or story to help out. In itself, the climax would rate a 5/5, but unfortunately the rest of the film drags the score down. Definitely worth seeing for fans of the genre though."
"sam_smithreview","8","1","1","28 May 2016"," What Action films use to be like
","Where, now we only focus on CGI and fast paced ""Real"" style fighting, this was the movie that put Jean Claude Van Damme on the map.<br/><br/>This is a splendid movie. It's van Damme exactly as I want to see him, with great martial arts action, a decent plot (even if it's not original at all), cool characters and a great 80's soundtrack. The movie is somewhat different from Bloodsport. Of course there are similarities too, like an evil fighting champion that van Damme is fighting. But this movie hasn't nearly as many fights as Bloodsport. Instead, it's more focus on training here. The training scenes are visually very good, and with really cool background music. Even though I had expected more fighting instead of this, there's no doubt that this is a great movie in it's own way."
"Fella_shibby","9","1","1","9 May 2016"," Loved the training part of this gr8 martial art flick.
","Kickboxer is one of Van Dammes best films (not as good as Bloodsport though). Muay Thai fight sequences are choreographed very well. It is a predictable film n full of clichés. Now comes the training part man, JCVD having his legs pulled apart with ropes (ouch the groin man), kicking down palm trees (the shin bone hurts man), coconuts dropped onto him from a great height, raw meat tied to his legs so dogs would chase him (Usayn bolt can learn something man), being kept underwater whilst performing various kicks (Mickey Mehta stole ideas from JCVD) and finally training in the ruined temple where he could hear the noises made by the ancient warriors (is it a fantasy flick man). Nevertheless I enjoyed this the first time I saw on a rented VHS during the early nineties. I still own a DVD of it. Fans of the genre shud definitely own a DVD or blu ray of it. Directed by Mark DiSalle n David Worth (The perfect weapon n Lady dragon respectively)."
"classicsoncall","7","1","1","12 April 2016"," ""Revenge is a dangerous motive.""
","This is the kind of movie if I were watching and evaluating about twenty years ago I would have thought it a lot better. Today it seems seriously dated and let's face it, downright hokey at times, like with that very embarrassing dance sequence Van Damme does at the Thai saloon. I wonder what he'd have to say about that today.<br/><br/>The main problem that I think most martial arts movie fans will acknowledge is that the story is formulaically clichéd. The revenge motive is ever present in these types of films, and the outcome is always the same - the hero wins, the villain loses. Sometimes the path to getting there is made interesting with a grueling training regimen and humorous elements introduced by a stoic trainer who's comic timing leads to some funny moments. You have some of that here, but it's counterbalanced by Kurt Sloane (Van Damme) whacking his leg against a palm tree full force (impossible) into a bloody pulp, and training immediately after with no visible bruising.<br/><br/>And after all that, I don't believe Kurt used any Muay Thai in his match against Tong Po (Michel Quissi). I could be wrong on that score, but not invested enough to re-watch the fight. Going back those couple of decades, I can't remember if this was the first Van Damme flick I ever saw or ""Bloodsport"". If I had to guess it would have been the earlier picture, but I don't know if I'm so keen on checking it out again and dimming another memory."

The subplot of the Thai gang headed by the sinister Freddy Li (Ka Ting Lee) blends in well with the main plot and delivers some added intrigue and tension to the story.<br/><br/>The acting is not really top-notch, as I thought emotions were forced at times and some of the dialog was a little cheesy, but it's still a good flick that action movie fans should enjoy.<br/><br/>Grade B"

","Kickboxer is simply a cult classic! it is one of Van Damme's most popular films. Just really shocked that this film is now a quarter of a century old.

Van Damme was the real deal throughout the nineties, performing in so many successful martial arts and action movies.<br/><br/>If you're a Van Damme fan, I'm sure Kickboxer is up there among your favourites.

"DamianThorn","8","1","1","1 July 2014"," I'm not going to sugar coat this review...but make no mistake about it this is a fantastic movie.
","Sure, the movie can be cheesy at times, the dialogue a bit silly and the acting about as far from Oscar worthy as you can get, but then again, does Oscar worthy mean anything anymore? At any rate Kickboxer is a fantastically fun film to watch. It attempts to (and does successfully) explore the story of a man seeking Vengeance, learning to better himself and discovering ancient methods of training to fight that much of the world had forgotten ever existed.<br/><br/>Jean-Claude Van Damme is in his prime here. Strong, powerful and about as masculine as a human male can get. In real life, Van Damme's combination of training methods brought something to film screens around the world that had never been seen before. A classically trained black belt in Karate, combined with a Kickboxing career and formal training in ballet. Yes, ballet. It sound like such an odd combination and yet it translates beautifully into a man who would become a world famous action star. Capable of amazing feats involving balance, flexibility and fighting combined with a muscular, ripped physique and dare I say a perfect set of facial features that make him insanely attractive. It's just astonishing and the only other actor I could even consider comparing him to would be Arnold Schwarzenegger. Although I think Schwarzenegger has better acting skills, he and Van Damme share that amazing unique set of god given talents both physical and mental that set them apart from almost every other action star that's ever lived. Now that I'm done drooling over Van Damme, back to the movie review.<br/><br/>It truly is a fantastic, male oriented action film the likes of which Hollywood rarely turns out anymore. The film starts off with a light hearted happy feeling as Kurt (Van Damme) accompanies his older brother Eric to a fight where Eric, already a champion Kickboxer defeats yet another opponent and then announces his next fight will be in Thailand. Eric, on a high from all of his wins fails to realize that Thailand's champion is a ruthless fighter named Tong Po who's backed by the Asian mafia.<br/><br/>When Eric finally faces off against Tong Po, Po not only defeats Eric but permanently and intentionally paralyzes him so that he will never fight again. In this instant, the light hearted feeling of the film is gone. Kurt and Eric are two Americans alone in a foreign land with no friends and no idea where to turn next. But Kurt knows one thing for certain, he wants revenge against Tong Po and he's willing to get it at any cost. <br/><br/>After a lucky meeting with a fellow American (a former war vet who chose to remain living in Thailand rather than return to America) Kurt's hopes of seeking out his revenge are brought to life. At first reluctant, Kurt's new friend eventually introduces him to Zion. A master Martial Artist who has long since retired from training, but he hears Kurt's story, he sees Kurt's passion and sees something Different in Kurt. After a little coaxing and a few rather amusing tests, Zion agrees to train Kurt to take down Tong Po once and for all. At this point the movie takes on a whole new feel again, an often surreal and very serious tone reflecting mans connection with nature, with the past and with the ancient warriors who came before them.<br/><br/>I won't go any further in my review, not because it will spoil the ending but because it would spoil everything else in between that leads up to a fantastic Rocky Style finale. It's all those parts in the middle though, all those moments all those genius bits of story that make this movie so worth watching. Oh the ending is good and well worth it but I assure you, watching Kurt train, watching him learn, face his fears and even fall in love. It's all of that, that's what really makes this movie.<br/><br/>As a final note which I always live to add to my reviews, watching this film is like watching a Bruce Lee movie or a Chuck Norris film. It's so easy to understand why an entire generation fell in love with martial arts and new generations continue to do so to this day."

Over time his tough training regimes leads to improvements but Po's backers are not going to take things lying down.<br/><br/>The better budget is there on screen, there is a lot of sly humour in the training scenes which reflect a lot of The Karate Kid movies and as the film progresses the Muscles from Brussels shows his trademark moves.<br/><br/>The film takes time to get going after the initial kick-boxing fight, there is an obligatory love plot and although not as thrilling as some of Van Damme's films of the early part of the 1990's this is a good showcase of his talents."

"breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com","7","1","1","12 June 2013"," Another one of Van Damme's most appreciated
","After Bloodsport (1988) was released, Jean-Claude Van Damme's career began to gain traction as a sport/action star. Even if his acting to many wasn't all that convincing, his physicality and choreographed fight scenes seemed to have a magnetic attraction to audiences. In between this movie and Bloodsport (1988) were two other movies but seemed to have not gone over well with viewers. It is not until this movie that Van Damme returns to what looks as some of his better performances at the beginning of his career.<br/><br/>Like many of his other films to come after or came before, Van Damme plays a character with some kind of a martial arts background. Why - because that's the thing Van Damme had going for him at the time. If you were going to see a Van Damme movie, it was for that reason; his martial arts skills. So in here, it is obvious that he's going to play a kickboxer because that's the title of the film. It's a dead give away. The story is about a trainer (Kurt Sloane), who takes it upon himself to fight for his brother who is permanently injured after challenging an opponent who plays dirty.<br/><br/>Playing the injured brother, Eric Sloane, is Dennis Alexio, a real life kickboxer. To be honest, I didn't find his on screen chemistry with Van Damme to be very convincing. It is explained to why they don't sound like brothers but it still sounds far-fetched. Making them close stepbrothers I think would have made things much easier and more believable. But as for characters, that's really the only weak link I found for that particular area. For Kurt, he must learn how to fight like the opponent who hurt is brother. The only way he'll be able to do that, is by being trained like the opponent.<br/><br/>The person to do that is Xian Chow (Dennis Chan), an old hermit who looks old but still packs quite a punch. To be brought to Chow, Kurt befriends a man named Winston Taylor (Haskell V. Anderson III), an ex- marine from the Vietnam War, now living in what he calls paradise. Anderson's character is partially the reason why this movie deserves to be seen. The early Van Damme films seem to contain the most comical characters. Also let's not forget the obligatory love interest that falls for Kurt Sloane, which doesn't bother me in the least. I understand that these kind of films need one because what would they be without? The love interest is Chow's niece, Mylee, played by Rochelle Ashana.<br/><br/>Let's also not forget the opponent who plays dirty. Tong Po (Michel Qissi) does a good job at making his character look like a jerk. Not only does he get away with several actions that are considered over the top brutal or disgraceful, he also has connections to crime bosses. Hmmm, doesn't sound very good. However this does dilute the character. If you look at Chong Li from Bloodsport (1988), he too was a mean and dirty fighter, but he had no connections. He was just in it for himself. With Tong Po, it's just another cliché - that every antagonist is connected with some crime lord.<br/><br/>There's only one other thing I found to be unnecessary. At one point, Chow gets Kurt drunk and asks him to start dancing. Yeah,...I know there's a point to it in the end of that scene but it really isn't needed. I didn't choose this movie to see Jean-Claude Van Damme dance. No thanks. However, the fight scenes were cool and it was good to see composer Paul Hertzog return to make the score for the film, even if it wasn't as present like his score from Bloodsport (1988). Other than that I was relatively pleased with the outcome of the film.<br/><br/>It is a little more cliché ridden than needed but it still works as a Van Damme sport film. The fight scenes as well as the characters are worth a watch."

","Another classic from Van Damme, and as the video sleeve told us...'revenge is a dangerous motive', beating Kill Bill by 14 years.<br/><br/>It's a simple story, Van Damme is the weak one of two brothers, the other being stronger because he has a cool moustache and will never be in a film again. Lo and behold 'Tiger' Tong-po realises this and decides to break his back.<br/><br/>Van Damme searches everywhere to get trained up, but no one wants to see him do the splits, apart from an old man who lives alone with his dog. the rest is predictable drivel, but it's the eighties, and we love a good fight.<br/><br/>Another Popular van Damme film, this features more training this time, think a mature Karate Kid movie a your almost there. there are also sub-plots with the triads, and love interests, but again there is a delicious villain in the form of Tong Po, who you would love to smack for no reason at all.<br/><br/>The film builds up to the climax, and what a fight we have at the end. Granted, the editing is poor and Makes Van Damme look like he is doing more than he actually is, but the final five minutes are so uplifting, you will find yourself rewinding over and over again.<br/><br/>a perfect Van Damme movie, and getting nearer to the big time.<br/><br/>a must for all Van Damme fans."

Xian, utilizing Kurt's determination and dedication, molds and develops him into a superior martial artist, but can he withstand the attack of Tong Po? Tong Po's agent, Freddy Li(Ka Ting Lee), uses treacherous antics(..like kidnapping Eric, having Xian's trusty canine stabbed by a dagger, and the rape of Kurt's girlfriend, Mylee(Rochelle Ashana)at the hands of Tong Po)in an attempt to thwart Kurt's chances of defeating his foe due to a lack of focus and concentration, factors needed to properly fight. Freddy Li has made a big bet on Tong Po and informs Kurt that if he is to see his brother alive again he'll throw the bout, but do so while being pummeled by Tong Po. Through the collective efforts of his friends, including Xian and a retired Vietnam vet, Winston(Haskell V Anderson III), perhaps Kurt will be able to fulfill his desire for revenge, while successfully proving that he can be a fighter of superior skill.<br/><br/>I feel like many fans of movies regarding kick-boxing will find this a tad disappointing for ""Kickboxer"" features precious few fight sequences of real worth. We see Kong Po annihilate Eric in a bout(..before this, Eric himself defeats an American opponent with relative ease, and being a renowned fighter in the USA has grown his ego to epic proportions)establishing the meat of the film's revenge story, but the bulk of ""Kickboxer"" has Kurt training with Xian in preparation for Tong Po. <br/><br/>We see Kurt and Mylee's blossoming love, along with Freddy Li's shenanigans. The training regimen(..including their work in the fantastic Stone City, an ancient Buddhist temple ruins and around Xian's modest home where he uses natural objects as tools to train Kurt)envelopes a good 50 minutes of the movie. We do see a humorous scene where Xian wishes to challenge Kurt by taking him to a bar, getting him liquored up, and having Freddy Li's young fighters engage him in combat..to the chagrin of Li, Kurt obliterates them in short order, afterward showing that he can barely walk upright! <br/><br/>As is often the case with these movies featuring Van Damme(or part of this burgeoning genre of this time when martial arts was starting to take off with western audiences), Tong Po is a muscled and mean force to be reckoned with, an intimidating enemy the hero must overcome through the use of his evolved techniques and physical development. <br/><br/>Oftenin these flicks, we see how Xian, the trainer, is able to fashion Kurt mind, body, and soul into a superior fighter. The finale, I think, is sufficiently thrilling as Kurt, at first, must allow Tong Po an advantage, while also remaining distracted due to his brother's whereabouts and discovering Mylee was raped by his opponent. And, just as usual(..we wouldn't expect anything otherwise, would we?)Van Damme gains the upper hand when those encumbrances are lifted and he can take control. <br/><br/>""Kickboxer"" is a chance to see Van Damme in full form, landing every type of kick and punch in his arsenal..in slow motion or repeated two or three times to relive the blows as they deplete Tong Po until he's a broken, beaten, and bloody mass, without fight left in him. The martial arts Kurt is learning from Xian is Muay-Thai. I don't think Van Damme has ever looked better than he does here. As normal, JCVD performs the splits numerous times(..this time, there's a scene where his legs are pulled apart by Xian by ropes with sound effects featuring bone cracking)."

","The first time I saw this film I was in pig tails and still had all my baby teeth. Later this film made me fall head over heals for Van Damme! Its a story about two American brothers who travel to Thailand. The eldest becomes paralyzed in a kickboxing fight which provokes his younger brother (Van Damme) to learn kickboxing from an elder skilled in the art. Later, the highly trained younger brother sets out to avenge his brother in a match that could end up costing him his life. The only thing I found unappealing in the film was the music. However, the film also has some comedy points such as when his master attached a pork chop to his thigh and sends his German Shepard running after Van Damme."
"tenthousandtattoos","6","1","1","20 August 2007"," Inspiration in the strangest of places...
","While not a great film, this is an awesome example of an American action/martial arts movie.<br/><br/>Fight choreography is fantastic, I mean, let's face it, Jean Claude didn't get acting gigs because he is a decent actor, he got em because he's a great martial-artist. And it shows. So he was a never a prize fighter, so what? True martial arts is not about fighting, it's a mental/physical discipline, akin to religion in that to truly understand it you must devote yourself to it entirely.<br/><br/>The revenge story is run of the mill but cool - Kurt's bro gets paralysed in the ring by the nasty Thai champion (and quite intimidating character) Tong Po, so Kurt, an inexperienced martial artist, seeks training from an old master so he can return and defeat Tong Po in an honorable, though brutal, underground kickboxing contest in Thailand.<br/><br/>The real gem of this film is the second act, where Kurt trains in the jungle with the master Xian Chow. It shows some pretty full-on and very interesting scenes of harsh training, both mental and physical, and the forest setting is great. This part actually inspired me to pursue more intensely the martial art I was studying at the time, Arnis (bamboo stick fighting - originated in the Phillippines). Never did I think I would be inspired to better myself by a dumb action movie. Inspiration can come from the strangest of places.<br/><br/>The romantic subplot is aided by a nice performance from Rochelle Ashana as Mylee, she is very pretty and a decent actress. Xian Chow (Dennis Chan) is also very good as the wise master.<br/><br/>Can't help but mention the dance scene...it really is best experienced rather than described...<br/><br/>The final fight is one of the best pre-CGI fight scenes ever put on film. At first it appears like a Rocky-style ""champ gets pounded by bad buy for 9 rounds then makes a startling comeback at the end"" but it is far more, and that makes it so memorable. If you haven't seen it just watch it don't read on. If you have...how cool is it? Kurt knows he can k*ck Tong Po from the second he walks in the ring. Kurt has trained like the warriors of old, while Tong Po is really nothing more than a very strong street fighter. The agony is palpable as Kurt knows he has to throw the fight...but as soon as he knows his bro is safe, his girl is safe...the gloves come off...the fear shows in Tong Po...and from that first kick to the head it's all over in great Van Damme style for the Thailand's ""Tiger""!

Worse, though, is how boring it was. Mercifully, some of the jokes worked and actually had me laughing and I did enjoy one scene: a drunken Van Damme fighting in a bar.

","Kickboxer starts as Eric 'The Eliminator' Sloane (Dennis Alexio) is crowned the World kick-boxing champion, he decides he needs a new challenge & sets of for Thailand where kick-boxing is very popular. Eric & his brother Kurt (Jean-Claude Van Damme) head for Bangkok where he intends to prove himself to be the best by fighting hard as nails 'Tiger' Tong Po (Michel Qissi), Eric gets his wish but soon realises they play dirty in Thailand & Tong beats the crap out of him & just to rub salt into the wound breaks Eric's back which leaves him permanently paralysed & wheelchair bound. Eric's brother Kurt isn't happy about the situation & convinces an old Muay expert Xian Chow (Dennis Chan) to teach him the art of kick-boxing so he can gain revenge on Tong for his brother...<br/><br/>Kickboxer is one of those rare films which is credited has having three director's, producer Mark DiSalle (who also is listed in the credits as playing a 'U.S. Reporter') & David Worth with a very young looking JCVD credited as 'fight scenes director' as well, I personally have never seen a film where three separate director's are credited during the opening credits, never. It's then perhaps a surprise that Kickboxer turned out as coherent as it did, I'm not saying it's a great film because it's far from a great film & it isn't even particularly good by JCVD standards but it ain't too bad & passes the time harmlessly enough. The by-the-numbers script by Glen Bruce is just so clichéd & predictable, a man sets out to avenge a family member/friend who has had some sort of injustice inflicted upon them & in that respect Kickboxer is nothing new. Also it's far too predictable, I mean is there really anyone out there who doesn't think that JCVD will defeat Tong Po & avenge his brother? I didn't think so. So what Kickboxer is all about are the fight scenes of which there are not enough, JCVD only fights on four occasions although I admit they are pretty good sequences. The rest of the time is mostly spent watching him get trained by some crazy old Chinese dude in scenes that reminded me of similar ones in The Karate Kid (1984)! It moves along at a reasonable pace & it passes the time but the character's are thin, it's predictable & it's nothing new.<br/><br/>Director's DiSalle & Worth do OK with the talky bits while I have to admit JCVD does really well with the fight scenes, the choreography is actually rather impressive with brutal looking fights & kick-boxing scenes. The punches & kicks seem to have impact thanks to them being well staged & clever camera placement & I suppose JCVD's knowledge of martial arts & film-making comes in handy in this respect. Some of the Thai scenery looks quite nice & the early montage of Thai prostitutes & sex shops sets the tone for this lads flick. The violence isn't too strong, it's not overly sadistic or graphic. I was disappointed they didn't make use of the ropes wrapped around their hands with shards of broken glass stuck to them in a scene that is openly parodied in Hot Shots! Part Deux (1993), I mean one punch from those & it would have ripped your opponents skin to shreds.<br/><br/>With a modest sounding budget of about $1,500,000 Kickboxer looks alright, the locations look nice enough I suppose & it's competently made. Apparently JCVD got paid $70,000 for this, it certainly wasn't for his acting ability though.<br/><br/>Kickboxer is an OK time waster if you like martial arts type films or are a huge JCVD fan, if any still exist. I didn't think it was one of his best but nowhere near his worst, it's just very average predictable middle of the road stuff. Successful enough to spawn four sequels none of which featured JCVD, Kickboxer 2: The Road Back (1991), Kickboxer 3: The Art of War (1992), Kickboxer 4: The Aggressor (1994) & Kickboxer 5 (1995) although they seem to have stopped making them now."

","There's no reinventing the wheel with this straightforward martial arts / vengeance themed potboiler, one of Jean-Claude Van Damme's earlier starring vehicles. The Muscles from Brussels plays Kurt Sloane, the younger brother of a champion fighter named Eric (Dennis Alexio). We can see right away that Eric's success and resulting overconfidence will be his downfall, and so it goes when Eric is permanently crippled by reigning Thai kick boxer Tong Po (Michel Qissi), a truly scary and creepy m.f. Of course, Kurt swears revenge, and learns that the one person who MIGHT train him is reclusive Xian Chow (Dennis Chan).<br/><br/>There isn't anything inherently wrong with sticking to a formula, and writer Glenn A. Bruce and co-directors Mark DiSalle and David Worth throw absolutely no surprises into the mix. As with many movies of this ilk, there is some charm to be found in the performance of the person playing the trainer, and Chan is both amusing and likeable. So is upbeat, engaging Haskell V. Anderson III, playing an expatriate American in Thailand who lends a helping hand - sometimes reluctantly. Rochelle Ashana is gorgeous as the requisite love interest / eye candy. And Jean-Claude is as affable as he's ever been. Qissi is a purely formidable villain who the writers and directors make sure is always proving just what a bad guy he is.<br/><br/>Thankfully played with some humour, as well as an enjoyable (if moderate) amount of gore and violence, ""Kickboxer"" is pretty good fun, if not all that memorable. It does push buttons in an effective manner, putting characters in peril as well as including a canine companion for Xian. One funny moment has Xian give Kurt some raw meat to carry while running so the dog will chase Kurt and make him move faster. The fight scenes are staged by Jean-Claude himself and are suitably rousing. But the best part of all has to be when Xian prods Kurt to get on a dance floor so he can check out his sense of balance. Jean-Claude's dance moves are most amusing.<br/><br/>Overall, solid entertainment for fans of the genre and the star.<br/><br/>Seven out of 10."

","This movie had a great story to it; however, the fighting sequences were not the greatest. In a way the fighting sequences were incredibly plain. In one of the matches, the two fighters were literally taking turns kicking each other one at a time. There was also a lack of any defensive skills. Almost every hit connected. It just did not make sense.<br/><br/>Despite the fighting sequences lacking exceptional choreography, the story was well put together. Kurt Sloane, played by Jean-Claude Van Damme, was determined to train in martial arts in order to defeat Tong Po, played by Michel Qissi.

So Sloane set out to train and learn the art of kickboxing in order to seek vengeance for his brother."
"The Grand Master","7","0","0","21 November 2015"," Kickboxer is vintage Van Damme doing what he does best.
","Kickboxer may be seen now as a dumb action movie but there's no denying that Kickboxer is still popular amongst many of Van Damme's fans as well as those that grew up in an era where audiences liked their heroes musclebound and the action violent and bloody. I last saw Kickboxer when I was 11 years old and I hadn't seen the movie in 20 years. Thankfully, the movie was still enjoyable and like a vintage wine you can still enjoy it with age. Kickboxer also showcased Van Damme's spectacular martial arts prowess and he does it with style.<br/><br/>Kurt Sloane (Jean-Claude Van Damme) acts as cornerman and trainer for his older brother Eric (Dennis Alexio), an US kickboxing champion. Kurt and Eric travel to Bangkok, Thailand to challenge Tong Po (Michel Qissi), Thailand's undefeated powerhouse champion who ruthlessly pummels his opponents in the ring. Ignoring all of Kurt's warnings to pull out of the match, Eric remains proudly adamant that he is not going to back down from Tong Po in the ring. Kurt helplessly watches Tong Po brutally beat Eric in the ring and leaves him paralysed from the waist down, wheelchair bound and unable to walk again. Filled with grief and rage, Kurt swears revenge on Tong Po. Kurt finds a sole ally in Winston Taylor (Haskell Anderson), a retired US Army special forces soldier who helps Kurt enlist the help of a former Muay Thai trainer Xian Chow (Dennis Chan) who lives in seclusion in a quiet village along with his niece Mylee (Rochelle Ashana). Though reluctant at first, Xian teaches Kurt the ways of Muay Thai with primitive but extremely effective methods to transform Kurt into a hardened fighter primed to avenge his older brother by fighting Tong Po. <br/><br/>The acting was never going to set the world on fire but there is no doubt Kickboxer is still exciting and enjoyable from start to finish. The fighting and martial arts showcased on screen are still a delight to watch many years later. Jean-Claude Van Damme in his halcyon days is still enjoyable to watch on screen. Though Van Damme's star has since faded and he is no longer the box office drawcard he used to be, a lot of his early movies still have a special spot in all of our hearts.<br/><br/>Kickboxer is vintage Van Damme doing what he does best. If you are a true Van Damme fan, Kickboxer is certainly a movie to have in your collection.<br/><br/>7/10."

By-the-book martial arts flick is a tolerable time-killer, but Anderson and Chan's characters risk so much for nothing—what is their motivation?

","When I saw this on Crackle just recently at first I didn't take it as seriously. Not because of Jean Claude Van Damme but because it was on crackle and I don't like commercial blocks in movies. Not because there are blocks but because they have too many stretched out and might be just the same one over and over. Also when Van Damme talks it's like his accent is too thick even for a French or Belgian guy. Anyway this movie starts out with Van Damme's brother fighting in a kick boxing tournament and winning.<br/><br/>They then go to Thailand to fight this guy called ""the Tiger"" but his brother get's his back broken. Van Damme get's his brother to a hospital by this black guy Winston. At the Hospital Van Damme finds out his brother can't walk again after that blow to his spine. After that he goes around trying to do a montage and finding trainers for Muai Thai Kickboxing. The choreography for the kick boxing is okay for a Van Damme movie that is and I think he helped with it as well.<br/><br/>Some of the dialog from the Thai people sounds dubbed at times if you look close enough. Or even care, but anyway Van Damme goes into some town for this trainer guy to help him. The trainer tells him to go to the store and after that there's another training montage. There's even this scene where the trainer and Van Damme go to a bar and after a few drinks, he starts to dance a little and he seems to do pretty well. He also find love with the trainer's daughter but after a bit she gets kidnapped and attacked by the Tiger.<br/><br/>At the end Van Damme's brother get's kidnapped by the Tigers goons and threaten to kill his brother if he fights. During Van Damme's fight with the Tiger the trainer and Winston go to save Van Damme's brother. They arrive at the match and Van Damme beat's up the Tiger and wins.<br/><br/>This is a pretty basic martial arts/revenge film but it seems to have a bit of a cult hit."

","So the kickboxer stars Jean-Claude Van Damme as Kurt Sloan the trainer and little brother of world heavyweight kickboxing Eric Sloan. so the story is essentially the story of Kurt training with Mr Chan in the art of Muay Thai so he can get revenge on Tong Po the man who paralysed Eric in the ring. And that is what i think is the problem most people have with this movie compared with other martial art movies is the film doesn't really have a secondary plot line to go along with the karate kid had the sort of romeo and Juliet star crossed lovers secondary plot going for it bloodsport had Frank trying to avoid the cops so he could still fight in the kumite but what does kickboxer have. probably the closes it comes to a second plot line is the Eric trying to talk Kurt out of the fight. But if you come into the Film expecting nothing more than lots of fighting and martial arts i almost guarantee you will enjoy it if you come looking for a deep and meaningful martial arts movie your gonna be disappointed.<br/><br/>As Jeremy Jahns would say this movie is a good time no alcohol required if you expect it to be what it is if not its a good time if your drunk"

Van Damme is sensational in this movie (and in Bloodsport, which is the 2nd greatest movie of all time). The fighting choreography is awesome especially the scene in the bar and the final fight with Tong Po. The film has some very good comedic moments as well, mostly coming from Xian and Winston (and the old guy sitting outside of mylee's store). In terms of a remake staring Dave Bautista and Gorge ST Pierre I find a silly idea because if it is a straight up remake it will make no sense. Bautista looks nothing like Tong Po and if the rumours are true that George ST Pierre is playing Kurt, the size difference between the two is ridiculous."

","So now I've finally seen all of the first three movies. I had ""Kickboxer"" in my TiVo but chose to watch the sequel first. You can see why if you go to my review of that movie. And I saw the second sequel before this one as well.<br/><br/>Did it help to see the second one first? Certain details were less of a shock. However, the brother in the other movies in the series did not exist or was unknown to the brothers in this movie. And something else was inconsistent between this movie and the sequel. But I can't say what that was because it would be a major spoiler. Let's just say I was dreading the ending of this movie but it was much more satisfying than I had thought it would be. A term used on the CW Smallville message boards was ""Offscreenville"". Perhaps something happened offscreen between the two movies. <br/><br/>You watch Jean Claude Van Damme movies to see him fight. You do not watch them to see him act. He did smile a lot in some scenes with his brother. He almost never smiles. So here, he seems to have a more pleasant personality, at least in a few scenes, than what I am used to.<br/><br/>Van Damme is shown as the director of fight scenes. I don't know precisely how you direct yourself, but Van Damme knows what he is doing. And all the fighting is really good.<br/><br/>As was the case in the sequels, Dennis Chan does a very good job as trainer Xian. And there is a lot of comedy, though not nearly as much as in the third movie. The training here reminded me a lot of the training in the sequel: very tough, sometimes funny. Xian would not let Kurt give up.<br/><br/>Haskell Anderson is quite good as the man who gives Kurt and Eric so much help.<br/><br/>I'm not sure why Michel Qissi was shown in the credits as Tong Po, but whatever his real name is he is quite fierce without saying a word, and terrifying when he does speak the one time.<br/><br/>Rochelle Asana is simply adorable as Xian's niece who ran the village store.<br/><br/>I am curious about how Xian knew Kurt was American. Kurt's accent, of course, is explained when he says his parents divorced and he was raised by his mother in Belgium and his father stayed with Eric in the U.S. Eric has an ""ethnic"" look, though, which is never explained.<br/><br/>Is this a good movie? Maybe. It's no ""Rocky"", that's for sure. But it's not bad."

His big bro (Dennis Alexio) is crippled in a seedy backroom bout in Muay Tai by villainous rival ""Tong Po,"" a mohawked villain who plays tribal music as he circles his prey. Van Damme, aided by an African American Vietnam Vet, seeks training from a wise old sage and – like KUNG FU and KILL BILL 2 – the revenge-driven student goes through a torturous training session at a rural outpost, learning a method of kickboxing that you can't get anywhere else.<br/><br/>This takes up most of the film, including terrific montage scenes as Van Damme gains strength, agile, and wisdom. And when the local mob moves in, the student proves his worth to protect a local love-interest. The exterior locations are beautiful and the fight scenes occur sporadically enough to appease hardcore action fans. There's a significant story-arc as Van Damme morphs from lamb to lion, and it's not easy. Especially after the bad guys kidnap his wheelchair-bound brother and Van Damme must survive the final match with Tong Po, while the side characters, never resorted to filler status, need to pull off a last minute rescue for our hero to turn the tables in the ring – to win the match and to save his life.<br/><br/>For More Reviews: www.cultfilmfreaks.com"
"jonathanruano","7","0","0","27 December 2011"," Kickboxer - review
","Without going into too much detail, ""Kickboxer"" follows the same formula as Rocky IV and, to a lesser extent, the other Rocky pictures and the Karate Kid films. Yet I found this film to be a lot of fun despite its predictability. Jean Claude Van Damme (playing the hero Kurt Sloan) is not a great actor, but his youthful exuberance, cheerful demeanour, and dashing appearance make him a very likable hero nonetheless. In addition, Van Damme is also not held back as much as in his later films when he goes through the indignity of saying fewer lines than the supporting cast. For me, the decision not to hold Van Damme back is a good one, because a hero can never hold our interest unless he has a well defined character to go along with his martial arts moves. Yet the best character in Kickboxer has to be Xian Chow (Dennis Chan) who trains Van Damme for his big fight with Tong Po (Michel Qissi). Xian Chow was obviously modelled after Mr. Miyagi from the Karate Kid movies, but his character has a few fresh elements. To begin with, Dennis Chan projects a dry sense of humour, like when he explains to Kurt Sloan why it is unwise to train a stranger in the art of Muay Thai. This movie was sold on its martial arts sequences, but the truth of the matter is that Dennis Chan steals the show whenever he performs on screen.<br/><br/>The rest of Kickboxer consists of Van Damme's Kurt Sloan going through intensive training against a gorgeous backdrop of Thai architecture and great 1980s music, which is just as well since training sequences in an exotic martial arts form and amidst Ancient Thai architecture are reliably entertaining. This film, especially its training sequences, also has a subtle statement to make on life which was very much in keeping with the spirit of the 1980s. This statement, simply expressed, is that the route to success and lasting happiness is to suppress troubling emotions, pull yourself up by your bootstraps, and work incredibly hard to overcome adversity. Those people who fail to overcome adversity in this way only have themselves to blame."

","This is one of Van Damme best films,i always credit my top five personally as A.W.O.L,Kickboxer and Death Warrant/Double Impact,Bloodsport,Wake Of Death.Van Damme acting wasn't so great,especially in the hospital scenes.This is a classic revenge story of brotherly love.Van Damme showcases his martial arts ability here,which some say is not real Thai Boxing.Who cares? we watch this because we see people getting their asses kicked all over the screen.I first saw this when i was only about 8 years old and my older brother rented it along with Bloodsport.There is some funny parts in this movie,which make it more interesting and enjoyable.Tong Po is a real bad ass dude,you can see the evil in his eyes throughout the movie.But he plays his part well enough.The trainer Xian brings some light comic scenes to the film,And creates some classic lines like ""wood in a palm tree"".This movie shows Van Dammes martial arts talent as i said,but it has a heart-felt story to it.This is a classic martial arts movie for any fan of martial arts or Van Damme.If you like this then check out the Kickboxer franchise,and just remember to enjoy as a time passing viewing."

","This has to be the best Van Damme film. Surely. JCVD was a trained martial artist and fighter, not an actor when he first got in films. He is in his most impressive physical shape in this film and does the most impressive kicks than in any other film. This gives great insight into the training of Muay Thai. It shows a lot of will power through hard, physical training which is what I like to see. A lot better than the Rocky montage that I've seen, Kickboxer has become famous for the training scenes and his dancing scene in the bar.

They had 2 basic formulas - person who was a complete novice and knows it learns ow to fight, or person has some skill but they aren't as good as think they are so they need to learn how to fight well. Van Damme was one of my favorites in this genre, and this movie doesn't disappoint, throwing the main characters into fights in and out of ring.<br/><br/>The rape could have been left out without hurting the movie, but I guess they wanted to make you hate the already very hate-able character even more.<br/><br/>Van Damme is in amazing shape, there is some lame humor here, but the great action and scenic shots make this an interesting movie."

","***J.C VAN DAMME IS MY HERO FOREVER***<br/><br/>Jean-Claude Van Damme is in a class by himself. This film shows off his Kickboxing skills. He is nothing short of spectacular both in acting and fighting. This film shows us his most modest and loving character. He is a simple soul at heart ready to give a helping hand.<br/><br/>Now about the film: Kurt Sloan is the corner-man for his brother, U.S. kickboxing champion Eric Sloan. Eric has his next match in Thailand against an opponent he knows nothing about. He doesn't even know the art of Muay Thai his opponent Tong Po is a master of this deadly art.<br/><br/>Before the fight Eric asks Kurt to fetch himself some ice to cool of his body. As Kurt is returning with some ice in some pails he hears some dull thuds and catches first glimpse of Tong Po who is hitting the support pillars of his room with his legs bringing pieces of the ceiling plaster down to the floor much to the shock of Kurt. He pleads to Eric to stop the fight. Eric tells Kurt to have faith in his his abilities.<br/><br/>During the fight Eric is punished and paralyzed in the ring by and elbow to the back by Thailand champion Tong Po. When Kurt tries to intervene he is given a kick to the chest and throw out of the ring, where he is noticed by Winston Taylor a retired Vietnam War veteran. <br/><br/>Eric is dumped outside by attendants much to the disbelief of Kurt and left there without even arrangements being made to take him to hospital. Winston Taylor arrives at the scene and he and Kurt take Eric to the hospital where he is later diagnosed as being paralyzed waist down as a result of the injury by Tong Po.<br/><br/>He vows revenge against all of Winston's arguments that Tong Po is owned by a vicious crime lord, and that a direct attack on him would mean their deaths. Kurt's only chance is in the ring and that without any training it would mean his doom.<br/><br/>Kurt tries to enroll in a Muay Thai school but is refused many times. Eventually Winston who has been watching him all the time tells him that he knows an old friend called Zion who could tutor him. <br/><br/>With the help of Zion Kurt begins his first steps in the art of Muay Thai, and the eventual showdown between him and Tong Po. <br/><br/>To mention: the actor that plays Tong Po (Michel Qissi) is phenomenal.<br/><br/>There is a sequel worth having Kickboxer 2 which doesn't star Van Damme but stars Michelle Quissi.<br/><br/>Other similar movies of J.C Van Damme:<br/><br/>1.

","Yes, now we're into the realms of classic masterpieces! One of John Claud Van Damne's early films, Kickboxer has it all- fighting. Jean Cloud stars as Luc 'kickboxer' Deveroux, a fighter who wants to travel to China and enter a deadly Marshall Arts contest. His brother, Luke Deveroux was meant to go but as he was an unknown actor they decided to send Vin Darn instead. Off he goes, wearing nothing as always to make sure the female, gay, and curious portion of the audience get to drool over his well oiled, muscular and inviting buttocks. Soon he is being trained by a wizened old genius in the ways of kick boxing. He kicks empty cardboard boxes, flat packs, dodges boxes filled with ripe fruit and veg, and eats cardboard all day. The middle section of the film is simply various montages of this type of behaviour, showing his skills improving until he can do the splits balancing on top of a hundred stacked milk cartons. We also see him shaking his thang at a local bar, entrancing the local woman and igniting them into a sexual frenzy. Luckily when they approach he snaps their necks with swift roundhouse kicks. Thus he is ready for the tournament. Many fighters from around the globe and beyond have come to fight and win. We have Bolo from China, a sumo wrestler from Japan, a Viking from Norway, a funny little crab like creature from Africa, and various others, each with a unique fighting style. Shaun Claw Damn Van progresses through each round, beating everyone easily. In the final he has to fight a hard looking transvestite who trains by kicking holes in car doors and eating concrete. JCVCDVD beats him after a gruelling ten rounds by punching him in the nuts so hard that she/he becomes a he/she. We celebrate with a fist pumping 80s power ballad, possibly called 'Don't Let The Cardboard Box You In (Keep Believing, Little Boy)!'<br/><br/>Best Scene: When the Sumo sits on the little crab man and laughs, and you see all the arms and limbs underneath frantically flailing around, then stretching climactically, then trembling softly, then stopping. Always stopping."

","I first saw Kickboxer on VHS back in the early 1990s. It was a great time to be a kid. Street Fighter II was huge! Ninja Turtles was still booming and there was a big martial arts craze going on at the time. So there was nothing cooler than renting an R-rated Van Damme movie! Kickboxer comes from a long line of classics that spawned from the 80s and early 90s. It was truly a great time for movies and Hollywood had not yet burned itself out like it has today.<br/><br/>For this film, Van Damme is in full form fresh from his breakthrough performance in Bloodsport. This time around, the plot is that of classic martial arts revenge and even more cool training. The best thing about this type of movie is that it doesn't try to be anything more than it already IS, and for that it truly succeeds. Van Damme demonstrates his classic (long forgotten) charisma that once made him a mega-star. Not because he was an amazing actor, but because he had so much HEART.<br/><br/>The fight scenes are some of the best ever filmed. Van Damme really shows off his impressive physique and his unique martial arts form this time around. Nothing was cooler than Van Damme’s famous air born spin kicks.<br/><br/>Kickboxer is not perfect, but it is very enjoyable and is always a big reminder of how cool these types of movies used to be before both Hollywood and Van Damme sadly burned themselves out.<br/><br/>Awesome movie!! 8 out of 10 Classic!"

Revenge in this one. <br/><br/>His older brother gets in a fight with a real bad guy, so it's up to Jean-Claude to save the day!!<br/><br/>Even though he can act, despite popular belief (Replicant, Maximum Risk, In Hell) he doesn't concentrate on that here. He just shows us his breathtaking ability to kick down a brick wall with an aerial kick, and how he can, with ease, without bending over at all, kick with both legs well above his own head, with force too. He's not just doing fancy moves that mean nothing in the grand scheme of things. You have to really applaud his ability, he's incredible, he has his name up there with some of the best like Jackie, Jet and Bruce. He's also one of the most physically defined people I've ever seen, how much fat would you say? Maybe minus five percent?!!!! A true athlete, where he gets the energy to do what looks like about 4 or 5 hours of exercise a day is beyond me. How far can he stretch, too? It's enough to make you lose your appetite, but it's all good!<br/><br/>Poor story, but that's not what we care for, great action, a bit of comedy to keep us laughing, and incredible training montage and fight scenes, with a soundtrack you want to get hold of yourself for personal use when working out! 10/10"

I tend to enjoy material art movies, and this is one I enjoyed from a fighting purpose, look at it through acting and plot wise, well it's quite average.

","Van Damme stars as a kick-boxer who follows his brother, who's a champion.

A lot of people don't think much of Van Damme anymore, but this film was made at a time when all the kungfu theater movies were dying out in the US and Chuck Norris just wasn't getting the job done. Enter Van Damme, a decent looking kid, a feeble, awkward ability to act, and what do you get? This! I remember first watching this movie on HBO when it originally came out, and I was residing in a household with several roommates and this movie was on the tube every time it came up, and yours truly was right there, watching it with everyone else. I feel Van Damme has lost some of his luster over the years, either due to bad roles or just a personal choice to sit out, but the man put out some decent movies in the 80's and 90's and this was definitely one of them!

","KICKBOXER is deservedly a cultmovie. Featuring a rising, ascending Van Damme, it has the note of unassuming intimacy and confidentiality and discretion of the older martial arts flicks. As a quite naive youngster, Van Damme has charm, niceness and even a certain naturalness. He made a few movies better than KICKBOXERand also many far worseso what I'm saying is that KICKBOXER has a place of pride in his career.<br/><br/>Van Damme shows us a very nice persona in this action flicka nice youngster, set to learn Muai Thai from a master, Xian (Dennis Chan) in order to avenge his brother. This is the plot of tens of action movies; like the vast majority, this one seems drastically lowbudgeted, and it's made worth especially by the Asian performerssuch as the already mentioned Muai Thai master Dennis Chan, and his niece Rochelle Ashana ('Mylee' in the movie). The master can be funny when he so chooses.<br/><br/>Most of the film details Van Damme's training; Xian takes him sometimes to the Stone City, to put him in line with the atmosphere of a place once visited by the ancient warriors. Also, by very harsh methods, Xian teaches Van Damme how to stretchusing things that would make a professional hangman pretty envious. Xian's lesson to Van Damme is that, in order to learn kick-boxing, you have to learn more than just kick-boxing. There's a widerhumanreality. But rest assuredthe flick is thoroughly straightforward, you'll be spared lectures of Oriental wisdom.<br/><br/>Van Damme's adversary is Tong Po, a Neanderthalian brute, very skilled, very strong, and extremely basehe rapes Mylee before the match.<br/><br/>KICKBOXER is a nononsense fights flick, leaner than most others."

Van Damage then takes it upon himself to train by the great master Xian to take kickboxing revenge on Tong Po for his brother's sake, and it's done well. there's about 2 to 3 fights in between the extensive training, which leave something to be slightly desired (except for the brilliant scene where he gets drunk then dances with two chicks and fights, like, 7 or 8 guys. really nice).<br/><br/>Tong Po molests Xian's niece and Van Damme doesn't know this.

The teacher student relationship and training was interesting, but nothing special compared to similar movie scenarios. Uncle Xian was funny sometimes but in general all of the dialogue was just plain corny. That dancing scene brought the quality level to its lowest. The whole movie lacked intrigue and it had nothing to keep your whole interest or attention. The fight scenes (which is why most people watch these types of movies) were not even that good.

","Eric Sloane (Dennis Alexio) is a champion kickboxer who is invincible and seemingly untouchable in his home country. Having beaten everyone that he can in America, he's talked into travelling to the home of kickboxing in Thailand to see if he can take on the best that they have to offer. However, Eric ends up paralysed after a fight with Thailand's best Tong Po (Michel Qissi). Eric's brother Kurt (Jean-Claude Van Damme) is determined to avenge Po for what he did to his brother and sets about training and preparing for the fight of his life with the assistance of Xian Chow (Dennis Chan).<br/><br/>Kickboxer seems to be remembered as one of the defining films for Van Damme and watching it again today I can't help but be reminded at how lazy and unimaginative that this film feels as a whole. Let's look at some examples....<br/><br/>We have a Rocky 4 scenario at the start where we have a cocky champion that underestimates his opponent and ends up paying the price for this (albeit the champion's fate was much worse in Rocky 4, but the general consensus is the same).<br/><br/>Kickboxer then switches tone and becomes a karate kid style film whereby an unassuming martial arts genius takes a pupil under his wing and provides him with the necessary training to defeat his opponent.<br/><br/>This all sounds OK in writing, but somehow these elements don't translate quite as well on screen; for one thing this film lacks the entertainment value that Rocky 4 offered; sure Rocky 4 was agenda heavy, but it was entertaining. The other problem with this film is that The Karate Kid element is weak compared to Karate Kid; the training montages were dull and unimaginative for the most part (although some elements did make me laugh so this aspect of the narrative wasn't a complete failure). If we continue to draw comparisons then it's almost impossible to overlook the fact that Van Damme lacks the vulnerability of Macchio who looked like a 5 stone weakling in the Karate Kid. Van Damme is the 'Muscles from Brussels' so to see him training as a rookie in martial arts was a tough sell to say the least.<br/><br/>Kickboxer is a predictable film which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but the clichéd turn of events at the end was almost too much to bear (Kurt is getting his ass kicked, but then when Po announces that he raped his woman Kurt seems to whirr into action). It's an obvious plot device and to be honest it would have been better if we'd have just seen Kurt kicking Po's ass because of all the training that he'd had).<br/><br/>I noted at the start of the film that Van Damme was responsible for the fight choreography and for that he does deserve some credit. A lot of the fight scenes were intense and quite well-staged.<br/><br/>There are other problems with this film such as cheesy dialogue, wooden acting and awful dubbing, but given the fact that this is a JCVD film these are forgivable flaws. However, the lazy and overly familiar plot line that plagues Kickboxer only helps to remind us of the better films that it tries and fails to emulate."

","This little Jean Claude Van Damme movie had its ups and downs, but in the end just was not up to his previous martial arts movie ""Bloodsport"" released the previous year. The movie has more of a revenge plot to it than anything as this guy who is the American champ of kick boxing goes overseas to fight another champion of some country in Asia I do not remember which. The brother is paralyzed by this champ and the other brother finds a guy to train him so he can defeat this super killer guy who took out the American champ in a few seconds. So the rest of the movie is Jean training to get back at the super kick boxer. The movie is okay, but it has problems too. There is only so much training one can take and this one has those scenes in spades. The super kick boxer in the final fight is a bit weak and that whole fight is a bit anti-climatic. And seriously they just dump the American champ outside after his loss? Why did the American agree to go over there without some sort of backing by the government to take care of him and sanction the fight, just goes to show you never go to an underground like fighting arena to prove yourself. Still, it is a watchable movie just not really my thing, I preferred the tournament of ""Bloodsport"" where they had rather big array of fighters."

","Van Damme wrote this story to demonstrate that it takes a long long time to achieve the level of expertise that one needs in order to compete in a contest such as featured herein. The lion's share of film time is devoted to the rigorous training Kurt (Van Damme) receives in preparation of the upcoming bout with Tong Po. The story begins in the beginning, takes a hiatus to demonstrate the instruction necessary to get to the climax, and then runs straight into the climax.<br/><br/>The problem is that most casual martial arts fans don't CARE about the training or character development. They just want action action action and then in the ending finale, they want action, with maybe a little story thrown in. If that is what you're after, this isn't that kind of film. This also isn't an intelligent film or anything Oscar-worthy, but if you want your teenager to see what is required to hone those tai kwan do classes into something real and formidable, plug this one in and explain the level of dedication one must invest to achieve that goal.<br/><br/>If for no other reason, watch it for that.<br/><br/>I don't know.

Note that, just like in Bloodsport, the beaten-up big bro of Kickboxer is a rather irritating blokey with unsightly facial hair, who's just too full of himself (there's a lesson in there... don't wear a 'tache on a fighting ring, probably). J-C v D goes out for revenge against the mean champion. And this is where the only real difference between Kickboxer and Bloodsport shows; here, Van Damme is still lacking experience in the domain of martial arts, and needs to undergo a long training before he'll stand a chance against the big nasty.<br/><br/>
This then leads to a big dose of scenes where the Damme-man undergoes harsh and slightly unusual training under an old master. Pretty much 2/3 of the movie are made up of these initiation scenes, and thus it seems like a much more slow and calm film than Bloodsport. It may also seem much more boring than Bloodsport to others, as there is fairly little actual fighting until the end of the film. Just a lot of long scenes where Van Damme strengthens himself, or scenes where we see some pretty Thai scenery. It's not that bad, really, and certainly less dull than it sounds, but this more sedate pace won't work for everyone.<br/><br/>In the end, the film does sort of make up for it's lack of zest by throwing in a long and very intense final battle (and the nasty here is a good deal more genuinely evil than Chong Li was in Bloodsport). Thrilling as though the final scene may be, it is sort of hard to believe that the hero could've gone from being a mere beginner to an expert strong enough to beat a highly feared champion so quickly. It somehow doesn't quite feel as if Van Damme has really undergone many months of agonising training, gaining fighting experience...exactly because we haven't seen him fight all that much up to the last (and pretty much only) battle. Where did he get the experience in practise from? Reading a handbook?<br/><br/>One thing to point out; the idea in this film is that Jean-Claude, unlike his badly shaven big bro, is the shy and sensitive intello of the two. Okay, so this point is only mentioned very briefly, but it still raises a lot of eyebrows. Jean-Clause Van Damme as the educated wuss in a family is about as plausible as Louis de Funès would be in a Swan Lake ballet (still, who knows...).<br/><br/>With it's flawed pace and blatant cloning of Bloodsport, this movie isn't ideal. It's not exactly horrible either, and remains watchable enough, but only total fighting film junkies will really enjoy it. The whole loincloth scene also makes it commendable to fans of male skin-showing (errr...right, brothers?). Others don't really have a reason to check this out."

The training sequence took up too much of the movie, Van Damme's camera fetish is annoying (YES! We all know your butt is tight!

","""Kickboxer"" is one of the early films of Jean-Claude Van Damme and like his older movies, it's pretty good. The set-up is good....the finale, however, is pretty predictable and cliched.<br/><br/>When the story begins, Eric Sloane has just successfully defended his kickboxing title. With nothing interesting to do at home, Eric decides to travel to Thailand to fight...bringing along his younger brother, Kurt (Van Damme), as his trainer. Eric is overconfident and gets his butt whipped in the ring...and the evil Tong Po refuses to quit when the fight is called...and leaves Eric paralyzed. Not surprisingly, Kurt wants revenge and seeks out a local guy to train him.<br/><br/>When it comes to the final big battle, the film throws in every cliche known to martial arts films. Po's boss is determined he's going to win and has Eric kidnapped and help prisoner until Kurt throws the fight. Additionally, evil Po rapes Kurt's girl. So, apparently paralyzing the brother isn't enough....and the film threw everything into this one.<br/><br/>The best parts of the film are the fighting sequences. While he's no great actor (and his accent and brother's are TOTALLY different), Van Damme has incredible skills in the film....and it's worth seeing for this reason alone. So, ignore the cliches and just enjoy."

","Last night, I wanted to watch Laurence Olivier's ""Hamlet"", the DVD didn't work. I tried the original version of ""The Ballad of Narayama"", the DVD bugged as well. Then I put the original ""A Star is Born"" but the streaks of malfunction didn't want to end.<br/><br/>Then I said to myself ""oh what the heck, let's just watch ""Kickboxer"" on Netflix!"" Which feels like cancelling a reservation to the town's fanciest French restaurant for a kebab. But if the film doesn't exactly offer the same menu than the other distinguished titles, it's perhaps the most likely to be visited again and again. I don't mean that it's so bad it's good, but one should revaluate the taste of these old martials arts movies, getting better with time. Now that ""Kickboxer"" has celebrated its thirtieth anniversary, it's interesting to note how well it holds up or let's just say, better than expected.<br/><br/>Enumerating the flaws would be a vain exercise but let's do it for fun. Sure the acting and the writing isn't exactly the film's driving force, sure the brother's body language is as convincing as a mayonnaise tube. Sure the Winston character seems to belong to some ""Rambo"" or ""Commando"" wannabe. Sure the revenge story is as predictable as a Disney film. Sure the character of Tong Po who starts as a legitimate opponent gets a useless villain-upgrade as if we needed more reasons to hate him than breaking the bro's vertebras. Sure the film is as implausible as it's corny, but the real question is: to what extent does that make it unwatchable?<br/><br/>When it comes to movies that ""bad"" on objective terms, I tend to remember Ebert's critic of a really bad movie of the same year: ""She's Out of Control"". Following his inquisitive critic, I watched the film again and realized it wasn't as bad as it was wrong on many levels, especially the creepily incestuous implications. ""Kickboxer"" keeps a rather clean image behind its simple concept of a brother avenging his brother after he's been left paralysed. I'm not saying any film can get away with positive feelings and morality, but in the case of ""Kickboxer"", the plot has so little subtlety that one can concede that much to the film, it's got heart, and a good heart.
There's more to appreciate, like the passion and respectful dedication to martial arts and in that case Muay Thai. Once the story takes off and the basic training begins, we're immersed in a territory that wouldn't feel unfamiliar to ""Karate Kid"" fans, after all, Xiao is a likable character but not far from the sensei with unorthodox method training codified by Mr. Miyagi. Still, Van Damme designed the story in a way that showed respect to the discipline and discipline in general and prompted many young viewers to adopt martial arts as a passion of theirs.<br/><br/>Inded, whenever I consider Van Damme movies, I remember my older cousin and his poster-clad bedroom, he was Van Damme's number one fan, practised Karate competition, and always brought us the latest Van Damme VHS, needless to say we used to watch in crappy 80s quality. And that's part of the charm; one that gives a slight gourmet taste to these films, the sound was awful, the cropping hideous so we were looking to beauty whenever it could pop up. Anyone must remember these old-school textures that DVDs and Netflix swept off, the film looks so empty and bland now that it makes you easily forget the kind of experience VHS provided. You had to stay focused, to get through the film, it filled your afternoon and your heart before you'd get back to reality, ""Kickboxer"" provided so much fun that even its laughable flaws were forgettable.<br/><br/>And yet for all these flaws, there were a few scenes that stuck in memory, ""Tong-Po hitting the pillar concrete, the palm tree breaking, the trick to run faster, the training in the Buddhist temple and one of Van Damme's infamous drunk-dancing moment, one of the highlights of his fluctuating career with so many ups and downs and double kicks, Van Damme had the moves and not just for the splits.<br/><br/>Finally, it's a martial arts movie so one that must be judged on the basis of its climactic fight, once again the choreographic staging shows some relative professionalism. It doesn't stand out like the ""Bloodsport"" Kumite but it's still the second best Van Damme movie, one that makes you want to chant ""Nuk Soo Cow"" all over the place, before some random uplifting 80s theme start.<br/><br/>""Kickboxer"" is the reflection of simpler times when combat movies didn't rely on sophisticated stories but just stars with enough appeal to drag an audience. Sure it's not a masterpiece, but it'll please the right amount of fans whether of Van Damme or martial arts, it's probably the ""Rocky"" of the Thai Boxing.... Or le's just say the ""Rocky IV""."

A by the numbers storyline. Van Damne's got the same motivation of character, overthrow the bad guys, and that (spoiler alert) he does. The R rated version really doesn't offer any shock gore, which was a come down, like the R version of Wrong Bet. There's even a Very Frequent Violence warning on the cover for Kickboxer, it's a joke. I actually felt after Cyborg bombed, cinema chains were thinking, "" We might as well put Kickboxer out"", which was released four weeks after Cyborg. To be honest, Kickboxer isn't anything exceptional. It's a plot of such simplicity and predictability, if you checked out Bloodsport, Wrong Bet, and Kickboxer 2+. Van Damne, a believable actor of emotion, but of course, he's playing Van Damne, avenges this ugly bald headed Asian dude, Tung Po, who crippled his brother in the ring, so Van Damne's character, fighting the impossible odds, thinks ""I'm gonna beat him"". by pulling off my kickboxing skills. Van Damne again gets to kiss a beautiful girl. Probably the best thing about Kickboxer is it's

","If you liked ""Bloodsport"", you'll like this one, because it's pretty much the same movie. Van Damme's out for revenge again, this time on some Thai dude who put his brother in a wheelchair. So he trains. And trains. And trains. A huge chunk of this movie is devoted to Van Damme kicking air or if we're lucky inanimate objects. Some of that stuff is actually pretty badass, like the scene where the usual wise trainer stereotype instructs him to take down a tree, but most of it just feels boring and overlong. The romantic subplot isn't any help either, around halfway I was just hoping they would bring out the fight already. So then they bring out the fight and it's actually quite good, well-choreographed and the climax is set up nicely. Only problem I'm having with the conclusion is that they shouldn't have made the villain talk. Or at least come up with something better for him to say.

","This is a great movie. Not as good as Bloodsport, however, with its own quirky changes from the Van Damage movie formula. Yes, he does get trained after his brother is brutally beaten by a Muay Thai boxer, he does go through the hardship of training and yes there is cheesy romance. But this cheesy romance is saved by the fact that there is no sex scene, yet somehow Van Damme manages to get his token ass shot in there again! Brilliantly planned. This movie, like Bloodsport, has a support character called Jackson (maybe JCVD had a close friend by the same name...or maybe it is the only English name he can pronounce?), anyway he is a great character as he is really 'Nam American. He brings life to the movie as he acts out his role as the mentally effected 'Nam veteran. Furthermore, this movie shows Van Dammes acting ability at its finest when he is taken to the bar, made to drink till he is HIGHLY intoxicated and then test his skills on a bunch of little Thai guys (much like in Bruce Lee films where he proceeds to beat up 100 little Chinese guys).

","I have seen this movie twice on In-Flight Movies on Thai International Airways flights from Bangkok. It was a low-budget film but with a great story line. I think that the title was simply ""Kick Box"".<br/><br/>The plot was: There are two brothers. One brother is the World Champion Kick Boxer. However, in a fight to defend the world championship, he is severely injured. He is put in a wheel-chair and cannot box any more.<br/><br/>His brother wants to gain revenge, so he goes looking for a grandmaster to teach him Thai kick boxing. After a long search, he finds the Grandmaster of Kick Boxing living as a recluse far out in the jungles of Thailand. At first the grandmaster denies that he is the right person. Then he says that he does not box any more. Finally with great reluctance he agrees to teach him kick boxing.<br/><br/>There follows months of rigorous training. Finally the brother decides he is ready and leaves.<br/><br/>We soon find out why the grandmaster was so reluctant to box any more, even denying who he was. The same boxer who severely injured the brother has been searching for the grandmaster too. He finally finds him in the jungle, they fight and the grandmaster is killed. The brother returns to find his teacher dead. Now the brother goes searching to gain revenge against the kick boxer who both injured his brother and killed his teacher.<br/><br/>I finally got around to seeing this movie today in DVD format. However, there were major, major changes from the original version I saw as an in-flight movie on Thai International Airways. The changes are so big that it is almost a different movie. Here are some of the changes: The Viet Nam War veteran Winston Taylor part does not exist in the original. There is no such person.<br/><br/>The female lead MyLee does not exist in the original.<br/><br/>The only female in the original is the hooker who the elder brother is taking into a hotel. The hooker in the original is a different girl and more beautiful.<br/><br/>All or almost all of the actors are different. The bad guy Tong Po is a different actor in the original. In the original, that part is played by a very mean looking black man. He kills three people unnecessarily, and is killed himself in the end.<br/><br/>The trainer in the original is a different actor. He is a much younger man who merely wants to retire from fighting, so at first he pretends not to be that person. We later learn that he is hiding from the Tong Po character who wants to hunt him down, kind of like in the old western movies where the two fastest gunslingers in the west want to battle each other to see who is the fastest.<br/><br/>The final fight scene does not take place in an arena in front of a paying audience. Rather, the final fight takes place in the jungle and it is a fight to the death.<br/><br/>With all these changes, one must wonder if it is really the same movie. Yet, it is clearly the same. The earlier part up to the point where the defeated and injured elder brother is taken out and left on the street is virtually identical to the in-flight movie I saw.<br/><br/>The movie I saw was very primitive. It looked like it had been shot with a home movie camera. What I suspect is that some Hollywood producers saw the original I saw, realized its potential and purchased the rights and remade the movie completely.<br/><br/>I still prefer the original. Perhaps they should go back and find the original if it still exists and remake THAT movie.<br/><br/>Sam Sloan"
