","Platoon is a 1986 American war film written and directed by Oliver Stone one of the most strongest realistic anti war films of all time. It is one of the best Vietnam war films I have ever seen that won the Academy Award for Best Picture of 1986 and best Director for Oliver Stone, as well as Best Sound Mixing and Best Film Editing. Stone's Vietnam film portrayed a real life human been on his point of view of the story telling that went on in his real life that he experienced after his tour of duty in Vietnam ended in 1968, Oliver Stone wrote a screenplay called Break: a semi-autobiographical account detailing his experiences and the life he was in Vietnam. The characters were portrayed more then a few soldiers they were portrayed more as a human been than been soldiers obeying an order.Platoon shows the Vietnam War was a big mistake, but being a fictional documentary on Vietnam is far from its purpose. It is one of my personal favorite war movies. I love this movie to death. <br/><br/>Those of us who did make it have an obligation to build again, to teach to others what we know, and to try with what's left of our lives to find a goodness and meaning in this life. <br/><br/>In Platoon, Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen) is a young, naive U.S. soldier who, upon his arrival to Vietnam, quickly discovers that he must do battle not only with the Viet Cong, but also with the gnawing fear, physical exhaustion and intense anger growing within him. While his two commanding officers draw a fine line between the war they wage against the enemy and the one they fight with each other, the conflict, chaos and hatred permeate Taylor, suffocating his realities and numbing his feelings to man's highest value... life.<br/><br/>Chris sees his platoon fragmented into two halves, each aligned with one of two men -- Sgt. Elias (Willem Dafoe) and Sgt. Barnes (Tom Berenger). Those two soldiers are really two positive good things to see in the film because it sets the viewer on the seat of the edge. They both have nominally the same enemy (Viet Cong), but, really, it doesn't take long to realize that Elias is Good, and Barnes is Evil (the ""enemy"" does not enter into the moral equation of this film, at all it's an outside threat, same as malaria-carrying mosquitoes or even friendly fire). Elias feels the futility of the war and has respect for life; Barnes fights the war doggedly and has no compassion, period. Both are efficient soldiers fighting the same enemy, but really as is at one point aptly put by Chris Taylor himself,they are fighting for the souls of the platoon members, as the outcome of the war is never really in doubt.<br/><br/>The platoon reaches the village, where a food and weapons cache is discovered. While questioning the village chief, Barnes loses his patience and senselessly kills the man's wife despite his denials that they are aiding the Viet Cong. Barnes is about to murder the man's young daughter to force him to tell them to where the enemy is. <br/><br/>Elias doesn't take kindly to this kind of behavior. Elias and Barnes come closer and closer to open conflict, as Taylor becomes a veteran, obviously siding with Elias. Meanwhile, the fate of the platoon comes closer and closer to them, culminating in an explosively shot action conclusion. The end is dark, but morally satisfying.<br/><br/>Platoon is a legendary film. A film that I will always cherish, and a film that I will never get tired of. And the last Vietnam film worth a damn to watch. There isn't any War film today that was filmed as really human drama war today in 2015. It respectively represents the very essence of purposefully haunting powerful cinematography in the history.-- It is representing admirable cinematic craftsmanship and storytelling. A film that is sometimes impossible to watch for its frighteningly intense and emotionally draining account of the Vietnam War as it is waged both on the battlefields and within the very souls of men.<br/><br/>The best real human drama portrayed on screen anti-war film in Vietnam from the 80's, It is my favorite film that I will always love to death to see. I also don't watch this film for an action ; I actually see it for the war and how it everything was, what is more valuable and it is life: The film also have a message in it. The actors portraying the characters did make a believable performance as the real team of squad soldier fighting the Enemy the Viet Cong.<br/><br/>The battles with Viet-Cong are shown realistic mostly on the end of the final battle. 10/10"

","Platoon is the landmark definition of a war film. Pulse-pounding sequences stacked on well-performed portrayal of soldiers (Sheen, Berenger & Dafoe) as well as a couple of heart-wrenching scenes that would be somewhat difficult to view. The film is Oliver Stone's most significant to date, especially since it's based off his own personal experience in the Vietnam War."
"alifanova","10","72","83","10 June 2010"," Hell is the impossibility of reason
","Why I think Platoon is probably the best war movie Hollywood ever made? Because it's very humane. I mean it. The director sees all his characters as victims of war rather than heroes or villains. Have a closer look at 'em.<br/><br/>Taylor has no power inside himself and is torn between the two fathers; he ends up with a physical act of revenge. This is not what one father taught him - and the other father is actually murdered by him. <br/><br/>Sgt. Barnes would never fit the postwar life and knew it damn too well himself; after all, he is not a fool although might seem a senseless killing machine at first sight. Vietnamese bullets could not kill him, his talent for survival being his enemy. So, he attempts kinda suicide twice (at least) begging others to kill him and thus end the pain tearing him from inside: first, in the potheads' bunker scene after Taylor's accusations; then, when Taylor finds him in the final scene.<br/><br/>Sgt. Elias was far too good to survive the Nam and maybe even challenged and annoyed lifers on purpose, waiting for some bob barnes to hit back :) It's a pity Stone excluded the stars' scene monologue which explains pretty much about Elias' ways and view of the future. In fact, for himself he sees no future. Not in this world that is all about betrayal and killing.<br/><br/>Bunny and Junior, one the embodiment of somewhat sadistic bravery and the other of cowardice. Their deaths are partly a morality, partly to show that it does not matter if you're black or white, brave or cowardly, war makes no difference wiping off everyone it can. <br/><br/>King, Big Harold, Francis are survivors yet victims, too. What is awaiting them in the ""real"" world where nobody understands and nobody respects anything? They are dreaming of a comeback to music, girlfriends, fun time - but reality bites, and who knows, will they find their spot under the sun or will be forced to use the skills obtained in the Nam and get engaged in crime and drug abuse?<br/><br/>Red O'Neill talking about his ability to predict if a guy is gonna make it or not. A reflection of his own fears: shall I stay alive and get out of here or not. The odds are that he is not, and Stone nails him to the place with Captain's order to take over what was once the Platoon... Bye Patsy.<br/><br/>The idea that Stone has been trying to bring forward to us is NOT (to my mind) a story of struggle between the good and the bad for the possession of Taylor's soul (remember, the boy became a murderer in the end), but: where is war there can be no escape. Leave hope everyone who enters.<br/><br/>Highest rate ever for that."

","Platoon is generally regarded as one of the strongest anti-war films of all time. While this is certainly true, what's often overlooked -- at least after only one run through the film -- is that it's chiefly a tale of God vs. Satan, and the war is there to set a perilous backdrop. No doubt, Platoon shows the Vietnam War was a big mistake, but being a fictional documentary on Vietnam is far from its purpose.<br/><br/>The story is told from the point of view of Chris Taylor (solidly played by Charlie Sheen), a middle class kid who goes to Vietnam to do what he thinks is his patriotic duty. In the first ten minutes, Chris is shown in the uncomfortable jungle, struggling just to survive in the natural environment, let alone do any actual damage to the enemy. Quickly we're introduced to the well-known facets of the Vietnam War: The lack of sense of purpose, the wraith-like enemies, the obvious prevalence of the uneducated and poor among the fighting grunts -- and, soon, we see how these factors combine to cause widespread low morale and some actions of more than questionable ethical value.<br/><br/>Chris sees his platoon fragmented into two halves, each aligned with one of two men -- Sgt. Elias (Willem Dafoe) and Sgt. Barnes (Tom Berenger). These two really are the driving force behind the film. They both have nominally the same enemy (the Viet Cong), but, really, it doesn't take long to realize that Elias is Good, and Barnes is Evil (the ""enemy"" does not enter into the moral equation of this film, at all -- it's an outside threat, same as malaria-carrying mosquitoes or even friendly fire). I won't deny it is a very black-vesus-white relationship, but this polarity does not feel contrived. Elias feels the futility of the war and has respect for life; Barnes fights the war doggedly and has no compassion, period. Both are efficient soldiers fighting the same enemy, but really -- as is at one point aptly put by Chris Taylor himself -- they are fighting for the souls of the platoon members, as the outcome of the war is never really in doubt.<br/><br/>Elias/Barnes' hold on the platoon, and the viewer, is developed through several war sequences. A chilling scene takes place in a village, where our soldiers find no VC, but they do find a cache of VC weapons. The inhumanity of certain soldiers, including of Sgt. Barnes, is unflinchingly shown here. It leaves the viewer with an empty feeling that is hard to shake, reminding of the similarly empty look on a woman's face after she sees her son killed in front her.<br/><br/>Elias doesn't take kindly to this kind of behavior. Elias and Barnes come closer and closer to open conflict, as Taylor becomes a veteran, obviously siding with Elias. Meanwhile, the fate of the platoon comes closer and closer to them, culminating in an explosively shot action conclusion. The end is dark, but morally satisfying.<br/><br/>Don't watch this movie for the action. That's not to say it's not well shot, or unrealistic. On the contrary. It's quite convincing. But it doesn't show war as a fun sport, and it's never a question of good guys versus bad guys. There will be no cheering for the ""good guys"" or anyone else in this one. Stone succeeds brilliantly at putting the viewer into the middle of it all, and it's not a pretty sigh (and definitely not for the squeamish, either).<br/><br/>On the other hand, if you want great acting, it's here. Dafoe and Berenger do incredibly well, with the incredibly good (and seemingly authentically sounding) script. Barnes is horrific as he challenges three men to kill him, drinking hard liquor out of the bottle. They don't make a move, and neither will you, though you'll hate him just as much as them. Dafoe is a ray of light in the dark as Elias. The cast is rounded out with many characters, all well played, and adding another dimension to the film.<br/><br/>The technical aspects of the film are superb, though one never thinks about them much, as the movie is completely engrossing. The production values seem quite good, as well. The most stunning peripheral aspect of this film, however, is the music. It's emotional and draining, and used to great effect -- listen for the main theme as you watch the village burn.<br/><br/>Watch this one a few times, and you'll likely be quite moved each time. I'll be surprised if you give it less than what I gave it: 9/10"
"blinkchester","Null","227","288","28 April 2004"," Perfection... or as close to it as we're ever likely to see
","Its hard to know where to start with such a breathtaking film. Oliver Stone's Platoon is quite simply the best Vietnam war film ever made in my opinion. Everything about it is as close to perfection as we are likely to see. Charlie Sheen plays the lead, and Willem Defoe and Tom Berenger play the two sergeants that form a key part of the plot.<br/><br/>Chris Taylor (Sheen) is torn between the sergeants. Barnes (Berenger) is the battle hardened, brutal murderer, who uses the war as an excuse to tender to his sadistic pleasures. Elias (Defoe) is the other side of the spectrum. We get the sense that he has wrestled with his inner demons, but he has successfully come through to the other side. He has compassion for his fellow man, and he uses drugs as a form of escapism from this brutal war. The two symbolise the struggle that Taylor must face if he is to survive out in Vietnam.<br/><br/>Oliver Stone perfectly captures war. The shooting is frantic and impossible to follow. It perfectly disorientates us, just as the soldiers were. We have no idea who is being shot at, and neither do they. We follow the war at ground level, and see the brutalities first hand. Having served in Vietnam, the film is loosely based on Stone's time out there, and Taylor loosely based on himself.<br/><br/>Full Metal Jacket showcases how inhumane the war was, Apocalypse Now turns it into a story about life in general, and hopelessness, but Platoon has everything. Trying hard to avoid the old cliché, but if you only watch one war film, make sure it is this one. Nothing else can come close."

","I watched Platoon when I was 17 at 1987. I was on the edge of questioning everything and ready to uprise with a small move. Of course I was fascinated after watching the movie and I remember I was that close to cry. I can definitely say Platoon is one of the best war movies of the history. It has many incredible scenes and it reserves a great story of brotherhood inside also vandalism and senseless of war. Charlie Sheen , William Dafoe and the great Tom Berenger can easily be considered as one the best combination of actors to tell a story of faith and betrayal in a movie. Oliver Stone did a great job as writer and director. I remember that I was really touched with the letters that Taylor ( Charlie Sheen ) writes to his grandma. Also with the amazing music of the film you feel many different things. I believe that on the last scene the picture of William Dafoe with his hands open on his knees with hundreds Viet Congs coming after him is a masterpiece work and unforgettable.I watched this movie at Osmanbey Gazi movie theater at Osmanbey-Istanbul and ı believe 70's and 80's are the best time in Istanbul for watching a movie with big saloons and with great atmosphere. With 90's big movie theaters started to turn to couple of small saloons and with shopping malls movie theaters started to locate at malls. I really miss a lot of 80's and the taste I get from the legend movie theaters like Osmanbey Site-Sisli Kent-Osmanbey Gazi- Pangaltı Inci-Harbiye Konak and Harbiye As."

","At the height of the Vietnam War, America's teens are drafted into the war effort to find themselves in the middle of hell.  One such young man is Chris Taylor.  He is placed in a squadron where two sergeants have different approaches to the war  Elias is more about surviving without being brutal or cruel, whereas Barnes is crueller, more ruthless and more violent. During the course of his term, Taylor's very soul is torn between the two men as he deals with what he must do.<br/><br/>The first film in Oliver Stone's unofficial trilogy is arguably the best of the three.  The basic story not only shows us what the war was like for those serving but also how the different personalities come out of those involved in it.  As we follow Taylor we see him change as he is influenced by those around him and by his situation.  It makes for an uncomfortable film but one that's worth watching.  It's certainly a better war movie than things like Wild Geese or The Dirty Dozen, simply because it's a little more real to what happens than those ones.<br/><br/>Charlie Sheen has never been better than when he's acting for Stone.  Here he gives one of his best ever performances as the innocent who is changed. Willem Dafoe is a great actor and here is no different  he also gives us one of the film's most enduring images so I'm a little biased.  Berenger is another one for whom it's hard to think of a higher point reached than when he did this film.  He is brutal and ruthless but he makes us support him in a strange way.  The support cast are all good and contains a few famous faces (John C McGinley, Whitaker, Depp) however this is really a three man show.<br/><br/>Overall this is brutal and violent with no happy ending.  At the end of the day isn't that what a war film should be?"
"Theo Robertson","9","178","242","3 September 2003"," One Of The Best Movies Of The 1980s
","The 1980s in general and the mid 1980s in particular aren't highly regarded where pop culture is concerned , this is most especially true in cinema where films seemed to be written around their soundtrack in much the same way as Hollywood movies nowadays seem to be written around their special effects . PLATOON is one of the very few films from that period that has an emotional impact , an impact that it still retains while watching it in 2003. <br/><br/>Everyone else seems to have mentioned what makes PLATOON a classic anti-war ( Note it's anti-war , not anti American or anti soldier ) movie along with being a classic movie , so I won't go over old ground except to say THAT death scene is up there with all the other tear jerking scenes from 20th century cinema , don't be ashamed to say you cried <br/><br/>If PLATOON has a flaw it's in its duality , there's the good Sarge/bad Sarge , good officer/bad officer , good white guy/bad white guy , good black guy/bad black boy etc which is maybe a bit clichéd and possibly leads me to believe Stone is making an excuse/reason that the Americans lost in Vietnam because that spent so much fighting each other rather than the VC ( Though I do concede I'm possibly misinterpreting that as an excuse or even a reason since no one will confuse the politics of Stone with the politics of John Wayne ) while Taylor's character comes across as being more of a literary device rather than a real human being , but these are minor flaws<br/><br/>It's a shame to see war films from the last few years devoid of scathing anti-war sentiments like the ones seen here . PLATOON screams at you "" War is hell and whatever the rights and wrongs of conflict you need a bloody good reason to wage war . Vietnam wasn't a good enough reason to sacrifice human lives """
"gigan-92","10","35","43","4 January 2011"," ""When I﻿ die, bury me upside-down, so the world can kiss my ass""
","A+ Undoubtedly one of the best war films ever made, if not one of the THE best films of all time. Where to begin with such a film? A lot of this goes to Oliver Stone, who actually served in the God-forsaken jungles of Vietnam. The film really brings to light the atrocities and pointlessness of the Vietnam War full force, all cleverly represented by the soldiers who fought these not so courageous and valor-filled battles.<br/><br/>The conflict is simple at a glance; Chris Taylor, played superbly by Charlie Sheen, is a young recruit who in a similar trait to the Civil War novel ""The Red Bade of Courage"" is naively eager to be a proud and loyal soldier fighting against Communism, as he believes, nobly. However, he soon finds that ""the 'Nam"" is nothing like he thought it would be. The Vietnam is portrayed as realistically as it will ever be here: as a chaotic, dark, and all to real nightmare. It is within this hell he realizes that there are only two ways to truly endure the war: Give into near animal instincts, discarding all morals and perspectives of decency or find ways to escape the war at least for short bursts. Taylor decides to choose the latter, but regardless the platoon is divided by these two choices, on one side being Barnes, who will let the war consume them completely. The other is Elias, who represents Taylor's last grasp to his humanity. Many choose one path and never turn away from it, despite the fact that many of these men will die regardless. The underlying conflict is how you spend those last remaining days, minutes, instances of life. And all along the Vietcong are just an outside force who the soldiers have no real chance of understanding or negotiating with , just one of the many hazards they will have to survive.<br/><br/>Tom Berenger is endlessly great as Barnes, and Willem Dafoe is no less stunning. Every performance is stunning and captures the very real fear of war. Among the many other stand out performances in this picture are Kevin Dillon as the sadistic Bunny, John C. McGinley as Sgt. O'Neill, Francesco Quinn as Rhah, Johnny Depp as Lerner, Forest Whitaker as Big Harold and Keith David as the unforgettable King. And the coup de grace, an unforgettable and heartbreaking score by the late Georges Delerue and Samuel Barber, such beautiful and yet clearly pained music. ""Platoon"" will never cease to be my favorite war flick ever."
"Vogue189","10","57","74","21 July 2001"," One of Oliver Stone's best films
","Platoon left me absolutely numb after watching it. Oliver Stone,(Who in fact did serve in Vietnam) did a fantastic job telling this story of the horrors and the insanity of the Vietnam war. What's to be admired about this film, is that Stone doesn't sweet-talk the story, with the good old American boys fighting for their country and facing brutality, instead he brings up a strong morality and humanity issue. It's wasn't all black and white, it wasn't one person was wrong, one was right, there was all shades of gray in between. He uses the characters of Sergeant Barnes and Sergeant Elias (both played brilliantly) as symbols of good and evil clashing into one another. Charlie Sheen (Chris, the narrator of the story) is in a sense torn between both, they are both a part of him as he tries to deal with things falling apart all around him. Vietnam was a senseless war, and Platoon tries to understand why we went through it and how we ever got through it."
"brown301","10","108","147","22 January 2005"," Best Vietnam War movie you can see
","Platoon is a must see for any fan of war movies. The film that put Stone on the map, Platoon is considered by Vietnam Vets as the most realistic (my father having been one of them). But in keeping the maxim of giving credit where credit is due, much of the success of Platoon belongs to military adviser Captain Dale Dye, who has been linked to pretty much every great war movie in the last twenty years. Much accolades to Tom Berenger as well, whose performance as Sgt. Barnes is the tour de force of his career (the scene in the village towards the end of the movie is brutal, befitting the character). With a great script, great performances, and awesome cinematography, Platoon is a surefire classic."

Surely after ""Saving Private Ryan,"" ""Titanic,"" ""Crimes and Misdemeanors,"" or ""Schindler's List"" I have seen a better film.  Well, after every viewing there is something about Oliver Stone's masterpiece that keeps me saying that I have never seen anything better.<br/><br/>I am a sucker for Vietnam pictures.  ""Apocalypse Now"" and ""The Deer Hunter"" also rank in my top ten of all time.  Stories about Vietnam can run the entire gambit of human emotions.  ""Platoon"" is not only a documentation of America's sordid involvement in a foreign civil war, it is also a dramatic story of human response.  A life developing in the most horrible of places.<br/><br/>There have been films put together better.  There have been films with more detailed and interesting plots.

"tomgillespie2002","9","14","16","27 October 2016"," Still packs a punch 30 years on
","Ever since Steven Spielberg wowed the cinematic world and changed the aesthetic of the war movie forever with the exceptional opening 25 minutes of 1998's Saving Private Ryan - the film went downhill from there - audiences have come to expect the same grainy camera-work and ultra-realism of Spielberg's breathtaking vision whenever a battle is depicted. Anything else would be 'unrealistic', and many movies dated horribly almost overnight as a result. While Oliver Stone's Platoon, which was once considered difficult to watch due to its unflinching depiction of the insanity of war, may not seem quite as brutal as it used to, it possesses one thing that no war other movie can boast - the guiding hand of a veteran.<br/><br/>Stone did a tour in Vietnam which ended in 1968, changing the future writer/director forever. Starting out life as a screenplay focusing on a soldier's experiences both before and during the war which had Jim Morrison touted for the lead, it evolved into a movie focused solely on a young volunteer's time spent in the sweaty, eternally damp jungle. Charlie Sheen's Chris Taylor is an obvious stand-in for Stone, and he arrives fresh-faced and eager to fight for his country. By the end, he is dazed and confused, and angry at the country who would send such ""bottom of the barrel"" men - invisible in society - into a world of such horror and meaningless bloodshed. It's an experience that moulded Stone into the one of the most outspoken voices in cinema.<br/><br/>The casting of the two sergeants vying for Chris' soul is a stroke of genius. The platoon is made up of two main groups - the 'juicers', a collection of beer-swilling meat-heads seemingly intent on violence at every opportunity, and the 'heads', a more laid-back and weary bunch who are happiest when getting high and having a singalong. At the head of the juicers is Sgt. Barnes, played by Tom Berenger, an actor known for his heart-throb leading-man roles but here cast as a dead-eyed, heavily scarred brute. While Willem Dafoe, who was and still is known for his crazy-eyed villainous roles, plays the wiser, gentler leader of the heads, an all-round good guy battling his own demons. By toying with expectations, Stone adds layers to their characters, and they both received Best Actor nominations for their efforts.<br/><br/>Yet what makes Platoon truly stand out 30 years after its release is the way Stone manages to transport the audience to that terrible place. It's teeming with dangers at every turn, be it the ants, the snakes or the Viet Cong better equipped for the harsh surroundings, the most frightening moment is when they fall asleep. And even when they awake, there's something moving in the shadows. The film never allows you to ever be at ease, despite the fun to be had with spotting the many famous faces dotted throughout the supporting cast. There are flaws, especially with some overacting from some of the supporting cast - in particular John C. McGinley - and Chris' unnecessary, rambling narration, but the movie packs such a punch that it's easy to forget these quibbles. It's a true insight into the mind of a grunt and how combat can have a lasting, eye-opening effect on those on the ground, and undoubtedly one of the most important war pictures ever to come out of the US."
"rex-10","9","24","30","17 July 2002"," Not just surface Violence (see book Tropic Thunder, Red Lightning)
","I may be over analyzing the film.  It certainly appears at first glance that other than the deer appearing after the battle, and the talk of soul in Chris's/Charlie Sheen's final narration there is very little symbolism in the film basically every thing is what it is.<br/><br/>However, I believe that even if Mr. Stone didn't intend it, the fact that Chris picks up an AK-47 to kill SSGT Barnes is important.  There are weapons (and bodies) all over the battlefield but he picks up the AK-47.  It must be noted that the Armalite Rifle or M-16 as it became known had become the weapon of the ARVN forces and the US troops (and is still the primary issue for US forces today.)  This weapon then, represents the `establishment' or the status quo power.  The silhouette of an AK-47 on the other hand, had come to represent revolution the whole world over.  Chris's use of the AK-47 was not to hide the fact that Barnes was killed by an M-16, as Bergerud's book points out, friendly fire' casualties were a fact of life in Vietnam.<br/><br/>When I combine the integrated `potheads' dancing to tracks of my tears,' I wonder if the tears are related to the civil rights struggle back home. Taylor's `I volunteered' speech when he gives his reasons that it shouldn't just be black kids and poor kids doing the s**t jobs' also add to my belief that the AK-47 is relevant as a taking up the opposition to fight the establishment.  Barnes also represented the `lifer' or career military and from there one can extrapolate that to include the Pentagon establishment who tenaciously clung to the belief in some kind of victory in spite of evidence that the population rejected the Saigon government could be had. By killing Barnes, it seems Oliver Stone might shed a different light on the comments Chris Taylor/Charlie Sheen makes at after the rampage at the village and the divisiveness it brought the platoon: `I can't believe we're fighting each other when we should be fighting them!'  In this view the Them' could be the establishment that created a world in which a Vietnam could take place.    His platitudes at the end don't dissuade me from seeing Chris Taylor (as Oliver Stone) having undergone a personal sea change. `We didn't fight the enemy we fought ourselves'<br/><br/>Stone could very well express these sentiments, `The war is over for me now but it will always be there the rest of my days as I am sure Elias will be fighting with Barnes for what Rhah called the possession of my soul... Those of us who did make it have an obligation to build again and try with what's left of our lives to find a goodness and meaning to this life.' `To teach others what we know'<br/><br/>This obligation statement is almost a verbatim reprise of the defeated Japanese soldiers in the movie `The Burmese Harp' (1956.)  They say the same thing about a duty to go home and rebuild after the war, though there isn't a statement accepting or even acknowledging any wrongdoing. Thirty years separate these films.  I would not exactly say they claim war is senseless,' though they both overwhelm the viewer with the senseless waste of lives caused by war.<br/><br/>Other points of note: when we see the APC (armored personnel carrier) roll up behind the patrol looking for survivors after the battle, there is a Nazi flag on the top of it (it is very close to the top of the screen and hard to make out, and is not the typical hakenkruz on the white circle in a red field, but the one that was meant to express a pan-Aryanism' with the Scandinavian people by having a red field with a black cross outlined by a white cross and the swastika in the crux.)  Is Stone implying a fascist nature to this war?<br/><br/>Secondly, we briefly see the men who are the despicable `ear collectors' I had read about in a 1981 book called `Nam.'  They would string the ears on their dog-tag necklace as a show of bravado of how many confirmed kills' they had.  (Though there are some interesting perspectives brought out by Nam' much of that book reads like war crimes)<br/><br/>The shot of the lynched soldier was a strange inclusion, considering the Blacks marching against the war at home carrying a banner that stated, `The VC never called me a nigger'.  I wondered why Stone did that.  Furthermore, except for a glimpse at a suspected VC in the tunnel shot by Elias, we never actually see a VC in the film.  The person shot by Elias is not attacking. We see their tunnels, the arms caches, their posts, campsites and bunkers. It's always only hints of them.  The only Vietnamese we see attacking are NVA regulars.  Is this saying Stone does not blame the popular Front forces for attacks on US troops?<br/><br/>`Gook' is also used through out the film, as it was in Vietnam.  This word entered the GI lexicon through the Korean War.  Han Gook' is Korean for Korea/Korean.  The Korean's would see the American's and say `Mi Gook' which is Korean for America/American.  The GI's thought the Koreans were saying they were gooks' Me Gook.  The carrying of the word from Korea to Vietnam shows the tendency of latent dehumanizing racism they all look alike'<br/><br/>
Speaking of Human, David Lynch, the director of The Elephant Man (1980) was furious that Stone used Samuel Barber's Adagio for Strings since he had used it in his film and hoped when people heard it they would reflect on it.  He must have sensed that people are now more likely to associate Adagio with the Elias crucified' scene.  However, there is another connection to the Elephant Man.  Think of Taylor stopping the gang rape.  The GI's respond, `she's an animal!' to which Chris shouts back, `She's a HUMAN BEING, man a human being!  This is an echo of John Hurt's line in Elephant Man, `I am not an animal! I am a human being! I...am...a man!'<br/><br/>There are a few more interesting points worth comment, but I will close by mentioning the suicide attack.  Stone himself was the actor playing the Battalion Commander in the bunker that suffered the suicide attack.  It is interesting that In response to the suicide attack, Captain Harris, the Company Commander calls in an air strike right on his own position.  In other words it is as though he answered the suicide attack with a suicide attack.  This seems analogous to the continuing inflow of US troops to Vietnam as a suicide.  I will leave it off here in hope that someone else discusses the intentional inflicting of wounds on oneself as a means to be sent home."
"asifahsankhan","8","12","14","2 February 2018"," Platoon focuses on the moral decay of the soldiers in the most unpopular war in modern American history
","Many great war films of the Vietnam conflict are centered around these themes of blurred morality and the uselessness of war, and Oliver Stone's Platoon is among the most well known. Stone, who wrote and directed the film and also served as an infantryman in Vietnam, first rose to fame for his war films that dramatized the infamous Cold War conflict. The main premise of his magnum opus are the inner conflicts within US forces deployed to southeast Asia, rather than the actual physical conflicts between them and the Communist-allied Vietnamese forces. More broadly, Platoon analyzes the ""duality of man"" concept that has been studied in numerous other works, from fellow Vietnam War films like Full Metal Jacket (1987) and Apocalypse Now (1979), all the way back to the latter's source material and inspiration in Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness. <br/><br/>Platoon focuses on the moral decay of soldiers in American units, and how this contributes to their inability to fight their Vietnamese enemies. Charlie Sheen sums up this theme with his on-the-nose voiceover, ""We did not fight the enemy, we fought ourselves... and the enemy was in us.""<br/><br/>Vietnam War-movies tend to be even harder to watch than most war flicks, as the lines between the ""heroes"" and ""villains"" are blurred more than in any other dramatized period of warfare in recent human history. In wars like World War II, which are widely known for being as black and white as military conflicts have become, the contrasting features between the heroic forces we are meant to root for and their opposing enemy platoons are well defined. That is almost never the case with the United States-North Vietnamese/Vietcong conflict in Vietnam during the overarching Cold War.<br/><br/>That is not to say that most wars throughout human history have not been many shades of grey, with the winners and losers not always corresponding with the righteous and evil. But because of the guerrilla nature and infamous legacy of the Vietnam War itself - namely, the immense public protest against American involvement - the Vietnam War remains by far the most unpopular war in modern American history. With that said, most of the film is fantastic, from the aforementioned narrative to the grim lightning of the southeast Asian jungles that emphasize the film's tone, to the poignant, melancholic score."
"WhimsicalVonia","8","12","14","10 November 2013"," An illuminating expose on the long-lasting, personality-changing effects of the military and war...
","I don't usually like war movies, at all. Platoon was an unexpected exception. Oliver Stone's first of three Vietnam War films, for me it really came down to an educational expose of the psychological trauma unique to war. With an all-star ensemble cast, the performances were exceptional. From what I have read, this can be attributed to training from a retired Marines Captain as well as director Oliver Stone's personal history as a Vietnam soldier. I believe Platoon to be an accurate representation of war on a micro scale, but not a macro one- any and all of these events could have and probably did happen at some time during the war, but it is unlikely that this much could happen between such a small number of men in such a short amount of time. The protagonist is played by none other than a young Charlie Sheen at his prime. Taylor's words of wisdom throughout the film are a testament to the long lasting effects of war. Veterans have a stereotype personality: more often than not, someone more logical than emotional; a lover of order, rules, and regimen; individuals willing to sacrifice for the greater good; a cool, collected, logical decision maker and leader even under high-pressure circumstances. As with all stereotypes, it is rooted in truth. Studies have shown that individuals attracted to the military tend to, overall, be a little less agreeable, extroverted, and friendly than those who do not seek it out. One study in particular finds them to be ""more aggressive"", ""interested in competition rather than cooperation"", and ""less concerned about the feelings of others"". These particular personality traits, whereas obviously not so great for romantic relationships or for forming lasting friendships, are often an asset in career success. For example, these individuals are more likely to make the difficult decisions sometimes necessary for success. <br/><br/>Psychologists claim that our personalities do not change dramatically over the course of our lifetime. Interestingly, the military is one of the only exceptions to this, as various research has shown. An exception, though, that couldn't be more understandable. After all, what one experience is more immersive, uncompromising, and invasive? A prominent aim of military training is to disseminate your preconceptions, views, and outlook of the ""outside"" world. They want to, literally, break you down and build you back up as a soldier. The aggression, the rules, the logical coolness of higher-ranking officials? Not only welcomed, but expected. If you cannot handle yourself under pressure, cannot brace yourself for both physical and emotional war, you will not survive training, let alone deployment. Ironic, then, isn't it, that once a soldier signs his/her contract, they are bound to their word for the next several years? What if he realizes he is too sensitive? She realizes she hasn't the strength, either emotionally and/or physically? At some point, it's just too damn bad. In this way, individuals are often forced into an extreme situation; unexpected, life-altering, and personality-changing. <br/><br/>After the all-immersive experience of military training, an individual has had to harden themselves even more; close off their emotions in order to endure trying physical tests and emotional assault from all angles. And if they are chosen to actually go to war? Well, I am certain that the personality shift will only be that much more ingrained. Once they return home, it's easier said than done to just smoothly transition back to who they once were, how they once responded and reacted to life. And Taylor is no exception to this. <br/><br/>It has been a while since I felt so moved watching a film, in both positive and negative ways. Scenes depicting the cold, ruthless killing of others, friend or foe. Empathizing with soldiers wishing to be killed or injured in order to be sent home. Taylor trying to save some young Vietnamese girls from being raped by his own men. Imagining the psychological trauma of watching people you yelled at yesterday, got high with last night, bonded with this morning, die in your arms. The palpable loneliness of these men, writing home to their loved ones, or even as they vie for the any emotionless type of physical intimacy. Watching Taylor transform from a positive, optimistic young man wanting to do the right thing for his country into an old soul, enervated and jaded, murder becoming a daily occurrence rather than the unbelievable nightmare it should always be. In the penultimate scene before he is rescued, Taylor serving personal justice in taking the life of the heartless Staff Sargent Barnes. <br/><br/>So, I wonder, is it any surprise that soldiers return home that much more emotionally closed off, their minds almost accustomed to the idea of everyday trauma and constant panic, with an inability to open themselves up to others or allow themselves to succumb to emotional weakness?"
"Lt_Coffey_182","8","32","44","23 January 2006"," Shows the harsh realities of war very effectively
","The Vietnam War has been one of the controversial wars in history and was an unpleasant experience for everyone involved. Oliver Stone harnessed these experiences to make Platoon; a film where he could illustrate to everyone what Vietnam was like from his perspective.<br/><br/>In my opinion, this is the best war movie ever made. The sheer horror of war is captured so well in everyway. The fear of death, compatriots dying, divisions in the platoon, guilt of killing; it's all there and Stone doesn't try to disguise it. Platoon is very honestly written and it is this honesty that makes the film so great. Platoon isn't an anti war movie and it certainly does not glorify war in anyway, it is simply how war is in its entirety. There are some shocking scenes such as the one in the Vietnamese village but there are also more light hearted moments such as where the troops on Dafoe's side are partying and having a good time. On base camp, there is great contrast with the mood but on the forest, it is just fear, aggression and blood, nothing else.<br/><br/>Taylor's (Charlie Sheen) story is very good as he experiencing war at the same time of the audience. Before the war, he was a rich kid who loved his grandma and it is how war changes him that is truly fascinating. The character story that always receives most praise however is that between Barnes (Tom Berenger) and Elias (Willem Dafoe) is very compelling and leads to some great scenes with them and carves an interesting divide within the camp. This film is big on character and explores many relationships but (take note Jarhead) doesn't sacrifice any action time for these scenes. Stone struck a perfect balance between action and story.<br/><br/>Acting from everyone involved is very good. Sheen as the naïve newcomer is very good and after this, should have done much better for himself than he did. Dafoe and Berenger, once again steal the attention off the lead. Their extreme contrasting personalities is brilliantly done and raises the standard of the film. Berenger is truly terrifying, he didn't hold back in this one. Dafoe is much more sympathetic and will speak his mind to anyone. Johnny Depp makes one of his early film appearances with a small, yet memorable role. The way Sheen is wearing Depp's bandana after Lerner (Depp) gets taken by the chopper is discretely done but touching.<br/><br/>Platoon is the best war movie there's ever been. Stone wrote and directed this film with such passion that it couldn't be anything but good. A great mix of characters, a great cast and such well crafted action scenes are all what you need for an exceptional war movie and they're all here. The film ends perfectly as we are given a chance to reflect and take it in before the credits start rolling. Stone, who often misses the point with his films, hit the nail on the head with this one."

","This certainly rates as one of the best Vietnam films of all time. What I especially enjoyed was the realistic atmosphere of the film, entrenching the viewer into a world which seems surreal yet believable. Oliver Stone's real-life experience in Vietnam brought a gifted outlook to this film, one drawn by experience, not common Hollywood conventions. While this proved be a lesser film to the equally amazing Full Metal Jacket, it was not by much. The performances by Tom Berenger, Willem Dafoe, Charlie Sheen and John C.

","""Platoon"" was my first introduction to wartime reality.I was just a kid when first viewing it and the film left a powerful impression in me.Before that,I had only seen a couple of Rambo films and thats what I expected to get here,pretty much.It turned out to be something quite different from that,although it would take me a few years to realize just how different.<br/><br/>""Platoon"" is Oliver Stone's breakthrough picture and a landmark in Hollywood history of the 80's.It features almost every well known actor on the rise from that era,most notable ones being Forest Whitaker,Johnny Depp,Willem Dafoe,Francesco Quinn and Charlie Sheen.<br/><br/>Why is it a landmark film?It helped to bring more understanding into the hot issue of Vietnam war,although ""Apocalypse Now!"" had already worked out that subject in the most stunning way.Yet there was still something left to say for Stone.It was pretty much the same as Coppola said,but in another,more harrowing and less complex way.We got a closer glimpse of how it is to die,for one.Dafoe's heroic end is one of the most dramatic scenes in history of war films.<br/><br/>A strong issue here is the abuse of military codes and discipline.Tom Berenger's sadistic,disturbed sgt. Barnes is the perfect example of a warrior playing god,or angel of death, and fighting a war by his own rules.Berenger plays Barnes so well that it really gives you the chills watching him and you want him dead.Sgt. Elias is his counterpart in every way,as he really cares for his men and is in touch with the human in him always.<br/><br/>He is not popular among the lowlifes like the redneck psychopath Bunny (great early role by Kevin Dillon) and the spineless racist O'Neill in John McGinley's incarnation.<br/><br/>Another spineless character is the young lieutenant,who on one hand is a greater sinner than Barnes.He has no control over the men under his command whatsoever and refuses to take responsibility or even feel the guilt for not doing anything to prevent the massacre of the village committed by Barnes and his butchers.Here we see the effect that the horrors are having on private Chris,as he in a fit of frustration and anger over the situation he is in tortures a sick and frail creature of a man and ends up in tears.Its a powerful and riveting scene which highlights the film's message against war,showing its inhumanity and absurdity in the most shocking way.<br/><br/>The final battle is very brutal and well shot.It sums up the whole Vietnam war and the strategy of the American army.The napalm kills not just the Vietcongs but also Americans.Ironically,it saves Chris' life as he is about to be killed by Barnes during their confrontation.Bunny gets what he deserves and Junior,who is the most despicable of the black characters here,also dies.This may be seen as director's own judgment.The only other sympathetic character still alive by this time,the underground lord Rah, is left alive.Francesco Quinn shows here that he is capable of taking over his father's legacy.<br/><br/>In the end,this film is not flawless,but it is a perfect document of the madness that occurred in Vietnam 1964-73.And its consistent to its very end,which by the way is very touching and almost made me cry the second time I watched it.It is funny how one can feel both happy and sad about leaving a war torn place.Such are the feelings that a war conjures up in a man.It is almost like Chris was sad he was leaving,or maybe the emotions that were bubbling under surface just came out for real.<br/><br/>Any which way,this film will always be remembered as the one that gave a true and unpolished picture of mankind at war at a time when Hollywood producers made an attempt to glorify the US army and cast an eclipse on its disgraceful stain,transforming the killing into culture.Ironically they succeeded.8/10"

","The movie is about a young man (Chris Taylor), who in his efforts to find out his place in society, decides to enlist as a volunteer in the American army, during the Vietnam War. Chris, at the beginning, faces a lot of difficulties concerning his survival in such a cruel and harsh environment. While he is beginning to acclimatize, he has to deal with important ethical issues that come along with his more active involvement in the battles with the Vietnamese. Two men, Sergeant Gordon Elias and Sergeant Robert Barnes, are the two voices in Chris' head, just like the little angel and the little devil flying over our shoulders, that shape him and his moral code throughout his stay in Vietnam and stigmatize him for the rest of his life. Oliver Stone in a masterful manner in this movie, demonstrates the alienation, caused by such a bloody war, to those who wage it, whether they are high rank officials or just a private. The movie is a cry for the poor youth of his country, that was wrongfully wasted in this war, but also for the civilians, who are the ones who suffer the most by the hands of the two sides fighting this war. A very strong cast of actors, who all give their best selves to succeed in passing through the message the director was trying to send with this exceptional movie, but the point of interest, as far as acting is concerned, is Tom Berenger's powerful performance."

Including a realist and thought-provoking dialog plenty of profanities , bad taste , sexual remarks and dealing with foreign intervention . Wooden acting by Charlie Sheen as naive soldier , it made a star out of Sheen and Stone cast him in his followup film : Wall Street .

","Though I'm not a war movie fan, I thought Platoon was a solid film.<br/><br/>Oliver Stone did a great job at directing, with perfect shots especially during the combat scenes. Great cast, but you can only admire Sheen's performance as the rest of the actors is a bit in the background to me. Now on the other hand, I felt the movie could have used some extra dynamic script-wise, because even though it is a good storytelling, it is a bit linear.<br/><br/>I rated Platoon 7/10, because I'm not fond of war films, but I have to admit it is a solid one that conveys emotion especially through Sheen's character."
"goreilly40","9","8","10","29 April 2016"," Brutal but honest.....
","Of all the war movies I've seen, this is probably one of the most honest and non-romantic depictions of the 20th centuries longest war I've seen. Its a hard movie to watch but its meant to be as it shows the war for the hell it really was, its authenticity cannot be praised enough thanks to Oliver Stone's personal experiences that he went through when serving in the war. The actors put themselves through a tough boot-camp in order for an accurate portrayal and it showed, they didn't have to act exhausted and weary as they genuinely were. Charlie Sheen's depiction as the naive bright eyed college kid who joined up for romantic reasons, but quickly learns the harsh realities of the war is one of the more memorable. likewise Tom Berenger and Willem Dafoe as two battle hardened but morally very different veterans are also very memorable. The fighting and battle scenes again are unforgettable and accurate and the show just what the American solders were up against and how slippery and how hard the NVA and the VC could be to pin down. One aspect of the movie which I found refreshing was it didn't attempt to picture the Americans as angels, it showed that they could be no better or sometimes worse than the enemy they were fighting. Now in comparison with Full Metal Jacket, this movie is no better or worse, as it depicts a different aspect of the war than this movie, this movie depicts the type of fighting the soldiers had to do before the Tet Offensive, jungle warfare, where-as Full Metal Jacket depicted urban warfare in the Tet Offensive. So if you want an non-sugar coated, accurate and authentic portrayal of the Vietnam war, then this movie is for you."
"MartinHafer","10","9","12","9 January 2010"," Thoroughly unpleasant viewing...
","This is a very, very hard film for me to review. I was too young to be in Vietnam (thank God) and I have no idea what the real Vietnam War was like. Was it like John Wayne's THE GREEN BERETS? I am sure it was not! But, was it like PLATOON? I just don't know. Did the soldiers in the war do drugs, kill civilians and run amok? Yes, but whether or not it was the norm (like it was shown in this film), I just can't say. Some Vietnam vets I've spoken with say this film is accurate, others say it over-emphasizes isolated incidents because it has an agenda. I just don't know, especially since director Oliver Stone does have problems, at least in some films, with fictionalizing events (such as in JFK and Alexander). Regardless, it is a very powerful film.<br/><br/>Unlike FULL METAL JACKET, this Vietnam War film begins in Vietnam. The film opens with Barber's ""Adagio for Strings"" providing an appropriately somber and dirge-like musical introduction--newbie Charlie Sheen arrives as body bags are being loaded into a plane. This is the perfect music for the intro, though I must admit that later in the film it is overused just a bit--losing some of its impact.<br/><br/>The film revolves around young Sheen and the men serving with him--soldiers on the front lines and in the middle of the action. Over time, the whole reason for them being their and their humanity all comes into question. This struggle is epitomized in the two sergeants. One, Tom Berenger, is a bit nuts. He's willing to break the rules, kill civilians and become an animal. The other, Willem Defoe, is an equally skilled soldier but cannot allow himself to give in to his darker side. This all comes to a head when Berenger and several others viciously kill several villagers--villagers who could easily have been completely innocent and certainly did not deserve this. When Defoe swears to file a report about this, you know that eventually there will be a serious confrontation between these two men. However, it's Sheen who eventually finds himself in the middle--and you are pretty sure that it will be him or Berenger that must die. Yet, there is STILL almost an hour left in the film! The final hour is one of the most harrowing in film history. It consists of one hellacious firefight after another--culminating in a battle along the Cambodian border that ultimately kills off most of the men in the platoon--and further dehumanizes the survivors. For sheer violence and terror, I can't think of another war film that can even come close. It's practically non-stop and will keep you on the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>So what did I think about the film? Well, watching it was certainly among the most unpleasant experiences I have ever had! The extreme violence, the pointlessness, the horrible language and the drugs were all pretty awful and didn't make this a film for little kids, that's for sure! But, you certainly must admire it for the intensity and realism you lack in many films--traditional war films that make war seem fun or manly. You certainly can't watch this film enjoy it--and that really is a good thing when you think about it.<br/><br/>So, for a film that shows war in all its awfulness, you can't find one quite like PLATOON. Once again, I can't attest to the voracity of the portrait of the war, but for a vision of what war can be like, it can't fail to have a huge emotional impact. My only quibble, and it is minor, is that Charlie Sheen seemed a tad young in his role--so much so that I had a hard time accepting him as a soldier among all these men."
"TheMovieDiorama","9","7","9","9 March 2018"," Platoon is so much more than just your average war film.
","This is actually rather intelligent, both in its plot and technical execution. It's the Vietnam War, we follow a platoon of US soldiers as they attempt to wipe out the enemy. The question that this film raises is: who really is the enemy? You have the conflict of the war itself (America against Vietnam) but within the platoon is a conflict for authority. Split between what is right and what is wrong, the moral implications of this war have taken effect on several soldiers as they question their choices. This was a smart element to include within the plot, it was easier to establish character development and build some tension. The majority of the characters were sufficiently developed and their personalities had charisma. This was mostly down to the great cast. Willem Dafoe was easily the best performance, Tom Berenger was also decent and the heated chemistry between them was well conveyed. Charlie Sheen however, didn't work for me. His acting ability consisted of monotonous dialogue delivery and shouting, perhaps he was overpowered by the rest of the great cast? I don't know, just felt meh. Didn't help that his biggest battle was with nature...we're talking ants, leeches and other insects. Obviously, animals love abit of Sheen. Oliver Stone's direction was solid, very realistic and gritty. The makeup effects were practical, the wounds and blown up limbs looked pretty damn realistic. A standout scene was the raiding of the Vietnamese village. This was the turning point where actually the American side were perceived as the antagonists, clearly communicating with our inner moral compasses. Effective, very effective. This is easily one of the best war films I've seen and winning Best Picture was fully justified."

","... and for good reason! Platoon is a unique war film in that it almost plays out as more of a morality tale and the inner conflict that eats away at the insides of man rather than focusing primarily on the conflict with the enemies. In Stone's film, we are given in-depth examinations into both the atrocities of the war and those committed by the Staff Sergeant supposedly on the 'good side' of it all. Played to perfection by Tom Berenger. his terrifying portrayal of a heartless Sgt. becomes all the more frightening when contrasted with the compassionate, caring nature of Sgt. Elias, portrayed by William Dafoe. The film is unapologetically outspoken in its depiction of the horrors soldiers faced in the war and with razor-edged editing that nabbed Academy Award honors, it really does immerse you, almost uncomfortably so, in the hell these men endure. One of the best."
"Red-Barracuda","6","20","32","1 June 2015"," Pivotal at the time but hasn't aged as well as some other Vietnam films
","Platoon is the film that not only put director Oliver Stone well and truly on the Hollywood map, its huge critical and commercial success also would set the Vietnam War film cycle into hyper-drive. It centres on a platoon on a tour of duty in Vietnam through the eyes of a young recruit who quit college to volunteer for active service. It is in essence a combat film where the view is at ground level. In this sense it mixes traditional gun battles with the smaller more personal details that show the discomfort of life in the jungle. Its approach was very realistic for its time and in some ways it did reinvent what a war film could be.<br/><br/>While it does have many scenes of combat action, they are pretty messy and unglorified and the film has a pretty clear anti-war message. This is conveyed in quite a major way by how the platoon itself is portrayed. It's divided into two camps led by two diametrically opposite sergeants Barnes and Elias (Tom Berenger and Willem Dafoe, respectively). The former is a facially scarred, violent man, while the latter is a morally sensitive borderline hippy. They show both sides of the American thinking about the war, with Barnes and his alcohol drinking followers the ugly brutal side of the coin and Elias and his marijuana smoking buddies the ones who question the participation of their country. This dramatic tension is brought fully to the fore in the pivotal moment of the film where the platoon commit mass murder and rape in a village, in a nod to arguably the most infamous real event in the war, a massacre at the village of Mai Lai in 1968.<br/><br/>The dramatic conflict, while being the real meat of the film, does look quite overly simplistically done to my eyes now, with the evil Barnes and his bevvy merchant bad boys set against the hippy-like Elias and his chilled-out troops. It comes across as too black and white. It gets the message across but it does so with little subtlety or grey areas. I think Platoon overall, has aged a little worse than some of its contemporaries like Apocalypse Now (1979), Full Metal Jacket (1987) or Casualties of War (1989). This is probably a lot to do with Stone's overly politicised message, while the classical music which soundtracks the grimmest moments probably felt original at the time but now almost comes across as, dare I say it, a little cheesy. The film benefits somewhat from having quite a good cast, some of whom are actors who would go onto big careers, although in truth future mega star Johnny Depp makes absolutely no impression whatsoever in his minor role as a translator.<br/><br/>All-in-all, Platoon is still an impressive combat film but it's one which for me has not aged too great in other ways. It still has historical importance as a key entry in the sub-genre though."
"Mr-Fusion","9","5","6","26 August 2016"," ""... we did not fight the enemy; we fought ourselves""
","""Platoon"" is hardly an obscure movie, and I guess the reason it's taken me so many years to finally see this is - I dunno, you see enough war movies over the years (not to mention having seen ""Full Metal Jacket""), how affecting could this actually be? That's a stupid reason, and the joke's on me; ""Platoon"" is devastating. This is probably as anti-war as they come, and that it's partly somewhat autobiographical just gives it more punch.<br/><br/>I don't think I've ever seen a movie of this type that really emphasizes the dehumanizing effects of war. Charlie Sheen's fall from wide-eyed grace isn't so much heartbreaking as it is tremendously dispiriting. And putting him between two opposing symbols of embittered soldier (Willem Dafoe and Tom Berenger) makes for a clever storytelling hook. I really don't want to give away any spoilers, but when one of these lead actors is killed, it is deeply sad.<br/><br/>This one absolutely lives up to the hype.<br/><br/>9/10"

The veterans over there went through very little sleep and had to go through fear almost every parts of the day. I personally did not go in the Vietnam war but from what I heard this is the most realistic movie of what happened in Vietnam. The ambush scene where Taylor is just waiting in fear with his hear pounding that the Vietnam soldiers would not see him. I also love the final battle scene it had lots of action and was very intriguing. When Elias was running from the soldiers was a very emotional scene. Charlie Sheen was magnificent along with Forrest Whittaker, Willam Defoe, Tom Berenger, and others. Taylor had to witness murder, rape, and injustice by his fellow soldiers or as he put it ""he couldn't tell what was right or wrong anymore. It was truly grew and I highly recommend it."
"FilmOtaku","7","25","45","21 September 2004"," A personal and gut-wrenching look at the Vietnam War
","Oliver Stone's 'Platoon', which he wrote and directed, is partly based on his own experiences in Vietnam. Our protagonist, Chris (Charlie Sheen) is an idealized kid from a privileged family who feels it is his patriotic duty to enlist, and therefore is one of the lone volunteers in his platoon, headed by the badass Staff Sgt. Bob Barnes. (Tom Berenger, looking even more badass with a deep gash in his face that runs from forehead to chin) Somewhat acting as Chris' mentor is Sgt. Elias Grodin (Willem Dafoe), and the two provide (in the most rudimentary sense) good and evil influences as Chris experiences the every day horrors in the jungles of Vietnam; from the irritating  bugs, inclement weather, to the terrifying  combat with the Vietcong, to the gut-wrenching  the ruin of a Vietnam village, mostly innocents.<br/><br/>I thought that 'Platoon' was a good film  it is obviously a film made before Stone's highly stylistic period (which he still appears to be in), and is instead a fairly straightforward film about the horrors of war. Sheen was decent as Chris; he managed to believably convey innocence as well as hardness without falling into cliché. Berenger was pretty brutal as Barnes, but it was Dafoe who I was most impressed with, (though his talent is obvious throughout his many roles, he still has the ability to amaze me. This was obviously a very personal film for Stone, and I think that he conveyed his message of 'War is hell', 'War kill innocence' effectively. <br/><br/>There were some moments where I was incredibly disturbed, mainly the scene in the village. I found that I couldn't stop crying during this scene because it was just so terrifying, and unfortunately very true. 'Platoon' doesn't give us any new insights on war, but it also doesn't prescribe to clichés either. It is a solid and well-done film that does not glorify the war experience, nor does it preach. I would certainly recommend this film to any war-film lover, but it also has enough of a storyline to hold the attention of most other film lovers as well.<br/><br/>--Shel"

"dataconflossmoor","10","8","12","7 February 2008"," This Is His Trophy!!
","Recently, over the last few days, I will have commented on a triumvirate of Oliver Stone movies. ""Platoon"" is considered his greatest movie ever!! I thought it was extremely compelling!!! ""Platoon"" won the academy award for best picture in 1986, and, Oliver Stone won for best director for this film that year as well!! I would have to say that my favorite Oliver Stone film is ""Talk Radio""... With regard to all of Oliver Stone's movies, ""Platoon"" is the most critically acclaimed, hence, this is his trophy!! ""Platoon"" deals with the laborious tragedies of the Vietnam War, and how one horrifying conundrum had the ability to vitiate so many soldier's sense of naivety!! While the vast majority of Americans were reticent to criticize the United States involvement in Vietnam, they also did not have the clairvoyance to envision the idea of how we as a nation would get so involved with such a sustained and prolonged occupation in this archaic nation (Vietnam) either!! The precarious political agenda of our constituency on Capital Hill cultivated an intransigence with worldwide decorum, as well as with the wishes of the American people!! This movie is an incredibly astute depiction of how some young soldiers became victims of congressional blundering!! A war should be fought for national cause and not for political agreement!!! The movie ""Platoon"" articulates an uncanny ability to purvey a moral dissonance with the unfortunate plight of so many Americans during the Vietnam War!! Oliver Stone is once again very cunningly successful at depicting human atrocity to it's ultimately dire and absolutely abhorrent level of socially conscious pitfalls!! The acting in this movie is spectacular, the actors include, Tom Berrenger, Charles Sheen, Johnny Depp, and John McGinley!! AFI ranks ""Platoon"" as one of the top 100 movies ever made in the American cinema world, and, this website ranks it amongst the top 250!! YOU MUST SEE THIS MOVIE!!! IT IS FABULOUS!!!!"

"Screen_Blitz","9","4","5","7 April 2016"," Thoroughly brutal, but effective portrayal of the Vietnam War
","The Vietnam War is a conflict that garnered tremendous controversy as many condemned the war as a futile and lead to what people called needless lost of thousands of American lives. The purpose of the war was to the fight against communism, a long going threat occurring during the decades of the Cold War. Director Oliver Stone who was a Vietnamese War veteran himself makes a brutal, but utterly effective portrayal in this war drama based on his experiences in the Vietnamese battlefields. Charlie Sheen plays Chris Taylor, a young man in his late teens who drops out of college and voluntary for active duty in Vietnam. With no combat experience compared to the other men in his platoon including the hot-tempered Staff Sergeant Robert Barnes (played by Tom Berenger), the more kind- heart Sergeant Elias (played by William Defoe), the aggressive and ruthless Lieutenant Wolfe (played by Mark Moses), and fellow African-American Big Harold (played by Forest Whitaker); Chris faces the dehumanizing effects of the war and the moral dilemmas of men in active combat as the platoon fight their through the grueling environment and atmosphere of the Vietnamese battle front.<br/><br/>War is ugly, and this movie certainly shows it. Shooting the film in the Phillipines which serves as an authentic backdrop of wartime Vietnam, Oliver Stone uses his experiences in active combat and puts into grueling prospective, giving viewers on a haunting and gritty taste of the horrors and atrocities that ignited during the years of active duty in Vietnam. From the bloody and gruesome combat sequences, to the deteriorating psychological health of the fellow soldiers, to the loss of innocence in humanity in the characters; Oliver Stone pulls no punches when expressing the reality of what the deadly conflict overseas was like with convicted realism and powerful emotions. One scene in particular features a raid in the Vietnamese village where members of the platoon, Lieutenant Wolfe in particular torture innocent civilians and the way they treat these civilians is an eye-sore and quite unsettling to watch. Most importantly, it shows the psychological impact on Charlie Sheen's character and his fellow comrades and they become robbed of their moral compass. It is a real powerful issue that goes on in active combat today, soldiers overseas are pitted with not only their desperate feat to survive and protect their country but dealing with their ethical sense. The story focuses not exactly active combat itself but the effects it has the soldiers, and the story progresses through how the main character changes as person, a character who you come to care about. Charlie Sheen gives an incredible performance, easily one of the best if not the best roles in his career. And let's not forget William Defoe, an actor who isn't well known for placing good guy roles, yet manages to show pure charisma and humanity in his character; and Tom Berenger as Sergeant Barnes, a soldier with a cold heart against the both his comrades and the Vietnamese.<br/><br/>Platoon is brutal, violent, and quite disturbing to sit through, but it is very effective and honest in portraying the horrors of the Vietnam War. Oliver Stone does a tremendous job on capturing the brutality of the hellish environment of active combat. His directorial efforts pay off and the cast is outstanding. This movie would make a great pick for anyone in the mood of a powerful war flick."
"miRaCuLouS26","10","4","5","6 June 2015"," An unique experience about the effects of war
","This is my first review on IMDb - Hope you find it helpful <br/><br/>Oliver Stone's career speaks for itself to anyone interested in what this man has to say. His view of the U.S. politics and his realist touch is present in any of his films (and screenplays, look up Scarface-1983). So, when talking about this director, it's either you love him or you're not interested in his message. But he has voice, he has the raw energy and the impulse to make a change, be it social, political or in the film industry. <br/><br/>""Platoon"" is a very personal movie. Simply put, it's a must watch. The reasons for me saying this are : I am very fond of war-movies placed in the 20th Century since all the major conflicts of the modern era created the world as it is today, and you will find this one to change your perception about the Vietnam-War that you thought you knew; if you want to see Charlie Sheen's best portrayal of his life you might want to check out this movie; there are a lot of young actors (at the time) in incredibly convincing roles; you have Willem Dafoe and Tom Berenger as opposite archetypes; you have intense fight scenes with an outstanding cinematography; the movie is filled with likable characters and even some funny moments and, to top it all - there is compassion, realism and a true sense of revelation through insight present in the story! <br/><br/>The fact that the director himself was a soldier in Vietnam (his first film - in 1971, is about his experience) provides a knowledgeable geometry of feelings about the subject - War in all its vast, vicious and vulgar ""splendor"". The good guy Chris (Sheen's character) is transformed by the horrors he witnesses, by the people he meets and most of all, by the decisions his fate seems to have taken for him - to be a part of this infernal conflict that seems to consume the spirits of everyone involved. <br/><br/>This is a movie best watched alone, for you to analyze it in detail and to allow it to ""leave its mark"" upon your perception, because that is what it does. I would compare it to ""The Deer Hunter"" or ""Full Metal Jacket"" in its nerve-shattering effect of how a man, noble in thought and kind in action, is a participant in an abominable, absurd yet absolute conflict that will forever change his universe. <br/><br/>For a mature viewer, with plenty of time to digest and discuss it, ""Platoon"" is one of those rare films that show us the true extent of our violence, vanity and visceral impulses. Man cannot conquer the world if he can't even conquer himself. <br/><br/>I give it a 9.8 out of 10. Enjoy!"
"The Grand Master","9","4","5","17 March 2015"," Hauntingly excellent movie on the Vietnam War which will stay with you forever.
","Platoon was a deserving winner of 4 Academy Awards including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Sound and Best Editing. It was a shame it didn't net more Academy Awards. Charlie Sheen, Tom Berenger and Willem Defoe are brilliant in their respective roles. Platoon was also notable for being the first film about the Vietnam War to be written and directed by a Vietnam veteran.<br/><br/>Based on Oliver Stone's experiences in the Vietnam War when he served in the US Army, Platoon is told through the eyes of Chris Taylor played by Charlie Sheen. Chris Taylor is an idealistic and naive college dropout who enlisted in the US Army to serve in the Vietnam War. When he arrives in Vietnam, he is worn down by the exhausting and terrible conditions and his enthusiasm to serve in the Vietnam War wanes. Chris Taylor also narrates his thoughts and feelings via letters to his Grandmother. Taylor also meets Sergeant Barnes and Sergeant Elias, two Platoon Sergeants with contrasting personalities. Tom Berenger plays the battle scarred, world weary, callous and bad tempered Sergeant Barnes, and Willem Defoe plays the compassionate, caring and free spirited Sergeant Elias. The platoon is led by the fresh faced and inexperienced Platoon Commander Lieutenant Wolfe (Mark Moses) who struggles to assert his authority over the battle hardened platoon yet it is shown that the men look up to Sergeant Barnes as their leader. Taylor meets a variety of soldiers in his platoon including the cowardly and sycophantic Sergeant O'Neill (John C. McGinley), Bunny (Kevin Dillon), Junior (Reggie Johnson), King (Keith David), Rhah (Francesco Quinn), Big Harold (Forrest Whitaker), Lerner (Johnny Depp), Crawford (Chris Pedersen) and Francis (Corey Glover). The personalities vary from compassionate, good-natured and affable, to angry, ruthless and sadistic. Taylor finds himself conflicted when the horrors of the war take its toll and following a raid on the village which many villagers are beaten, killed, and raped, Taylor and the platoon find themselves taking sides with Sergeant Barnes and Sergeant Elias.<br/><br/>Charlie Sheen puts in an unforgettable performance in one of his early movies as Private Chris Taylor. You can't help but feel that he is channeling his father Martin Sheen who previously starred in another Vietnam War movie Apocalypse Now (1979). Charlie Sheen has been embroiled in numerous controversies recently including his (in)famous falling out with the producers of the TV series Two and a Half Men in 2011 and appearing in highly publicized interviews displaying his bizarre behaviour and stating his catch phrase ""Winning!"". Controversies aside, many people forget that Charlie Sheen was brilliant in Platoon.<br/><br/>Tom Berenger was previously known to play very likable characters but here he deserved an Academy Award nomination for his role as Sergeant Barnes, a man who refuses to be killed in the Vietnam War. Willem Defoe who made his mark frequently playing villains was also very memorable as the likable and compassionate Sergeant Elias.<br/><br/>It was also great to see Johnny Depp (Pirates of the Caribbean), Forrest Whitaker (The Last King of Scotland), John C. McGinley (TV's Scrubs) and Kevin Dillon (TV's Entourage) in early roles.<br/><br/>Oliver Stone who previously wrote Midnight Express (1978) and Scarface (1983), made his mark as a director with Platoon which saw his career skyrocket with hit movies such as Wall Street (1987), Born on the Fourth of July (1989), The Doors (1991) as well as controversial movies JFK (1991) and Natural Born Killers (1994). Oliver Stone hasn't had the same success in recent times with the mega flop Alexander (2004) and mixed success with World Trade Center (2006), W. (2008), Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps (2010), and Savages (2012). Platoon is definitely his best movie to date as a director.<br/><br/>Platoon's theme song Samuel Barber's Adagio for Strings has been permanently imprinted into my memory. Although Adagio for Strings has been heard frequently on film and television, it is a perfect theme for Platoon which sums up the bleak and depressing outlook of the Vietnam War.<br/><br/>Platoon is an excellent though bleak movie that shows the horrors of the Vietnam War and soldiers as flawed human beings which will stay with you forever. Platoon definitely shows Tom Berenger, Willem Defoe and Charlie Sheen at their finest and Oliver Stone's best movie as a director. Platoon earns its spot as one of the best war movies of all time right up there with Saving Private Ryan (1998), Black Hawk Down (2001), Full Metal Jacket (1987), and Apocalypse Now (1979).<br/><br/>9/10."
"videorama-759-859391","9","4","5","2 May 2014"," Vietnam, as frank as you can see it, without the gloves
","Yes, it was the Vietnam movie, in a trilogy of three, ala 1987. What I read about it, and seen briefly through, clips, yet when I went into the cinema, I still yet was disappointed, but respectfully it is a great film. I just expected more realism, I guess. The opening is haunting, and leaves an imprint in the memory for those who would of seen it. Told through the eyes, of a school dropout Chris Taylor (Sheen, very good), who sighed up for the Nam, we follow his eye opening journey of hell, how with fresh eyes, how it perceived, the terror of Vietnam, no holds barred. Granted, there are some really tense moments in Platoon, concerning Charlie, the enemy, one indisputably tensely charged scene, with Sheen on watch, where he's in close proximity of them. Another scary moment had a gentle humble, Sergeant Elias, wonderfully played by Dafoe in still one of his best performances, going into a bunker underneath which is like cavern where he explores it, with a little bit of company. Of course, it's Berenger's show in the life of the story and his performance, as stout hearted and uncompromising Barnes, the head Sergeant, running the other platoon, where he butts heads a lot with adversary Dafoe, and in one shocking moment towards the end, Not only with this whole outfit fighting the enemy, both platoons are fighting each other. I couldn't stands Barnes's platoon, that partly consists, of a fawning type, John Mcginley who went on to become a very and sought after commodity as character actor, while Kevin's Dillon's borderline psychotic Bunny, will live on in my mind, probably, secretly, one of the film's best performances. As in Casualties Of War the death of innocents related to the enemy are again, sickeningly disregarding, as in court marshaling, brushed under the carpet stuff. Ironically the same actor who sided with Penn and his boys, in this, he's the other way intent, on seeing, this unlawful killing by Barnes goes to trial, if proved. The scene with Bunny in the tent, was sickening, though the violence was implicit here, where he was smashing the brains of a gook civilian's head in with the butt of his rival, splots of blood, staining Bunny's face. Platoon, with a crafted script by Stone and A grade performances by it's actors, is a film to see cinematocally, the photography is excellent and does work. May'be I really got carried with the realism aspect of the film, but it's still a pretty real and effective that will scar the memory years after seeing it. For a war film, trying to win an Oscar as best film, is war itself. This was one that did."
"Michael_Elliott","Null","4","5","17 August 2012"," Depressing and Raw
","Platoon (1986) <br/><br/>**** (out of 4) <br/><br/>Oliver Stone's Oscar-winning Vietnam film has a new soldier (Charlie Sheen) arriving in the jungle not fully knowing what to expect and for the next year we follow his platoon as they lose one man after another. I really don't think PLATOON is one of the greatest films ever made and I'm not certain I'd even place it among the best films of the decade but you have to admire a war film that doesn't try to be manly or fun. This is one of the most depressing, dark and somber films you're ever going to see about the war and I think this is its strongest aspect. It's even more raw when you know that Stone went through this stuff and is basically sharing his memories of what it was like serving in Vietnam. I wasn't even born yet so I'm not going to sit here and say which film most realistically captured the war but when I hear people say this is the closest it's easy to see why. Stone's direction is certainly the star here because he really makes the viewer feel like they were in a platoon and there's no question that the director gets his points across without preaching. The film is ultra intense during certain scenes and brutally sad in others and especially during a scene where villagers are attacked and we're not even sure if they're guilty or not. The entire thing does make you wonder why such violence was needed and if it accomplishes anything. Of course, looking back on the film today you are amazed at how many great performers are here. Tom Berenger, Willem Dafoe and Sheen are all excellent in their leading bits but we get terrific support from the likes of Forest Whitaker, Keith David, Francesco Quinn, John C. McGinley, Kevin Dillon, Tony Todd and Johnny Depp. PLATOON isn't a fun film to watch but then again should a film like this be ""fun"" to watch?"
"Dennis_Cooper","1","50","111","12 May 2002"," Cartoonish Portrayal of the Vietnam War
","Platoon is to the Vietnam War as Rocky IV is to heavyweight championship boxing. Oliver Stone's story of the experience of a US Army platoon in Vietnam in 1968 is so overdone it's laughable. While most or all of the occurrences in Platoon did occur over the 10+ year span of US military involvement in Vietnam, to portray these things happening to one small group of men in such a short time frame (weeks) gives a horribly skewed picture of the war. In Platoon, the men of the platoon see all of the following in the course of a week or two: US soldiers murdering civilians, US Soldiers raping civilians, a US Sergeant murdering another US Sergeant, a US Private murdering a US Staff Sergeant, US soldiers killed/wounded by friendly fire, 90%+ killed or wounded in the platoon. For Stone to try to pass this film off as the typical experience of a US soldier in Vietnam is a disgrace. Two Vietnam War films I would recommend are We Were Soldiers (the TRUE story of arguably the worst battle for US soldiers in Vietnam) and HBO's A Bright Shining Lie."

","It takes a master filmmaker like Oliver Stone to find real beauty in chaos. The two are of course polar opposites, and yet the talented director fuses them in a movie that is both haunting and amazing.<br/><br/>I saw this film two years ago when I was only fourteen. Usually I wouldn't make personal comments in a review, but I think its important to understand what effect this movie had on me. I was young and knew that I wanted to be a filmmaker but it was this film that really encouraged me to make movies. I was spurned on by the artful camera-work, brilliant screenplay and dynamic acting that, as clichéd as it sounds, really created an unforgettable screen experience.<br/><br/>The movie still haunts me. Despite scenes filled with drug abuse, violence and an overall sense of menace, there are some moments which speak volumes to us all. There's an attention to detail usually lacking in war films: characters actually sound like real people instead of cardboard cuttouts.<br/><br/>All in all this is a movie I'll never forget.<br/><br/>Watch it and you'll see what I mean."

The horror of war was not evident in this movie, only the horror of ham performances. Constant screaming, lots of blood and profanity are no substitute for good acting. Defoe's character is shot twice almost point blank by Berringer and yet he manages to survive and stagger around, one assumes this is Stone's attempt at dragging emotion out of his audience, although the emotion was humor and not sadness. These actors can be grateful that they were so young at the time of the movie and can use that as their excuse."

"ding50","1","52","125","6 January 2001"," Another lie from Oliver Stone
","I'm both amused and disgusted by the people who claim that this movie is so accurate about Vietnam, and WERE NEVER THERE. This movie is about as true about the whole Vietnam war as the Rodney King beating is true about ALL police officers. Yes, bad things do (and did) happen, but in general the people there are just like you and me. They have morals, they are not killing machines, they do not all do drugs. Atrocities were the exception in Vietnam, not the rule. They happened far more infrequently than the ""hype"" would lead you believe. Oliver Stone has a knack for making movies that show the Vietnam war as this brutal bloodbath, but are based as much in reality as Star Wars. If you honestly believe the stereotypes of Vietnam, do yourself a favour and learn the truth. Fact: the Viet Cong and NVA did far worse things to the South Vietnamese than ANY soldier in the US Armed Forces ever did. Fact: the soldiers in World War II treated the enemy far worse in general than the soldiers in Vietnam did, and they were WELCOMED when they came home. The fine Americans who served this country in Vietnam deserve our respect; though the war was badly fought from a political standpoint, no one could have asked for more from our soldiers, and it is a great disservice to assert that this kind of ""mostly true"" fiction is the way things really were there."
"Goon-2","2","15","30","29 October 1999"," Can a film BE any more overhyped?

This film is the epitome of a sub-par movie and I practically feel as though I'm being polite for saying so, considering the numerous flaws this one has. The acting is okay, but nothing more than that, the characters are dull and the ""heroes"" are beyond non-sympathetic, the script lacks depth, and the ending is terrible. Why people can pan a fine movie like ""Limbo"" for its ending and not this is beyond me. I've never seen such a terrible message given, but what can you expect from a movie where the heroes bond during a big drug circle? Even the film's one really good scene(where they're in Vietnam and freakishly shooting just about anybody) literally goes nowhere. I think it was merely supposed to reflect the 'goodness' of Captian Elias and the monstrosity of Tom Berenger(pathetically the most interesting character), or something, but who knows, considering nobody in the movie is even mentioning anything about it 10 minutes after it happened, though one would have thought it was supposed to be a great plot twist? That, along with a ""shocking"" scene where a helicophter flies away, leaving an important character behind(so ridiculously done that I couldn't help laughing aloud)and this is real ""Best Picture"" fair alright. What a taint to the Academy Awards."
"buzzerbill","1","26","58","13 August 2001"," Pretentious twaddle
","Not much to say about this film, which I detested on first sight and which has not improved over time.  Oliver Stone is a film maker of great technique--unfortunately, since technique substitutes for other virtues such as intelligence and balance.  At this best (in, say, JFK) Stone achieves a kind of demented grandeur--you can't possibly take it seriously (unless you believe in UFOs, the theory of Atlantis, and the Bavarian illuminati), but it's geat fun.  Platoon is glumly allegorical and depressingly schematic. Good=black, takes dope.  Bad=white, drinks beer.  Spend your time on the few great Vietnam films--Full Metal Jacket and Apocalypse Now."

"Verbal-20","1","32","78","21 January 2000"," Did I miss something here?
","It's ridiculous to compare Platoon to Saving Private Ryan, and idiotic to say that the former is better than the latter. Nevertheless, I will compare the two, if only to counter some of the more ridiculous user comments written on this site. <br/><br/>Ryan has a far better-written script than Platoon. Its storyline isn't all over the place (Platoon seems to take its group of soldiers and put them into every single situation faced by Americans in the Vietnam war, which is okay in concept, but not done too well here). Ryan's has a path and moves smoothly and interestingly from one event to the next.<br/><br/>
Next: The combat sequences. I consider myself open-minded, but I have to seriously doubt the intelligence of ANYONE who says that in this category, Platoon is better. It cannot possibly be--Platoon is simply too low-budget. The visual effects are unconvincing (don't tell me those explosions look real) and the sound (which won an Oscar!) ranges from tinny to annoying.<br/><br/>
And what's up with the tiny platoon? When we get to a lot of the combat sequences, there are hardly any soldiers. It's like there's Barnes and a handful of American privates. For that matter, the problem of not enough soldiers (was this supposed to be a WAR, or what?) exists on BOTH sides. Ryan outmatches Platoon not only in terms of intensity but in terms of scope as well, showing fights between large groups of soldiers, which made it look... REAL. Platoon makes a false promise to put you in the war. I've seen street gangs with more members.<br/><br/>And to anyone who says, ""Oliver Stone was there. He fought in Vietnam. He knows what he's showing,"" just please stop. STOP. All you know is hearsay. Just because someone served in the war doesn't mean they saw everything that happened in the war, now does it? I guess Oliver didn't know that the Vietnamese frequently strapped time bombs to their own children during this war, then sent them out to American soldiers, who were promptly blown up because they couldn't shoot a child.<br/><br/>Where am I going with this? Well, a lot of the things that happen in this movie make no sense, and a lot of people will think they know something and say Stone must be right--after all, he went through it. No one platoon could have seen all the events (combat and otherwise) that this one does. It was like Stone was putting the platoon through the whole war in a week. Stone didn't see everything that they did. Not by half. The result is that Stone is directing what he DOESN'T know, what he DIDN'T see, which is, in part, why a lot of the movie doesn't make sense. An objective viewer will look at this movie and see a whole bunch of parts that are just plain stupid. (And the cinematography's not that great, either)<br/><br/>In addition, I'm really put off by the fact that this movie makes monsters out of the Americans and heroes and martyrs out of the Vietnamese, showing only the atrocities committed on our part and none of theirs. Didn't we enter the war because the people portrayed as innocent townspeople (and badly camouflaged soldiers) invade South Vietnam to put the populace under dictatorial communist control? We came there to save them and WE'RE the bad guys? If Stone were making a truly objective film, he'd show what crimes the Viet Minh and Viet Cong committed against us. This movie isn't anti-war, it's anti-American.<br/><br/>On a positive note, the acting is great, the good cast masking the inadequacies of a thinly written script that brings forth every possible kind of conflict with the flimsiest of segues between them. And the music is truly beautiful, unlike the overall film. I do not lambaste it because it's disturbing (my favorite movies include Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan), but because it's unconvincing. Best Picture? I wouldn't give this Best Picture over anything short of the 1998 American Godzilla movie."
"ccthemovieman-1","3","25","59","4 May 2007"," Typical Oliver Stone Bias
","My thoughts on this film are very, very similar to those written by ""Hill-1"" except he was a little more tactful than I would be regarding Oliver Stone's famous Liberal bias. ""Hill-1"" also speaks from experience from being an infantry soldier Vietnam, and I cannot say that.<br/><br/>I like a good war movie but I was tired of Oliver Stone's left-wing propaganda films so I waited until the '90s before finally seeing this on VHS. He didn't disappoint me - it's biased and very profane, which is what I expected. It also had excellent acting by the two leads, played by Tom Beringer and William Dafoe and some stunning jungle photography. I didn't have to be in Vietnam to know the horrible conditions those poor guys fought under. <br/><br/>The action scenes were not credible in that, as Hill-1 points out, guys would have been killed doing the things they do here, such as some of Martin Sheen's actions. I rooted for the infantrymen, of course, but I didn't appreciate Stone's (and Hollywood's in general) typical stereotypes of showing a gung-ho solider as the bad guy and the more pacifist-type as the good guy. It'so so clichéd. I also think it was a horrible cheap shot, and a typical one of elitist Liberals, to portray almost all soldiers as the lowest class in American society. John Kerry did the same recently, calling the American soldiers in Iraq not the brightest people. This is normal name-calling by Liberals like Stone, and it ruins me enjoying any of his films.<br/><br/>You want an intense Viet Nam war movie without all the bias? Watch ""We Were Solidiers."""

","Even if you never heard of this movie, chances are you know its theme song a lot. Oliver Stone's best picture winner Platoon is very dramatic real and sad. It shows the real side of the Vietnam War in movies, which started in the late 1960s just as US Troops started getting hammered during the second longest war in US history. It was the second Oscar win for Orion, which continued to dominate until Silence of the Lambs won and made Orion bankrupt until MGM revived it as a full time studio."
"Joe X.","10","3","4","27 April 2019"," Classic War Movie
","In Platoon, Stone brilliantly accomplishes what he set out to do: to show the viewer what it would be like to be a new volunteer on the front ""line"" in Vietnam. By the time Charlie Sheen goes out on that first night ambush, I was totally immersed. I felt his fear and isolation. I was scared to death for him.<br/><br/>Sheen's character becomes less isolated, but he still can't trust everyone. I can't think of a picture that examines the divisions within a unit like Platoon does. Fear and distrust and tension are woven throughout the film. When I watched it the first time, I couldn't ever really untie the knot in my gut.<br/><br/>After repeated viewings you notice how Stone adroitly gets so many characters into the mix. He's got 23 soldiers (by my count) with lines, and almost all of them are fleshed out a little. The stars were great, but Stone gets fantastic performances from the whole cast (and many little-known actors, some of whom gave up acting). It's a remarkable ensemble.<br/><br/>Repeated viewings reveal some flaws, of course, but compared to what this film achieves, they are minor. There are a few operatic moments which I was willing to indulge the director because of his ability to create such an intimate look at a soldier's experience of war."

the screenplay which talked in a really great way about the characters with their fools and the main characters feelings with fears the way it was chosen to say how it was really hard the fluence of the war on them in not traditional way showing the real loses they made to them selfes their in Vietnam and the great lesson was out of it<br/><br/>About acting I liked the characters in movie and how they were fools in things and good in things asshols in too many things but I really liked Tom Berenger in his character more than any one and Willem Dafoe was good too also Charlie Sheen as he was the main character and was the greatest written character in the movie he was really great<br/><br/>
In the technical side the film editing was awesome was impressive was good for battles scenes<br/><br/>Cinematography made great work by taking difficult shots in the woods with giving a great fearing soul to the movie<br/><br/>
Oliver Stone did really a great job in this movie by making the greatest thing in every side for making the movie as he has a bad thing about doing some not good points but I guess I liked his work here I think I'm gonna like to watch more movies by him in the future"
"vinylvanilla","10","3","4","10 March 2019"," A masterpiece with timeless philosophical meaning
","I don't know how I've lived without this movie until today. It was released the year I was born and it spoke to me as if it was fresh and new. This is definitely Oliver Stone's masterpiece, and my respect for the director only increased right now.<br/><br/>In Platoon, we not only see the horrors of the Vietnam war - we see a brutal and honest portrait of the many war crimes the American army committed, how millions of Vietnamese civilians were murdered, how entire millenarian villages were decimated and how, in the end, this is one of the most ignorant, gratuitous, unwarranted and pathetic wars of all times - aren't them all?<br/><br/>But although all these facts already make Platoon one of the greatest movies of all times, surprisingly, they are not what make it a masterpiece. The real geniality in Platoon is to raise philosophical questions about the relevance of war and the duality of humankind - with its flawlessly constructed and complex characters, we see that nobody is entirely bad or good, and we also see that sometimes morally condemned acts will be justified by opportunists as an ""unnecessary evil"".<br/><br/>Technically speaking, the movie is impeccable. A 2-hour-long war movie that feels like it lasts only 30 minutes, because tension and action is maintained at their peak the whole time, and you don't want to blink to miss anything. Edition is something to be acclaimed as well, because the war scenes were absurdly difficult to be filmed and yet in a multidimensional environment which is a battle camp scene where everything happens simultaneously they managed to show everything that was happening without confounding the audience - all scenes were explicit, clear and understandable. Everything had a point or a reason to be shown.<br/><br/>Needless to say, this is the quintessential Willem Dafoe movie. I have always thought he is one of the greatest actors of all times and he's terrible underrated. I now am very sorry for the fact he didn't win any relevant award for this performance - few actors could deliver the emotion and the charisma he delivered only with his eyes and his body language. I have to say the same thing about Tom Berenger - that acting was the work of genius - and yet both Tom and Willem were nominated for an Academy Award and neither of them won, in the year when Platoon won for Best Picture. Charlie Sheen and Forest Whitaker also shone as well - it's absurdly refreshing to, every once in a while, to watch a movie in which the ENTIRE CAST can actually ACT and do a great job.<br/><br/>As if this movie didn't have enough qualities, cinematography is another undeniable quality of this capolavoro - the green palette in the entire movie highlights the blood and the human expressions amid the horrors of war - and beautiful and iconic scenes (such as the one portrayed in the movie poster) were filmed in such a gorgeous way that they will certainly be in my mind forever. I have never seen aerial shots done so masterfully like I did here.<br/><br/>Platoon is neither a horror show or a gruesome war movie - you won't see a blood battle here, though the battle scenes are relevant. The point of the movie is, fortunately, not to shock the audience with blood or mutilated limbs - the aim of this work is to startle us with the horrors of human nature - and how apparently normal people can hide monsters that will be only released in the right conditions.<br/><br/>There were scenes halfway into this movie that made me cry in desperation and lose my breath like any other movie could. To think that events like that happened in real life only made me feel even more miserable and question how exactly humankind evolved throughout the years. Are we really civilized? Are we actually becoming a better species? Oliver Stone, with his brilliant plot and direction, created a masterpiece who will be imprinted in our minds not only as the portrait of one of most terrifying genocides of all times - his work will resonate as the fire that stirs philosophical questionings about the true meaning of life, humanity and morality. Unfortunately, when we watch this work of genius we realize the world hasn't changed much since then. That says a lot about what kind of humans we've become. That proves how relevant this movie is today - and it has impressed my mind and heart like only very few movies could.<br/><br/>May God bless the souls of whoever died in those very dark times."

","Continuing my plan to watch every Johnny Depp movie in order, I come to Platoon (1986)<br/><br/>The first of Stones Vietnam trilogy. Stone wrote the screenplay based upon his experiences as a U.S. Infantryman in Vietname to counter the vision of the war portrayed in John Waynes The Green Barets. Platoon was the first Hollywood film to be written and directed by a veteran of the Vietnam War. Stone fought for years to get this movie made. Studios didn't want to make another movie about the unpopular war and considered Deer Hunter and Apocolypse Now as the definitive Vietnam movies, and saw no reason to make this.<br/><br/>This really is harrowing viewing, but it's not only the best movie of 1986, its one of the best of the decade.<br/><br/>This movie reminds us, that before he became a tabloid fodder and punchline on late night talk shows Charlie Sheen was once a very promising young actor. His voice-over is eerily reminiscent of Martin Sheen in Apocolypse Now. Willem Defo, Tom Berenger (both playing against type and both Oscar-nominated) John C. McGinley, Kieth David (an actor I always enjoy seeing on screen) and Forest Whitaker are all superb. <br/><br/>The part of Sergeant Barnes was originally offered to Kevin Costner. Although pretty unknown and a few years away from fame, he turned it down because he didn't want to disrespect his brother, who was a Vietnam veteran. <br/><br/>Depp (his helmet reading, ""Sherilyn"", a tribute to Sherilyn Fenn, whom Depp was dating at the time) is OK, but he fades into the background against the bigger performances, despite a key scene.<br/><br/>Not only did Platoon win Best Picture and Best Director for Stone, it grossed $138 dollars at the domestic box office to end 1986 as the 3rd highest grossing movie of the year."
"Aly200","9","3","4","3 January 2017"," The Best Vietnam War Film Ever Made
","Oliver Stone brought his first-hand experience as a Vietnam veteran behind the camera in what is arguably his magnum opus. Crafting a gripping and haunting film that brought out the nightmares of the horrors of war, Stone rightfully won his first Oscar for Best Director as well as Best Picture. <br/><br/>Telling the tale of a ragtag platoon of soldiers from the perspective of newbie infantryman Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen) about the atrocities of the war and how it affects each of the core players; the film's major players are all based upon people known by Oliver Stone during his service.<br/><br/>The pivotal role of Chris Taylor was based on the director himself; a college drop-out eager to serve his country, but soon realizing how horrifying war really is and thus must become a stronger man and no longer a frightened boy among men. Charlie Sheen is perfectly cast as Taylor and is able to be sympathetic despite his naivety. The character of Chris Taylor is silent for the majority of the film except for his voice-overs and rare exchanges with his comrades. Sheen boldly develops his character deftly from the fresh-faced novice frightened by what he sees, moments perfectly captured in the night watch scene and the village raid, to a hardened young man who is no longer afraid to act in a brutal fashion as evidenced in Taylor's final encounter with Tom Berenger's brutal Sergeant Barnes at the end of the film. <br/><br/>Providing the film's greatest internal conflict is the constant power struggle within the unit between Tom Berenger's arrogant and brutal Barnes (Berenger scored a nomination for Best Actor) and Willem Dafoe's peaceful, tactful Sergeant Elias (Dafoe was nominated for Best Supporting Actor). The differences between the men show the display of how war affects the once able-bodied souls who go to serve; Barnes representing a hardened, violent and quick-to-act soldier unafraid to turn on his own, particularly in the horrible moment where he ambushes Elias, while Elias represents the passive face of what is to come with war, but this does not mean the sergeant won't strive to serve and protect his unit. <br/><br/>Caught in the middle of the sergeants' warring spar is Sheen's Taylor. As Taylor states at the film's end, ""Still fighting for what Rhah called 'the possession of my soul'"", this thought echoes Chris's own turmoil for how he must choose to act: forceful and cruel like Barnes or with discipline and heart like Elias. As the film's events steer to the dark actions the group takes, the rage boils deeper within Barnes and Elias until it reaches a fever pitch and the two men fist-fight which eventually leads to Elias's iconic death scene. The outcome can only turn out one way by the time Elias is heartbreakingly slain before the platoon's and viewer's eyes: someone must pay.<br/><br/>This isn't the easiest film to watch, but the topic of the war in Vietnam is important and not forgotten. Keep tissues nearby and prepare to be enraptured with this magnetic gem."

","This is one of the best movies of 80's, and one of the strongest, most influential movies ever made. I was very young when I first saw it and it had a very strong, moving influence on me that have stayed to this day. I saw it today again, it was a while since last time, but I'd never thought it would move me, shake me and still have such a strong influence on me still today as hardened and weathered as I am today. It really depicts the hell on a personal level as few war movies has ever done since. It is a movie that has an educational value for each and everyone today that has an interest in what war does to a human being and the scars it leaves on both sides, and shows the hell like it really is. In that way it is really understandable why it was so controversial and shook the establishment as it did when it released. Many of the famous actors we see today basically made their real debut in this movie and it is interesting in that way too. Tom Berenger and Willem Dafoe are spectacular as the two main adversaries of the story, and each and every one of the cast portrays their characters in a great way. If you have any interest in modern history, war and how it affects people this is a must see for anyone, not least the younger generations that wants to know about the pain and hell real war really is.

This film is also excellent on a much deeper, metaphorical level. Upon multiple viewings, it becomes apparent that Elias represents Jesus Christ (good) and Barnes represents Satan (evil) which creates a whole new level of interest in the film.

"sandnair87","9","3","4","20 December 2015"," Platoon is a Film of Inspiring Empathy and Implacable Force!
","There are no grandstanding heroics in Oliver Stone's 'Platoon'. No back-patting reassurances that the Vietnam War was ever remotely considered a noble cause. This film is an act of courage. Stone, the gutsy writer-director, records in a devastating barrage of images the relentless horror and the senseless carnage experienced by far too many Americans in Vietnam. The movie is, in fact, so emotionally powerful that you can practically feel the same gnawing fear that can bring out the savagery in the most decent young men. Platoon, to a large extent, is a replay of his own harrowing, wartime experiences - Stone was a medal-decorated former ""grunt"" who served with the 25th Infantry in Vietnam.<br/><br/>From the very first shot - where newly arrived troops recoil at the sight of body bags being loaded onto their returning plane - you plunge directly into a blazing jungle inferno. The film is structured as a Dantesque descent into hell, following the progress of a young foot soldier, Chris Taylor (a commendable Charlie Sheen), as he penetrates further and further into the blind terror that is his experience of the war. Chris, as Stone himself was, is a well-to-do college dropout who volunteered for Vietnam out of a sense of patriotism and a vague desire to prove himself as a man. He's expecting a WWII movie; what he finds instead is a nightmare. It's a war where there seems to be no master plan, no big picture and no advances. There is only terror, bone-deep exhaustion, nighttime patrols and the humid jungle, crawling with snakes, insects and the silent Viet Cong. This is, unquestionably, what Vietnam must have felt like to the foot soldiers.<br/><br/>The movie, with its hallucinatory, nightmarish visual quality, captures the moral confusion and the increasing disintegration of soldiers who escape by getting stoned together. This mercilessly intense movie is definitely not for the faint of heart. The atmosphere remains highly charged from beginning to end. There's no letup, nary a suggestion of humor to break the tension. It's not unlike an Indonesian shadow play in the sense that the evil god, scar-faced Sgt. Barnes (Tom Berenger, his face a road-map of scars, extremely dynamic as the fighting machine), collides head-on with his moral pole- a heroic God fearing man, the disillusioned Sgt. Elias (Willem Dafoe making a strong impression). There are images in Platoon so powerful that they seem, rather than simply imprinted on celluloid, to have been burned into memory. This bold combat movie projects Vietnam with such ferocity that no one can ever doubt that that war was indeed anything but a living hell.<br/><br/>Decades later, Platoon remains an intriguing blend of the political and the personal, with Stone turning his memories and his opinions about Vietnam into a potent drama. Platoon continues to be lauded as a film of inspiring empathy and implacable force!"
"Tweekums","9","3","4","28 September 2015"," Oliver Stone's view of the Vietnam War
","This film follows Chris Taylor from the moment he arrives in Vietnam until he leaves. He was a college student, so didn't have to fight, but he thought it was wrong that it was the poor kids being forced to serve so he enlisted it isn't long before he questions that decision. Nobody wants to know the new guys and they are seen not to matter. As time passes he becomes accepted in the group but at the same time it becomes clear that there are deep divisions within the platoon with those half behind Sgt Barnes, the brutal but effective platoon leader, and half behind the more sympathetic Sgt Elias; these tensions deepen when Elias reports Barnes for a war crime committed in a Vietnamese village; Taylor will have to choose his side if he is to survive the conflict between the two sergeants as well as numerous fights with the North Vietnamese Army.<br/><br/>Writer/director Oliver Stone isn't trying to explain the war; he is trying to show us the war from the point of view of ordinary infantry soldiers the generals may be fighting for an overall cause but these poor grunts are just trying to survive their year in Vietnam. He brilliantly captures the fear and confusion of war in the jungle where one moment soldiers are worrying about insect bites and the next they are in a fire fight. These fights aren't shown as exciting; they are confused and bloody and when people are hit they are shown to suffer rather than dying silently. The film doesn't shy away from showing the dark side of war as we see soldiers murdering Vietnamese civilians. The division within the platoon seems like a metaphor for the divided opinions of people about the war at the time. The cast does a great job; Charlie Sheen puts in his best performance as Taylor; our guide to the life of US soldiers in that war. Tom Berenger and Willem Dafoe also excel as Sgts Barnes and Elias; the former is particularly frightening as a character who is almost evil incarnate at times yet at others seems like the man who is keeping his platoon alive. The rest of the cast, which includes several people who went onto bigger roles, do a fine job making all the varied characters believable. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to anybody interesting in films about war; just don't expect gung-ho excitement; this is gut-wrenching and very tense and if you enjoyed this check out the less well known 'Hamburger Hill'."
"estebangonzalez10","9","3","4","27 June 2015"," Stone's personal experience during the Vietnam War
","""I think now, looking back, we did not fight the enemy; we fought ourselves. And the enemy was in us.""<br/><br/>If all war films were as good and sincere as Platoon it would probably be one of my favorite genres, but there are very few exceptions where the material is treated right as most directors tend to either be incredibly biased debating either in favor or against the war. It's strange I make this claim since Platoon is obviously an anti-war film, but it treats the material with an honesty you don't find in other films of the genre. It is much easier to make a statement like this in a war that everyone considers was a terrible mistake to get into. What Platoon has going for it however, is that it was written and directed by a man who actually served in the Vietnam War and decided to share his experience of what really was going on. Oliver Stone handles the material with incredible honesty not shying away from the horrors and senseless deaths in war and he delivers a film that never feels sermonizing (with a few exceptions). Even the villains (not the Vietnam soldiers, but the dubious Sgt. Barnes and his band of brothers) are portrayed with some sort of empathy. Platoon isn't actually a film that focuses on war between Vietnamese and American soldiers, but rather the civil war that was going on inside the mind of these soldiers that Stone fought alongside with. He wasn't afraid at pointing out who the real enemy truly was and for that reason the Vietnamese soldiers are barely portrayed in this film. It seems that with Platoon, Stone was able to cope with the effects that the war had on him and the result is a passionate and sincere film. <br/><br/>In the very opening scene we are introduced to Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen) as he has just been deployed to Vietnam and is arriving at the war zone. He narrates the film through voice-over as he is writing letters to his grandma informing her about the war. Unlike most of the soldiers, he wasn't forced to go to the war, but volunteered after giving up on college. During the first few weeks he is struggling to keep up with the pace of war and no one seems to care too much for him since he's the new kid who hasn't yet been exposed to all the carnage they've experienced. Chris is currently serving two noncommissioned officers who couldn't be more different from each other. On the one hand there is scar faced Sgt. Barnes (Tom Berenger) who seems to have been in the war forever and on the other there is Sgt. Elias (Willem Dafoe) who is much more lighthearted and easy going. Both are experts at war who know they are fighting with unexperienced soldiers. When a village raid gets out of hand both Sergeants take opposite sides and the platoon is divided between those who support Elias and those who take Barnes's side. Evidently the war has taken a toll on all these men and some begin to question their very participation in it when they realize the enemy is inside each of them. There are also supporting performances from Johnny Depp, Forest Whitaker, Kevin Dillon, and John C. McGinley who are all in the platoon together.<br/><br/>There is no denying the emotional buildup during the scene of the village raid and Johnny Depp's face says it all during one of the killings that takes place there. It is one of the most intense scenes I've seen in a war film. The performances in this movie are what stood out for me. Charlie Sheen is great in the lead role, but it is the confrontation between Berenger and Dafoe that truly stands out. Both deserved their Oscar nominations despite not winning, but Platoon still took the top honors for Best Picture in 1987. My only complaint with the film perhaps was that it didn't really need the voice-over narration from Charlie Sheen. Stone could've had enough faith in the audience and let them see what he wanted to say with the images alone and not spoon feed them with the narration. The excuse for its inclusion is that he is writing his grandmother, but there are things as the movie goes on that are evidently thrown in there so the audience could understand what he was thinking. It's just a minor complaint because his character was still the easiest to identify with. The score and the cinematography are both effective and they enhance the horrors portrayed in this film. Platoon still manages to have an impact almost thirty years later and that is why it is a classic.<br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"

The score has served it's purpose of providing dark, serious atmosphere and combined with the voice narration of Sheen who has dialogs that hit right in the feels , this movie is a must. It's not just the acting and the dialogs that are moving but the story itself is touching. With characters struggling to cope up with this new found freedom, they inch closer and closer to insanity each passing day. The war has turned some into maniacs as it titillates their darker propensities of those, exposing their inner demons which, in turn, gave birth to animistic behavior like raping children , killing innocents as a 'revenge' and burning down villages . And they enjoyed doing it. Not a feeling of guilt, not a single regret.<br/><br/>The question that haunts me is after the war, those lunatics who survived , what did they do with their lives? How did they adjust back to the society? Well, what i think is that most of them ended up in the streets as those homeless , drunk , vets that are found so much in abundance in the States. States."

The violent battles show the soldiers getting transformed into killing machines after many frightening experiences and close calls they have. The movie both looks and sounds amazing. I really like the film's score. When it's played, it really helps us get immersed in the scenes due to the notes and beats in it. Sure, some of their choices of actors are a bit questionable like putting Charlie Sheen in an emotional role but I didn't seem to mind it that much because they played the roles with such great emotion and power that it didn't seem to bother me. This is a great war film and it will be remembered throughout the ages. It's unforgettable, violent, sad, and moving."

","Platoon is loosely based on real life situations that writer/director, Oliver Stone went through when he was in the Vietnam War. This is also parallel to Francis Ford Coppola's 1979 masterpiece, Apocalypse Now. I'm going to start out by saying that I found Apocalypse Now to be a much better flick. Platoon is practically the same story with everything inferior, which is why I'm not giving a perfect score. When compared, Platoon is inferior. Even when not compared, this movie gives a great sense of deja-vu. ""Haven't I seen this before?"" Both movies are about a Sheen enlisting in the Vietnam War and transcend into madness and insanity while partaking in the horrors of war. Apocalypse Now has Martin Sheen on a mission to assassinate a demigod while Platoon has Charlie Sheen's mental state wearing thin after a massacre occurs. Apocalypse Now has build-ups and gets somewhere with the plot, and has an overall better look. Platoon is certainly not bad. Heck, it IS as good as everybody says. It won Best Picture and Director of 1986, but I think Aliens should have won one of those.<br/><br/>I think that any war movie is a great movie. Think about how it takes the action sequences to do and make-up to put on. Platoon's action sequences are excellent. But what makes Platoon the extravagant film that it is, is it's accurate depictions of life in war. While movies like Rambo made war seem fun and cool, Platoon was back to reality. The whole idea of transcending into madness is shown so well by all and is always relevant.<br/><br/>4/4"

","It was rather too long, personally. But when I think about plot, it seems that every scene was necessary. Perhaps, this is the reason why some scenes were cut with Johnny Depp. Actually, was really painful to watch it, because there were some inhumanely cruel scenes. But this is reality, history. And it's very good that director and actors did their job fantastically. Not unnecessarily rating is high. I don't really like films about war, but there are two good things about it. When this genre of film is appointed for war heroes, it's really very nice. It makes me to pause and think about those people. Second thing - I love facts. And facts were in this film. Chosen music ,of course, revealed mood. This movie made me to be tense. To be quite honest, I have never watched a film about war. ""Platoon"" was the first. But now I know how should look good film about war. One more thing, that scene with thunder was amazing, it gave me the shudders. I really was empathized. My heart bit together with characters' hearts. Plot is full of stress, it's very complicated and tense, it shows the reality, as I said. Also, was sad and tearful to see how brutally soldiers behaved with those poor Vietnameses. Actually, I always said that Charlie Sheen isn't good actor, because after ""Scary movie 5"" he looked ""to cheap"" for me. But I changed my mind. Now I think that he's really very good actor. ""Platoon"" and Chris Taylor from the film changed my mind once and for all. I gave 9, because film was rather too long for me."
"Vartiainen","Null","3","4","12 July 2014"," Brutal war story
","Platoon has the honor of being the first Vietnam War film made by an actual Vietnam War veteran. Director Oliver Stone based the film on his own experiences in the jungle and the end result was one of the most bleak, violent, unforgiving and brutal war movies made by then.<br/><br/>The film might also contain the best performance from Charlie Sheen we've ever seen. Chris Taylor is an innocent American youngster freshly recruited into the war effort, forced to grow up quickly within the terror of the battlefield. He's also torn between two man, the sergeants of the company, played by Tom Berenger and Willem Dafoe. Theirs is a private war of ideals and ways of surviving. Both are amazing soldiers, but whereas Dafoe's Elias still holds onto his ideals, Berenger's Barnes is ready and in reality rather willing to do what it takes to finish the mission and survive.<br/><br/>And from those story elements we end up getting a harrowing journey through the battlefields, hardships, loss and Pyrrhic victories. Platoon shines because of its non-compromising tone, its actors, its intensity and its vision to tell about the war through the eyes of someone who's been there. It belongs to the elite of war movies for a reason and is easily recommended."

"brando647","8","3","4","18 April 2012"," A Powerful Vision of Vietnam from Oliver Stone
","PLATOON is a movie that didn't really impress me much when I first watched it, but I found that it grew on me after a few more viewings. I've never been into war movies but there's always been something about the Vietnam War that grabbed my interest. It didn't play out like a normal war. It was deep in the jungle and the soldiers that experienced it encountered more than your average wartime strain. The jungle is a beast all it's own and to find yourself battling in it's nightmare terrain where the enemy can and will come from all sides at any moment is terrifying. I love a good Vietnam War film, where the focus is on the experiences of the soldiers as opposed to achieving victory. APOCALYPSE NOW is one of my all-time favorite films period, and FULL METAL JACKET is an intense view of a soldier's life from boot camp through the horrors of the war. So when I sat down to watch PLATOON, my questions was: how well did Oliver Stone's vision of the war stand up to Coppola and Kubrick? PLATOON follows the experiences of one soldier, Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen), as he arrives in Vietnam. An idealistic college student, Chris believed it was everyone's duty, not just the poor, to do their part in the war. Once he arrives, he discovers that nobility doesn't even enter the picture. It's all about survival and the law of the jungle, and he's caught in the conflict between the gung-ho Sergeant Barnes and the liberal Sergeant Elias.<br/><br/>I suppose my initial disappointment with the movie was all a result of personal biases. At first glance, the movie wasn't as visually impressive as Kubrick's 'Nam, and especially not Coppola's. Coppola had an incredible artistic vision when he created APOCALYPSE NOW. Every scene, every shot, every line of dialogue in that movie is powerful (in my personal opinion, anyway). And Kubrick's film was brutal in how it depicted the dehumanization of soldier's in the war. Oliver Stone's movie didn't feel as artistically influenced. It had an almost generic feel to the movie from the very beginning with the jungle-green opening credits over the shot of a passenger/cargo plane dropping a batch of fresh recruits in Vietnam. As I watched the film again, I found myself drawn into it's vision more and more. I still find Stone's vision less visually impressive than the others, but I am pulled in by the characters of the film (more than Kubrick's at times). PLATOON is an intense character piece where we experience the war through the eyes of someone going into a nightmare situation without knowing what to expect (just like the viewer). You sympathize with Chris and his comrades and feel the tension between the Elias and Barnes sides of the camp. You watch as Chris's idealism is slowly chipped away until there is nothing left but an almost feral nature and a code of honor when he seeks justice for one of his fallen friends.<br/><br/>My second problem with the film on its first viewing was the main character. I hadn't seen this movie until very recently, after the whole public meltdown of Charlie Sheen in the media. So my image of Charlie Sheen is that of a bizarre tale of how celebrity life and eat your sanity. Watching him as a bright-eyed, optimistic private was a hard pill to swallow. I just couldn't buy into it. I eventually overcame my views on Sheen and actually believe he did a better job than I originally gave him credit for. He's still a little hard to buy in such a powerful dramatic role (I mean, he did do HOT SHOTS) but he puts in a good performance. No where near as good as his father in APOCALYPSE NOW, but a good job regardless. There are actually a lot of great performances hereKeith David, Kevin Dillon, Forest Whitaker, etc. I admit Dillon did feel a little over the top as Bunny, but he remained in the realm of plausibility. You believe him as a someone who was probably a small-town jock back home but gets to stretch his legs a bit and goes a little far with the freedom to act in Vietnam. Speaking of over-the-top though, no one fits the bill better than John C. McGinley as O'Neill. It's OK though, because I've come to expect him to ham it up. The real powerhouses in the film are Willem Dafoe and Tom Berenger as Sergeants Elias and Barnes. These man are the real center of conflict in the picture. These two men have very different views on running the war in Vietnam and it's their head-butting and eventual confrontation that drives Private Taylor's final descent into total loss of innocence. It's truly a great story. Sure, I still don't believe it rises to the ranks of Coppola and Kubrick, but I definitely count this as one of the most iconic visions of Vietnam to come out of Hollywood."
"Maniac-9","10","3","4","9 March 2012"," One of the two best Vietnam movies
","Platoon in my opinion is tied with Apocalypse Now as being the best Vietnam War movie of all time, with Born on the Fourth of July right behind them. And Casualties of War being extraordinarily behind all 3 of those.<br/><br/>This was Oliver Stone in the prime of his career when he was cranking out this movie, Born on the Fourth of July, Wall Street, The Doors and JFK. Actually Stone makes a very good choice in using The Doors as the music for the movie.<br/><br/>The movie has a fantastic cast with Charlie Sheen, Tom Berenger, Willem Dafoe, Forest Whitaker, John C.

"classicsoncall","9","3","4","1 July 2011"," ""There's the way it ought to be. And there's the way it is"".
","Oliver Stone's politics are no secret, but at the same time it would be difficult to characterize any film about the Viet Nam conflict as anything but anti-war. ""Platoon"" takes that idea and personalizes it in the battle of wills between two diametrically opposed warriors - Tom Berenger's sadistically ruthless Sergeant Barnes, and Willem Dafoe's humanistic Sergeant Elias. Charlie Sheen's character, Private Chris Taylor, serves as the viewer's moral arbiter between the two, attempting to make some sense of the untenable situation he finds himself in once he sets foot in the jungles of Viet Nam. We share his thoughts as he writes home to his grandmother, realizing that his noble ideals will be severely tested, while coming to an early conclusion that 'Hell is the impossibility of reason'.<br/><br/>For me, a picture like ""Platoon"" conveys the utter insanity that drives some men to do the kinds of things in war that would never even be considered in 'ordinary' life. The character of Bunny (Kevin Dillon) is a prime example. You have a young kid with little or no education, plucked from an ordinary and safe home environment, suddenly thrust into a situation of terrorizing foreigners at the point of a gun. Where does his kind of rage and brutality spring from? What makes Bunny so different from Chris Taylor, willing to waste a village while others shudder in horror at the mere thought? ""Platoon"" doesn't try to answer those kinds of questions, but boldly puts them out there for the viewer to consider."

"TheAll-SeeingI","10","4","6","6 November 2019"," Elite Portrayal of War's Hideous Realities
","In 1986, former Vietnam War infantry man Oliver Stone brought ""Platoon"" to the screen, and with it all the brutal realities of war that Hollywood had recently shunned in favor of the vulgarities of Rambo-tinted fireworks. By so many accounts of those that served our country, this is a stunningly accurate and authentic depiction of boots-on-the-ground wartime in Vietnam, in equal parts aching and unvarnished.<br/><br/>The film leans heavily on the tale of the progressively lost innocence of an infantryman in a role that saw Charlie Sheen emerge from under his father Martin's legendary performance in ""Apocalypse Now,"" particularly as Charlie's voiceover is evoked as he reads letters of acute introspection to his grandmother back home (this is an exceedingly well-acted film from top to bottom). As the platoon takes on a largely unseen enemy, the combat scenes are wholly immersive yet alarmingly difficult to watch, and as well they should be -- yet they're also beautifully executed in the context of expert filmmaking, as a dark, faceless claustrophobia permeates throughout.<br/><br/>""Platoon"" remains in that small group of films -- regardless of subject matter -- which manage to tell whatever their specific story is with a far greater depth of nuance than others who fall short of the mark. In our current environment -- in which our one-time thirst for wartime truths has arguably been suppressed by a sheer exhaustion with endless conflicts -- ""Platoon"" may not be front-of-mind for our escapist consumer population. Yet here it waits, immortalized with great storytelling and great performances, and with a message destined to reemerge at our current expense of selectively looking the other way. - (Was this review of use to you?

I don't remember what director Oliver Stone said in his commentary; actor Charlie Sheen made his great debut with ""Platoon"" (1986) but I don't remember whether he had a featurette in the Blu-ray disk. Hence young generation now-a-days are not prompt to watch Blu-ray, they have everything on-line. Valuable detail from IMDb - the Film was shot at locations in Luzon, Philippines. It's all Jungle there, after all!<br/><br/>Have other things. Me and Charlie Sheen are one and the same age. I know the spirit of 1980s and although I made first step in U.S.A. at year 1990, I can declare that we lived ""happy as pigs in those times"" /citation not mine/. I have to confess that I didn't stay and came back home, but my brother have a breed in America and my nephew is an American. Those young people have to know, but unfortunately I can't speak to Sam very often.<br/><br/>The Vietnamese population are Buddhist by religion. Almost 90% of those are dumb found. They didn't understood that War Inc. was imposed on them by Great Powers. Soviet Union and Communist China did well in Vietnam, they dragged the Americans for whole 10 years and bleeded them 50 000 troopers. More were lost as P.O.W. and no one can figure the exact number. Total deployment of U.S.A. and Allies were 500 000 soldiers. My personal opinion is that drafting procedure was a total shame - what do you mean by every odd number in Birth Certificate becoming a conscript. Else, many people doved.<br/><br/>A share in documentary literature are the, so called, ""Pentagon Papers"" on United States Vietnam Relations 1945-1967. Issued by U.S. Department of Defense, commissioned by Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara. Those ""Pentagon Papers"" became a banned book since revealing Congressional Records. Things like that.

"DeeNine-2","8","6","11","2 February 2003"," How a nation lost its innocence
","In one sense this can be seen as Oliver Stone's attempt to account for the massacre at My Lai for which Lt. William Calley was famously court-martialed. One recalls a statement made at the time by somebody in close concert with the logic of the Vietnam War: ""We had to destroy the village in order to save it."" But more inclusively, Oliver Stone's film addresses the question of what war does to us as it focuses on Pvt. Chris Taylor, played by Charlie Sheen, who gave up his student deferment, joined the army and volunteered to fight in Vietnam as his patriotic duty. How the twisted logic of war changes him and corrupts him and others in his platoon is the story of the film.<br/><br/>To Oliver Stone's credit it can be said that this movie, first released in 1989, helped to shock a new generation of Americans into understanding just why our involvement in Vietnam was a tragic mistake and to warn us not to do anything like that again. The fact that recent military adventures by the US have been limited engagements with limited objectives (instead of the vague and unrestricted policy of stopping the spread of communism, which was the rationale for the war in Vietnam)--engagements that have been carefully orchestrated to avoid becoming mired in the kind of hand-to-hand combat favoring the side defending its own turf as shown in this film, owes something to Stone's vision and to that of other film makers. One also recalls Senator Barry Goldwater R, Arizona) who advocated ""winning"" the war in Vietnam by ""bombing them back into the Stone Age."" Stone's film suggests just how impossible that would have been.<br/><br/>Tom Berenger gives a splendid and somewhat horrific performance as Sgt. Barnes, the ""War Lover"" (the phrase is the title of John Hersey's WWII novel), who kills both friend and foe indiscriminately. Willem DaFoe plays his opposite, Sgt. Elias who is the model of the good soldier. The rest of the cast gives fine support while the script by Stone, partially from personal experience, is full of authentic dialogue and veracious detail. The clash between our civilized nature and our baser instincts is well presented.<br/><br/>It is impossible to fairly compare this to other excellent Vietnam War movies such as The Deer Hunter (1978), Full Metal Jacket (1987), Apocalypse Now (1979), et al., because they are all so different. I do believe that Platoon was more of a throwback to World War II movies in the sense that it focused on the dynamics of the soldiers immersed in actual battles with the enemy. Yet on the other hand it falls completely within the Vietnam War genre by looking beyond the battles to address the larger question of why, and the war's consequences. In World War II movies, the why was never in doubt, and the consequences were not an issue.<br/><br/>The theme of this movie has been expressed as the loss of innocence, and that is a fair assessment; but I think it wasn't so much the soldiers themselves that lost their innocence, although many did, but a nation that lost its. We were a different country before Vietnam. We have never been the same since, and we will never be the same again.<br/><br/>(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""

He can't allow emotions to speak for themselves, so he asks slow motion shots and thundering music to do the work instead.

"tieman64","Null","8","17","7 May 2010"," Two and a Half Men
","When ""Platoon"" premiered, Time Magazine ran a cover spread with the title ""Vietnam as it really was"". Other pundits applauded director Oliver Stone for his ""truthful account of the Vietnam War"". Of course, these songs of praise largely occurred in America. Elsewhere in the world, such films were viewed as just more tedious propaganda, which served only to further rob entire generations of a right to factual information and further mythologise a deliberately obfuscated war.<br/><br/>But what's worse is the way these films purport to be ""anti-war"", but then treat war as a coming-of-age ritual, a rights of passage into manhood in which our heroes endure exciting action sequences and then, at least in ""Platoon's"" case, benefit from these experiences (as explained in ""Platoon's"" excruciating final voice-over).<br/><br/>These films covertly endorse war, serving up tales of a rag-tag bunch of racially diverse guys who ""don't know what they're fighting for"" but are nevertheless ""willing to die for their brothers"". Elsewhere the ""horrors"" which these soldiers commit are simply dismissed as acts of temporary insanity, rather than systemic atrocities ordered from above. Worse still is the way these films tend to treat Vietnam as a lost war, but a noble one, America simply guilty of being overly generous to a point of naivety, the Vietnamese population – portrayed as primal and barbaric - ultimately to blame for the pain inflicted upon the American psyche. <br/><br/>The historical truth, of course, is the opposite: the US sided with French Imperialism before the war, was neither supported by Northern Vietnam or the South, did everything it could to scuttle elections and unification, disobeyed Geneva mandates, propped up puppet dictators, artificially and deliberately divided a nation, killed over 4 million Vietnamese, raped the country, engaged in large scale torture, bombing, war-crimes and detainments, faked terrorist acts, funded and armed warlords, forced the displacement of five million, and violently subverted the will of a 80 percent majority who wanted democratic communism. But that's how the US, in tandem with the Imperial powers of yesteryear, habitually operates: vote for who we don't want and we crush you. <br/><br/>The truth is, most films touted as being ""Vietnam war films"", aren't really about the Vietnam War; they're simply about confused and anguished Americans. ""Platoon"", like ""First Blood"", presented itself as an attempt to reconcile Americans with what had happened in Vietnam. But unlike ""First Blood"", which brought Vietnam back home and forced Americans to confront the scars, ""Platoon"" yanks us back to Asia and invites us to experience the everyday ""truths"" of how soldiers experienced the war, the film designed to heal the wounds of a ""great nation"" undeservedly ""defeated"" at the hands of a poverty-stricken third world country (the notion that America was ""defeated"" is itself mythology. America achieved its real goals in Vietnam, in much the same way it did in Iraq, another supposedly ""failed war"").<br/><br/>So at its core, ""Platoon"" is a fairly straightforward morality play. Chris, played by Charlie Sheen, is a young soldier who must (like his character in Stone's ""Wall Street"") choose between two fathers. The first father is Sgt Elias, a tough but gentle sergeant, and the second is Sgt Barnes, an evil brute. Elias represents the mud-stained American ideal, whilst Barnes represents a kind of corrupt devil who believes that men of principle are weak and that evil is within everyone.<br/><br/>The film ends with two successive apocalypses. In the first, Elias is abandoned and dies like Christ, a horde of Vietcong devils engulfing him whilst Chris betrays him and angelically rise up into the skies. But this is a false resurrection. The last good man – the moral heart of America – has been left behind to die on the cross, leaving Chris alone with Barnes, a kind of demonic God.<br/><br/>To salvage his soul, Chris must thus venture back into the jungle-hell, avenge Elias and kill Barnes, an incident which takes place in the film's final apocalypse. Here, amongst the devilish shadows of the Vietcong, Chris confronts Elias and kills him, before being once again lifted up into the skies. In Stone's mythology, America is neither fighting Vietnam nor defeated by it. Rather, America is struggling to confront and dispatch its own demons, that of collective memory and national guilt. She then re-learns how to be a good warrior nation.<br/><br/>The devil sergeant destroyed and the Christ hero avenged, Chris(t) frees America and is then lifted off into the sunset like a body resurrected into some easier, more comfortable tomorrow. ""I have felt like the child of these two fathers,"" Chris then says. ""We did not fight the enemy, we fought ourselves, and the enemy was within us. Those of us who made it have an obligation to build again, to teach to others what we know and to try with what's left of our lives to find a goodness and meaning to this life."" <br/><br/>And so ""Platoon"" dissolves defeat and serves up a cathartic experience in which memory is erased and the American dream persists. Elsewhere the film is resolutely goofy, with Barber's ""Adagio for Strings"" overused (cribbed from ""Elephant Man""), too much romanticised insanity, goofy poetry, high-school symbolism and the kind of macho posturing that now seems silly post ""Tropic Thunder"", ""Hot Shots"" and ""Full Metal Jacket's"" self-aware caricatures. Furthermore, Stone throws in every cliché (the village trial, the racist, the southern soldiers, the ineffective officer who almost always gets their men killed, the dope smoking, the war-as-being-high aesthetic etc) known to man. He'd direct the superior ""Born on the Fourth of July"" some years later.<br/><br/>6/10 – An ingratiating film, rewarding in a very superficial way. See ""The Quiet American"", ""Walker"", Pontecorvo's ""Burn"" and ""Go Tell the Spartans""."

","Platoon is a masterclass of how to make a film with a message. The underlying theme of Platoon concerns the ultimate horror and sometimes futility of war. Set in Nam' during the late 60s we follow the war through the eyes of a raw young volunteer (Charlie Sheen). Starting out full of ideology and belief in his cause, his experiences lead him to conclude that war entails enormous and often wasteful sacrifice. At times, Platoon is very sad; scores of young soldiers, often friends, being slain in combat. We witness the internal rivalries that split an army, the cynicism that can develop and the differing methods of coping with battle. Platoon is not a sensationalist war movie. It has a deep statement that many viewers may resonate with. The action scenes are well staged and take place very much from the perspective of the man 'at the front'. The cast does not feature any major stars, but perhaps because of this, Platoon can be viewed without the Hollywood cult of personality. It perfectly suits its' genre; a war film that plays it straight. One for any collection."

I've talked to many Vietnam veterans, and they all hated the film, denounced its many historical inaccuracies and its negative portrayal of them. Here's a hint: Oliver Stone directed the shlock. He's an admirer of Fidel Castro. So, obviously this movie is loaded with Communist propaganda. Sick, vile, poorly written, poorly made, etc. I could go on all day, but I have better things to do then contemplate this terrible film. Avoid it all costs. Most of the men who fought in Vietnam were (with a few exceptions, of course) tough, courageous, valiant men who fought honorably. By watching the movie, by praising it, you are only giving aid and comfort to the murderous Communists who were the true villains and butchers of that war."

","Platoon is an incredibly powerful war movie that's extremely intense, harrowing and emotional. Charlie Sheen, Willem Dafoe and Tom Berenger all give incredibly committed and intense performances.

","I have seen this movie easily a half a dozen times, and I find that the beauty of the film is how Platoon not only shares his innocence and purity with others, including the audience, he also manages to retain that innocence and purity through some very difficult times. As a Viet Nam veteran, and a college graduate of the late Sixties, I could of course personally relate to the various periods that Platoon endures. I would only mention that the skillful and seamless blending of music, action, and period costume was enthralling."

","In 1967, U.S. Army volunteer Chris Taylor arrives in Vietnam and is assigned to an infantry platoon near the Cambodian border. The platoon is officially led by the young and inexperienced Lieutenant Wolfe, but in reality the soldiers defer to two of his older and more experienced subordinates: the hardened and cynical Staff Sergeant Barnes, and the more idealistic Sergeant Elias.<br/><br/>Taylor is immediately sent out with Barnes, Elias and veteran soldiers on a planned night ambush for a North Vietnamese Army force. The NVA soldiers manage to get close to the sleeping Americans before a brief firefight ensues; Taylor's fellow new recruit Gardener is killed and Taylor himself lightly wounded. After his return from hospital, Taylor bonds with Elias and his circle of marijuana-smokers while remaining aloof from Barnes and his more hard-edged followers."
"sharky_55","5","3","5","27 March 2016"," Something from Ecclesiastes
","So it seems to me that the ideals of Platoon are to be anti-war...to not ascribe any blame towards the overtly political powers that drove this war but to centre it on the human aspect of the soldier itself, and how it loses its humanity. Sheen's bleary, self-serious voice- over narration says so as much - that the enemy was within themselves, the violence from their own hearts. And Stone collaborates this idea with his visuals; there is scarcely a clear shot of a Vietnamese soldier, guns blazing. The danger is all around them, but it is murky and indistinct, and the paranoia settles into the platoon quite easily, and begins to affect them. There is no logic or reason to the madness, to the hysteria of the violence, to the casual beckoning of death itself after a few weeks in the jungle. <br/><br/>The problem is that Sheen's storyline doesn't fit this message at all. Stone tries to avoid pointing the blaming finger, and attempts to rid the film of any structure or cause or journey just because we might expect it from a movie. But in doing so he inadvertently creates a coming-of-age story that just so happens to be set during the Vietnam War. Taylor goes in a fresh-faced youth, having idealised the soldier life and cast away the bores of college, and immediately finds himself out of his depth. And then he has to go through the usual rigours of gaining acceptance within the group and finding his feet, and shaping his own philosophy. The choice that Stone has presented here is a insultingly simplistic one; the scarred, savage Barnes who shoots first and asks questions later, who Taylor unsurprisingly initially worships and who has half of the platoon following his violent, racist ways. And then you have the literal hippie, Dafoe's disillusioned, goody two-shoes veteran that later befriends Taylor and stops the atrocity at the village. <br/><br/>There's not much engagement even for Taylor - one moment he is deliriously taunting the villager with his gun and even close to shooting him, and following that, nearly speaks out on the massacre and then stops the gang-rape of some girls. Stone wants these moral decisions to be grounded within visceral, graphic images of war, but doesn't commit to it; the rape is only hinted at from off-screen, and as Bunny smashes the elderly woman's head open, it surely is a sight for Taylor to recoil from, but we don't see it. Even when the group discover the gory end of Manny, Stone spends more time pointing the camera at the horrified reactions instead. <br/><br/>Many critics have praised it for its realism, its fuzzy, indistinct boundaries of warfare that do not glorify the combat, do not make it exhilarating but chaotic and confusing for all involved. But Stone's film is full of these cinematic moments that betray his intent - Sheen's cliché-ridden voice-over becomes quickly insufferable because it assumes so much of the other characters without ever giving evidence of their ""heat and soul"". There's that wishy-washy poetic speech from Dafoe the night before the chaos and mayhem that just happens to take place underneath a beautiful star-filled sky and a stupid shooting star. Later he is the figure of perhaps the worst scene in the film, his own death, stumbling for his life as he is riddled with Vietnam bullets in slow-motion and Samuel Barber's Adagio for Strings swells to peak sentimentality and it's almost unwatchable."
"khanbaliq2","9","3","5","21 April 2014"," The Vietnam War is recreated with striking realism in Platoon.
","Platoon is clearly one of director Oliver Stone's most inspired films. Stone volunteered for the army in 1967 as a college drop-out. He wrote the screenplay for Platoon in 1975 but it took over ten years until he was able to film it. What separates Platoon from other American films dealing with the Vietnam War is that it depicts wartime massacres. Films before that, like The Deer Hunter (1978) and Apocalypse Now (1979), only focused on the shattered psyches produced by the war. Keep in mind though that Platoon is a mainstream movie, so it doesn't come anywhere near the brutality that the Americans sometimes demonstrated. The 1968 My Lai Massacre, in which as many as 504 unarmed civilians were killed, is just one of many examples. The Vietnam War is considered to be the greatest trauma of 20th century American history, but a few decades later the USA savagely attacked Yugoslavia and Iraq. Platoon made a lot of money at the box office, mainly because Stone has the ability to make a film entertaining no matter what it's about. The film's partial blindness to the war was another reason for its success. It's not made clear who the American soldiers are actually fighting and why they invaded Vietnam in the first place. Let's also not forget that Stone dedicated the film to the men who lost their lives. So, when Stone is accused by some people of being anti-American or a leftie I can just laugh at their foolishness. What's most interesting about Platoon for me is that Stone brought his own experience of being a soldier in Vietnam. When Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen) said that you don't really sleep even when you do get time to sleep I was immediately reminded of what my father told me. My father served in the army. Even though he didn't see combat he told me that he still stayed awake. In Platoon Stone looks at the war from his educated middle-class point of view. He shows the behavior of under-privileged blacks and of ""white trash"" from middle America. Stone's direction is very good, so it's not a surprise that he won an Oscar. With cinematographer Robert Richardson he managed to capture some impressive images. He also brought intelligence to the film by depicting a war between two sergeants, Barnes (Tom Berenger) and Elias (Willem Dafoe). It's pretty much Jesus (Elias) fighting against the covetous shadow of the American dream (Barnes). The performances by most of the cast are very good. Berenger and Dafoe are terrific. They're clearly the standouts. Historian Carroll Quigley thought that what happened to Western civilization in the first half of the 20th century was a tragedy. It's clear why. There were two big wars, a depression, and the coming of fascism. In addition to that the Russians foiled the plans of the Germans and the British and captured Eastern Europe. Yet Quigley still had hope when he wrote his famous book in the 1960s. But, as the Vietnam War dragged on, he began to lose this hope. He began to think that Western civilization is nearly finished. I think that there's still hope for Western civilization, though the Vietnam War was yet another example of the crisis that this society is going through. Platoon isn't my favorite war movie. I like Come And See (1985) and Apocalypse Now (1979) more, but I easily recommend Platoon too."
"zhubertX","7","3","5","19 June 2011"," so-so
","Oliver Stone, Platoon was name a ""masterpiece"" and one of the most realistic Vietnam war movies of all times.<br/><br/>I did enjoy the village scene showing how crazy yanks are at yielding their way to scared the populations.<br/><br/>Charlie Sheen memorable motto ""They're just humans being...""man, showed what wars movie is all about.<br/><br/>Charlie's great and all, but Platoon's thrill is in its supporting cast, namely Tom Berenger as a rather evil yet invincible Staff Sargeant, and Willem Dafoe as the unforgettably moral Sargeant Elias. When Berenger and Elias spar, it's epic acting -- and as Stone details on a commentary track, it's a bit ironic since up until this film, Berenger had always played good guys (a la The Big Chill) and Dafoe had always played terrorists. Dafoe, of course, would go on to play Jesus Christ.<br/><br/>Highly recommended as one of Stone's greatest works."

","Many consider Platoon as the best war film ever made. I disagree. Yes, Platoon is perhaps one of the best few around challenging the likes of Apocalypse Now, The Deer Hunter, Full Metal Jacket etc. But, in my opinion, Saving Private Ryan tops the bunch. But Platoon should be acknowledged for presenting the most sincere vision of war. Oliver Stone who's a Vietnam veteran, fully utilizes his war experience to write an impressive screenplay, following through with assured direction.<br/><br/>Platoon also triumphs in the area of photography (highlighted by the tense sequence when the Vietcong steps out of the shadows during a night in the jungle, hunting the unsuspecting Americans), and showcasing forceful human drama (the village scene is unforgettable). Oliver Stone films Platoon in a way that makes viewers feel uneasy, unknowing of the dangers lurking that might result in deaths for the soldiers at any time. This is an effective motion picture that truthfully reflects Vietnam during that turbulent era, and is certainly deserving of the Best Picture trophy.<br/><br/>SCORE: 8.5/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!"

","In PLATOON, it shows you the experiences as an infantryman in Vietnam to convey the immediacy of guerrilla warfare. Charlie Sheen stars as Chris, a raw recruit, or new meat in the movie a term for new recruits. At first he wilts under the rigorous conditions of jungle life, freezes up in a firefight, and wonders whether he'll be able to survive. But he gradually adapts and, as time goes by, begins to see that the platoon is divided into two groups. One consists of lifers, juicers, and sub intelligent whites, the other of blacks and heads. Sgt. Barnes, a combat-loving burnout is the informal leader of the lifers, and Sgt. Elias, a free spirit, leads the latter group. When the platoon takes some gruesome losses while on an o.p., an enraged Barnes kills some Vietnamese who may or may not have been VC and orders the burning of their village, outraging the temporarily absent Elias. As the conflict between these two reaches its tragic denouncement, Chris must decide what he really values."

Along with the battle against the Vietcong, the platoon battles themselves morally and physically.<br/><br/>This movie is one of the rare war movies that actually captured to total guerrilla warfare of the Vietnam War. It showed the burning of villages, digging fox holes, and use of mortars. The movie has two great performances with two opposing roles. Dafoe does an amazing job of being the man who was willing to fight for others safety, and Berenger did a great job as the tyrant who believed in what he was doing when he had to use unethical tactics. The movie also includes good performances from Charlie Sheen, Forest Whitaker, John C. McGinley, and Reggie Johnson. Johnny Depp also gets a small little roll in the movie. The movie's writing is wonderful also. There is a scene where Dafoe's character talks to Sheen's about how ""the stars have no right or wrong in them, they are just there"". There is also a scene where Berenger's character says ""Are you smoking this shi_ so's to escape from reality? Me, I don't need this shi_. I am reality."" The writing was just very real and convincing. Overall, this movie is absolutely wonderful and definitely the best Oliver Stone has ever done. It is his legacy of movies.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this war classic."

","I have to say that Oliver Stone seems to be one of the most misunderstood directors in the world. What some people don't get is that one of the main values of an artist is his originality. How HE sees things,how HE creates something. Stone has an OPINION and a TAKE on things which he throws in our faces. He is SUBJECTIVE, as all art should be.All these people here on IMDb that say that Platoon and other Stone pictures don't do justice to Vietnam veterans miss the point.This movie is not only about Vietnam veterans, it is about people in an extreme situation.About feelings, emotions and human behavior.It is fairly historically accurate and it is enough.Dialogues are excellent, as all dialogs written by Stone.Of course you have to FEEL like Stone to really appreciate his movies.You have to connect.If you don't, that's OK, but don't criticize simply because you don't agree with how he perceived the events. Acting is brilliant,filming beautiful,screenplay excellent. You can sense the 100% passion that went into the making of this movie, and this is the most that you can ask from an artist. Europe (generally) loves your movies Oliver, so don't bother with your shallow and brainwashed compatriots. 10/10"
"mattrochman","2","15","42","21 September 2006"," Some plot please?
","I read one other review that expressed the view that Platoon was a never ending cycle of marines killing people, being killed, taking drugs and talking trash.<br/><br/>I don't agree with that because the film actually had more to it, but it a way, I can see what this person is trying to say: this had no real plot - which is a point i agree with.<br/><br/>It is self-indulgent Stone at his best. He really wanted to show, not only how war leads to death, but also how it is extremely traumatic on those who survive. Unfortunately, the film seems to over ""glorify"" this aspect and the grand finale is just way too champagne, grand-standing, Oscar-hunting ""let's create an enduring image"" for my liking.<br/><br/>The problem I have with Stone and other film-makers of his ilk is that they fail to understand this simply concept: depicting the terribly bloody deadly waste that war is only says that war is bad - which is pretty self-evident, isn't it? World War 2 was horrible, incredible waste of human life, yet a necessary path to take in most people's opinion. It's clear Stone wants to say that the Vietnam war was wrong (which is fine) but argues this point by simply saying it was wrong because it was violent and traumatic. If you want to challenge the Vietnam war, make a film focusing on how it started rather that 100 minutes of people getting blown apart!<br/><br/>This says nothing of the fact that the ending or the final big ""twist"" was a bit stupid. However, this is not Stones first oddball departure. Wall street was a magnificent film, up until the last 30 minutes or so when it made a dreadful ""wrong turn."" JFK is probably one of the few films Stone did that actually ended very well.<br/><br/>But it hardly matters in this one because there was very little plot up until that point of the film to twist around. And this is why i gave it such a low mark. It was virtually story-less and ultimately boring - unless you fell for the manufactured poignancy."

","One of my favourite films of all time - and not many people i know seem to have watched this amazing piece... ??? I have watched Platoon several times and it never fails to capture what a war was (or is) and how it affects people in different ways and the conflict war brings not just between opposing armies, but between each other.<br/><br/>In this case it provides a very emotional account of a person that endures some torturous moments that are sometimes hard to watch - which is obviously what films should do, make you really feel what the actors portray! Some right characters and a story to get your teeth into .<br/><br/>I think this film deserves more credit."

","I remember watching this film about ten years ago and not being impressed. I have since been plagued by people insisting that it is the greatest film of its genre so I decided to watch it again and give it another chance. My original impressions were correct. Some of the acting in this film is truly awful (John C. McGinley, for example, is consistently weak throughout). Also there are some serious questions to be asked of the dialogue. The major problem with the film, however, is the the plot in general and the characters that are central to it. The blatant juxtaposition of Sgt. Barnes with Sgt. Grodin trivialises the atrocities that are committed in war. The gross simplification of the issues by Stone here is actually quite irritating. If one wants to look at a war film that deals with the horrors without being overly sentimental (note Barber's Adagio!) then I would suggest The Deer Hunter."
"seancolins","2","9","24","20 May 2000"," Disrespectful to an honorable people
","The first scene is of recruits landing in Vietnam. Among them is an  enlisted soldier (Charlie Sheen) who we follow throughout the film.  Sheen does this because he thinks it's the decent thing to do. When he  gets to Vietnam he is in horror. Of course any good war film would show  horror, but this one would rather just do that than show some respect.  Every word in the film is practically **** and the soldiers' attitudes  are terrible. There is a scene when they go through a village and  slaughter civilians. Now of course Mey Li is true, but unless your  making a movie about that, or only disrespecting some soldiers you  should keep your mouth shut. Oliver Stone decides because he was in Nam  for a year that all Vietnam War soldiers were a terrible evil force.  When the soldiers of Vietnam got home, arrogant, idiot protesters  condemed them. This film is a bunch of worthless protesters. A lot of  them knew that they were fighting for nothing, yet they still did it  anyway because their country asked them to. These honorable men go  through so much, and what do they get besides ever lasting respect that  they deserve? Trash thrown at them like this movie.  Besides being disrespectful it is also depressing beyond belief. Now of  course it's okay to have depressing war films, (""Apocalypes Now"" was a  masterpiece) but this film has empty depressents. Maybe that last scene  was suppose to touch people, but it just tried to make something that  it was not. When was it ever in the books that Americans fought against  themselves viciously?  If you want to develop a disrespect for very honorable people and make  yourself totally depressed go out and get ""Platoon."" If you want to see  a great version of what Vietnam was I urge you to go out and get  Francis Ford Coppalas epic ""Apocalypse Now"" or for good respect of  Vietnam War veterans see ""Hamburger Hill."" Don't even think that this  film has any right to be the least bit near at all to Steven Speilbergs  epic ""Saving Private Ryan."" Platooon definitely didn't deserve that  Oscar."

","I know that 'war movies' are a bit of a 'niche' genre. Not everyone is interested in seeing various real life conflicts depicted on the big screen. However, 'Platoon' is just about the 'perfect' war movie and - hopefully - should be able to be appreciated by almost everyone. Most people know that the 'Vietnam war' didn't go quite as well as the US were hoping. Here we don't see a glorified historical retelling of the conflict, showing how the US were 'right' to get involved, or how they really did 'win' the war (honest!). It's more of a character study of the 'average' troop on the ground who was forced to fight in the conflict.<br/><br/>Charlie Sheen (pre 'tiger blood' outcry!) is the young recruit who the story focuses on - a man from middle class America who enlists in the army because he didn't see why only the 'poor kids' should get killed in the line of fire. However, as you can imagine, he quickly discovers the true horrors of war and regrets his decision to enlist. There's plenty of other recognisable actors among the soldiers who you'll probably recognise (including a particularly young Johnny Depp), all of which play their parts well. But 'Platoon' is not just about the grisly effects of battle, as a big part of the film is about 'ideologies,' namely between the two sergeants who wrestle (sometimes quite literally!) for control of the squad and the recruits it's made up of. Willem Dafoe and Tom Berenger play the two soldiers and both have a tendency to steal every scene.<br/><br/>Of course it wouldn't be an epic war film without plenty of action and the battle scenes certainly don't hold back in terms of practical effects and nasty death scenes. You'll need a strong stomach in some places as the film never holds back when it comes to limbs being blown in all directions (and expect plenty of strong language to match).<br/><br/>Platoon' may have been made back in 1986, long before the massive influx of computer special effects that allow film-makers to create huge worlds and epic battles which we could only just dream of back in the eighties. However, watching it today in 2018, I couldn't help but feel that it could have been made today and the effects couldn't be improved on. It really is timeless, so, if you're looking for a character study that never holds back from showing the horrors of war, different ideologies and has action to boot, then 'Platoon' is as good as it ever was."

","At the height of the Vietnam War, America's teens are drafted into the war effort to find themselves in the middle of hell. One such young man is Chris Taylor. He is placed in a squadron where two sergeants have different approaches to the war – Elias is more about surviving without being brutal or cruel, whereas Barnes is crueller, more ruthless and more violent. During the course of his term, Taylor's very soul is torn between the two men as he deals with what he must do.<br/><br/>The first film in Oliver Stone's unofficial trilogy is arguably the best of the three. The basic story not only shows us what the war was like for those serving but also how the different personalities come out of those involved in it. As we follow Taylor we see him change as he is influenced by those around him and by his situation. It makes for an uncomfortable film but one that's worth watching. It's certainly a better war movie than things like Wild Geese or The Dirty Dozen, simply because it's a little more real to what happens than those ones.<br/><br/>Charlie Sheen has never been better than when he's acting for Stone. Here he gives one of his best ever performances as the innocent who is changed. Willem Dafoe is a great actor and here is no different – he also gives us one of the film's most enduring images so I'm a little biased. Berenger is another one for whom it's hard to think of a higher point reached than when he did this film. He is brutal and ruthless but he makes us support him in a strange way. The support cast are all good and contains a few famous faces (John C McGinley, Whitaker, Depp) however this is really a three man show."

","Platoon directed and written by Oliver Stone is a masterpiece. From start to end it is intriguing. There is no down parts in the movie and full of action. It makes it seem as if you are part of the Vietnam war while watching the movie. Very realistic account. As soon as the movie it gives you the chills; with dead bodies on the ground in the first seen. Then to when one American kills another on purpose. Chills throughout. This is the best war movie I have watched to date and would highly recommend it to anyone. It is a life changer."

","Reals good. Francois Truffaut once said ""There is no such thing as an anti-war film"". If only Truffaunt had lived to see Platoon, I wonder what he would have said...<br/><br/>Stone himself, who fought in Vietnam, said he tried to make that was not metaphor, not message, but simply a memory of what it seemed like at the time to him.<br/><br/>Platoon captures this, all with out every really showing a clear shot of an enemy solider. Yet there is dander all around. Combat scenes are chaotic. There are no standard heros. Americans fight Americans. The sense of dread is overwhelming at times and the true madness of war finally comes to the forefront with this film. <br/><br/>A must see."
"cdjh-81125","10","2","3","24 November 2016"," In One Word: Real
","Oliver Stone for me is a really interesting director, he stands by his opinions no matter how divisive but this film is far from divisive it paints a picture of real men struggling to survive in a situation they have no idea how to and Platoon is a masterpiece. Easily in my top 50 of all time I adored this movie. From the opening scene of this movie we can tell that the main character played by Charlie Sheen is not even trying to hide his regret or fear he is in constant fear for his life and this was a very bold choice and a very good one, it's clear that Stone took from his own experiences in Vietnam to make this film seem more real and it payed of. This is an extremely atmospheric movie, you can practically smell Vietnam through the screen, every time it rains you feel the soldiers cold and discomfort and has action sequences rivalling that of Saving Private Ryan. Charlie Sheen was excellent in this movie he does a really good job at portraying his character as a vulnerable and inexperienced soldier and it allowed the audience to relate to him more as a character and his one man war between his two sergeants is riveting to watch and gives us an impression as to how the war effected everybody in different ways, take Willem Dafoes character an upbeat sergeant trying to make the best out of this situation or Tom Berengers character a wounded, damaged soul having lost all hope of every regaining the humanity he lost. Both Dafoe and Berenger are amazing in this move and both worthy of Oscars and career highlights for the both of them. This film has some truly disturbing and brutal sequences committed by both sides of this war, it could have been easy for Stone to paint the Americans as the good guys in this conflict but he doesn't there's a lot of scenes where they are truly committing atrocities that will leave an impression on you. <br/><br/>Few times have a combination of Screenplay, acting and directing come together so perfectly, I love this movie it's one of the greatest and most realistic war films every made, platoon is one of my favourite movie and one of my favourite best picture winners. <br/><br/>A+/100%"
"bkoganbing","8","2","3","17 November 2016"," What a war
","The only military conflict that was in the American experience similar to Vietnam was the Phillipine Insurrection. I doubt that any of the characters whom Oliver Stone created for Platoon would even have known we were in a five year war in the Phillipines battling elements wanting independence after the Spanish-American War made the territory our's.<br/><br/>This was a war without uniforms or battle lines. No one knew who was friend or foe. That bred callousness of an extreme kind into our troops. They learned to shoot first then fake a story for the official report. This is what we see in Platoon.<br/><br/>Charlie Sheen is a newly arrived private in Vietnam and through him Oliver Stone the director/writer of Platoon tells the story of his war. He gets caught in a power struggle between Sergeants Willem Dafoe and Tom Berenger who are presented as good versus evil. Dafoe is a professional soldier who has managed to keep some semblance of humanity. Berenger has totally lost it. A Yin and Yang of personal valor.<br/><br/>Other films like Casualties Of War and Apocalypse Now have given their Vietnam stories. I like Casualties Of War as a favorite Vietnam film of mine, but Platoon certainly has its merits. I think an awful lot who were there will say Platoon is the real deal.<br/><br/>Some familiar people are scattered through the supporting cast. One that stands out is Matt's younger brother Kevin who plays a kind of Berenger in training. I doubt this kid from small town USA ever imagined himself doing the brutal things he does. He learned his lessons from Vietnam well and Berenger was a good teacher.<br/><br/>Platoon got several Oscar nominations. Not my favorite Vietnam war film, but a very good one."
"Leofwine_draca","7","2","3","12 October 2016"," Hard-hitting, and then some
","Oliver Stone's hard-hitting, compulsively watchable Vietnam epic is based on his own experiences fighting in the US army. It's rightly regarded as something of a classic film of the 1980s, and watching it you get the right idea about war: it's a terrible, soul-destroying, and utterly nihilistic experience in which men are turned into cattle and moralities fly out of the window. It's also a hugely influential film; pretty much any Vietnam film made since must use this film as a template. You can't imagine Mel Gibson's WE WERE SOLDIERS without this, for instance.<br/><br/>Unlike many modern war films, this isn't an action film, although there is plenty of fighting. Instead it's an intense drama with some scenes of physical violence and rape that are almost unwatchable – not because they're graphic, but because they're so powerfully portrayed and well directed. The film has something of a slow start, and it does take a while for the lead, played by Charlie Sheen, to warm to the viewer (I suspect this is because Sheen has mercilessly spoofed his role in the HOT SHOTS! films). Once we reach the jungle, though, the film hits a high note, as loyalties are divided, booby traps and the enemy are lurking around every corner, and tempers flare. Things culminate with an overwhelming onslaught from the enemy in which everybody's fate is finally decided. The ending of this film is truly intense – I haven't seen much like it – and will leave you feeling tired and emotionally drained afterwards.<br/><br/>The cast is superb. It's one of those films where nobody puts a foot wrong. By the end, Sheen is giving his greatest performance in a film – ever. Tom Berenger's scarred sergeant is a supremely scary creation, more monstrous than a dozen Kruegers or Vorhees. The film served as a springboard for many young actors in the '80s, so roles are fleshed out by the likes of John C. McGinley, Forest Whitaker, Tony Todd, Johnny Depp, Keith David, and Kevin Dillon. Cinematography, music, and effects are all great but the one thing you'll take away with you is a career-best Willem Dafoe as one of the good guys for a change."

","Superb.<br/><br/>1967. A fresh-out-of-training recruit, Chris (played by Charlie Sheen), arrives in Vietnam and within days is out on patrol in the jungle. His platoon sergeant, Staff Sergeant Barnes (Tom Berenger), is tough-as-nails and a hard taskmaster. His squad leader, Sergeant Elias (Willem Dafoe), cares for his men and tries to help Chris learn and survive. Unfortunately, an incident occurs which sets Barnes against Elias and causes a large amount of friction within the platoon. This, and they still have to fight the Viet Cong...<br/><br/>One of the greatest war movies ever made. Certainly in my top 3 Vietnam war movies (the other two being Apocalypse Now and Full Metal Jacket). Incredibly gritty and realistic, with a great sense of what those that fought in Vietnam it went though.

It has a lot of quiet times when people are just waiting or walking around and those moments are no less tense than the action filled ones.<br/><br/>The action....well it is not really what this movie is about and I have seen better but it is still quite good. You will get your load of explosions.<br/><br/>It is hard to talk about the story as there isn't really one. The movie is generally about people's characters coming out over the course of their time in the Vietnam war and the way those characters change, interact and clash.<br/><br/>To make that non-story story work, there is whole star cast. Willem Dafoe and Tom Berenger are the two strongest roles. Some of the acting can be a little cheesy, but this was probably Tom's best role ever.<br/><br/>The only problem I have is with the main protagonist, Charlie Sheen. His acting and his narration feel forced. I am not surprised that he would later start playing in comedy spoofs of action movies because that is how a lot of his acting felt like in this one.

","I can't begin to imagine how one might feel after watching ""Platoon"". The first in a trilogy Oliver Stone made on Vietnam, the story was based upon his actual experiences as a U.S. infantryman in the actual War. Thus also making it the first Hollywood film to be written and directed by a veteran of the Vietnam War.<br/><br/>Oliver Stone adds another classic to his extraordinary filmography, as well as delivering some truly great characters portrayed by some of the best actors possible. The main character is a decent performance from Charlie Sheen, but no match for how incredible Tom Berenger and Willem Dafoe are as the ever confrontational Sergeants of the squad. I suppose the biggest thing that comes to my mind when viewing this movie is its music. The theme from ""Platoon"" is so epic & sad, it manages to capture all the intensity and despair of the War. So much so that it makes this visceral experience so much larger than life, as well as haunting.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: Truly incredible with perfect execution. ""Platoon"" just feels like something too big to fit on a simple television screen. 9/10."

","I know many will probably disagree with me, but personally I consider Platoon to be the definitive Vietnam War movie, and I say that after taking into account Apocalypse Now. Although Apocalypse Now had a number of moments of brilliance, but on the whole I think it suffers due to a disjointed script. Platoon on the other hand is intense right from the get-go. Like many of the other films dealing with the Vietnam war,in this one too,the dark, gloomy and unrelenting jungles of Vietnam serve as a separate character in itself. The soldiers find themselves trapped in the hell that we call war. Oliver Stone executes a detailed analysis of why soldiers tend to lose their sanity and their minds in the torturous conditions. There are a number of soldiers in the film who commit heinous acts and behave hideously, but considering the circumstances, it is understandable as in a hellish environment, it is not strange if people lose their humane qualities.<br/><br/>For me Lt. Wolfe represents the leaders and the politicians who are supposed to lead and serve ordinary people, but they have no idea what they are doing and innocents lose their lives due to their incompetence and lack of vision. Barnes and Elias represent the two schools of thought in society that generally clash at the time of war and Chris is caught in the middle who is uncertain about whom to follow.<br/><br/>The direction is brilliant, the cinematography is great, the scores are hauntingly beautiful,the action scenes look as realistic as possible. I think the only negative aspect for the film is that Charlie Sheen is a bit weak and unconvincing in some of the scenes.<br/><br/>This film brilliantly gives you a bird's eye view of the terrible experiences that soldiers had to face during the war. I felt psychologically drained just by watching this, I can't even begin to imagine how it affected the real soldiers."

","Oliver Stone directed this powerfully told account of the Vietnam war that stars Charlie Sheen as recent recruit Chris Taylor, who arrives in Vietnam with enthusiasm, but quickly realizes that this war is not what he expected, as he is disrespected by the more seasoned soldiers for his inexperience, and shocked by the lack of purpose he finds in the conflict, which is personified by his two non-commissioned officers, Barnes(played by Tom Berenger) & Elias(played by Willem Dafoe) who hate each other, and are polar opposites in philosophy and approach. Chris will eventually bond with his fellow soldiers, which will be painful later when so many are killed... Realistic and believable film with fine performances and direction, though isn't always easy to watch. Won the Academy Awards for best picture and director."

"s13ky","8","2","3","11 July 2013"," Platoon is certainly one of the best films about Vietnam War and Oliver Stone's best.
","If we talk about the war in Vietnam, we should talk about Platoon. It is certainly one of the best films about Vietnam War and in my opinion, it's absolutely Oliver Stone's best film since JFK and Nixon. Overall, apart from the credibility of the film director and also the authenticity in the depiction of the war, I find the screenplay, editing and film direction stand out above all, not to forget the all star casts of two famous method actors, Tom Berenger (possibly his best performance ever) and Willem Dafoe. To be honest, deep within my heart, ""Platoon"" ranked somewhere among ""Apocalypse Now"", ""Full Metal Jacket"" and ""The Deer Hunter"" (the latter isn't a war film) because of its raw visualization of the war horror that some consider a crime against humanity. I always get carried away by the spectacular music scoring, saddening, beautiful as well as frightening. The best music sequence would be ""Adagio For Strings"" by Samuel Barber and it's your task to find out which sequence. Oliver Stone really did well in bringing us the rich psychological portraits of soldiers who fought the popular war from a very interesting perspective, through the eyes of a rookie soldier (Charlie Sheen) who volunteered to defend his country, in a fight against communism. We witness the harsh time they faced as soon as they landed on the Saigon combat zone, in the jungle, with a simple mission of staying alive from day to day. The line between good and evil is the spot where Oliver Stone places the personal stories of the men whose horror and fear were their daily foods, real men who fought and died in the Vietnam War. This unnecessary war was taped in brutal realism. Awesome combat scenes, frank, hard and strangely beautiful. Robert Richardson as the cinematographer created a jaw-dropping atmosphere combining gray and bleak apocalyptic tones of the great wild landscapes. In conclusion, this is one of the greatest war films of cinema history, it contains some moving scenes and offers a realistic and cruel story of one of the greatest atrocities of humanity: wars."
"jake-law123","9","2","3","8 July 2013"," Charlie Sheen's breakthrough performance!
","Not really big on Oliver Stone, but his depiction of the Vietnam war is brilliant in this heavy, dark tribute to the men who died in the war.<br/><br/>Charlie Sheen, Tom Berenger, and Willam Dafoe all make one big triangle in this film, as it revolves around the conflict going on between them, and by them, I mean Willem Dafoe's squad, and Tom Berenger's squad in the Platoon, while Charlie Sheen is caught in the middle to deal with both, struggling to maintain his sanity as the depression of the war gets to him every day.<br/><br/>All performances are excellent. Even though the beginning consists of Sheen being an innocent little girly man, the war progresses, and he becomes a brutal life risking grunt that ruthlessly kills everything in his path, showing how the war affects him mentally.<br/><br/>The sound of the film sounds muddled every time somebody opens their mouth, not sure what Stone's intentions were, but it won the Oscar for sound, so whatever. The film isn't centered around combat, or the realism of war, it's centered around the duality of men, and how the war affects the minds of the soldiers, and the different types of soldiers that faced the war.<br/><br/>The beginning scenes consist of the Platoon getting to know each other, leading up to one of the most infamous and controversial scenes in cinema history, the village. It's interesting to see different characters of different personalities conflict each other over being with a different squad leader, like are you guys in high school? Either way they find a way to make it more intense.<br/><br/>Not too heavy on atmosphere, history, or in depth messaging like Apocalypse Now or The Deer Hunter, but it gets it around pretty easy, and the message about the war bringing out the best or the worst in men is carried out pretty easy also. Very excellent war film, isn't along the lines of Saving Private Ryan, (my favorite war film) but definitely give it a viewing."

This is one of those movie you could list everything here. I'll limit myself to what makes it truly special. An incredible score that leaves an indelible mark. Extremely strong psychology built into the scenario and the characters. You get right there with them, you feel the heat, the ants, the numbness... Perfect realism for the firefights, the ambushes, the battles, the camps, the duality, the interactions, and the dialogs. Superb acting.<br/><br/>The actors. At the time Tom Berenger and Willem Dafoe were big names and you can see why by the quality of their work in this piece. However, the real star here is Charlie Sheen for his portrayal of a and ex college boy and disillusioned volunteer. An other great performance, often underrated, is the one by John C. McGinley as the stringy sergeant O'Neil. This production also feature people that would eventually become much bigger in the industry, namely Forest Whitaker, Keith David and a very young Johnny Depp.<br/><br/>The bad.

"mjeccles76","10","2","3","26 January 2013"," A Timeless Classic
","It's over 25 years since I first saw Platoon. The highest praise I can give it is that I've seen only a handful of films since that come remotely close to it's utter perfection.<br/><br/>Without going into unnecessary detail, the movie is a claustrophobic, multi-layered Vietnam war film. Primarilly it's Oliver Stone's semi-autobiographical tribute to young men at war. It's an unapologetic, unflinching look at the brutal chaos of fighting at the coal face, with all the associated moral turmoil and paralysing fear brought vividly to life. It's also a universal morality fable.<br/><br/>It's plot is deceptively simple but essentially timeless, and that's one of the things I love about it: Platoon is perfect in it's scope and execution. It's depth is derived from it's characters (portrayed so well by a cast containing many young actors who's careers later blossomed) and by it's authenticity.<br/><br/>It doesn't pander to the audience, it doesn't attempt to explain all the intricacies of warfare in Vietnam (equipment, tactics, military language). It's often confusing, dark and disorientating. It requires / demands repeated viewings to appreciate the fuller picture.<br/><br/>The principal characters are perfect in their conception: Chris as narrator and moral barometer, link to the viewer, who leads us through the various traumatic phases of survival from clueless raw recruit to seasoned fighter. Barnes as deranged leader, Captain Ahab, the alpha warrior obsessed in his pursuit of the elusive (Moby Dick) NVA regardless of cost to himself or others. And Elias, the counter balance love to Barnes's hate, the philosopher soldier who fights despite his realisation of the futility of the cause.<br/><br/>The supporting cast, the aforementioned members of the Platoon, the crew of the Pequod, are also such an important part of the whole. They give perfectly balanced depth to the script and many of the pivotal moments revolve around them: they are not relegated to mere background chaff.<br/><br/>Ultimately, what remains after some 25 years is Stone's utter love and respect for the bravery and sacrifice of young men who fought and died for each other, regardless of political motive, and his anger at such futile waste."
"ElMaruecan82","10","2","3","9 November 2012"," War as a state of mind ...
","I hate quoting myself but as I said it before: 'the best war movies are about wars that were lost for defeat is the most revealing of the essence of war which already signs the defeat of reason, of civilization'. At one point, the central character of ""Platoon"", Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen) says: ""I see hell as the impossibility of reason"", war is indeed hell because it jeopardizes all your beliefs and all the values you stand for, and by the simple process of following orders in a blind patriotism, it leads men to their own principles' betrayal.<br/><br/>And ""Platoon"" powerfully conveys the terrifying aspect of war as more than a series of battles opposing two military forces, but as a conflict taking place in another arena of angst, pain and fear: the minds of young soldiers, literally torn apart. War as an inner dilemma, incarnated by two visions: one humanistic that can be perceived as pure suicidal crusading, another one, more realistic but that feels like a nihilistic escape. And the power of the film is to incarnate this duality through two characters, two actors who define two approaches to war: Sgt. Elias (Willem Dafoe) the humanistic; Sgt. Barnes (Tom Berenger) the realistic. Chris Taylor arrives in Vietnam with the innocence of a newborn baby and all his initiation will be driven by these two figures, as he says, he was ""raised by these two fathers"".<br/><br/>""Platoon"" shows the three different layers: the conventional Vietnam War, the ""civil war"" within the platoon where half the 'grunts' follow Barnes and the other half, including Taylor, follows Elias, and ultimately, the war as a state of mind. The result is a nightmarish chaos where death can come from anywhere, it might as well be your enemy, and your comrade and even yourself the battles are rarely frontal, rather circular where each spot can reveal a deadly presence. Some soldiers can feel the presence of death, and this very pressure can either paralyze you when you see the enemy coming during an ambush or it can make you shoot at any directions. It can also make a solder snap and provoke the massacre of whole villages. Barnes is pushed to shoot a crying mother in the head, and reaches his breaking point at this very moment.<br/><br/>The village massacre serves to show that in the name of so-called America's ideals, the soldiers killed, massacred and committed deeds that were no nobler than the ones they were supposed to fight. Oliver Stone doesn't condemn or glorify these actions, he only shows them with a gripping realism, showing is enough because it's further than where any other war movie went. It exorcises the inner demons of many Vietnam veterans who couldn't tell what they saw or what they did. It confronts America to its own actions; to the way the countries exploited poor soldiers for a war that wasn't worth it. Maybe the film betrays a hope in Oliver Stone's mind, that the film would encourage the younger generations to be able to use free will before fighting, and not to think that any war is worth to fight just because you owe it to your country.<br/><br/>And Chris Taylor doesn't just incarnate the coming-of-age spirit of the film; he represents the proud American patriotism altered by reality. He volunteered because, like his grandpa fought in WWI, his father in WWII, he embodies the naive attitude that consists to think that any war is a fair war. That's the kind of sensitive nerve patriotism tries to touch, and that's why so many young America went to Iraq to fight because there were massive destruction weapons, and Saddam Hussein was linked to the September 11 attacks, shameful lies that ended up destroying a country. In the beginning, Taylor wants to discover these anonymous guys at the end of the barrel, who define the real America, some who'll make it, some who don't, but it's this camaraderie, this male bonding, this pride to serve the country that drives Taylor's heart. When he's there, he understands the meaning of hell, he understands why people are counting the days before relief, and more than anything he understands why they don't understand his volunteering.<br/><br/>Lack of understanding, impossibility to reason, it's probably this disbelief that is forever immortalized by the shot of this dying soldier rising his arms through the air, trying to reach the unreachable In a country sparing of 'mea culpa', Oliver Stone had the guts to show the reality of the Vietnam War and its psychological affect on young people who started being idealistic before discovering how low can humanity fall in the name of so noble ideals. His next film ""Born on the Fourth of July"" tackled the political aspect but ""Platoon"" is a 100% war movie and an extraordinary psychological thriller as well supported by a magnificent cast of supporting characters (Forest Withaker, Terry Quinn, Kevin Dillon, Johnny Depp, Francesco Quinn, to name a few) and spectacular special effects and sounds. Oliver Stone is also part of the praise not only for the directing but also for the realism he drained from his own experience in Vietnam.<br/><br/>Indeed, just like I thought ""Schindler's List"" was better directed than ""The Pianist"" but ""The Pianist"" was a better told story because it was directed by a man who survived the holocaust, I would establish the same comparison with ""Apocalypse Now"", ""Platoon"" has a less epic scope, but it feels so personal that you know you couldn't get any closer to what the hell of the Vietnam war truly was, and that's what makes it one of the most accurate, thought-provoking and emotionally affecting war movies movie ever made, or simply one of the best."

","One of the best Oliver Stone's 1986 Vietnam era war film Platoon is one of the most authentic and probing films about the Vietnam War ever made. Not only does it show the dedication and courage of the soldiers who fought in the conflict is also shows the underbelly of the conflict as well. The film, which is also written by Stone, stars Charlie Sheen, Forest Whitaker, Willem Dafoe, and Tom Berenger and in one of his first film roles Jonny Depp. The film tells the story of a newly arrived in country volunteer private named Chris played very professionally by Charlie Sheen. In the movie Chris goes from replacement ""new guy"" to veteran soldier in the course of his tour and learns from those around him how to cope with his new surroundings. Along the way he learns how to survive not only the enemy but also the environment and even those on his own side. He also learns to become a man from 2 polar opposites and as he puts it 2 separate fathers. They are Staff Sergeant Barns played by Tom Berenger and Staff Sergeant Elias played by Wilem Dafoe. Both of these characters play a big part in the development of Chris and how he views the war and life in general. Staff Sergeant Barns is more of the no-nonsense hard charging win at any cost influence while Staff Sergeant Elias is the more sage-like and introspective influence who takes a wider view of things. Throughout the film Chris evolves and scared and somewhat excited volunteer to savvy and jaded veteran. The films main theme is one of good vs. evil. This can be seen in many of the scenes and in the contrast between Dafoe and Berengers characters. The motif fits in well with the theme because Chris constantly has to choose between what he sees at right and wrong. This is especially true in the scenes concerning the Vietnamese village. Music and soundtrack are great in this movie. The songs, both original and not original fit in perfectly with the time period and move seamlessly throughout the film and set the mood perfectly. The battle scenes in this film were, for the time, some of the best ever shot until Saving Private Ryan came along and they set the standard for all that followed. This movie will go down as one of the classics of not only war films but of all films in general regardless of genre. This is truly an American classic."

","This movie is on the top of my list of favorite movies ever. My mom even hates war films, but loves this movie! Even though I detest some of the actors, such as Charlie Sheen, Keith David, Kevin Dillon, and Tom Berenger....I still love this movie because it depicts the Vietnam war. We Were Soldiers and Platoon are my two favorite Vietnam war films because of the gruesome action and it makes me have very high respect for war veterans. Oliver Stone did a fantastic job on showing the terrors of war and how it can drive people literally insane. As it the subtitle says ""The first casualty of war is innocence"", which I find shocking...but it is very true. If you haven't seen this movie, it is a must-see and don't listen to all those Platoon haters, they must not have respect for the war veterans....because this movie shows exactly what they had to go through in the battles. I always watch this movie on memorial day....its truly amazing."

","""Platoon"" is timeless and describes the reality of the Vietnam war better than any other. This film is not your typical cheesy Hollywood movie, and it is not surreal.<br/><br/>Platoon makes everything seem very real. The film does try to be black and white and is not afraid to show the complexities facing fighting men in Vietnam. However, the real greatness of this film is in the gritty realism of the characters. Stone gathered a great and diverse collection of actors. Each character well developed and unique. In deed, the viewers are allowed to look at these characters and choose which one best represents them and in that, perhaps sees how they might have done in Vietnam. Charlie Sheen's character is innocence, heading for war. When he arrives in Vietnam, he must make the choice of what kind of soldier he will be. Will he emulate Sargent Barnes, a hardcore lifer that believes in killing them all and staying alive? Or will Sheen's character choose to join the souls under Sargent Elias, a compassionate veteran, who realizes that American soldiers are still human beings and should act as such. The greatness of this film, is that the choice is not cut and dry. Barnes represents the frustration of many grunts in Vietnam. The frustration of seeing many friends die and not knowing who your enemy is. The frustration of being placed in a foreign land and not knowing how to win. Many young men see Barnes as their savior, the man that will kill the enemy and keep them alive. Although Barnes is evil, one can see why men would be attracted to him. However, for many, Barnes is the worst of what war turns people into. These optimists cling to their humanity and to Elias, a Christ-like figure that attempts to keep the souls of those young soldiers pure. This film takes the viewer to Vietnam and puts them in the jungle. It shows us why we would never ever want to be there."

","Its hard to know where to start with such a breathtaking film. Oliver Stone's Platoon is quite simply the best Vietnam war film ever made in my opinion. Everything about it is as close to perfection as we are likely to see. Charlie Sheen plays the lead, and Willem Defoe and Tom Berenger play the two sergeants that form a key part of the plot.<br/><br/>Chris Taylor (Sheen) is torn between the sergeants. Barnes (Berenger) is the battle hardened, brutal murderer, who uses the war as an excuse to tender to his sadistic pleasures. Elias (Defoe) is the other side of the spectrum. We get the sense that he has wrestled with his inner demons, but he has successfully come through to the other side. He has compassion for his fellow man, and he uses drugs as a form of escapism from this brutal war. The two symbolise the struggle that Taylor must face if he is to survive out in Vietnam.<br/><br/>Oliver Stone perfectly captures war. The shooting is frantic and impossible to follow. It perfectly disorientates us, just as the soldiers were. We have no idea who is being shot at, and neither do they. We follow the war at ground level, and see the brutalities first hand. Having served in Vietnam, the film is loosely based on Stone's time out there, and Taylor loosely based on himself.<br/><br/>Full Metal Jacket showcases how inhumane the war was, Apocalypse Now turns it into a story about life in general, and hopelessness, but Platoon has everything. Trying hard to avoid the old cliché, but if you only watch one war film, make sure it is this one. Nothing else can come close."

","Oliver Stone wrote the story based upon his experiences as a U.S. infantryman in Vietnam to counter the vision of the war portrayed in John Wayne's The Green Berets entitled,Platoon.It stars Tom Berenger, Willem Dafoe and Charlie Sheen together with Forest Whitaker,Francesco Quinn,John C. McGinley,Richard Edson and Kevin Dillon.It is war film written and directed by Stone,which is the first of his Vietnam War trilogy, followed by Born on the Fourth of July; and Heaven & Earth.<br/><br/>Platoon is a brutally realistic look at a young soldier's tour of duty in Vietnam. Chris Taylor is a college student who quits school to volunteer for the Army in the late '60s. He's shipped off to Vietnam, where he serves with a culturally diverse group of fellow soldiers under two men who lead the platoon: Sgt. Barnes, whose facial scars are a mirror of the violence and corruption of his soul, and Sgt. Elias, who maintains a Zen-like calm in the jungle and fights with both personal and moral courage even though he no longer believes in the war. After a few weeks, Taylor begins to see the naïveté of his views of the war, especially after a quick search for enemy troops devolves into a round of murder and rape. <br/><br/>This movie excels in the sense that it is a grunt's-eye view of the war, touching on moral issues but focusing on the men who fought the battles and suffered the wounds. It resembles older war movies more than its Vietnam peers, as it mixes familiar elements of on screen battle with small realistic details: bugs, jungle rot, exhaustion, C-rations, marijuana, and counting the days before you go home together with a contemporary sensibility and the psychological effects it has brought to the soldiers involved.Also,the cast involved were brilliant in their performance.It is a masterpiece, once seen, will never be forgotten, and, at least for those who were not in Vietnam, will forever alter the way in which the war is considered."

","I was there as Oliver Stone was in 1968, 25th Infantry Division, Dau Tieng, S. Vietnam (of the Tropic Lightning Division). Oliver was a PFC (E-3) in the 3rd Brigade (Infantry) and I was a PFC in D, 65th Engineer Bn... both units based in Dau Teing.<br/><br/>The setting of the movie is over by the Cambodia border on Search and Destroy missions, January 1968, just before the 1968 Tet Offensive (February 1968). I was a Combat Engineer in direct support of the Infantry (3rd Brigade) and went everywhere that the Infantry went and fought along side each other during combat action.<br/><br/>The movie was about pre-Tet Offensive combat action during Operation Yellowstone, January 1968. Oliver did an excellent job of rein-acting the combat action. He labels the movie as ""fiction"", but it is NOT. Oliver did change a few things, though. 1) he changed the time-frame of the big battle to the last part of the movie. Actually, the battle took place earlier, January 2, 1968, at Forward Fire Support Base Burt. Oliver had to do that in order to make sure the climax of the movie was the last action to take place. That would have been premature in the sequence of the movie to have it upfront in the movie. The battle was called the Battle of Soui Cut. And, 2) the enemy was NOT North Vietnamese Army (Regulars, (NVA)). They were strictly Viet Cong (VC). I walked over the dead bodies of about 382 enemy Viet Cong soldiers. There were zero (0) NVA soldiers fighting at this battle, only VC. I suppose Oliver changed that because NVA soldiers may seem more combat worthy, more dynamic and exciting for the movie. With those two changes, yes, it was fiction, but everything else was non-fiction and factual. About 30 US soldiers died that night with a few hundred wounded in-action.<br/><br/>The meaning of the movie was how soldiers interact with one another during highly stressful combat, day after day. Its not pretty. I saw the same thing as soldier fought with one another. Thats reality.<br/><br/>Hats off to Oliver Stone for finally making the movie in 1986, 18 years after his Vietnam experience. I always thought that I would write a book or something about my experience, but never did.<br/><br/>I have suffered from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) since my Army experience, 1968, Vietnam... as many other combat soldiers have. I'm 63 years old now and still have day and nightmares."

Harrowing, Disturbing, Savage, Brutal, Violent, Gruesome, Mortifying and Moving are just some words to describe this but it's brilliant too. I was upset when Elias (Dafoe) died.

When I saw this movie the first time, I don't think I moved, in my seat, for two hours. When I came out of the theater, I felt like I had been driving in deep snow for 6 hours. Totally wrung out. The next day, I went to see it again, this time with a date. She had to leave after about the first hour because she said it was too intense. No argument from me. Thankfully, she insisted I stay and watch the rest of it. Again, no argument from me.

Full Metal Jacket dealt with the pressures the young troops had cope with before being shipped out to war, and Apocalypse Now centered its attention on Marlon Brando's and Martin Sheen's characters - but Platoon is far more realistic and shocking then both of those films.  Oliver Stone constantly bombards you with graphic images and emotions never displayed on film at that point in time.  It is a true depiction of what the Vietnam war (or any war for that matter) was - a mistake.  Willem Dafoe and Tom Berenger literally fight for the viewers innocence - and you feel like you're thrown right into the middle of the battle.  An amazing achievement."

"showmethemoviescontact","9","1","1","25 February 2017"," Platoon ShowMeTheMovies Review
","With Oscars weekend underway, I thought it would be appropriate to review a movie which won best picture exactly thirty years ago at the 59th Academy Awards. Platoon totalled four Oscar wins, and eight nominations - the leading picture of the year, so it begs the question - has Platoon stood the test of time? Platoon follows Chris (Charlie Sheen) and his stint in the Vietnamese War, alongside fellow protagonist Sgt. Elias (Willem Dafoe) and cruel manipulator Sgt. Barnes (Tom Berenger). The plot simply tells the story of the platoon both during and outside of battle, to give a 'big picture' take on the conflict to show multiple sides of the soldiers.<br/><br/>If you have ever heard this song before, (likely you have, many times), it's interesting to note that Platoon made Adagio for Strings as famous as it is today. Despite this, its' severe overuse happens to be my biggest criticism of the entire film. Don't get me wrong, I'm sure its' 1987 viewers will have watched in awe in deep melancholy, but presently its' use in essentially every death scene (of which there are more than a few, I kid you not!), comes across as horrifically cliché.<br/><br/>The film was clearly low budget, so there are times where action sequences with explosions do not look true-to-life, and the Platoon involved sometimes appear too small due to the cinematography and an absence of more actors/unavailability of CGI.<br/><br/>However, other than a few mere complaints, the movie is dramatic, compelling and by definition: Oscar-worthy. While issues can be drawn from the low-budget action, this, and I guess I'm contradicting myself here, completely misses the point of the film. Platoon shows the true horrors of war, the relationship comrades have with one another during their down-time between conflict, and the issues that allies can have with one another: even if they're meant to be brothers in arms.<br/><br/>In my review of Hacksaw Ridge, I explained that there are too many war films which make staring death in the face look incredibly fun; count Platoon among the films that do not do this. With magnificent acting from Tom Berenger and Willem Dafoe, the film is a saddening story, as interesting as it is brutal; deliberately not providing a polished version of events.<br/><br/>Platoon received the praise it deserved, and it will be exciting to see which movie will join it among the list of best picture movies at the Oscars this year; it is well worth a watch and I thoroughly enjoyed the movie overall."
"dworldeater","9","1","1","28 August 2014"," Great Vietnam War film from Oliver Stone
","Coming off Oliver Stone's underrated, but not so successful feature Salvador. Platoon is a critical and commercial success. At this point Oliver Stone had made his mark in Hollywood as an excellent screenwriter with classics like Conan The Barbarian, Scarface and The Year Of The Dragon. This production was his breakout film as director. However, if you ask me Salvador(which Oliver wrote and directed right before Platoon) is a great film that never got the respect it deserves. Platoon is the first Vietnam War film to be made by a veteran and was based on Oliver Stone's experiences. Platoon is a very well structured and great looking film that captures the gritty essence of war but is beautiful to look at as well. Characters are rich and well developed and the story flows smoothly from scene to scene. Performances are top notch from an up and coming cast of great actors and future stars such as Charlie Sheen, Willem Dafoe, Tom Berenger, Keith David, Forest Whitaker, John C Reily, etc. The story is told through Charlie Sheen's(Chris) perspective and is a morality tale about innocence lost, different takes on the war from soldiers who support the war and those who do the best they can to stay alive and survive a war they found to be immoral and insane. Willem Dafoe is from the latter camp as Sgt. Elias. Tom Berenger delivers his best performance as hard as nails hawk Sgt. Barnes. Following in the footsteps of his father(Martin Sheen) the underrated Charlie Sheen does an excellent job as the lead in his own classic Vietnam War film. The battle scenes are gritty and Oliver did not try to sugar coat the material in any way. He shows the madness and brutality of the war and did not shy away from showing atrocities that became associated with the war. The film won a richly deserved Oscar for best film and director in 1986 as well as best sound and film editing. Platoon made its mark and hold up great decades later as well as making Oliver Stone a household name."
"SnoopyStyle","9","1","1","28 November 2013"," The quintessential Vietnam war movie
","It's September 1967, and Chris (Charlie Sheen) has just arrived in Vietnam. He is sheltered and his father and grandfather fought in the military. As the new guy, nobody cares to be his friend. Lt. Wolfe (Mark Moses) is a weak ineffective leader. His men are divided in two. Some are followers of the cruel Sgt. Barnes (Tom Berenger). Others are followers of the humane Sgt. Elias (Willem Dafoe). In the end, Barnes and Elias are in a struggle for Chris' soul.<br/><br/>This is the quintessential Vietnam war movie. Oliver Stone has recreated the jungle combat and placed a morality tale in the middle of it. It is possibly Charlie Sheen's greatest performance. His innocence at the beginning evolves into a grizzled veteran fighter. The combat is so realistic, and the story is so compelling. It is a must see for all movie goers."
"CinemaClown","Null","1","1","14 October 2013"," A Genre Masterpiece That Works Even Better As A Meditation On Morality
","Painting a very grim but also realistic portrait of the horrors of war and also illustrating how it affects the psyche & moral ethics of even the bravest, Platoon is a terrific blend of expert direction, compact screenplay & engaging performances that is counted amongst the finest examples of warfare filmmaking and deservingly so.<br/><br/>Set during the Vietnam War, the story of Platoon follows a young American who drops out of college, enlists in the US army & volunteers for combat duty in Vietnam. Upon arrival, he finds himself caught in between two non-commissioned officers who are constantly at odds with each other, and has to battle with not just the enemy but also men within his own platoon.<br/><br/>Written & directed by Oliver Stone, Platoon presents the director brilliantly penning down his personal experience of Vietnam on the paper before bringing it to life in the form of moving images. Stone's direction is truly commendable for he knows what he wants this film to be and what it needs to reflect about war & the deep scars it leaves on anyone who ever was a part of it.<br/><br/>Vietnam is brought to life in detail thanks to its clever set pieces & well-chosen shooting locations. Cinematography keeps a safe distance from all the unfolding drama yet every captured moment has a story to tell. Editing is nicely carried out for the most part & provides a good pace to the narrative. And as for the music, 'Adagio of Strings' by Samuel Barber is a perfect companion piece to go with this war drama.<br/><br/>Coming to the acting department, Platoon features a splendid cast in Charlie Sheen, Willem Dafoe & Tom Berenger and all three of them shine in their given roles. Sheen plays the naive kid who volunteers for war in Vietnam where he undergoes a psychological meltdown of his own and his performance is compelling. Also adding more strength to the acting aspect are stellar inputs from both Berenger & Dafoe, with the latter being the most impressive of them all.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Platoon is Oliver Stone's plea for humanity in the face of something as harrowing & psychologically damaging as war and is a heartbreaking illustration of the loss of innocence, morals & ethics that also says much about the duality of man. It's technically accomplished yet its real strength lies in the its script, direction & admirable performances from its cast. A memorable war drama that works even better as a powerful meditation on morality, Platoon comes highly recommended."
"sme_no_densetsu","8","1","1","8 September 2013"," Possibly Oliver Stone's best
","To be quite honest, the first time I saw Oliver Stone's ""Platoon"" I was disappointed. Perhaps it was the fact that the presence of Charlie Sheen in the lead role invited comparison to ""Apocalypse Now"", starring his dad. However, even though both are war movies set in Viet Nam, comparing them is like comparing apples & oranges.<br/><br/>Stone's film is, first and foremost, a movie about the experiences of 'grunts' in this bloody conflict. In place of the surreal nature of ""Apocalypse Now"", Stone and technical adviser Dale Dye brought a sense of realism to the picture. That being said, while realism was enforced, Stone still managed to imbue his script with deeper meaning.<br/><br/>The story revolves around young volunteer Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen) as he arrives in Viet Nam and quickly becomes acquainted with the horrors of war. Apart from the enemy, there's conflict among the soldiers themselves, as a rift develops between the compassionate Sgt. Elias (Willem Dafoe) and the ruthless Sgt. Barnes (Tom Berenger).<br/><br/>Despite the fact that Charlie Sheen is in the lead role, the acting is actually pretty strong. Berenger & Dafoe were both nominated for Academy Awards but they ended up losing to Michael Caine. The large ensemble cast includes several recognizable actors, often contributing memorable performances. Notable names include Keith David, Forest Whitaker, John C. McGinley, Kevin Dillon and even a young Johnny Depp.<br/><br/>Stone's direction won him one of the film's four Academy Awards. Another Oscar deservedly rewarded the sound department for their contribution to the film. Also notable was the extensive (and effective) use of Samuel Barber's ""Adagio for Strings"". Both visually and sonically, the movie is impressive.<br/><br/>Ultimately, ""Platoon"" isn't quite perfect but it's definitely good enough that I'm glad I gave it a second chance. The movie's realism is commendable and the storyline is thought-provoking. It may be no match for ""Apocalypse Now"" but that only means that it's just a very good movie and not a masterpiece."
"silva-w-pius","8","1","1","21 August 2013"," In war no one wins
","""First real casualty of war is innocents; the first real movie on the war in Vietnam is Platoon""<br/><br/>That is a quote from the trailer that I felt encompassed what I felt about Platoon to a T. What makes Platoon so realistic is that it is part of those rare occasions where you have a story born from a director's firsthand experience, but that's what you get with Oliver stone, who served as an infantry soldier in Vietnam, allowing him to create an almost autobiographical account, and in some instances a documentary into the under belly and less glamour side of war – and by glamorous I mean not a place where you shot bad guys, then come home to a giant marching band and a handshake from the president, but instead it's actually a place where real and sometimes innocent people die. With so much realism it should be no surprise that Platoon won four Oscars in 86 in the best director, picture, sound and cinematography categories. <br/><br/>Platoon tells the story of a student named Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen) in the late 60's who joins up for the army believing in his heart that he is fulfilling his patriotic duty, and I feel in some part that deep down he believes that he will go to Vietnam fire a few bullets and return as a hero. But upon reaching, he joins up with a diverse platoon of men, in the outside world would probably never rub shoulders with, but here they move as one, lead by two men; Sgt. Barnes (Tom Berenger) a man with a scared appearance, that adds to his mystical aura of being a man that cannot be killed and the other Sgt. Elias (Willem Dafoe) who through the use of mind altering drugs is able to maintain an air of calm. But Chris Taylor's dreams of heroism are quickly obliterated as they delve deeper into enemy territory, witnessing acts of despicable evil towards his fellow man by the very same men he serves within the same platoon, making him quickly realises how naive his ideas of war as they are not a rite of passage he once thought but instead war is actually hell on earth where no side wins, captured perfectly in dark and sinister cinematography. <br/><br/>Reading of the credits was like a who's who of Hollywood icons, it was probably one of the most successful bringing together of star names up until then, with the likes of; tom Berenger, Willem Dafoe (Born on the Fourth of July), Forest Whitaker (The Last King of Scotland), Keith David (The Thing), Johnny Depp (Pirates of the Caribbean) and Kevin Dillon. You are guaranteed to find a name amongst them that is one of your favourite actors. But in a sea of big names and future big names, I still felt Charlie Sheen (Hot Shots) was able to stand out and deliver a convincing portrayal of a conflicted man, caught up in the ultimate battle with himself as he has to choose between what's right and doing whatever it takes to survive, so basically choosing between safety of the body or safety of the mind. I also felt with such complex emotions he had to show at a drop of a hat, and doing them so well that it was a surprise and travesty that he wasn't nominated for a single big award. <br/><br/>I really do feel that a man's innocents is truly lost in a war, and it is a shamed you don't get to see it played out on film, but that is what also makes Platoon so special because unlike previous films based on the war in Vietnam such as; Apocalypse Now, The Deer Hunter or Coming Home. Platoon is the very first not to look at the war from the wide perspective, and not get caught up in the big budget special effects. Instead it takes a profound and uncompromising leap into the very depths of the human condition; never shying away from exposing the sinister side to us such is in the case of Sgt. Barnes (Tom Berenger) and penetrating through the sense of false bravado to leaving a film offering a sincere exploration of self."

","First and foremost I must say that Platoon is my favourite movie of all time.I have to admit that when I first watched it way back in '88, it was not as thrilling, as I expected something of the likes of MIA or Rambo. At the time I was 12 years of age and I remember the Vietnam fever was at its peak, in terms of movies eg MIA, Rambo ,POW the Escape to name few.<br/><br/>However, as I watched it for the second ,third and countless other times thereafter, I realised that the movie was and still is a masterpiece. The graphic nature of the war was exceptionally depicted and the acting by the characters of Sgt Barnes, Sgt Elias and Taylor and others was brilliant! Sgt Barnes(Tom Berenger), I truly believe should have been nominated and should have scooped the Best actor at the Academy Awards of 1987 (he was robbed)Sgt Elias should have scooped the best supporting actor award( he was robbed too)The two actors should not have been put together in the same category.<br/><br/>I think that is the way the war in vietman really was (We're gonna lose this war, we've been kicking other peoples asses for so long, I figure its time we got ours kicked)That was the brutal truth. No macho heroism, just reality.<br/><br/>On a scale of 1 to 10 I give Platoon 10 out of 10"

","You could sandwich this between the highly overrated and dismal The Deer Hunter (1978) and the surreal greatness that is Apocalypse Now (1979)... (forget the redux). The Vietnam War was and is quite the problem child of Father America's Soldiers and fighting Men. The unnecessary involvement and complete mishandling of the War, although pretty much uncovered and clear by now, has still not been fully understood by newer Generations.<br/><br/>This is an unforgettable, if slightly overrated, account of a Platoon of Grunts that is rich in Characters but may have tried to compact many long and hard years of boots on the ground into the experience of one group. Given that this is something that could be called ""Artistic License"", we should give Oliver Stone a pass and politely call this Fiction based on Fact. Because that is exactly what it is and the Director knows it and would say that is the intent here.<br/><br/>So many have called this a ""that's the way it was"" Movie. It is in a sense, a once removed sense, of an overview of the total experience that was this unfortunate ""Police Action"" (War was never declared) that claimed the lives of so many and shaped a Generation."
"thewillt08","9","1","1","3 September 2012"," They Fought Themselves more than the Vietnamese
","Before he was winning and before he was on his own drug, there was Platoon. Platoon stars Charlie Sheen and Willem DaFoe in the 80's. They are soldiers in the Vietnam War. They experience the full blown hell that war produced. Platoon was directed by Oliver Stone and most of his movies are very long and have extreme detail. Platoon is no exception having a deeper meaning than what is shown. Vietnam veterans suffered greatly during and after the war. Platoon shows the suffering during the war. I thought it was interesting how towards the end a soldier is talking the Sheen and he says if they survive the war they will go home heroes and life will be easy. In reality it was the exact opposite and I wonder if soldiers really thought that or if that was just for comic relief. Either way the story was basic, fight the war and survive, but it turned into something more. It turned into what is right and wrong in warfare and how or who to fight. Soldiers in Vietnam were exposed to drugs and Platoon shows how soldiers would relax by taking drugs and smoking cigarettes. The reactions to these drugs and the warfare itself drove soldiers insane and caused them to commit terrible acts that Platoon portrays. Platoon was historically accurate as well and that is very important. Situations the movie showed really happened. The scene where they raid the village and terrorize the farmers actually happened. It was a historically known massacre that really happened; I just can't remember the name. Soldiers didn't know who the real enemy was so they attacked everybody. Innocent people suffered because American soldiers could not control themselves and the pressures of the war got to them. They raped, murdered, and pillaged the village and that was just the beginning. They weren't only fighting the Vietnamese; they were also fighting each other. Barnes and Elias had their differences and they fought constantly but the betrayal of Barnes where he basically murdered Elias was just epic. That scene was just so bone chilling. Barnes chases him down and they stare each other down. It's a showdown and they look like they can read each other's minds. Barnes shoots and Elias falls down to the ground. Barnes tells Chris, Sheen, that he is already dead. Chris and Elias were good friends and shared similar opinions on the war. Barnes and Chris retreat to the helicopter but as they go up they see one of their own running towards the helicopter. It was Elias. He ate so many bullets and was bleeding everywhere. It was the ultimate betrayal. He was killed by his own squad and he raised his arms and looked up to the sky which became a classic pose from the movie. He falls over, dies and the helicopter flies away. Throughout the movie there is music from the Vietnam era but in every sad or serious scene the same tune of violins plays and makes the scene so much better. I always say the music can be the most important part of a movie. It sets tone and mood. It can make or break a scene and every time those violins played the audience knows the scene is important. Let me make one thing clear. I hate Charlie Sheen. I don't think he is funny; he is crazy, and a terrible actor. He should not be allowed to make anything else in the industry but that is just my opinion. Luckily this was before all of that garbage and he really did a good job. In parts of his acting I laughed and thought it was ridiculous but about an hour into the movie he stepped it up and did an amazing job. It made me respect the man more for his acting and what he had in his young career. It is a shame he let drugs ruin his life. My problems with the movie were that there were a lot of characters, possibly too many. Forrest Whitaker and Johnny Depp were in the movie but they disappeared. They were important for a scene and then I don't know what happened to them. Did they die? Did they leave the war? I don't know. Maybe somebody can let me know so please comment. For a war movie it wasn't the best I've seen but it wasn't really about the war between the Vietnamese but more about the war with themselves and the betrayal of soldiers. It was more emotional than physical and in a movie about Vietnam that should be portrayed so kudos to Platoon for that. Overall it was a fantastic movie that was more than a war movie but an emotional tale of soldiers in the Vietnam War. They suffered greatly and this movie probably most accurately portrays the devastation of the war. Action, acting, emotion, music, and overall performance were all good. Platoon easily gets the WillyT seal of approval but Charlie Sheen needs to just go away. I really just don't like the man or anything he is in, other than this movie. I could watch this movie again and again and can be viewed alone or with friends. Don't let young kids watch it obviously; listen to the rating on the movie because it will probably not end well but still a great film for mature audiences."

That part of war is a crime of its own!! This movie is packed full of SO many of Hollywood's greats...Charlie Sheen, Forest Whitaker, Kevin Dillon, & Johnny Depp just to name a few.

","Platoon is a gritty, unadulterated war film without the usual Hollywood sugar-coating or patriotic banter. It is wonderfully impartial- showing the brutalities of war from both sides. It does not stop to white wash the soldiers or get distracted of its special effects. The frustration, the confusion, the helplessness and the rage that springs through it is captured brilliantly by the director.<br/><br/>The characters are intricately woven. Although I felt that the lead, played by Charlie Sheen, was a tad weakly portrayed. Not to say that he was bad, but the character could have brought to life better. Tim Brener and William Dafoe delivered stellar performances as the two rival sergeants. The whole cast was brilliantly picked to complement the intelligent storyline. <br/><br/>I shall not get in to the plot as this is a movie that is better watched than said.<br/><br/>If you are keen on watching a war movie that is intelligent, gritty and powerful- there is none better"

","Coming from someone who has actually been to war, this is an honest and grueling masterpiece which has been under-rated for a long time. They say 'Ryan' broke all the rules for a war movie, go see this one then. Platoon's main villains are in the platoon, who brutally kill fellow soldiers and murder innocent Vietnamese including women and children just for fun. Charlie Sheen plays his best role portraying Oliver Stone in the war, who is probably the only director to make a war movie out of his own experiences. Tom Berenger and Kevin Dillon are the most menacing characters I have ever seen, the only characters I personally wanted to kill on film. To be a Vietnamese watching this film must have been an awful, mind-numbling experience: watching your own descendants get brutally mis-treated as in this movie. 'Saving Private Ryan' was a very good film, but sending the overused message ""war is bad"" is pretty old, but this film is the first to show how Americans were the real enemy. Did Oliver Stone get a medal for this?"

","I find it interesting that many people continue to put the (don't get me wrong) very good ""Saving Private Ryan"" over ""Platoon"" as the best war movie. While I find both to be very good, I find Platoon superior in many ways (first and foremost...OLIVER STONE WENT TO VIETNAM! HE SHOULD KNOW!).  One is that I felt much more connected with the characters.  They were not politically correct (my favorite being the raspy pot head Rhan) they had more depth than any of the characters in SPR.  Also, the combat in Platoon did not feel adventureous, like in SPR.  The enemy was all around, and there was an intense feeling of horror everytime the shooting started, as you never knew how it would end.<br/><br/>An interesting thing to me is that many people say the village scene is unrealistic!?!  What do you mean?  Haven't you people heard of My Lai? Let's leave this one to Stone, ok?"

"macpherr","10","1","1","10 March 1999"," Platoon is a story about making choices and the terror of a war. Autobiographic, and very moving!
","I am a Quaker, meaning someone who does not believe in war. My view is that wars are a form of killing of the poor, the lower middle class,  people get killed because there were no other jobs available to them except to join the military. It is also a form of making money, selling armaments  and the struggle for power. I might be wrong in that! But that is my opinion.<br/><br/>When this movie came out I was in law school and I was fighting my own war at school as law school is much similar to a military regime. I was a basket case!  This movie put terror in my head!  I was terrified.  I said that I would never watch a war movie again in my life!  But I have overruled that principle.  I felt that Chris, Charlie Sheen,  had made a mistake that he admits in his letters to his grandmother.  I kept asking myself why is this kid writing to the grandmother and not his mother. I have watched most of Stone's movies and had read most books written about him. I sense that this movie is autobiographic. Stone and his father could not see eye to eye on things, his parents got divorced when he was fifteen if I am not mistaken. He felt betrayed because he did not suspect that the divorce was coming and perhaps decided that he was alone in the world!  When Stone was at Yale he decided to volunteer when he did not have to!  Oh, God!  Bless his soul!  He believed innocently that he could serve his country. Viet Nam changed a naive innocent recruit who went to war, and allowed him to see the ambiguity of the war.  The platoon started fighting between itself and killing innocent civilians, because the two sergeants could not get along. This conflict of choice turns the young recruit into a man that we now know as one the best writers, directors,  producers of our days.  As Chris, Stone seems to have his own opinions about things, (Stone is also the only child and this is an only child syndrome), he comes up with projects that he feels are the right thing to do and does them alive or dead! Stone parallels Chris' choice to go to war in his own life. He is very independent. There is always a price to pay for being independent!  That is clear in Platoon.<br/><br/>I could never come up with stuff that Stone does.  Still after having seen all that atrocity and although his movies are full of violence, he did not lose his faith and tenderness as one can see him in a cameo appearance  in his movie Salvador, right at the beginning of the movie Stone kisses a little boy. Stone has a worldwide view because he himself admits feeling like a foreigner,  his mother was a French Catholic woman and his father was Jewish. This movie is ""one of the best war movies ever made"", and Oscar worthy movie to me.  As a woman, who is not a believer of war, the movie is about paying the price of our decisions. Chris as well as Oliver Stone did not have to volunteer to go to Viet Nam. They felt that they could make a difference as a young men going to war. Stone was wounded and earned a purple heart. The cast in this movie is superb as well as the music.<br/><br/>This is my parallel perception of the story of Chris/Stone in the platoon .. . I would like to see this movie re-released to be able to watch  in its entirety without cuts."
"Peach-2","10","1","1","21 January 1999"," Oliver Stone's masterwork.
","Oliver Stone's true passion as a film-maker comes to the screen in vivid life in his biographical film, Platoon. This was one of the most captivating experiences I've ever had while watching a film and I still watch this at least once a year. The cast is perfect. Charlie Sheen has never been better, Tom Berenger is hypnotizing and very scary as Barnes. Willem DaFoe plays Elias as a mentor and guide to life for Charlie Sheen's character. There are similarities between Elias and Jesus Christ, especially when Elias is killed. He dies with his arms outstretched, as if to say he sacrificed himself for his men. Stone's film never misses a beat and proves that he is a film genius."

Perhaps Apocalypse Now has a darker atmosphere, but Platoon is pretty grim. A clean-cut boy loses his innocence like shedding layers of skin as he is immersed into a situation where surviving is the only thing that matters.  A number of shocking moments in this film.  Oliver Stone will never make a better film than this.  You can almost forgive him for Natural Born Killers."
"Don-102","10","1","1","17 January 1999"," Hands down the best film about the Vietnam War...
","The big question about the Vietnam war is this: What were we doing over there? Thousands of young men died for no apparent reason. Oliver Stone makes no direct attempt to answer this question. Every bit of the movie's action takes place in the jungles of Vietnam around 1967 and 1968. However, the horror and madness we see on screen leaves you with a sad feeling in your heart and we realize we absolutely did not belong there, fighting amidst a civil war within a peasant country we knew nothing about. Stone himself fought in the war and this was his experience, with Charlie Sheen playing his alter ego. As Sheen says during the closing narration, ""we didn't fight the enemy, we fought ourselves.""<br/><br/>Many people have drawn comparisons between PLATOON and Coppola's APOCALYPSE NOW, a spectacular film in its own right. These are two distinctly different visions of the war, PLATOON being a gritty, documentary-like version with APOCALYPSE the surreal, fictionalized account. PLATOON is the better war film because of its honest, in-your-face style. Stone utilized hand-held cameras to capture combat in a way never seen before. We get to know the characters of this platoon and how 'civil wars' probably broke out within American units themselves. There are no tricky shots, nor do we see any glamorization of war, as seen in such films as THE RED BADGE OF COURAGE. This is not an artistic depiction of Vietnam like APOCALYPSE NOW. It is bloody realism shown in quite graphic detail, the way it may have been, based on Stone's own experiences.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is superb, painting a non-stereotypical portrait of tragic characters. Of course, Tom Berenger's 'Barnes' and Willem Dafoe's 'Elias', are symbolic of the good and evil that most likely existed within some units. These two characters are essential to the inner struggles going on in Sheen's 'Chris'. The battle scenes are shot in such a way that we are put right in the middle of the action, seeing what the soldiers saw. It is nearly impossible to know where the enemy is and who you are shooting at, and there is a frightening scene involving Sheen as the platoon's lookout, who is paralyzed with fear, unable to act while the enemy creeps upon them. The madness of the war is more emotionally powerful than in APOCALYPSE because we are closer to these events and there are virtually no breaks in intensity.<br/><br/>I ask anyone who disagrees with my assessment regarding this film and APOCALYPSE to watch both back to back. Anti-war films are at their best when we are moved emotionally, and I assure you will be more wiped out after PLATOON. Again, APOCALYPSE is a great movie, however, do you really care about a fictional mission up a river to kill an insane American? You be the judge. PLATOON and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN are the two most emotionally shattering and best anti-war films."
"chip98","10","1","1","13 January 1999"," One of our best war flicks.
","To me, this was a surprise from Oliver ""Reagan-is-a-fascist"" Stone.  One of the few Vietnam flicks that gives a fair account of what it's like to fight on the ground in a war run by strategy-free nitwits, though Mr. Stone probably didn't intend it that way.  The personal conflicts and dilemmas come across as real and plausible, without the usual Hollywood pacifist moralizing--until we get Charlie Sheen's sentimental (and dead wrong) voice-over at the very end.  (Historical note: some of the marquee posters for Platoon advertised a story from America's ""bloodiest and most unpopular"" war.  Neither description is true.)"
"critic-22","10","1","1","13 January 1999"," First person perspective
","Yes. I love watching platoon. There was some great acting and drama going on which was edge of the seat sort of stuff. The elements also played a role (rain etc), which helped to make a convincing movie. Nevertheless, by Oliver Stone using a first person perspective, the audience knew the main character was not going to die, which in turn reduced the thiller nature of the film as we knew nothing serious was going to happen to SHEEN. Saving Private Ryan gave the impression of a real war with enemies and not know who was going to survive. Platoon is a fantastic drama, not about war in itself, rather a character study of the effects of war upon people who are meant to be close to you. The real enemy was within than external. Oliver Stone shows that America can be the enemy with undisciplined soldiers and conflicting leaders which made the movie a classic which it is."

"Movie-12","10","1","1","10 June 2001"," One of the most vivid, anti-war movies every made. Superior performances. **** (out of four)
","PLATOON / (1986) **** (out of four)<br/><br/>""Platoon"" was one of the first movies to portray its subject in a way that does not glamorize war. Many war movies, such as the recent ""Pearl Harbor"" and ""The Patriot,"" create an involving sense of adventure and strategy, thus shinning an entertaining light on combat. ""Platoon"" set the standards for war movies to follow. It is an unmistakable, startling depiction of Vietnam. No other war movie more graphically presents its material as believable and disturbing; not ""Apocalypse Now,"" ""The Deer Hunter,"" ""The Killing Fields,"" or ""Saving Private Ryan."" This is the kind of movie young people should watch before they enlist in the army. It will make them think twice about their decision.<br/><br/>The film's main character is said to be based on director Oliver Stone's personal experiences while fighting in Vietnam. His name is Chris (Charlie Sheen) a college student who enlists in the military because he believes it to be his patriotic duty. The movie introduces the character's environment uncomfortably well. We sense many soldiers lack rest and fulfillment; many are at the point of physical breakdown. There are long shots of exhausted soldiers wandering through the woods, potential danger lurking behind every tree. A snake slithers around a soldier's leg. Dozens of red ants crawl down a resting man's neck. We can almost feel the enormous weight of their backpacks on our shoulders. The portrait Stone paints is unimaginably vivid; we squirm in our seats.<br/><br/>The soldiers often sit around, discuss things of no importance, use drugs, dance, and act like general fools. The film portrays the soldiers as many might believe actual soldiers behave. ""Platoon,"" gives each character a personal dimension. The actors inject a taut edge into the characters. Charlie Sheen creates the illusion that Chris listens and thinks about the words and actions of others. He is an inquisitive, just character, displayed with a sense of unease and frustration. Willem Dafoe, arguably at the center of the film, delivers a strong performance as a skilled fighter, but a man who tries to escape the horrific realties through drugs. The most thought-provoking, powerful performance comes from Tom Berenger, as a sadistic, determined veteran sergeant with a face deformed by a vast history of bullet wounds. Even the supporting cast, including Forest Whitaker, John C. McGinley, Francesco Quinn, Kevin Dillon, Johnny Depp, and Tony Todd, convincingly display a sense of fear and disorientation.<br/><br/>
""Platoon"" makes clear that war is hell. Oliver Stone writes no actual plot, but instead a collection of scenes that do not contain adventure, strategy, or orientation. We realize any character could die at any given time. The enemy is not given personality, or even a point of view. We see them as the soldiers see them, as distant figures in the jungle paths. They provoke a clear impression of danger lurking from all around. There is little evidence of choreography or style. The battle scenes has no order. Most of us will never know what war is like, thank God for that. But movies like this can give us an appreciation of combat, and of Vietnam.<br/><br/>I would like to close this review with the final lines of the movie. I feel these accurately conclude the statement ""Platoon"" makes about Vietnam.<br/><br/>
""I think now, looking back, we did not fight the enemy, we fought ourselves. The enemy was in us. The war is over for me now, but it will always be there, the rest of my days. As I'm sure Elias will be, fighting with Barnes for what Rhah called ""possesion of my soul."" There are times since, I've felt like a child, born of those two fathers. But be that as it may, those of us who did make it have an obligation to build again. To teach to others what we know, and to try with what's left of our lives to find a goodness and a meaning to this life.""<br/><br/>Charlie"

","This is one of the best movies I've ever seen, and not just war movies. I mean all movies. Oliver Stone did an excellent job of depicting the struggle to get along between men in a chaotic setting.<br/><br/>Tom Berenger does an excellent job playing the hardcore Sergeant Barnes who sees the only way to win the war is to blow away anyone and everyone innocent or not. His superb acting makes the viewer dispise him, and cheer at his ironic but obvious demise.<br/><br/>Willem Defoe does a great job acting and should be in a lot more movies period. He has an awesome talent that is never seen because he stars in movies that aren't totally mainstream. He plays the opposing role to Berenger. Sergeant Elias, a man that sees himself in the hell of vietnam but keeps his humanity instead of turning into a savage with no morals like Berenger.<br/><br/>Let's not forget Charlie Sheen who does an outstanding job. Especially when compared to his other movies Hot Shots, Hot Shots Part Duex, Major League, Major League 2. Although funny and good for a laugh are not worth his time when he could act in a movie that has a meaning.<br/><br/>This movie is great and only bettered when you watch it on DVD.

","Platoon has got to be one of the greatest war movies of all time. The story centers around a rich boy (Charlie Sheen) who goes to fight in Vietnam, because he feels the poor and downtrodden of america shouldn't be the only one's fighting for our country. While in Vietnam we see the transformation of Sheeen's character from the ignorant child he was into a real soldier. This comes at the hands of two sargents who have opposing ideas on the treatment of people in a Vietnam village. The two sargents played by Willam DaFoe and Tom Berenger, idealize the typical types of people in Vietnam, those in control, and those who are real leaders. Sheen turns in an absolutely stunning portrayal of a newbie grunt, while the supporting cast does a magnificent job to add life to the brutal story. Stone did some of his best work in this movie demontrating a brutally real picture of the Vietnam war. This movie should be a must see for any one with a television set and a VCR."
"markd813","10","1","1","9 December 2000"," A review
","`Somebody once wrote: Hell is the impossibility of reason.'  That's what this place feels like: Hell.'<br/><br/>So Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen) writes home after experiencing combat in Vietnam.  What makes Oliver Stone's account of the Vietnam War so remarkable is the depiction of that complete lack of reason.  This is not a war where the lines of battle are distinctly drawn.  The fighting overlaps itself.  We see soldiers surrounded on all sides while sleeping.  We see American bombers attacking their own troops after a miscalculation in coordinates.  We see a Vietcong soldier strapped with explosives run into a tent filled with officers.  We see the war for how it must have been: total chaos. Confusion permeates scenes of brutality.  No one in the film knows what is going on.  Why are they fighting?  How do they end up here?  Will they die in the next battle?<br/><br/>These questions are at the heart of Platoon.  There is no real plot to the film and to try to describe one is demeaning to the film's content.  I will only say a major theme of the film is conflict.  However, it is not only the conflict between two armies fighting for two distinct causes, but also the conflict among the soldiers on how to fight.  The `why' of fighting never comes into play, because there is no reason to ask `why' they are fighting. The soldiers are as confused as the civilians are.  At one point, the platoon is surprised to learn they have crossed into Cambodia.<br/><br/>The lines of combat are drawn within the American troops as well.  There is a conflict of conscience.  The sides are very distinct, and the leaders are as different as two men can be.  The first, Sgt. Barnes (Tom Berenger), is a scarred, war-torn man, who, at one point, kills an innocent woman to force her husband to talk.  The second, Sgt. Elias (Willem Dafoe), is a kind, concerned man who stops Barnes from massacring the entire village.  As the film progresses and we see the chaos continue, we know that these two men represent, in completely general terms, good and evil.  By the end of the film, Chris will have learned from both these men, and we see his education progress throughout the story.  One minute he shoots at the feet of a crippled civilian to make him dance and the next stops a gang rape.<br/><br/>There is social conflict, also, among the troops.  Chris is an enlisted soldier, one of the few among a platoon of drafted men.  They express their disgust with a system that filters out the poor and uneducated to fight and die in place of the privileged.  Race is another qualification in the draft, and the African-American soldiers state hatred for the system also.  No one in the film wants to be in Vietnam.  Even Chris who signed up knows he has made a terrible mistake the instant he steps off the helicopter.<br/><br/>Stone argues that evil won the war.  The complete confusion lead to chaos, and in this chaos, the war was fought and lost.  This loss was not military, political, or social, but moral.<br/><br/>At the end of the film, Chris says that those who made it out of Vietnam have an obligation `to try with what's left of our lives to find a goodness and a meaning to this life.'  After what we have seen occur in the film, it is almost impossible to believe that any of them will find these things. It is this fact that makes the film utterly heartbreaking."
"Orific","5","5","12","22 September 2006"," I do not agree...
","...with the majority of people commenting on this film. It is described by many as:<br/><br/><ul><li>one of the best (if not the best) film on war ever made,</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>better than Apocalypse Now</li></ul><br/><br/>For the first point, I am pretty sure than a lot of better things have been done on war; for the second point, I am on the edge of crying when thinking that some people dare compare it to Apocalypse Now !...<br/><br/>But let's not start a flame war. To comment on it, first the director could have made more of some parts of the movie. The tensions between the members of the platoon could have been exploited much better. The main character (Taylor) could have used a far sharper depiction. The war scenes are better, quite realistic. But the scenes describing the ""abuses of war"" seemed really gratuitous.<br/><br/>The acting is good. I really liked some of the second parts (Keith David for example). But the main ones deserve little praise. I am pretty sure that Charlie Sheen had the leading part on the only basis of his being the descendant of the much more convincing leading actor of Apocalypse Now. Even the use of him as the voice off smells like a ""réchauffé"" of Coppola's masterpiece. Dafoe is not very convincing, which is all the more regrettable that his part was important in the ""propos"" of the film.<br/><br/>Concerning the sound track, I will only say that it is typically Hollywoodian.<br/><br/>I was maybe a little severe due to my expectations, since I had read some of the comments on IMDb before watching it. I should maybe replace it in the context of the time when it was released (cold war, triumphant Reaganism). I should maybe not try to see it as a film about war in general, but rather on the specific experience of American soldiers in Viet Nâm. But even in this case, my rating would not change by much (well, maybe half a star more).<br/><br/>Once again (don't think I am being partial, but I was really upset by some comments on this matter): it CAN NOT be compared to Apocalypse Now. This latter was raising the Viet Nâm war context up to a more generalist level, allowing a deep introspection in the implications and necessities of ""warfare"". Nothing in common with the bits of reflection scattered here and there in Platoon."

","A rich kid joins the military out of guilt and is appalled by the behaviour of the underclass who he selected as his comrades.<br/><br/>George Orwell said, ""I have known numbers of bourgeois Socialists. I have listened by the hour to their tirades against their own class, and yet never, not even once, have I met one who had picked up proletarian table manners. Yet after all why not? Why should a man who thinks all virtue resides in the proletariat still take such pains to drink his soup silently? It can only be because in his heart he feels that proletarian manners are disgusting.""<br/><br/>George Orwell spent less than a ha'penny on the production of that quote.

Realistic and emotional, this film serves as a reminder of how the soldiers paid for the price of freedom and the sacrifices they made, and offers an interesting view on war.

","It's hard to say what's ""the best war movie ever"", since it all boils down to opinion. However, this is the best war movie ever when it comes down to the effect it has on people. The mini-war going on within the platoon is what makes this so amazing. The scene in the village is immensely emotional and beautifully executed.<br/><br/>In a war movie, you normally shouldn't have to explain who the villains are, however in this one it is necessary. The enemy, not exactly villains, are the Vietcong, but there is another enemy. SSGT. Barnes is about as big as an enemy within the Platoon can get, and by ""big"" I mean ruthless. Ruthless not just to his own men, but also to the Vietcong, seen in great detail in the village. Tom Berenger deserved that best supporting actor nomination.<br/><br/>Willem Dafoe also did great in this movie. The shot of him raising his arms in the air as he *HUGE HUGE SPOILER AHEAD* gets... still time to look away from the spoiler... he gets shot in the back has become an iconic picture in film.<br/><br/>Charlie Sheen was as good as I've sever seen him in this, and he really made the story seem believable. One scene where the impact of the war and the way his comrades are acting is getting to him is when he defends the two girls in the village, saying they're human beings.<br/><br/>I was surprised to see Johnny Depp in this. This is a great jump on his early career.<br/><br/>Like I stated before, the best war movie comes down to opinion. When it comes to the impact it has on its victims and combatants, however, Platoon wins hands down.<br/><br/>10/10. It deserved that Best Picture Oscar, and Oliver Stone deserved Best Director."

","Filmmakers have a huge responsibility when making historical films, as their film is all most viewers will see on that period or event, and it can shape the viewers perception of it. In Platoon, Oliver Stone tackled the subject of the Vietnam War, and by saying his film was autobiographical ensured more people took it as the gospel truth on what really happened in Vietnam. Actually, it has been proved that he did not experience many of the events of the film, such as the village incident. The biggest inaccuracy of this film is the fact that everything befalling this one platoon would not, could not and did not happen in the time span of this film. During nearly all patrols in reality the enemy was hardly ever seen or heard. The biggest problem an ordinary GI would face was boredom. Also, contrary to what Stone would like everyone to think, not everyone in Vietnam was a drunk or doper. In addition, I find it hard to believe that Chris Taylor would write home to his grandmother such truths as ""Somebody once wrote: Hell is the impossibility of reason. That's what this place feels like: Hell."" Likewise, his voiceover at the end commenting that his platoon's biggest problem was fighting itself, was a little simplistic, especially in view of the bodies of the final battle and other enemy encounters.<br/><br/>The absence of a real plot did not seem to me to matter, as Stone was just trying to show what it was like in Vietnam, even if he did try to rewrite history, rather than tell a story. There were some good elements to the film apart from the fact that it was good viewing to watch; these included its jungle scenes and combat sequences and the fact that the GI uniform, living conditions, age, language and equipment was accurately portrayed. I also enjoyed the acting and became drawn into the conflict between Elias and Barnes. It is just a shame that the vast majority of those who see it believe it is the ultimate true story of what really happened in the war. In reality is is an excellent picture but poor, extremely biased history."

","I was expecting to be blown away by this movie, given I love war films and Oliver Stone was the man behind it but I was very disappointed.  While Platoon is a good overall movie, I found it to be very shallow.  I didn't feel that any actors gave outstanding performances.  I couldn't relate to any of them because the movie didn't give background or develop characters in a way that would show me why they were crazy, scared, strong, weak, etc. Charlie Sheen was very weak.  He didn't make his character intriguing in any way.  The battle scenes saved me from hating it, but I still only gave it a 6."
"themachiavellian","5","5","13","15 January 2005"," Hollywood does Nam...Not Best of Both Worlds
","Stone's Platoon certainly has one thing going for it: potential. I just never thought that it lived up to it. For being a movie about the second most morally ambiguous war in American history (WWI being the first), it was too cut and dry. The Freudian psyche is blatantly paraded around via DeFoe (superego) and Berenger (id), with Sheen as the ego. It too overtly says ""this=good"" and ""that=bad."" Vietam is about gray, not black and white.<br/><br/>Also, it felt very sophomoric. The soldiers' swearing seemed more like they were trying to act tough. They kept saying how everything was politics, and ""the man"" was tying to keep them down. Perhaps this movie is where we get our mental commercialized image of Vietnam troops, but I thought it was cheesy. The entire cast, especially Charlie Sheen, felt melodramatic and maudlin. <br/><br/>Stone's camera work was decent, but at time it felt jumbled, though this served the battle scenes well. They were probably the best part of the movie.<br/><br/>My biggest complaint is Elias's death. If he was running when he got shot, why wouldn't he just fall forward? Why kneel and raise your arms to the heavens, then fall sideways? It sure does make a nice box cover. It's this sort of overly-dramatic sequences that bugged me throughout the film.<br/><br/>Overall, Platoon seemed more like a commercial Hollywood blockbuster cashing in on the war than a mature statement on it. Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket was released within a year of Platoon, and better shows the dehumanization of war (It's a Jungian thing). Both bow before Apocalypse Now, which stars Martin Sheen, Charlie's father, as he is sent to execute Kurtz, who would make Barnes wet his pants.

Plenty of films with the same message (horror of war, evil in men) such as Apocalypse Now or Full Metal Jacket tower way above this one.<br/><br/>
But Stone can't handle subtlety, so he has to beat you over the head with how truly evil our Amercian soldiers were in his eyes.

I do believe the film has it's good points, but its damage to the common view of Vietnam vets is undeniable. <br/><br/>I realize Oliver Stone was a vet, but the view is obviously one-sided. Charlie Sheen's character is based on him and therefore every character is seen through him. Everyone who smokes dope and hangs out in the psychedelic bunker are certainly the good guys and are of course the heroic, top-grade soldiers. Their ""leader"" is Willem Dafoe's Elias. Meanwhile the other side, led by Tom Berenger's Barnes, are just a bunch of dumb rednecks. They sleep in a bunkhouse with Confederate battle flags on the wall, drink beer and whiskey, and listen to Merle Haggard. In the field they are either incompetent cowards or crazed murderers who kill unarmed innocent women and children for fun. <br/><br/>If you want a more realistic portrayal of the ground war in Vietnam, We Were Soldiers is your best bet, followed closely by The Green Berets (at least the first two-thirds, before the ""commando"" mission) and the Vietnam part of Forrest Gump."

","Platoon ranks up there as being one of the greats in war films. Why? My view is because of the angle that it takes on the Vietnam War. Platoon is a movie that drops you straight into the war and within five minutes of seeing the film, you feel like your there with the soldiers. The film follows a young soldier (Sheen) who volunteered and his struggles as he is torn apart between two sergeants. The best praise I can give to this film is it's ability to totally engross you in almost every character in the platoon. There are some very disturbing parts in the film, but they are only placed there to show the true horror of war and the affects it can have on men.

","I think, initially, that ""Platoon"" became to a sociological phenomenon, unintentionally. I don't know whether the American nation was just mature for a reconciliation with the veterans of Vietnam, who were neglected and reviled by society after they returned, or it was just an excellent film, that brought the people out of their shells and the ice to melt. I am not sure about that and it is not from importance. What is important is that ""Platoon"" brought a reconciliation between America's veterans of Vietnam, their families who didn't know anything about their experiences of war and the opponents of the Vietnam war.<br/><br/>Regarding this movie, it is outstanding in its intention and in its making of.

"charlietuna","7","3","7","7 February 2001"," Typical Stone
","Perhaps one of the most over rated yet necessary films made.  Typical of Oliver Stone, the imagery is wooden and the characters stereotypical.  Yet in spite of the crassness of his eye, the movie tells the story of Vietnam in a manner that communicates the complexities of the war to average movie goers.  If we juxtapose Stone's handling of the Mi Lai massacre with Coppola's metaphorical scene of the slaughter of innocents by the boat crew in Apocalypse Now, you see the difference between the art film making and the ""art"" of self righteous cinematic flotsam.  Yet on a real level, Platoon was released during the heat of Reganism and the nationalist chest pounding that went along with it.  Society was swallowing the palled justifications for world wide police actions easier than trickle down economic theory.  In this vein, this hyperbolic reminder of the last great feat of American nationalism run amok was well timed. Unfortunately, this film gave Stone the credibility with which he bashed us with such gems as ""Wall street"", ""Born on the Fourth of July"", and the seminal example of the girth of his ego, ""JFK"".  However, this is a small price to pay if he presented the dangers of being a myopic super power to a polity that had just re-elected an actor as President."

The dialog is terrible, the emotions feel fake and the acting feels forced, and it creeps along at an almost unbearable pace.

","I do not watch Vietnam movies because having served in the war, most are far from the reality my expediences of combat. However Oliver Stone did a great job of bringing his own wartime experience to the screen. Charlie Sheen was not the first choice for his part and his performance showed why. He apparently left a lot of his character wisping away in the smoke of a hash pipe and not in the movie. Worse and by that I mean THE worst actor (not character) but actor was Kevin Dillon. Having watched Entourage and enjoying it, except for Dillon, he also caused my 7/10 score for Platoon. It was just Johnny Drama in Vietnam and Entourage was Bunny survives the war (unfortunately) and goes to Hollywood. Dillon in everything I have watched him in, is a stiff, cardboard cutout of someone that should be there but didn't show up. He has only 2 facial expressions, bad attempts to smile and worse attempts to frown, from which he tries to cover the entire range of a characters emotional actions and responses.<br/><br/>Willem Defoe, Tom Berenger and Forest Whitaker were the three main actors who along with several others rated this movie a 7 for me. The soundtrack was great, the cinematography was excellent and for that Oliver Stone deserves his awards. I have however watched my last anything with Kevin Dillon anywhere in it. <br/><br/>In all, I do so wish Mr. Stone had looked further than Charlie Sheen for an actor, a real actor anyway, and for my money the movie would have been better without the character of Bunny entirely if Dillon was the only choice.

It has occurred to me that I might appreciate it more if I went back and watched it again, but I'm not very inclined to do so. Maybe I also just can't appreciate it as much because I'm a millennial and the Vietnam War is not exactly close to home for me like it would have been for people at the time of its release. <br/><br/>There were just a lot of problems that I found with it. First off, the characters were way to hard to tell apart. This isn't uncommon for war movies since everyone is by necessity dressed the same, but it was more of a problem here because the conflict was more character driven. I could not tell Elias and Barnes apart for the majority of the movie and definitely couldn't tell you how their views differed. I did try to pay attention, but I think that part of my confusion was caused by the two of them not getting distinct enough introductions or dialogue. This applied to all of the other characters too. They weren't distinct enough, and since, the enemy is within the platoon, as is so blatantly pointed out, there should have be more distinction between the characters. Taylor was another problem. He was really generic to the point that he did not feel real at all, which made his voice-over letters to his grandmother quite dry and his random acts of violence just seem weird. It seemed like he had strong views, but none of these really seemed to motivate him outside of his volunteering in the first place. <br/><br/>I know a lot of the appeal of the movie was how it portrayed the experience of the soldiers realistically. Obviously I wasn't in Vietnam so I can't exactly say whether it is, but I found Tim O'Brien's ""The Things They Carried"" to be a lot more compelling and realistic-feeling than Platoon. Regardless, I did not connect with the characters' struggles that much. This is kind of where I feel bad saying that I didn't like it. I know it's not a movie to be enjoyed, but I really like movies that gross me out and make me cringe a little and there was nothing like that in Platoon that I could find.<br/><br/>So, I can't really recommend this that strongly. Obviously a lot of people like this movie, and I don't think badly of them for it, but I find Platoon to be overrated. I wouldn't watch it for fun, because it is by no means made for entertainment. It's kind of something that you should watch to be informed, whether about the Vietnam war or the soldier's plight or something. Overall Rating: 4.6/10"

","My movie choice was one of my favorites of all time, Platoon, it is an academy award-winning movie about Vietnam and how a young man from a wealthy family volunteers for duty and finds himself fighting for not only for his life but lives of his platoon members as well. Chris Taylor played by Charlie Sheen narrates his story through his experiences that he and his platoon encounter with the North Vietnamese and the Viet Cong that eventually leads to a series of events both physically and emotionally demanding. Other actors that were involved in this film, Tom Berenger (Sgt, Barnes), a true veteran in the field and an emotionally strong, violent leader that tries to control the action at all times against his fellow enlisted members. Next, William Defoe (Sgt. Elias), also a true veteran but with a softer more understanding view of the war that after an accidental murder due to the stresses of combat creates tension between him and Sgt. Barnes. Both have major roles in the film and display a good guy bad guy relationship with one another. It reminds me of a movie I have not seen in a while by the name of ""The Siege Of Fire Base Gloria"" another Vietnam movie that has similar concepts as Platoon. Oliver Stone, one of the best directors in the business, with this movie captures the intense drama, and experiences that he himself came to realize as a young Vietnam soldier. It won Oscars for sound, best director, picture, film editing, and several others. This movie involves the most incredible sounds and emotions that I have ever experienced as a movie watcher. Oliver Stone creates sounds that subjectively place the actor with the experience. Through emotional transitional elements of firefights and explosions he creates an on the edge of your seat feeling that keeps the action real from beginning to end.<br/><br/>There were so many different types of sounds and physical emotions it is difficult to choose just one. Some of the specialized purposes of sound were the beginning of the movie with the first musical score by, Vancouver Symphony Orchestra-Adagio for Strings (The 80's rewind, 2008), which if you have never seen this movie it would make no sense to you but to experience it is the most moving piece of music I have ever heard. It transforms your very soul into the movie right from the start and plays throughout the movie to transition the most emotional parts of the film. One thing that I will tell you about this film is about the expansion and compression of time in slow motion. The most intensified, ironic, and emotional part of this type of compression displayed during the death of Sergeant Elias (William Defoe) by far one of the best scenes in any war movie ever made. With many movies out there today Platoon gives you the most realistic experience, and an all-star cast of characters that have moved on to become movie icons in the industry. A must see movie to add to your movie night experience and collection."

","When we see films about fighting in WWII, we see bonding and camaraderie. When we see films about fighting in Vietnam, we see vindictiveness, rape, power plays and questionable loyalties. Filmed with a mixture of subjectivity, as we never leave the journey of the story's particular platoon, and objectivity, as Stone tracks with them from a distance through leaves and bushes, Platoon epitomizes the Vietnam experience. Stone may have based restless but controlled Charlie Sheen's Taylor character on himself, and the film may revolve around him- --and one or two long takes indeed do just so---yet his experience is deeply felt by all of the characters. As he becomes more and more hardened by his journey into the heart of war, Taylor finds himself brusquely wavering between those who gravitate fearfully toward Barnes, an indestructible and forbidding return to one's earliest primordial nightmares, played by Tom Berenger, whose acute perception communicates the intimidating feeling of Barnes' presence, and those who gravitate toward Elias, a sagacious and optimistic veteran, played with self-contained receptiveness by Willem Dafoe, whose compadres, similarly cool and detached, share his accepting aura. These two characters are rivals with every ounce of willingness to mortally conquer one another.<br/><br/>What are alluring are the clues Stone leaves of the ideologies of the two dominant men. The separate congregations of troops, killing time till plodding on the next scorching day, are introduced together consecutively, and again overlap each other before we again see them enmeshed with each other as a seemingly unified single platoon. Taylor is welcomed into a world of pot smoke, nostalgic tunes and philosophical aphorisms in Elias' hut, where Taylor's existential comfort finds itself going to rejuvenate. We later hear Elias say to Taylor, ""I love the stars. There's no right or wrong in 'em. They're just there, man."" Barnes, on the other hand, shares his quarters with men who escape no further from the ever-crystallizing reality of their situation than knocking back beers and playing endless rounds of claustrophobic card games. We see a Confederate flag and a Jesus shrine respective of two peripheral bunkmates here. None of them, at any rate, have any patience for understanding the enemy or the man fighting with them, only enough to digress into the kill-or-be-killed level of fear- and rage-fueled thought processes. So there we have it: the accepting mentor and the intimidating idol, the one who awaits and welcomes free association and the one who lethally forbids anyone to get, or happen to be, in his way, and thus disrespect him. The blue team and the red team, the never-ending Civil War blurring the distinctions from the nameless, faceless savages they must kill to survive. Indeed, there is seldom a certain, indisputable shot of an enemy soldier.<br/><br/>In other Vietnam films like Casualties of War, there is a characterization of good and evil cast upon certain characters who do despicable things outside the bounds of their duty and certain ones who react righteously to them. In Stone's inarguably most personal, semi- autobiographical work, we spend the first half hour coming to like several soldiers whom we, and Taylor, find to have monstrous sides once Barnes leads them into terrorizing an alleged Viet Cong village in what is considerably the most disquieting sequence. They are just like you and me. They are not just dramatized characters.<br/><br/>There is the invariable angst that any motion affords a coin-toss prospect between a protected place or a threatened one. This film easily being the peak profit of Stone's craftsmanship, he assembles his shots to exclude the notion that combat coalesces consistently. Rather than combat sequences in which lines are distinctly evoked, his battle sequences comprise 360 degrees: Any blast or fired round might be aimed at friend or enemy, and in the frantic urgency of combat, many of his soldiers never have a definite conception of precisely who they are shooting at, or why.<br/><br/>There is the music, not only the diverting jams of the era, but a romantically somber orchestral throughline which Stone places with instinctive wisdom. Georges Delerue's gentle, compliant and deceptively vulnerable score sneaks in and out of the periphery. Similarly, the receptive humanitarian zeal of Samuel Barber's Adagio For Strings becomes a relentlessly emotive servant of the universal concerns awakened on screen.<br/><br/>Stone essentially implies the U.S. lost the war in Vietnam owing to tensions within its own forces and a disinclination to go all the way, which leaves one with the dreadful consequence that the measureless anguish and upheaval was for nothing. Stone was able to depict the abomination of war without ever stylizing them. Rather, the effect is all-encompassing chagrin, a generation lost in a conflict that it didn't actually believe in, a generation of young men fighting for a country that didn't truly regard very highly or have a procedure for what was really going on rapt in the jungles, within their own platoons. This was the story we needed to see. It would be the first in a trilogy of Vietnam War films from Stone which penetrated the bilious innards of the Vietnam predicament to present a succeeding generation of Americans and for all those who were alive then the reality and the underhandedness of such a war."

","Chris was once a rich kid, but he drops out of college and enlists to fight in Vietnam, Chris {Charlie Sheen} is a raw and green recruit, but in his platoon he finds a mighty division. One side is led by scarred veteran Sgt. Barnes {Tom Berrenger}, he and his followers have a kill them all mentality that is uncompromising in its intent. On the other side is Sgt. Elias {Willem Dafoe}, an adroit leader who retains his humane sensibility, Chris finds he is the centre of a battle for his soul, the horrors of war now taking on another deadly battle.<br/><br/>Director Oliver Stone has throughout his career ruffled feathers, he is the perennial fly in the ointment to critics and fans alike, what isn't in doubt is that when he gets it right, he leaves most others in his wake, and with Platoon he grabbed the proverbial scruff of Vietnam's neck and shook it senseless. Stone uses his own experiences of being in Vietnam to assault our senses, realism pores out from every crevice of Platoon's limbs. What Stone achieves best is the constant sense of fear and dread amongst the soldiers, this is no recruitment drive for the army, this is the raw and petrified fear of reality, as the tension mounts the locale becomes stifling, our nerve ends preparing to be shredded, whilst visually, Platoon also finds Stone on top form, Robert Richardson's cinematography an incredibly tight allied force.<br/><br/>There are many Vietnam films available to view, and all have something to offer in varying quality, all are important in helping a nation understand via the camera just what the hell, the hell Vietnam was!, but to me Platoon feels grounded in fact, the village massacre at the epicentre of Stone's movie an obvious reference to the real My Lai tragedy, it's merely one part of a whole that makes Platoon a haunting experience. As the credits role i always feel like a bath, i need to wash the blood off my body, Oliver Stone and his Platoon have made me feel desolate, and with that i know the makers here have done their job. 10/10"

","When I first saw this, I felt pretty disappointed in how a sense of the glory of war still seemed to have slipped its way into the mix through the character of Elias, played by Willem Dafoe. Somehow Dafoe's moralistic inner-strength and the way he can run into combat to kick butt without any support because, ""Other people just slow me down,"" seemed incongruous with the overarching point of intensifying the destructive feelings of fear, stress, and anger felt during combat.<br/><br/>However, regarding Elias as a symbol of what the innocent people like Chris wanted to believe came out of war helps to reinforce the theme stated at the end of the movie: ""We are in war against ourselves and our enemies are really within us."" Sergeant Barnes' (Berenger) hidden execution of Elias shows the ultimate destruction of that romantic heroism from within rather than without.<br/><br/>It is from that point that the high levels of violence, bodies ripping apart, disturbing fights, and harrowing warfare surrounds itself to become more than just voyeuristic appraisal of the Vietnam War. Much has been said about Oliver Stone's involvement in the war and how this movie was created of his experiences, but I think it's important to point out that Stone's writing and directing is strong enough that his reputation as a veteran is not the only excuse for the disturbing and disgusting images of a film that has upon second-thought no inspection, but contains itself admirably as a parable for the state of American politics at the time. Sure his use of an almost all-black cast for Sgt. Elias' half of the troop and all-white cast (a good few with strong ""hick"" accents) for Sgt. Bob's half is a bit heavy-handed, but the point is still solid.<br/><br/>This is also probably a really good film to watch just to cast light on a lot of what happens in Stone's other films. Ultimately this is the only Stone film I've seen so far that I've felt comfortable calling a ""Stone film"" because of his strong and specific approach to it. Nothing in this seems as gratuitously extreme, only necessarily extreme.<br/><br/>--PolarisDiB"

","War movies are very different. Usually, these differences depend on the film-makers' experience with war or knowledge of it. Occasionally, the time it was made and society's view towards it has its say in the matter too. This film was made by Oliver Stone, so naturally it's based on his experiences in the Vietnam war. Personally, I don't think there is a better war movie than All Quiet on the Western Front from 1979, simply because it's beautiful, concise and effective without simply showing lots of stuff blowing up or killing off characters we can relate to. Despite that, this film is still worth watching, simply due to how well-directed and intense it is. The plot is quite good, and follows a single platoon through a period in '67, during the Vietnam war. The pacing is good, though I felt that the film started somewhat slow only to later kick up to a very fast pace for a while. There didn't seem to be enough character development. I never picked up on all the names. Maybe there are too many major characters. That's something I often find in Stone's films, making them quite hard to sit through, and requiring more than one viewing to take it all in(which shouldn't be necessary... he's not Kubrick, after all). The acting is great. The casting is great, not one character seems miscast. The special effects are great. The characters are credible, interesting and well-written. The direction and editing is talented and effective. The film has a few memorable scenes, and the dialog contains a good bit of quotable lines. Not much else to say about the film... it's quite graphic and very direct, so you should only watch it if you're completely certain that you can take it. Oh, and John C. McGinley is excellent in the film. I recommend this to any fan of anyone involved in the making of the film, Oliver Stone in particular and fans of war movies. 8/10"

"Tom16uk","8","2","4","24 June 2005"," This is a ""real"" film, and its excellent
","I don't think I've ever watched a film that depicts a real life situation as good as this. It is a rare film in that it is complete - the acting, music, setting and directing are all superb and create an amazingly realistic atmosphere. From watching this film, you will not only be entertained, but you will learn what life was like during the Vietnam War. In case you haven't already heard, Platoon is a war film that presents us with a day-by-day account of young Charlie Sheen, who is struggling to fit in with a group of soldiers, all much older than him. As you should know, the Vietnam war lasted many years and soon became a problem for the American society when the media found out the truth, and as Walter Kronkite, the news reader said ""What the hells going on? I thought we were winning this war!"" (Nope, my gcse in history ain't coming out) But this film concentrates on how the soldiers were feeling, and reacting to the war. Oliver Stone who directed this film put the actors through their paces by actually making them survive in real soldier conditions, were they had to dig there own homes, avoid sleeping on watch duty, and much more. It proved a treat as all the acting in this looks as though the war had started again. Normally at this point, I would comment on the films special effects, but I've got a break because this film just uses very realistic warfare weapons to create the big war scenes. You would think this would make it a preety low budget movie, but when you see the attention to detail, it must have a long film to shoot. This is a great film, but not for the faint hearted. As you would expect from a realistic film, there is lots of blood and 'gorey wound' scenes. And again there's a lot of shooting, the saddest part being when the platoon of troops shoot down a group of innocent villagers due to frustration. Overall, this is a great film. Good acting and great surroundings combine with a theme tune that will never escape your head its that sad and catchy, just like the film."

This is one powerful film with many shocking scenes that will give you the chills . the performances are AMAZINGLY good (more on that later). I was actually expecting this to be very overrated but it wasn't at all and i enjoyed it very much even if it was pretty disturbing. This is a very important viewing for everyone but it's not pretty and hard to watch at times. there is LOTS of graphic violence but not hat much gore. We get some bloody gunshot wounds, TONS and TONS of bloody corpses , a brutal beating with a gun, (and what's said after that had happened is very disturbing). a VERY graphic bloody gunshot wound to the head with blood and brains splattering, and TONS and TONS of very graphic but non bloody gunshot wounds. The acting is Oscar worthy. Charlie Sheen is utterly fantastic and gives an Oscar worthy performance here , he is EXTREMELY likable and did a fantastic job. Tom Berenger is an awesome actor and did awesome here but his character was VERY unlikable. Williem Dafoe is great here as usual i liked him lots. Forest Whitaker and Johnny Depp both do fine with what they have to do and John C. McGinley does okay and Kevin Dillon annoyed me. Overall a classic film that is a required viewing for everyone ***** out of 5 (a true classic)!!!"
"msdiamon","10","2","4","11 November 2004"," There are no battle lines, we are thrown right into the confusion of war.
","Oliver Stone, the man behind JFK, WALL STREET and NIXON just to name a few, brings forth a film that is very close to his heart in PLATOON. This film effectively shows us the grind of war, one which Oliver Stone himself understands well, being a Vietnam vet himself. The combat scenes are not glamorized, each one thrown at us with the purpose of portraying the realities of battle. Saying this, each scene is beautifully framed, often showing no real battle lines, just confusion. We are first brought into Vietnam as an outsider, slowly becoming more and more accustomed to the brutality and apathy that exists all around. Charlie Sheen stars in this film (what's with the Sheen's and Vietnam). He plays an idealistic new recruit who volunteers for combat duty. Through Stone's genius, we observe the war through the eyes of Sheen's character. We land on an air base, witness the realities of being a new recruit, watch a horrific event at a village and see how someone can question one's own morality. Sheen's character gets off the helicopter a very innocent volunteer, not fully understanding of the situation that exists ahead. Well, that will change of course. <br/><br/>Tom Berenger and William Dafoe give extraordinary performances, especially Dafoe. One image of Dafoe in particular (hint is that it deals with him throwing his arms in the air) is about as effective as a movie image can get. As we are taken deeper into the jungle, we are taken deeper into the subplot that exists between William Dafoe's character and Tom Berenger's. I am not going to give away how this dispute starts but lets just say that it started with a shocking incident. The men are split in support of each one, Sheen being with Dafoe. We watch Sheen change into, well, into a man who now has seen the worst of mankind. The last battle is breathtaking to say the least. Berenger and Sheen share an unforgettable moment, one which will linger with you long after the credits fade. At the end, the brilliant score unleashes its might and we see Sheen leave on a helicopter, alone with his thoughts. His monologue at the end puts everything in perspective, we see Stone's view of the war with it as well. Sheen's character still has hope though and still strives to see the goodness that exists in life. Platoon is one of the better films of the 80's and will always be Stone's defining film."

","This is the first in a quadrilogy of reviews I'm set to write on the four great Vietnam movies (Platoon, Full Metal Jacket, the Deer Hunter and Apocalypse Now).<br/><br/>Even before I learned about the background to this movie, I had decided that it was my personal favourite film about Vietnam. After I learnt about how Oliver Stone actually was a soldier in the war and wrote the script based on his own experiences, I believe more adamantly than ever that this is probably the greatest war film ever made. <br/><br/>Charlie Sheen's character arrives in Vietnam, a principled kid from a privileged background who simply wants to do his part and fight for his country. The war very quickly takes it's toll on him, and over a period of weeks he becomes completely exhausted and more than a little insane. In the platoon he's joined there are two veteran soldiers played memorably by Tom Berenger and William Dafoe, who are depicted as supermen, almost unkillable -- and they represent the morality of the story. None of the men are exactly 'good' anymore, they're all killers certainly, but these two characters show us that there IS a line, and they stand on opposite sides of it. The main character perceives that these two men are fighting for possession of his soul, a typical ego-centric philosophy student kind of conclusion, but in a way they do represent a battle that is going on within this man, and that's what the story is really about.<br/><br/>All of the actors involved had to endure two weeks of intense training and exercises which were aimed to teach them exactly what it was like to be a soldier in Vietnam, and in the making of this film there were moments when they really seemed to believe that they were there. There's one scene towards the end where John C. McGinley's character is upset because he doesn't think he'll make it out of the next battle alive, and he gives a great performance where he is extremely emotional and close to tears -- but there's just one snag. He wasn't supposed to cry during that scene. The only take without tears was the one that they used in the film. On the DVD, there's an interview with Charlie Sheen where he says with a straight face that there were moments during shooting when he didn't think he'd make it out of there alive.<br/><br/>It wasn't an easy project for Oliver Stone either, as there were certain scenes that seemed to spark memories for him as he'd obviously written them about something that had happened to him. The film provoked pretty much the same reaction from the veterans who saw it, everyone felt that he'd truly captured something, which is probably why it won the oscars for best picture and best director that year.<br/><br/>You'll never hear Adaggio for Strings in quite the same way again. 5/5 (a classic, absolutely unmissable)."

Great performances by Charlie Sheen and my favourite, Willem, made this movie stand out. I couldn't believe it had been in my cupboard my whole life and I had missed it! It really IS the greatest war film EVER! My favourite scenes include the part where all the guys get 'high' and are dancing to 'Tracks of my Tears' which I am listening to at this very moment. Also, the scene where Elias is killed is possibly the best one. It is so touching, yet scary, and it had me screaming at Barnes and crying at our TV.

Brief Review -<br/><br/>Extremely atmospheric use of grounded content makes it just Mind-blowing ! War films have separate fan base and separate listing as far as the grounded content is concerned and Platoon surely makes it to Top 5 War films ever, i give you my words on that. Platoon creates the atmospheric radius around that you just don't want to go out of it. I wish to lock myself in a room in Dolby Atmos and watch this film again in 4K just to feel the atmosphere and check all the jitters again. Holy smoke.. The atmospheric tension gives some unforgettable cinematic moments and stunning vibes that leaves you all sweating even in air conditioning room. Oliver Stone wrote a shattering script but more importantly he delivered it on screen magnificently. The film has 120 minutes of runtime and this was probably a rare time that I stopped until the end credits rolled for like 5 minutes. I was glued to to my seat throughout and had to check if earphones fell down or what? Only one of the greatest War film could do it and that's Platoon for me now on. There are so many characters in the film that some of them might fade away from memory but thier small presence still makes it valueable. The big cast does big enough. Cinematography and Sound mixing are even bigger things to notice. When i first heard that Platoon won Best Picture, Best Director, Best Editing and Best Sound awards at Oscars against mighty competitors i doubted it but now when i am done watching it i can say, it made those mighty look weaker despite less budget. The grounded content like War and face offs of armies in forests is not easy to tell on silver screen but Oliver Stone was in no mood to accept it. 'When going gets tough, the tough gets going' he just nailed this saying like a Boss. A grand salute to the entire team of Platoon for this 'Stone-breaking' archivement.

","Platoon - an oscar-winning war drama, that shows to its viewers the Vietnam War - as one that is very inadequate, disorganized and lacking of good leadership. Truly, an anti-war movie!
The main character, Chris, is introduced to a military base, then he goes to a mission, then comes to the military base, then goes to another mission, then comes back to the same military base, then, guess what? - Goes to another mission, comes back again to the military base, then goes to his final mission, because at the end he gets injured and all the secondary characters die or disappear, thus you're already losing your interest for watching more of that movie (if you have enough patience left to watch until this point). The end!
Of course, there's more! More into the anti-war message of the movie: educated and rich Chris versus the uneducated and poor ""rest of the soldiers""; moral and sympathetic sergeant Elias versus immoral and scar-faced sadist sergeant Barnes; careless captain and generals at the military base versus wise sergeants on the battlefield; ""To Drug"" soldiers versus ""Not To Drug"" sergeant Barnes. The Afro-Americans are, again, presented as upset with white people. Vietnamese - as a flat, gray group of people, occurring below the level of awareness. Soldiers are, of course, in that view - uninformed and sometimes even ignorant about their mission or location, wondering on what side of the country's border are they(?). Then, the four missions they had on the battle field - are presented almost like a linear dumb game order, the next one being harder and harder to fight. At one point, some viewers might expect the evil boss to show up at the end.
But not everything is so bad!? You might enjoy the drama around the moral sergeant Elias, but as you could already hear other critics talk so much about how ""realistic"" that movie is - there might be something for some tastes! If you're tired of long monologues before the killings, that's a movie where there's no second thought when talking about a headshot of a mother, smashing the face of a civilian or fist-fighting your captain. That is, by the way, the reason why other described it as being highly violent and devastating, where violence is so intense, that it shows almost constant guns, blood, dead bodies and scenes like shooting and raping (mostly implied) Vietnamese characters.
The movie is ""so realistic"", that it's not even trying to sell to its viewers the idea of a ""transformation through hard work"" related to the main character, as it pictures the newbie soldier Chris, being so young, weak and clumsy, as well as his other soldier mates - remaining the same throughout the movie (falling while trying to climb the jungle and whining about their injures, sometimes even faking them to escape the battlefield). His, almost every violent breakout, is presented coming as an uncontrollable emotional burst, which I think nobody will expect from a real trained soldier sent to a real war, killing real people.
But then, how realistic is this movie? Was that war really so disorganized and messy, like the movie is presenting it? I don't know, but I'm skeptic about that! Where I'm not skeptic about - is that the movie is not for everyone! Definitely not for kids and military strategists, that might be offended by such a messy handling of military affairs!
In conclusion, there's no ""Good versus Bad"" fighting in there, it's just a story, where it's not about winning. So, for all the good, the bad and the ugly, this movie takes from me - a strong 6/10 and of course, like with my other movie reviews - the accountability for what I wrote above!"

Yet, 'Platoon (1986)' still suffers from the almost clip-show mentality most war pictures tend to adopt, even though it is told from the perspective of the soldiers in a very 'boots-on-the-ground' kind of way and isn't concerned with the larger picture of generals moving pieces on a proverbial chessboard. Thankfully, an inner struggle soon starts to emerge within the titular platoon and it is this, along with the individual development of the characters and how they handle the impossible situations they are placed in, that forms the basis for the overarching story. The piece always manages to maintain at least some semblance of narrative amongst the battles and boredom of long-form infantry life. 6/10"

","For a rather powerful film, this movie seems permanently stuck in the 1980's. It's still very much a trend setter that inspired other war themed films to follow even though they have emulated the theme of war, it can never fully be duplicated. Yes, ""Platoon"" still succeeds in capturing the fear, the unpredictability, and the uncertainty that comes into effect when you're in the war. However, Oliver Stone's other war themed follow-ups become more stylized in contrast to the substance that this film delivers. The visceral effects seems to be more personal due to the horrors director Oliver Stone faced during his time in Vietnam. The characters depicted here have the emotions to convince you that these soldiers are fearing their lives and know they can come out of this war as heroes or dead.<br/><br/>Charlie Sheen stars here as Chip Taylor, a college flunky from a posh upbringing arbitrarily enlists into the military feeling that the underclass should not be the only ones fighting in the Vietnam War, which shows little significance towards his allies who accurately says that only the rich could convey such an attitude. Sheen doesn't have the impression or the range as Taylor from the inexperienced novice to grizzled veteran he never sparks any kind of adequacy which makes this movie very distracting.<br/><br/>As times strolls on, Taylor becomes more respected by his troop who ignores the fact that other new recruits won't make it out alive and we grow onto them which is something the audience never really does. The platoon has two superior sergeants who they admire. We have a scar-faced mean-tempered tyrant Barnes (Tom Berenger) and the more level-headed but effective commando Elias (Willem Dafoe). Berenger excels quite well as the brutish leader who seems like he was born into this lifestyle and may not adjust well to civilian life. Both Berenger and Dafoe were nominated for Best Supporting Actors at the Oscars, only to be humbled by Michael Caine for ""Hannah and Her Sisters"".<br/><br/>Barnes and Elias's friendship falls out when the borderline insane Barnes threaten to kill a Vietnamese lady who may or may not be helping Viet Cong fighters which eventually leads to a divinity within the platoon which Taylor likes to awkwardly describes as a ""civil war"".<br/><br/>The loose formatting of ""Platoon"" we see a cornucopia of unrelated occurrences of grunts and the endless chatter about how how long before their tour of duty will come to a conclusion. The movie lures into the daily regiments that the soldiers go through in their endless quest for survival. The battles with the enemy is illustrated with realism along with the constant reminder that heroism or death are the only options in this war. The physical and psychological wounds is vintage in terms of storytelling. But Stone's choice of music is highly questionable. The ""Adagio of Strings"" song feels out of place and it more or less hinders the scenes as opposed to contemplating them.<br/><br/>The narration by is seen from Taylor's letters to his grans must've been giddy over his cheery sentiments about if his sanity is in tact or his doubts of making it in his war. His diary looks like it was written by a Junior High student coping with anxieties rather than a man in the middle of what is threshold of hell. Elias' death tends to be vastly overplayed loosely inspired by the 1968 picture of the soldier aiding a helicopter to the ground which runs its welcome.<br/><br/>The strong points in ""Platoon"" that's handled well is the stress of these average soldiers face when heading to the front line. The Viet Cong are depicted as semi invisible ghosts using their mind games to inject fear is handled very convincingly. So when the scene where the platoon invades a village and destroys it an annihilates the people serves a purpose. In the midst of battle, we see the fear, the pressure and the determination in which leads the troop to the brink of madness. It is a reminder to the environment in which these soldiers are facing and is an open invitation of what could happen if we were in their situations."

","""Rejoice O young man in thy youth"" - Ecclesiastes. Written and directed by Oliver Stone, ""Platoon"" is considered as one of the best war movies ever made. Another masterpiece of the same director, also with Vietnam war topic is ""Born on the Fourth of July"" with Tom Cruise as Ron Kovic real life war veteran, based on true story. Oliver Stone took part in Vietnam war (he served there from September 1967. until November 1968. being wounded twice and receiving couple of military decorations for his participation). After he returned home he decided to put his war experiences into a script of fictionalized war story which many years later was transformed into a movie inspired by war experiences that Stone had in Vietnam. That was how ""Platoon"" was made. A story with authentic background. <br/><br/>Not popular with US.Army because it is telling of highly negative side of the war (showing terrible war atrocities against civilians and horrors of fighting in the jungle) ""Platoon"" is a strong and emotional story about different characters of different people put together on inevitable collision course with each other. Those hidden virtues and faults of those people have always been in themselves, they are only emphasized in a war madness that surrounds them. Three main characters Sgt.Barnes (Tom Berenger) on one side, Sgt. Elias (Willem Dafoe) on the opposite one and private Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen) between them come from different life backgrounds and often have opposite and confronting perceptions of the war and life itself. In every war, in every army, on both sides in every armed conflict there were always and there will always be people like three of them and people around them. Movie shows platoon divided between Elias and Barnes two centers of gravity and those who choose to be with one or the other.<br/><br/>Sgt.Barnes is a battle hardened and ruthless warrior. A man who does n't care much for himself and others when it comes to having fire contact with the enemy. He lost his humanity and became like a blood thirsty animal itching for fighting because it is the only meaning of his life left. What kind of life and pain formed his personality we can only guess, but outside of war he has no place, he has no purpose. And he knows that. Deep inside he hates himself for what he is and he does n't care if he is going to live or get killed. He openly challenges others to take on him (""It's just me and six of you guys, come on, no one's gonna know"") but they don't dare to do anything. Two statements define his character and beliefs, first - ""Now, I got no fight with any man who does what he's told, but when he don't, the machine breaks down. And when the machine breaks down, we break down. And I ain't gonna allow that in any of you. Not one"" and second - ""You smoke this to escape from reality. Well, I don't need to do that, I am reality "" which is kind of his life statement.<br/><br/>Sgt. Elias is opposite of him. Battle hardened and experienced fighter too, but a man who can keep his balance, he will not cross the line, the point of no return that Sgt.Barnes crossed long time ago. Elias does n't have any illusions about the war, he had them on the beginning but they are lost meanwhile. As he says to Chris Taylor ""We are going to lose this one"" he considers it a wrong war to fight as he realized after disappointments that he had about its cause. If he lost his illusions he did not lose his humanity. A man who will do the right thing when it matters most and lose his life because of it. <br/><br/>Chris Taylor is rebellious and idealistic person who escapes from life at home full of restrictions and rules trying to gain an experience of his own and what he finds is not quite as what he expected, if he had any idealistic illusions they are soon crushed by harsh realities of war and the way it transforms people pushing the best and worst in them to the limits of human tolerance. In the end he is left deeply traumatized with psychological scars that will take many years to heal and become bearable. <br/><br/>Story about different characters of different people rejected by society but in war they have just what they need with some of them seeing it as a way to project worst parts of their personality and stay unpunished. As many other great movies, ""Platoon"" is a story about human character, about the best and worst in all of us. Part of us that makes us be the greatest humanists and part of us that makes us be the worst criminals. Chris Taylor puts it great when he says that he is ""a child of two fathers - Elias and Barnes"" because he has what both of them have. Humanity of Elias and killing instinct of Barnes because in the end he kills Barnes. Others are mere reflections like Sgt.O'Neill, an ordinary coward, psychopath Bunny, a dog of war released from his chains, or Rhah, King and Big Harold who can still find strength to joke after all. Joke is their best cure. For Chris and others there are many years left to heal from scars deep inside their souls as he says it in words that can be the point of the whole movie - ""I think now looking back we did not fight the enemy, we fought ourselves and the enemy was in us... But be that as it may, those of us who did make it have an obligation to build again, to teach others what we know and to try with what's left of our lives to find a goodness and meaning to this life""."

","The movie is fascinating in showing the real battle scenes, and describing the conflicts faced with a lot of GIs for the moral of the war.<br/><br/>Yet, I have a question here. The movie seems to be centered with two Sergeants, Barnes and Elias, the former was a killing machine while the latter tried to keep himself abreast of the chaos of war and stick to his own conscience and moral values. Elias didn't like Barnes, but he still regarded him as a reliable fellow grunt in battles. However, after the conflict in the small village, Barnes vowed to kill Elias and exactly did so on purpose when chance permitted.<br/><br/>My question is, is this teammate-killing a common sight in Vietnam? It is said the movie was partly based on the personal experience of Oliver Stone. But I am not sure whether this center-piece of the movie was based on real happenings or not.<br/><br/>It is interesting to note that there is also a similar parallel in the novel which FMJ is based on. In the novel (The Short-Timers by Gustav Hasvord), Animal Mother fragged down his own platoon leader intentionally.<br/><br/>Still, I doubt this was a common thing in the soldiers who served in Vietnam. It is just inconceivable for me that soldiers would kill each other for some disagreements, even it is about moral values."
"nvjs","7","0","0","7 March 2013"," The ""logic"" behind Taylor and Elias
","My beef, with this movie is that though it's set in the Vietnam War in '67-68; it doesn't quite jive as an drama with action picture. It seems as though Stone felt obligated to have firefights since NOT having any would be detrimental for audiences and undermine the chaos of war by portraying it as ""uneventful"". Or, he didn't want to ""glorify"" any war. The battles seem too meandering. No real outcome is implied or alluded to. Furthermore, Sheen's acting while not underacting, certainly is overdone. Specifically when he snaps in the ville at suspected VC. Alligator tears and wrought brows were probably not character requisites, but Stone's ""method directing"". If you watch the special features, you'll learn of Stone's madness to ""inspire"" great acting. The final thing that bothered me, was how Elias and Taylor rationalize. ""We're gonna lose this war. We've been kicking other peoples' asses for so long, it's time we got ours kicked."" So that's what America failed to see in that quagmire ? ""The truth's in the eyes! When you know, you know!"" So a gut instinct is substantial enough to warrant a summary execution ? This is ethically flawed judgment at it's worst and apparently, Stone's best. Or, a reflection of Stone's own rationale ?"

I have read some of the other comments and veterans from Vietnam have said it is pretty accurate to what happened. And saying that it seems like it was one place I would not want to be. It looked like it would have been miserable. I think it was good they had some humor in this movie as well but possibly could have had a little more but that might have taken away from it.

","Platoon does a nice job of balancing reality with Hollywood theater. The atmosphere is pretty much spot on, with only a few scenes going a bit over the top. The ""war"" in Vietnam was supposed to be a somewhat normal ""by the book"" conflict, but everyone on the ground found out fast that the rule book just wasn't translated into Vietnamese. The characters portray the general feelings that persisted through much of the war, including the in fighting and back stabbing in some units. It was a brutal, non-standard conflict, and it reflects that reality all the way through the movie...<br/><br/>But...the movie also crosses the line by implying that the conduct of the soldiers in Platoon is somehow justified. As the years after Vietnam have come and gone, we are seeing more and more incidents where American soldiers are not holding to the conduct that built this nation. Iran. Afghanistan and Pakistan are merely the latest examples of how our own moral values have been left by the wayside.<br/><br/>Anyway, overall this movie is gratingly accurate in showing the realities of ""modern warfare"" on the ground. I liked it, but it also made me cringe at the same time. Perhaps that is the real intent of the movie, and it does make you rethink your own values..."
"Puppet Master","10","0","0","5 November 2000"," Insight
","This just might be the best war film ever made. ""Platoon"" was brilliantly acted and directed, taking in several awards in 1986 including ""Best Picture."" Charlie Sheen gives an outstanding performance as a young Vietnam soldier who not only battles the enemy, but the fear within himself. Willem Dafoe and Tom Berenger do an excellent job of portraying sergeants who are in conflict. What makes this film so great is the realism brought out within the movie. Oliver Stone (writer and director), really does a great job of showing the effects the war had on the soldiers. Stone having been in Vietnam himself, shows a soldiers' point-of-view of the war being not only a shattering physical obstacle, but also a mental one. ""Platoon"" is a drama that gives you an experience of the horror that was Vietnam. The brutality of the scenes and the intensity of the characters help maintain an idea of the paranoia and fear the war caused. This movie is never disappointing and always keeps you interested. The excellent writing and superb acting makes this film hard to forget. I recommend this film to everybody, even if you don't find interest in war. On a scale of 1 to 10, I give it a 9. This film is rated R for strong language and violence."

If we ever go to war with aliens, sending them a copy of this will soon get rid of the little gits.

","This one was a great film both in its day and in the present too. Great tension between Berenger and Dafoe, chaotic, brutal battle scenes, stirring music, realistic combat footage and drug use, moods, reactions of the fighting men too. Stone was there, this bears the stamp of authenticity. Yeah the Berenger/Dafoe conflict is kinda forced; sure Sheen is hardly the best actor to be at the center of such an important film, and yeah, I know about the complaints of racism on Stone's parts-black soldiers as cowardly addicts, etc.-but sod it, these things did happen and do happen.<br/><br/>As for the Private Ryan comparison, well-Private Ryan was made for a much bigger budget, it was done on a bigger scale by a very different director in a different era. I believed what happened in Platoon more so than in Ryan, save for the landing/last battle; Speilberg's story arc is just too...I donno, outta an episode of 'Combat' while 'Platoon' strove for something greater. I think Stone gets at the heart of the regular grunts better than Spielberg did.

","Platoon is certainly one of my favourite war films from any particular era, although it doesn't quite reach the same intensity of Apocalypse Now or All Quiet on the Western Front. But it does have a more natural honesty about it than say Saving Private Ryan.<br/><br/>What I particularly liked about the film was the way America wasn't only fighting the Vietnamese but also with the liberals & conscientious-objectors back home AND their own internecine squabbles between the men themselves.<br/><br/>Oliver Stone's script & personal hands-on reflections of his own Tour of Duty don't hark upon the out-and-out conflict against the enemy. Instead he tries to point the camera at the young conscripts themselves. One minute they're thinking of college educations and a decent, well-paid job; the next they're out in the jungle being ripped to shreds by lethal blades of long grass, eaten by ants, blood-sucked by leaches, and that's even before you factor-in the enemy and their on-the-ground tactical supremacy.<br/><br/>Charlie Sheen is at his very best as Chris, the new recruit, or ""Crusader"". A rich kid who volunteered to do his bit for his country, although this could have been down more to peer pressure than a sense of duty.<br/><br/>But through his eyes & words we can see how the war affected so many American men in so many different ways. Fortunately, Stone doesn't go a stage further by incorporating the hateful voices back home who decry the invasion. It would have been interesting to see Chris's reaction to that kind of ""civil war"" and wondering who side he is really on!<br/><br/>The (very) ending is perhaps a little contrite & too nicely packaged, which smells of studio interference; but for the other 99% of the movie I was totally immersed in the raw energy & emotion these soldiers gave supporting a country they probably never knew existed and for a reason they were never properly told.<br/><br/>It could be argued that the film reeks with an air of Stone's typical liberal attitudes, but one thing that can't be forgotten - Stone was out there fighting someone else's war, he did see action and so who are we to disagree.<br/><br/>****/*****"

","""Platoon"" is one of the most realistic war movies ever made.  It deals with the fact that while Americans were fighting in Vietnam, horrible war crimes were commited.  In this movie, the main character is Chris Taylor, played by Charlie Sheen, a man who volunteered for Vietnam out of a sense of duty to his country.  His grandfather fought in the first world war, and his father in the second.  He felt it was also his duty to carry on the tradition. Taylor arrives in country with only a few other new recruits posted in his platoon.  Everyone expects him to know what to do and how to do it.  When the platoon is stationed on ""ambush"" in the jungle, they are the ones ambushed, by the Vietcong.  The ambush is unfairly blamed on Taylor, by people saying that it was his fault for sleeping.  In fact, his shift was over, and another soldier fell asleep on the job.  From there on, things get worse, and the platoon ends up burning a suspected Vietcong refuge village to the ground.  Sergeant Barnes shoots an old woman and is about to murder a child, when Sergeant Elias stops him.  Looting, rape, murder, and arson are all comitted by Americans in that village alone.  It is difficult to watch and you begin no to feel as much sympathy towards the Americans.  War is bad.  Plain and simple, and should be avoided at all costs.  Especially a different country's civil war, such as Vietnam."

","When viewing this movie years after it was originally released and having the oppotunity to see other Oliver Stone projects,it becomes evident that he probably climaxed with 'Platoon'.Artists from other entertainment disciplines have produced work that they will always be judged against and which they never have surpassed.A case in point is Micheal Jackson's 'Thiller'.Although his other offerings are good in their own right,they do tend to pale in comparison.I feel that his later projects suffer as a consequence and although it may not seem entirely fair,he set his own high standards with 'Platoon'.<br/><br/>There are a variety of factors that make this such a good movie.The first is the background music which conveys a message of seemingly overbearing tragedy about the loss of innocent young life.The tracks used to capture the era blended in with the screenplay and did not detract from the movie as sometimes occurs with more product oriented movies that choose tracks that will sell CD's and not to accentuate the mood the director may wish to convey.<br/><br/>The emsemble cast showcased here is very talented and many of them were to make an impact on the movie scene,most notably Johnny Depp and Charlie Sheen.Tom Berenger and William Dafoe play their parts perfectly which is essential since their conflict was a central theme.There were no weak performances which can usually be to the detriment of a good movie.<br/><br/>My own personal analysis of this picture is that the conflict between Tom Berenger and William Dafoe is a representation of the situation in America during the Vietnam war.Berenger represented the hard core anti-communist war machine which viewed American soldiers as part of the machinery to eradicate the enemy of democracy.Dafoe's character could be seen as the peace loving anti-establishment hippie generation that has a strong moral belief.The friction between these contrasting ideologies divides the camp and a violent result was inevitable.This is indicative of ideological differences in America during the war.Whether my interpretation is accurate is not relevant since it is a thought provoking movie and I am sure that other users will have they own analysis.This is the magic of the screenplay as a art form.<br/><br/>Anybody who enjoys movies most add this masterpiece to their collection.I am sure it will be watched many times over."

Particularly moving scenes,to name a few, which the viewer can never forget, include the village, Elias' death, and the apocalyptic ending- when the perimeter is overrun. The acting too is top class. Charlie Sheen's Taylor gives a credible performance as Stone's alter ego, but especial praise must go to Tom Berenger's depiction of the war scarred Barnes, and  Willem Defoe's sensitive Elias, as well as supporting roles, such as Kevin Dillon's sadistic Bunny, and Chris' big brotherly Keith David as King,all make up the tragedy and horror that was Vietnam.

What I don't understand is why everyone compares this to Saving Private Ryan (many times saying SPR is a better movie!).  The two are not even comparable.  Saving Private Ryan is a 50s ""war"" movie updated for the 90s with appropriate bloodletting and a weak plot.  Platoon is the great emotional (where Apocalypse Now was the surreal and Full Metal Jacket was the cold/uncaring) look at the horrors of fighting in the Vietnam War.  The struggle between good and evil for Taylor's soul is just about the most effecting ""personal battle"" in a war movie.  People are comparing this (based on fact!) to the fictional story of a bunch of guys who go looking for another guy 'cause the Chief of the General Staff (can you believe it!?!) wants them to.  Along the way Spielberg tries to mix the go get'em of postwar action films with the horrors of war.  That doesn't work.  Platoon does, very well.  In fact SPR is so uneven it's hard to believe that a veteran director directed it (not that Spielberg is a great one but he does have the experience)."

Only someone with a first-hand combat experience could have pulled it all off so convincingly.

At first It seems sketchy, however, as one watches the film, one realizes that it is a film of a great plotline. It is a modern tragedy. Sheen entering a war for honor ends up torn between the choice of becoming a savage, or keeping the little honor that he has left in the war symbolized by Sgt. Barnes (Tom Berenger) and Sgt. Elias (Willhelm Dafoe). As the war progresses, it becomes more and more difficult to keep honor in war as both Sergeants tear apart the Platoon as their ideologies conflict. The final sequence in the film is remarkably done, as Taylor (Charlie Sheen) chooses one path and ironically becomes the opposite.<br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan, on the other hand, is just about a couple of guys who go into France looking for Private Ryan. What makes this film great, were the ingenius action sequences of the film.<br/><br/>While currently Saving Private Ryan stands out as the best war film ever made. I believe that it will become dated from replication of similar techniques in other films. Plot of Saving Private Ryan is somewhat weak, as well as its character development compared to Platoon.<br/><br/>Platoon is a great film of various issues that intertwine within each other. Is there honor in war? What happens to men in war? Good vs. Evil... what eventually wins in war? Are there any positive aspect in war? etc... etc...As well as little issues that give it a distinct Vietnam persona. Why are a larger porportion of African Americans in Vietnam than whites? Do Lieutenants straight out of West Point deserve the same homage and responisbilites as a hardened Sergeant with several years of experience in the field. The frustration of guerilla warfare tactics on a superior military strength. etc... etc...<br/><br/>Anyways, this film is on my top ten list of greatest films ever made.

","It didn't take long for Oliver Stone to make a name for himself. Beginning with his Oscar-winning script for ""Midnight express"", he has continued making great scripts and movies all along the years.  However, not that many people knew him or followed his career even after he won that Oscar except for his biggest fans.  So ""Platoon"" could be considered to be his breakthrough movie and not only because it won Oscars for best picture and a best director one for him, but because it was really good. <br/><br/>
  Chris (Charlie Sheen) has dropped out of college to volunteer for the army to go to Vietnam.  But once he gets there, he realizes that the war really isn't how he thought it might be.  He sees the horrors of the war and lives them as well.  Also, there are two sergeants in his platoon and they are complete opposites; Sergeant Barnes (Tom Berenger) is a crazy man who kills any Vietnamese person as soon as he or she is in site.  And then there is Sergeant Elias (Willem Dafoe) who is completely against the war and probably wouldn't be there if he had a choice.  And so there is this hate rivalry between Barnes and Elias.  Barnes even goes as far as killing Elias in a very cowardly way.<br/><br/>  Throughout the movie, there is Sheen's voice-over telling his experiences with the intermediate of letters he writes to his grand-mother.  The movie is a biography of Stone's experience in Vietnam and you can see how he just hated the war and considered it incredibly stupid.  The scenes in the Vietnamese villages are very powerful and the whole movie is very well directed.  I think that it's Berenger who steals the movie however with his excellent incarnation of the crazy Sergeant Barnes.  Globally, this is an exceptional movie and even though it's very rough and a little gory sometimes, I still recommend it to any movie-buff who hasn't yet seen it. It IS exceptional."

This film argues that the horrors of war do have a purpose and point. And that with a victory something good can come out of it. 6.DrStrangelove ""What, this is not a war movie?"", that is probably what you are thinking. It is a war movie about a nuclear war. It laughs at the end of the world and brings the point across well. 7.Apocalpse Now! No movie captures the insanity of war like this movie does. A complete trip into the insanity of Vietnam. 8.Shindler's List A movie about the victims of a war and a hero. It shows the other side and it a touching and brilliant movie. You may call me crazy but I think the ending is happy. 9.The Killing Fields A movie about the observers, the outsiders, and the watchers of a war who get pulled into the horrors.

It affected me the very first time I saw it in 1988, and still affects me even today. Oliver Stone has created one of the great cinematic masterpieces of all-time.<br/><br/>The praise for Saving Private Ryan is very distressing mostly because most of the good things being said of it are all done better in Platoon (perhaps that's why Platoon WON for Best Picture). While it wasn't as grisly or graphic as Saving Private Ryan, I felt utterly more appalled by the violence and reality of war in Platoon. For the first time, I felt as if I was actually IN the movie, experiencing war as the soldiers experienced it. And it was horrifying. I was constantly afraid that the next step would set off a trap, or there were Viet Cong soldiers lurking somewhere in the trees. It was the most nerve-wracking experience I've ever had in a movie. It scared me more than any horror film I've ever seen, yet, it's that very fear that makes the ultimate statement in the movie.<br/><br/>Stone paints a gruesome picture of war through they eyes of one soldier. Charlie Sheen's subdued performance is perfect for this film. We can literally see his tranformation from a clueless green soldier to a gritty, experienced veteran of war. It's a transformation that we as viewers can follow and understand. We all experience his emotions, fears, and curiosity about war. And we are taken along for the ride without any veils pulled over our eyes.<br/><br/>This film is far and away the greatest war movie ever. It illustrates both the good and bad about American soldiers and war in general. War can sometimes turn grown men into monsters. It can sometimes turn monsters into grown men. Oliver Stone does a brilliant job in illustrating this. his decision to narrate the story through Charlie Sheen's character is both effective and brilliant. It provides the audience with an understanding and a face to attach the horror to.<br/><br/>In so many ways this movie is superior to Private Ryan.

The scenes with the red-ants, snakes, and the jungle made the movie easier to relate to the characters. I also think this movie is about drugs. It seemed that all the characters who were against the actual fighting were the ones getting stoned every night. I think if the soldiers back then would have kept their noses clean, they would have had a much better effect in the Vietnam war.

If you're a veteran of the Army or Marines who still carries a peace sign, then you'll see why this picture (and as with many others) is gratefully dedicated. This appeared to be a first for the screen, perhaps a step above other war films. It paints a hair-gripping portrait at fighting during the Vietnam War with strong attention to graphic details based on extremely true and tense situations. You might complain that this looks nearly like another 80s war action movie with no real substance, but this put into effect is demanding along with tensions, pain, and suffering on the battleground, which is conceivably portrayed. Take very careful notice of the end conclusion, which is horrifyingly true! While I'm waiting to see SAVING PRIVATE RYAN for the first time, this movie was best for starts.

Rookie marine Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen) is projected in one leap from the security of middle America to the blood and squalor of a war which can never be won.<br/><br/>Uncompromising in its use of soldier's language and graphic violence, the plot follows Taylor through a hellish baptism in a platoon made up of psychotics, criminals and plain murderers. Initially he is shunned by the veterans, but slowly develops the skills and traits of a combat Marine - having to suspend all thoughts of decent living in the process. Like all around him, the countdown to the end of his tour becomes a fixation.<br/><br/>In this no-rules environment, rivalries amongst the men take on brutish proportions and the domineering Barnes (Tom Berenger) battles with a fellow sergeant (Willem Dafoe) with, as far as Barnes is concerned, only one suitable outcome.<br/><br/> From the chilling silence of the jungle to the thunderous roar of full scale battle, this is a tense film, but with clear moral messages from Stone - war has no winners.

"Anonymous_Maxine","10","0","0","30 January 2001"," The Saving Private Ryan of the Vietnam War.
","Similar in many ways to another quality war film, Casualties of War, Platoon is a story that takes place during the Vietnam War and is about a platoon torn basically between good and evil. Oliver Stone relies heavily on personal experience in the war in his writing of the film, in which the above-mentioned platoon is divided by the brutal activities that take place in the overtaking of a village in Vietnam. <br/><br/>Charlie Sheen plays the role that parallels the role played by Michael J. Fox in Casualties of War. He is the narrator who tells the story of his disillusion with the camaraderie that develops between men during service in the war, which he left a fairly cushy lifestyle to volunteer for.<br/><br/>
I've never served in the military, much less been in battle, but it is clear that nothing is sugar-coated in this film, which leads me to willingly believe that what you see on the screen is exactly what it was like in Vietnam, especially given the fact that Oliver Stone served in that war himself. The war drama is made even more realistic by the fact that so many of the actors were, at the time at least, relatively unknown, which is one of the things that has always bothered me about Saving Private Ryan. In Platoon, these are just regular guys from everywhere and anywhere and nowhere, and they are all stuck in the same situation risking (and in many cases losing) their lives in battle. <br/><br/>The Vietnamese were portrayed as savages to some extent, but that's because they are obviously the antagonists from the point of view that the story is told, which is Private Chris Taylor's (Charlie Sheen) point of view. On the other hand, this portrayal can be forgiven because their tactics in many of the battle scenes are fairly clear, it's obvious how intelligently they fought the war.<br/><br/>I think that one of the things that makes Platoon so good is some of the many memorable scenes in the film, particularly those involving Sergeant Elias, played brilliantly by William Dafoe. The view from the helicopter of him being chased (unarmed and suffering from gunshot wounds inflicted by someone on his own side) by dozens of rifle wielding Vietnamese soldiers is an absolutely terrible thing to witness, and is one of the many ways that the sheer brutality of this war is presented in this film.<br/><br/>
Of the countless war films that are made, every once in a while a truly great one comes along, and Platoon is one of the great ones. It doesn't try to sugar coat anything, but presents the viciousness and violence of the Vietnam War as straightforwardly as possible, which is one of the many things that makes it so good. It is not only a startlingly realistic piece of entertainment, but also a good place to learn a little bit about the kinds of things that went on in the Vietnam War, and what go on in any war. This is great cinema."

","The photography in this film is great - it's got lots of original camera movements and shots.  For example when Taylor shoots Barnes in the end, the shot stays on Bob as the bullets hit him. The downside I found, was that it seemed predictable once some basic character traits had been developed.  We could all see Taylor surviving to the end, and that many of his mates would perish.  Also that Elias would be shot by Barnes seemed too obvious. I think a few moments of Taylor narrating to the audience a quick reminder of what the US was doing in Veitnam and why there was fighting would have been helpful."

","This is by far the worst, most overrated movie I've ever seen. There is no proper character/background introduction and the opening dialogue is very bland; as a result, the opening is quite stagnant and rather uninspiring. Throughout much of the film, tension is constantly built via brutal atrocities and blatant crimes against humanity: events such as the killing of innocent civilians with grenades, non-threatening people's heads bashed in for no reason, and a woman shot in the head for apparently yelling a bit too hysterically. The prime villain responsible for this happens to be in command of the platoon and few dare question his authority. Those who do are either killed for no reason (with regard to the 'plot') or are simply too helpless and timid to do anything about it, so that the second half of the film does nothing to properly resolve this tension. The result is a movie with no real justice. On top of this, the sound was cheap (as the firing of guns sounded like plastic toys), the action scenes were unimpressive (with actors running around aimlessly), the acting was petty, and the picture quality was mediocre. Overall, the movie comes off too preachy, contrived, and dry with really two-dimensional—good or bad—characters, and in essence, just isn't worth it.

Conrad's 'Heart of Darkness' is implied (more effectively expounded upon in ""Apocalypse Now"", and of course, ""Aguirre, der Zorn Gottes"").<br/><br/>How many vets bore such an existential crisis? No matter, this is the one that got the most thumbs up from the servicemen. <br/><br/>Stone was out to overturn the perspective of things like ""The Green Berets""; they just weren't real enough...in doing so, he started the trend of all successive war films (whether about this war or any other) needing to establish plausibility through tedious attention to detail.<br/><br/>So all we get is a morality play, nothing that needs to be displayed on film. This was all nicely deflated in Seinfeld's ""The Fatigues"" episode (the overuse of the 'Adagio' theme music)."
"mjneu59","5","3","8","27 December 2010"," revisiting the film, six months after its premiere
","When I first saw 'Platoon' in December of 1986 (less than a week after it opened) my reaction was more or less typical, and likely swayed by popular opinion at the time...<br/><br/>No politics, no apologies: just a blood and guts version of the Vietnam War as seen from a soldier's point of view, written and directed by one who was there. Oliver Stone's previous writing credits ('Midnight Express', 'Scarface', 'Year of the Dragon') showed an almost obsessive inclination toward melodramatic bloodletting, but here at least he found the perfect vehicle for his sweaty daydreams. The film is a soldier's act of public catharsis: a dramatized but painfully vivid account of one young grunt's transfiguration from eager, innocent recruit to brutalized, savage veteran, driven by his horror, fear, and fatigue into acts of violence against both his enemies and his comrades.<br/><br/>Some of the details may be exaggerated out of all proportion (Tom Berenger's cruelly scared face; the stately Barber adagio on the soundtrack), but the overall effect works not unlike a swift blow to the stomach: not exactly an enjoyable experience, but the pain is hard to forget.<br/><br/>Six months later, after seeing the film a second time (it was still screening at first-run theaters in San Francisco), my response was more circumspect...after all the Oscars were awarded and all the hype and hysteria quieted down, it became easier to appreciate Oliver Stone's career making war movie for what it really was: not the best film made of the Vietnam experience, but certainly the most timely and accessible.<br/><br/>There's no doubting the necessity or sincerity of Stone's vision. Or the grim accuracy of his details (drawn no doubt from his own memories of combat). But as a filmmaker he is, at best, more a skilled craftsman than an artist, and his claustrophobic grunt's-eye view of the war can't help but suffer from a foot soldier's single-minded lack of imagination, simplifying complex moral dilemmas into obvious and easy personifications of good versus evil: saintly Willem Dafoe vs. battle-scarred Tom Berenger.<br/><br/>The only way Stone can think to take up the narrative slack is with unnecessary voice-over narration (letters to grandma, no less), usually a last-ditch tactic designed to camouflage a film's inability to communicate in its own language. The same can be said for the biblical epigraph (from Ecclesiastes) and, to a lesser degree, the stately Barber adagio, both of which substitute false piety for the very real emotional drama already in evidence.<br/><br/>Further proof, if any were needed, that first impressions are rarely complete."

","I'm sorry, I know this film is pretty high up in the top 250 films.  I know it has an average vote of about 8, but I just didn't think it was all that good.<br/><br/>It was filled with supposedly touching voice-overs and the like, but I was completely unmoved by any of them.  The point where Willem Dafoe gets killed I though was laughable, and only served to turn the film into some sort of gung ho farce.<br/><br/>All in all the acting was reasonably good however and the direction was good, with some of the action scenes being very confusing and I imagine all the more realistic for it.<br/><br/>All in all, not the movie it is made out to be.

"hill-1","6","3","8","15 January 2002"," Partly real/partly political
","The acting by Dafoe and Beringer was top notch. However, while this movie fairly accurately portrayed the day-to-day miserable conditions under which an infantryman fought in Vietnam (or any war), most of the plot is largely symbolic:  ""good seargent"" (Elias) versus ""evil seargent""(Barnes) who are ""fighting for the soul"" of FNG Chris Taylor (Sheen).  The depiction of the squad on night ambush, trying to stay awake in the rain after humping the bush all day--truly a realistically miserable portrayal.  But Sheen's later savvy, getting out of the bunker just before an RPG hits it, was uncharacteristic of his character.  His spectacular one-man charge at the NVA in the middle of the firefight would have realistically gotten him killed.  Sheen's background narration often verged on the corny and derisive, such as in describing the rest of the platoon: ""They were society's losers, Grandma--the bottom of the barrel"" (or words to that effect), and does a disservice to Vietnam infantrymen.  It also repeats the old stereotype that only young draftees fought the war and died there (not true!).  The village ""massacre scene"" was just Stone's grinding his own political axe.  Such events were truly rare or we would have much more documentation on them. Read the book ""Platoon: Bravo Company"", by Robert Hemphill, the real commander of the unit portrayed in Platoon.  A somewhat different perspective than that portrayed by Stone.  I speak from experience, as an infantry veteran of the Vietnam War."

Sure, it's beautifully filmed, but really, all it is when you come right down to it is a bunch of Americans sitting around, getting drunk and stoned, and talking bull. Occasionally something actually happens/explodes, but then Stone goes into hyperactive camera mode. It might be authentic from the perspective that none of the troops knew what was going on either; but it's frustrating for an audience member trying to piece together some sense from this garbled mosaic that says 'War is hell!' in between long pulls on a 'J'.<br/><br/>None of the cast are particular standouts either, ranging from 'going through the motions' to pitifully bad.<br/><br/>It is rare that I have had to endure such a boring experience from an otherwise regarded classic.

","In Vietnam, the only war these men were fighting were themselves. Platoon is a treasured war picture about the Vietnam war. It's Oliver Stone's explosive debut as a big league filmmaker. Powerful and courageous was he to capture the inhumanity of the war, and it's affects on the average American soldier. Some are overtaken by it. These themes are familiar in Vietnam war movies, and shall I say, done significantly better. The one man account of the confused and hopeless nature of the war is far more effective in Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now. The war's barbarity was captured more accurately in Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket. Platoon by comparison falls into the issues of the formulaic. But big credit goes to performances by Willem Dafoe and Tom Bringer as the tyrannical and sadistic Sergeant Barnes."
"Svenstadt","4","2","5","3 April 2019"," Too formulaic for a war movie.
","This movie would have been good, if not for the scriptwriting and directing. This almost feels more like a Shakespeare play than an actual war movie. No one in Vietnam, in the heat of combat, is going to find the time to hump through the jungle to frag one of your own guys. The conflict between Willem Dafoe's character and Tom Berenger's character gets a little too cartoonish and too convenient at times. Charlie Sheen does an OK job. I have been told that pretty much every aspect of this movie is accurate. Dale Dye, an actual Vietnam soldier and advisor, acted as well to add some realism to this piece. The soundtrack is another bummer in this movie as well. There are no period-authentic pieces, like on Forest Gump with Fortunate Son. The soundtrack only further adds to the aggravation of the movie which seems to force a history lesson down your throat at times."

","Platoon (1986)<br/><br/>A movie with one goal: recreating the hell of war, Vietnam specifically but war in general. And it succeeds. It has strong acting, spectacular special effects, lots of rain and night shots (and snakes and bugs), a lot of death from every possible cause, and a steady, suspenseful pace. It's a really good movie, and at times really sucks you in.<br/><br/>It's also a movie with lots of well used themes, with stereotypes (in the soldiers) and with more stereotypes (very cardboard, in the enemies). And there is no real plot. There is a progression, yes, and things go from bad to worse until the climax of an ending. But the development of the characters and their interactions is thin, and the mission of the platoon, whatever it quite is, lacks clarity. <br/><br/>And a question might rise for anyone looking for a statement about Vietnam--was it really so ruthless and murderous, soldiers killing soldiers and civilians so readily? Or is this the worst of the worst? And if so, shouldn't it make that clear? Not that fiction needs to be accurate, but if we go back to the goal of showing what war is like, then this might not be what war is like. This is what a demented, blood thirsty platoon looks like, led by the evil selfish soldier played by Tom Berenger. With a couple of heroes holding things together, like the super fighter played by Willem Dafoe.<br/><br/>There are of lots of regular guys, all of them interesting and sympathetic--Johnny Depp and Forest Whitaker as examples. And there is a ton of trivia, too, outlined in detail in the IMDb page. Director Oliver Stone wanted the movie to be realistic in the details, too, and went to some extreme to pull that off. I don't think he wanted an original movie (it's no Apocalypse Now, for sure), but he wanted a mainstream, dramatic, moving experience, which he got."
"kenjha","6","2","5","27 October 2008"," Repetitious and Uncompelling
","In his breakthrough film, Stone relates the travails of a platoon of soldiers in Vietnam. The point Stone wants to make is that war is brutal. And he keeps making that point over and over again for two hours. The film is nothing more than a series of battle scenes, with interludes for drugs and booze. The battles are less than compelling because they are against a faceless enemy. Almost every line of the dialog includes a popular four-letter word and its adjective form. Furthermore, everybody spews clichés. On the plus side, some of the cinematography is quite beautiful and Barber's ""Adagio for Strings"" is used effectively. The acting is pretty good, especially Dafoe."
"rmax304823","8","2","5","1 September 2006"," A Study in Racial Antagonism
","This is a good movie, and a brave one, for several reasons. The plot and other elements of the film have been covered elsewhere, so I'd like to just make a few comments on the role of race in the Vietnamese conflict.<br/><br/>The combat experience in Vietnam was an almost perfect mirror of a famous social psychology experiment by Muzafer Sheriff called, ""The Robbers Cave"" study. This may look a little dull but it's important and relevant.<br/><br/>Under controlled conditions, Sheriff brought two matched groups of boys to a Boy Scout Camp in the middle of nowhere. In Phase One, the two groups had no contact with one another but gave themselves names (The Eagles and the Rattlers) and lived separately. They developed an intense in-group bonding.<br/><br/>In Phase Two, the Eagles and the Rattlers were brought together in competition with one another -- sports and so forth. And each group developed an intense antagonism for the other, an ""us-against-them"" set of attitudes. The hostility grew so strong that the experimenters cut Phase Two short so it wouldn't become physically dangerous.<br/><br/>In Phase Three, the competitive tasks were removed and replaced by tasks requiring cooperation for the good of both groups together. The crises were artificially created by the experimenters and involved joint jobs like hauling water when the pump broke down, pulling a truck when the engine quit, and so on. The conflict disappeared when it was replaced by what Sheriff called ""a superordinate goal"" or ""a superordinate enemy."" <br/><br/>The film illustrates the kind of bonding that takes place when the Eagles and the Rattlers are faced with a superordinate enemy, in this story the VC. There's no question that racial identities were retained, but they were overshadowed by allegiance to the group. They had to be, for the sake of survival. The casual and sometimes friendly interaction between African-Americans and whites is even more surprising when you consider that this takes place in the late 1960s, the era of Black Power, the Zebra killings, campus takeovers, and so on. None of that social movement filters into Vietnam. There may or may not be atheists in foxholes, but there seem to be far fewer racists.<br/><br/>Enough boring stuff. I mentioned that the film was brave because Stone was the first guy to come out with a film that dealt directly with the ordinary grunts in the Vietnam war. No politics or anything. None of that, ""Why are we here?"" business. The war is just a matter of getting through one day after another, shorter and shorter, until you can get out of it.<br/><br/>The usual stereotypes are either absent entirely or weak. Nobody is a wise guy from Brooklyn. And there is no braggart from Texas. And Sgt. Elias is not ""good"" in contrast to Sgt. Barnes' ""bad"" guy. He's a better human being than Barnes, but not a better soldier.<br/><br/>Overall, it's an instructive film coming from somebody who was there. And the director doesn't try to drive us nuts with razzle dazzle techniques as he sometimes does in his later work."
"bulleetz37235","8","2","5","14 October 2005"," The first casualty of war is innocence....
","Relentless. Shocking and totally totally amazing. Platoon is Oliver Stone's chilling vision of the Vietnam War, something he knew all about as he was part of it all. The ants that might just riddle you to death. The ambushes. The night watches that went wrong and this film doesn't paint a pretty picture. The platoon is a small hostile family of testosterone junkies who want nothing more than to kill the ""gook b****rds."" They don't give in to bargaining, they don't take any s**t and they are hard as nails. So when Charlie Sheen is thrown into the flames he is in for a shock as he seems to be the only one with a bone in him called remorse and shame. So when he comes to blows with Tom Berenger, the hard as nails (think I said that once) commander who likes to kill everything he sees, the fireworks certainly fly, ending in a huge battle of courage and survival.

"jb-schnitzler","8","2","5","15 August 2005"," The Best Vietnam movie.
","PLATOON (1986)---- I have now seen Apocalypse Now, Full Metal Jacket, Hamburger Hill, The Deer Hunter and Platoon. Of these 5 Vietnam dramas, I must say, Platoon is the best. Previously, I'd say Deer Hunter was the best, but after seeing Platoon, I have changed my mind. The Deer Hunter is still a masterpiece (as are the others, except for maybe Hamburger Hill), but I think that since Platoon is leaner, it has a slight advantage. Everyone says that The Deer Hunter's 30 minute wedding sequence develops the characters (which it does, to a certain degree) but I find it overly long. <br/><br/>Now to the actual review: Platoon begins in late 1967. Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen) has volunteered for the US army, and has been sent to Vietnam. Here, we are introduced to two sergeants: BARNES (Tom Berenger) and ELIAS (Willem Dafoe). They are fierce rivals, and have very differing opinions on the war. The lieutenant of this platoon sends Elias' squad (which happens to include Taylor) on an ambush mission. As the squad sleeps, Taylor watches. His shift ends, and he wakes up the next man. Chris awakens later, to find that Junior (the other man) has been sleeping the whole time. Expectedly, the Vietnamese attack, and the platoon loses a man. Taylor is left responsible, and it is here that he personally meets Barnes, a ruthless bastard who at first, Taylor admires. Throughout the movie, Taylor is in constant (emotional) pain. The movie is excellently acted. Charlie Sheen convinces you that Chris Taylor has many moral dilemmas. However, this is one of the only movies that has actually disturbed me. Maybe because it's so real. And that makes it even better. Barnes is simply sick, as is one of his followers, a man nicknamed Bunny. Chris begins to be disgusted with him, and as the platoon torches a Vietnamese village, he is shocked to find some of the US soldiers, his allies, raping a woman. The war is making him agitated and crazy, and as they are evacuating the village, he scares a Vietnamese man half to death with gunfire. However, Chris has a heart, he only wants the man out. Bunny (like I said) is the horrible human being, and he casually smashes the man's face in, while his wife is cowering on the floor. Not to be outdone, Barnes is trying to find out where this village got a huge stockade of grain. He threatens a man, and beats him around a little. A woman standing next to him (his wife) starts screaming and becomes hysterical. Barnes' solution? He shoots her in the head. Barnes badly wants the answer to his question. A young girl in the crowd is crying over her mother's murder. Barnes is so desperate (scratch that, disgusting) that he grabs her and puts a gun to her head. Elias (the good sergeant) starts to beat the hell out of the heartless bastard, and then he becomes blacklisted. The soldiers from the beginning are divided into two groups, those that follow Barnes, and those that follow Elias. Barnes' men are all cold and don't have much regard for human life. The worst part is when the soldiers are engaged in another battle. While the majority of soldiers fight at the fore-front, Elias believes that they may get flanked, and goes solo. He successfully kills all the opposing Vietnamese, only to be greeted by three of Barnes' bullets. Barnes leaves him for dead, and tells Taylor that Elias died. Taylor has become a close friend of Elias', and takes this hard. The surviving soldiers board a helicopter. However, in a masterfully directed sequence, we see Elias' bloody figure running away from dozens of Vietnamese. This scene struck an emotional chord with me. In this movie full of sick individuals, (many of which are only interested in killing and maiming) one of the only likable and respectable characters, is gunned down, backed by a chilling score. <br/><br/>This movie is amazing, real, and at times, disturbing. Watch it."
"jacron663","9","2","5","17 December 2004"," exceeds expectations
","I expected this to be a another semi-cheesy and mediocre war film that's only worth watchable once, and even that might be an overstatement. I was pleasantly surprised when it turned about to be fairly accurate about the immorality and horror of Vietnam (since I'm just a teenager I obviously don't know s**t myself, I'm basing that from what I've heard from vets)and also stars Willem Dafoe, who's always great and fun to watch. It's cool how there aren't any protagonists in this movie; the guy you'd expect to be the hero (Charlie Sheen) turns out to be just another dude who's corrupted by the war and turns into bandanna-sporting pothead (but what's wrong with that?). On a parallel with the primary review, my favorite scene was also when Elias comes hauling ass out of the forest, getting shot repeatedly and getting into that dramatic but somehow not cheesy posture while the Huey books it out of there. Barnes is obviously very hate-able, while the other characters fit into their roles well. The movie's the right length (2 hours), features some nice cinematography in the jungles, is free of cheesiness, is realistic and features strong performances from its cast. This movie definitely gets a 10/10 (trying not to be biased) and is without a doubt worth buying. In my opinion, it's a tie between Platoon and Apocalypse Now concerning which is a better Vietnam movie (although Apocalypse Now is definitely more surreal), but the solution if you haven't seen them is to rent and then buy both."
"malkane316","9","2","5","19 May 2004"," one line?
","This is above Apocalypse Now on my top 150 list, because I've always felt it shows a wider range of emotions and characters, and perhaps it is easier to identify with the struggle each man feels. Every actor is effective, from the leads, to the smaller parts like that of Kevin Dillon; his Bunny is both funny and horrifying. Stand out images: obviously that of Defoe, arms stretched to the sky as the outstanding music soars, but one of my favourites is the post napalm scene, when the jungle changes colour. Brilliant. The movie goes straight for your throat, shocking you at every turn, and although you may feel desensitized to some extent by the end, the images of brutality will stay on. Think war is fun? Watch this."
"marshall89","Null","2","5","14 March 2003"," Gritty and tense
","Most films about the Vietnam War deliver a powerful message. Apocalypse Now shows how war can drive a man to insanity and darkness, Full Metal Jacket focuses on dehumanization and turning wimps into killing machines, and The Deer Hunter tells the story of a simple friendship swept away by the tide of war. <br/><br/>Then there's Platoon, which shows how allies can start a war amongst them and become bigger dangers to one another than their real enemies. It also shows how the fight for leadership can tear into the ones who fight for it. But this conflict affects the soldiers most of all, and they must decide whether their loyalties are with the bitter, tough-as-nails leader (Tom Berenger), or the more faithful and supportive one (William Dafoe).<br/><br/>
SPOILER WARNING!!!!!!!! DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THIS MOVIE!!!<br/><br/>Platoon's gripping and unmerciful story is told by soldier Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen), a college dropout who put his education behind just to become a soldier. He is assigned to a platoon of mixed personalities and races such as Big Harold (Forest Whitaker), Rhah (Francesco Quinn), and Sgt. O'Neill (John McGinley). The soldiers must deal with the brutality and sickening reality of war: Rotting corpses, red ants biting your neck, swarms of gnats and mosquitoes that leave swollen bites all over your face, booby-trapped bunkers, and Viet Cong platooning by night. But the biggest threat to the well being of the band is the battle for its command.<br/><br/>
The platoon's leadership is split between scar-faced Sgt. Barnes (Berenger) and Sgt. Elias (Dafoe). Sgt. Barnes is a hateful and ungracious troop who kills with a vengeance. Elias is a man who has lost faith in the war, but still cares for his fellow soldiers. At first the two are able to cooperate, but when they are faced with a threat or are caught in a tight situation their decisions are almost exactly different. If a man were wounded, Barnes would rather leave his body to rot rather than tend to him, whereas Elias calls in for medical attention immediately. When the platoon invades a Vietnamese village, Barnes will shoot anybody who dares to try and stop him and even threatens to kill a child, but Elias would rather save the civilians and do what must be done. The conflict between the two eventually reaches boiling point, and when Elias stumbles upon Barnes during a Vietnamese troop invasion, his ungrateful rival shoots him. Taylor, whose loyalty had been with Elias during his gruesome stay, starts to believe that Barnes shot Elias when he sees the wounded and helpless sergeant praying for mercy while being hunted down by Viet Cong troops. When they meet back at base later on, Chris jumps right to conclusions with Barnes and attempts to kill him. He fails, however, and Barnes isn't daunted.<br/><br/>
The next day, the platoon heads out to the jungle once more to battle the Vietnamese troops. The Viet Cong strike late at night, attacking the American bunkers and outposts with full force. As bullets ricochet everywhere and explosions and fires erupt, a scrambling Taylor runs into Barnes, who has gone insane and is repeatedly stabbing a Viet Cong troop to death. Taylor pulls Barnes back, who pins him down and holds his knife high above him, ready to stab him to death. As Chris screams, a jet flies overhead and launches bombs, sending the forest up in a fiery napalm explosion and wiping nearly everything out. When Taylor wakes up the next morning, he finds a severely injured Barnes crawling across the ground in search of medical aid. When he turns around to find Taylor pointing a rifle at him, he says, `Go ahead. Shoot me.' In two seconds he's lying on the ground with bullets in his chest. Then, all of a sudden, a search team arrives to rescue Taylor and bring him back to the helicopter landing field. He is then carried aboard one on a stretcher, his time in Vietnam finished. But as the chopper sails over the smoking and body-ridden battlefield, Taylor begins to cry, realizing that the biggest enemy of all proved to be themselves.<br/><br/>Shortly put, this is one of the best films ever made. One of the many things that helps it achieve its status of greatness is the message it delivers. It basically shows how war can wreck the lives of those sucked in, and although there aren't any metaphorical aspects to it or such, it's still a powerful message that is perfectly exemplified by Oliver Stone. You can clearly see it right at the beginning when leaving troops shoot a cold glance towards Chris and the other newcomers. And from there on it becomes stronger and stronger.<br/><br/>But perhaps the best thing about the entire movie is the tension that constantly builds during each climax. The way Stone makes the Viet Cong appear as camouflaged silhouettes is eerie, presenting them as faceless, ghostlike figures. The very first climax with Taylor watching the Vietnamese troops in silence as they approach is perfectly shot from different angles, implying a strong sense of fear and anxiety upon the viewer. And when the tension lets up, it's perfectly relieved by a pulse-pounding sequence that moves at a fast pace. <br/><br/>The casting in Platoon is also good as well. Charlie Sheen follows the footsteps of his father with a stellar performance and well-placed narrating (Like father, like son). Tom Berenger is good, but I found his character almost impossible to like. Naturally, I preferred William Dafoe, who would probably be my pick for the best performance in the movie. The performances of Forest Whitaker and John McGinley are also good, and the film features plenty of other soon-to-be-famous faces like Johnny Depp and Keith David. But the problem with Platoon's characterization is that it tries to cover too many different people at once, making it a bit hard to follow each character. But that has got to be the only flaw in general. And since the characters are perfectly developed, it's not much of a problem.<br/><br/>
Platoon is simply a great movie, and it is right on the grand scale of great war films like Apocalypse Now, Full Metal Jacket, and The Deer Hunter. Everything is perfect, from the action to the cinematography, and it's about as good as a war movie can get. All in all, a must see film.<br/><br/>

I was always aware I was watching a movie; it never got beyond the screen to become an experience I got drawn in to.<br/><br/>The same goes for the production itself. While it had special effects galore, to me the action was just a lot of those expensive but not convincing effects. Again, the would-be horrific scenes never transcended the screen and gripped me.

","The film has as its core the supposed moral rift between two fundamental attitudes to war, represented by the two officers in the protagonist's platoon. But that conflict does not exist in real life, only on film. If the aim of the film was to say something about human nature, it failed. The characters are caricatures, nothing more. In real life, most soldiers simply don't care. They want to survive, they do what they have to do, and that's it. War is about survival, not philosophy. Soldiers don't spend their free time between battles thinking about good and evil. They think about how much they miss home. And when civilians get killed, no one has the time or strength to worry about it. You are too busy being on the edge of a nervous breakdown, or thanking God you didn't die. You just don't care."

","PLATOON (1986) **** Charlie Sheen, Willem Dafoe, Tom Berenger, Francesco Quinn, Kevin Dillon, Keith David, Forest Whitaker, Johnny Depp, John C. McGinley, Richard Edson, Tony Todd.   Oliver Stone's Oscar-winning masterpiece film about the horrors of the Vietnam war unflinchingly powerful and one of the most important films about war in general.  Told from a green 'grunt' 's point of view (Sheen in his best role ever) facing two father figures in the forms of sergeants Barnes (Berenger a scarred, vile thug) and the elegiac Elias (gaunt, weary and sympathetic Dafoe) who help guide him through his baptism of fire.  Devastating and brutal but never gratuitous despite its gory violence, the message of the US not going to war is all the more potent.  Memorable moment: Barnes terrorizing a Vietnamese family and Elias' fate with Christ-like epiphany.  Stone won the Best Director Academy Award and the film, Best Picture, and both deservingly so.  Additional Oscars went for Best Editing and Best Sound.  Berenger and Dafoe were nominated both for Best Supporting Actor and lost to Michael Caine for ""Hannah and Her Sisters""."

","""It's a lovely f***ing war."" This acts as the true repudiation of all of the Gung-ho Ra-Ra ""we're gonna win this time"" action films of the 1980's, but it also gets to have it's cake and eat it by being a muscular, hardcore damn (and damning) action picture, photographed by Robert Richardson in the days when he was still coming off being a documentary cameraman and before he got into his spotlights. It's Full Metal Oliver Stone, so much of what he was as a young 'grunt' in the 's***' that was Vietnam but also what he was in the intervening years (it took him a while to figure out what kind of movie it was, about 7 years after he left he wrote a first draft, another 10 years until it got made).<br/><br/>I don't know if necessarily Stone had Rambo and the Chuck Norris pieces of crap or all those other movies where people were returning to Vietnam to ""win again"", to fulfill some kind of vision that America didn't really *lose*, but there are two aspects of this movie that do a wonderful job of giving the middle finger to the military industrial complex and even military movies: Tom Berenger's hard-ass Sgt. Barnes, who gets s**t done and is a tough motherf****r, but also shirks responsibility for his rage and in killing innocents in full view of others and cold blood (maybe a minor plot-gap - sure Elias might stir hell up and report him, but even if he's gone no one else would speak up about a, you know *Court Martial*-able crime? oh well, I'll let it go I guess), and yet you completely understand who he is and what he's doing, why even if he is a true antagonist in his brutality he's human in his monstrosity, if that makes sense (see how he chugs Jack Daniels when he makes his 'I s*** on all of you' entrance to the other grunts talking about whether to take him out or not).<br/><br/>The other aspect is the climax; this is one of those major, hyper-realistic and hyper-violent and intense action set pieces with lots of gunfire and explosions and chaos, but a) you can understand everything going on (it'd be nice to show this sequence to action editors and directors today), and more important b) the Americans lose. The VC take over the military camp and the whole perimeter, and there's no choice but to call in the planes to drop some bombs on the area. It shouldn't be overlooked: the Americans *lose*, which encapsulates the message of the movie. Of course there were war movies before that didn't celebrate one side or the other - All Quiet on the Western Front, Paths of Glory - but a lot of those films were exceptions.<br/><br/>Though Full Metal Jacket came out a mere six months later - a coincidence I'm sure - many other movies, great ones, came out due to this one being released (Casualties of War being the most notable to me, but also Stone's other war pictures; oddly enough he wanted to also make Born on the 4th of July years before and only Platoon made it possible). I don't even know if it's his best or my personal favorite, but it certainly shows a filmmaker screaming out his concerns and passions as an artist about a place and time that is also meant to stretch beyond this war and to others; when Sheen gives that on the surface preachy narration at the end about ""we didn't fight the enemy, we fought ourselves,"" it can be spread out into other wars, other times people who thought they were in the right, the Barnes and Rambos, didn't see the BS (or accepted it, said 'screw it' with a giant machine gun).<br/><br/>Last note: Willem Dafoe's Jesus pose makes for a helluva poster, but in the context of the scene it's in... is it earned? There's enough operatic-horrors going on, which is fine, but it comes off as a bit much. But it's Dafoe so, I dunno, he's awesome."
"tfrizzell","Null","2","6","8 December 2001"," Oliver Stone's Haunting Vietnam Masterpiece
","There has been much debate about what was the best film of the 1980s. ""Platoon"" deserves real consideration. I don't think it was the best (I am partial to ""Raging Bull""), but ""Platoon"" is easily in the top five of that decade. Writer-director Oliver Stone's experiences in Vietnam were the catalysts for this amazing masterpiece which won four Oscars in 1986, including the Best Picture of the year. Young Charlie Sheen experiences a year of hell as he witnesses atrocities and learns first-hand that innocence is the initial casualty of warfare. At the heart of ""Platoon"" is the conflict between veteran sergeants Tom Berenger and Willem Dafoe (both Oscar-nominated). Berenger is crazed and has distorted views about war. His twisted views will lead to conflict with peaceful and deep-thinking Willem Dafoe who acts as the voice of reason in a time and place of total chaos. Sheen, Berenger and Dafoe all have the best performances to date. They are solid in every way imaginable. Familiar faces like John C. McGinley, Keith David, Johnny Depp, Forest Whitaker, Kevin Dillon and Tony Todd are all perfect in limited, but important screen time. Oliver Stone, regardless of what else he has done or will do, will always be remembered for his stunning creation of this film. A true modern-day masterpiece. 5 stars out of 5."

","Platoon is so much more than just your average war film. This is actually rather intelligent, both in its plot and technical execution. It's the Vietnam War, we follow a platoon of US soldiers as they attempt to wipe out the enemy. The question that this film raises is: who really is the enemy? You have the conflict of the war itself (America against Vietnam) but within the platoon is a conflict for authority. Split between what is right and what is wrong, the moral implications of this war have taken effect on several soldiers as they question their choices. This was a smart element to include within the plot, it was easier to establish character development and build some tension. The majority of the characters were sufficiently developed and their personalities had charisma. This was mostly down to the great cast. Willem Dafoe was easily the best performance, Tom Berenger was also decent and the heated chemistry between them was well conveyed. Oliver Stone's direction was solid, very realistic and gritty. The makeup effects were practical, the wounds and blown up limbs looked pretty damn realistic. A standout scene was the raiding of the Vietnamese village. This was the turning point where actually the American side were perceived as the antagonists, clearly communicating with our inner moral compasses. Effective, very effective. This is easily one of the best war films I've seen and winning Best Picture was fully justified."

","""Platoon"" (1986) directed and written by Oliver Stone treats the malignancy of the Vietnam war with striking authenticity. With its Interesting narrative structure, and ability to build suspense in the subtleties, it excited and frightened me.<br/><br/>Excellent writing and direction by Stone, and the fact that he himself is a Vietnam veteran I think comes across in the excellent screenplay. Strong performances by Tom Berenger, Forest Whitaker. The same cannot be said of Charlie Sheen who at times was almost embarrasing. But most of all, I thought Willem Dafoe did a wonderful performance as Elias.<br/><br/>As a mid-eighties war film, I cannot help but compare it to its predecessor by one-year, ""Idi i smotri"" by Elem Klimov, which is nothing short of magnificent, with beautiful camera work exemplified through creative pans, stunning long takes and tracking shots. Cinematographer Aleksey Rodionov did an absolutely fantastic job, harnessing the potential of the 4:3 aspect ratio. Here, we see a 16:9 format - also brilliantly used by the amazing DP, Robert Richardson.<br/><br/>While ""Idi i smotri"" is virtually an unparralelled masterpiece as a war film, being spontaneous, organic, and authentic, yet controlled and deliberate, I found ""Platoon"" to be poetic and nuanced in its own right. In my opinion it is an anti-war film; an excellent film about the psychological terror and dehumanization of war."
"BadChristian","8","1","2","23 June 2019"," Realistic war movie with unrealistic warfare
","Platoon is a distressing, dark, and disturbing film, but far too often it pulls its punches. Right out of the gate, Platoon sees our main character, portrayed by Charlie Sheen, starting his tour in the Vietnam War. What follows tries to be a serious, realistic vision of the war and its effects on our soldiers. For the most part, it succeeds. The story itself is the standard Vietnam story with some added dramatic elements and about half of the acting is pretty great (there are a lot of future stars here that I wasn't expecting to see). The other half of the cast ranges from below average to awful, but I'm not expecting an A+ cast in a war movie. My main issue is that even though they do express the atrocities of the Vietnam war and almost all of the characters felt real and I cared about what happened to them (whether I was invested in their survival or praying for their demise) even without contextualizing anything, Oliver Stone really dialed back the realism on the violence. Rarely do gunshots feel real, either the actual shot from the gun or the impact, and the blood effects are pretty terrible. I can understand toning it down if the level of violence was also toned down, but aside from a few events that we hear, but the camera cuts away so that we don't see, Platoon still has a lot of violence and death. No one ever acts like they were hit by a bullet, they just all of a sudden collapse and are covered in blood, there is no reaction to the impact and quite a few of the actors seem to think that a bullet wound causes generalized pain and not location specific. We see a head shot, but beyond a little skyward squirt, the only blood we see is a smear across where the bullet wound should be. I'm not asking for Quentin Tarantino or Eli Roth levels of blood and gore, but if realism is the goal, it should be applied equally, especially if your movie is essentially meant to be anti-war propaganda, you would assume that he'd want to paint a full picture. The story is generic and the effects are bad, but it has heart and there is a level of enjoyment to be had just seeing all these familiar faces showing up looking a lot younger than we're used to (I'd recommend not looking at any cast listings, because finally hitting the credits and saying ""I though that was him!"" is a blast). One thing that I'm not quite sure about is whether the Vietnamese and Philippine actors were just really bad actors (a good number of them are Vietnamese refugees that just happened to be living the the Philippines when they were shooting) or if it's a cultural thing. There is one woman who has a very convincing performance, but most of them are just blank mannequins that don't convey any emotion and sometimes smile when watching their neighbors die. If it was just the VC, it wouldn't even be noticeable, but when we see individual actors for any prolonged amount of time, it becomes clear that they aren't ""real"" actors and are just trying their best. Platoon is a solid Vietnam War movie that hits all the emotional notes it tries to, but is missing any real artistic style. Basically, I wanted something more like Full Metal Jacket; unflinching and real, but with cinematography that felt like it belongs to a director's vision."

"em_emrah","9","1","2","10 February 2019"," War is Beyond Morality
","What ""Saving Private Ryan"" is when compared with ""Thin Red Line"", is ""Platoon"" vis a vis ""Apocalypse Now"" in that, whereas the latter of both pairs reflect the irrationality of war, the former ones of each take into focus all that is inhumane and unbearable on the horrifying scene of war; that is, the formers are the emotional counterparts of the latters which are based on the meditative tone of philosophical movies. Indeed, ""Platoon"" is the film which concentrates upon the cathartic effect rather than on the uninterrupted reflective mode typical of the solemn atmophere depicted by the philosophical films. For me, one of the most unsettling messages of the film is that wartime is when the good and the bad become indistinguishable. As a matter of fact, war is the event during which your comrade may become the one whom you get ashamed of yourself fighting shoulder to shoulder with. Killing the brother in arms as a consequential act of seeking justice is one of the most striking scenes and reminded me of the fact that a person is always in danger of falling into conflict with himself like the private who has been in conflict with his comrade whom he killed in the end. The impossibility of perfect match with the comrades whom you entrust your life during the wartime can be interpreted as the continual interrogation of conscience which cannot be interrupted even when coming face to face with death. But I am not sure whether this inference is too optimistic to be accepted or not. Nevertheless, one thing is for sure and it is that being the area of perpetual conflict, war is the sphere which takes place beyond the realm of moral thinking and its untouchable Platonic ideas of good and bad. The bodies together with the dreams of men are not the only casualties of war; moral principles should be added to them."

","Platoon is a brilliantly crafted film, made by a director who actually served in the Vietnam war. What makes Platoon especially unusual IMO is its realistic depiction of deliberate and sickening atrocities by US troops. I can think of very few other US made war films where this is so, at least not without some 'justification'.<br/><br/>Americans tend to be very jingoistic about their super powerful military, and incredibly myopic about the many morally questionable actions it has carried out around the world since WW2. That a Hollywood movie would actually confront a domestic US audience with the terrible atrocities that US troops committed in Vietnaam is a geniune surpise.<br/><br/>Around 4 million Vietnamese citizens died in the war, a huge proportion of those by US bombs and bullets, either by inetentional action or by 'collaterall damage'. Of those killed around 1/4 were children under the age of 13. The Vietnam war is a stain on the moral concscience of the US (such as it is). That this was the case was recognised by the millions of young US anti-war protestors at the time who did not want any part in it and fought the draft (note there were almost no anti-war protestors during WW2 conscription). The depressing thing is that the anti-war conscience of this generation, many of whom hold power today, has not tempered recent US military policy or actions.<br/><br/>Even though Oliver Stone (in his film ""Platoon"") makes Americans face-up to the reprhensible actions their soldiers carried out in Vietnaam, he still feels compelled to weave this reality into a storyline of 'good v evil' 'ying v yang', i.e. Sgt Barnes v. Sgt Elias. That way the audience is left feeling, Oh well, that was just one bad dude, Sgt Barnes. The reality was there were countless 'bad dudes' from the Private level to likes of General Westmoreland.<br/><br/>The My Lai massacre and the subsequent pardoning of Lt Calley, perhaps the crowning US atrocity of the Vietnam war, was to be the subject of another Stone movie ""Pinksville"". However, I doubt this movie will ever be made, because a US audience will not want to see it, and there is no easy way of weaving good guy Sgt Elias characters into that shameful episode."

All this and more is incorporated here, underlined by a marvelous score, convincingly acted in almost every role, scarring to watch, thought provoking and honest. On the downside, there are some minor continuity errors, lack in realism and typical Oliver Stone-esque transcendental scenes, though non of these infringe on any of the premises of this film unless you are a stickler for every last detail.

","In my eyes the best film Oliver Stone ever made, Platoon mirrors his own experiences as a GI serving time in Vietnam.<br/><br/>The story is told from the point of view of runt Chris Taylor, an educated boy who volunteers to serve in the war, who discovers that patrolling the jungles around Cambodia not only drastically raises the mortality rate, it renders him completely worthless in the eyes of those who've served any amount of time longer than he has.<br/><br/>Quickly outliving his fellow runts, Taylor sees a line in the sand drawn between the laid back and sympathetic Sgt. Elias (Willem Dafoe in a very emotionally memorable role) and his pot smoking troops and the hard-edged Sgt. Barnes (Tom Berenger in an equally powerful but darker role) and his beer and whiskey drinking ass-kickers. He immediately chooses to side with Elias' squad, just wanting to make it through the war with his mind in tact but that hope doesn't last so long as the deeper into the jungle they roam, and the more horrors they witness, the powers that be and their backers become corrupted by hatred towards the Vietnamese and one another.<br/><br/>Soon enough, the conflict rages out of control and when the enemy launches a massive offensive, the platoon is barely able to fight their way out after communication between them has completely broken down.<br/><br/>Platoon boasts possibly the largest number of relatively fresh stars launched into movie stardom and legend status for any film in history although there were some familiar faces that had featured in successful titles some years before such as Keith David (The Thing) and Tom Berenger (Dogs of War). Other names include Charlie Sheen (Two And A Half Men), Forest Whittaker (Phenomenon), Tony Todd (Candyman), Kevin Dillon (Entourage), John C. McGinley (Scrubs), Johnny Depp (who???) and the list goes on.<br/><br/>'Platoon' boasts a massive multi-strand narrative telling not only the story of the war and the overbearing in-fighting between Elias and Barnes, but also the individual stories of soldiers destined to either go home or just fill another black rubber bag. It's touching even to see someone we don't like very much spouting obscenities like a broken record player one moment and then their bloody lifeless body being thrown on the pile the next moment and that imagery sums up the war for so many people; kids just working themselves into bad habits, watching their best friends die and knowing deep down that they are going to die too. It makes every tiny little indiscretion worth fighting for and that's why they all end up jumping at each others' throats, acting more like a lynch-mob than a platoon.<br/><br/>It also boasts the most organic scenery ever used in a film of its kind and, of course, the now legendary 'Adagio For Strings' theme by Samuel Barber, which was made so memorable in its many scenes imprinted on the impressionable human mind.<br/><br/>The perfect mix of drama and action, comedy and tragedy, feel-good factor and depression any war film could hope for, Platoon reaches a conclusion that not only hits you like a bullet between the eyes, it leaves you wondering what happened to all those left behind, the ones that survived up until the final credits!"
"Gerionas","8","1","2","22 June 2011"," ""We did not fight the enemy; we fought ourselves. The enemy was in us.""
","Those are the words from the last lines of the movie. The movie that today is seen as one of the most accurate Vietnam War movies. Directed by Vietnam vet O. Stone, Platoon is a very emotional story about war and about ordinary people who try to survive during it. Stone tried to make a war movie that would not be a fantasy, legend or metaphor but simply a memory of what he had seen in Vietnam. As far as I am concerned, he succeeded in every way. Main stars of the film are Ch. Sheen (echo to his father's role in Apoclapyse Now), W. Dafoe and T. Berenger.<br/><br/>Platoon's storyline is very simple. A young recruit Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen) comes to Vietnam in order to serve his country. He is full of hopes and patriotism. However, soon Taylor realizes that war is not a fairy tale. He confronts horrors of war and faces the moral crisis. Chris searches for someone to lean on and finds himself in crossfire between two commanding officers Sgt. Elias (Willem Dafoe) and Sgt. Barnes (Tom Berenger). Before long, Taylor has to decide which ones views he finds more reasonable.<br/><br/>While it is obvious that the storyline is not a very strong one, movie's strength lies in other places. One of them is the collision of two very strong personalities – Sgt. Elias and Sgt. Barnes. Firstly, neither of them is a typical war hero that we are used to see in movies. Sgt. Elias is a compassionate and charismatic leader who is experienced enough not to lose his mind and to defend his beliefs, however he is not perfect either and we see him doing drugs to escape from this war. Barnes is a veteran sergeant with many scars on his face (one of the characters says that he was hit seven times). His bravery and combat skills are undeniable and his men even believe that he cannot be killed. Barnes does not do drugs, he is a kind of man that bravely stands up to reality and does not hide from it. However, he has his dark side either – he saw so much in his life that killing is nothing more but a necessity for him. When we see both of these characters on the screen, we can sense the tension between them and it takes movie on a higher level.<br/><br/>When there is no fighting and no Sgt. Elias or Sgt. Barnes on the screen, the story revolves around a bunch of young freshmen. Their metamorphosis from frightful rookies to solders is one of the most interesting things in Platoon. It amazes and scares how war changes and splits people. Even though all rookies seem to be different personalities, they all go through the same path during the war and only at the end of this path, they become real soldiers. In this movie, we are shown that there only are three kinds of real solders – hardy and cruel (like Barnes), fearful and weak (like Sgt. O'Neill (John C. McGinley)) and there are some who manages to keep their sane mind and become brave and calm solders like Elias.<br/><br/>To sum up, Platoon is an overwhelming war drama that helps us to feel what war really feels like and shows what war does to people. It is not a movie full of special effects or a philosophical journey to human heart and sometimes the simplicity of the story annoys a bit. However, it is a human drama than can and should be seen by every grown up because of its anti-war message.<br/><br/>2011-06-22"

","Oliver Stone directed a trilogy of Vietnam war films and the first was Platoon. It became his most critically acclaimed of the three war epics, and one of his most acclaimed films of all time. Platoon follows a platoon of men in Vietnam as they battle the Viet Cong, the jungle, and themselves. Stone makes sure to include every bit of gut wrenching drama he can, pumping this film full of brutally emotional scenes. This is a true film about war and the men involved in it.<br/><br/>Platoon is essentially your most down to earth war film in spite of everything. It is brutal and some of the atrocity and harrowing destruction witnessed in this film is unreal, but it truly captures the brutality of the Vietnam war, and I feel like that is this films main goal. This film chronicles the immediate effects of war on the men participating, as the entire film takes place in Vietnam there is almost always fighting going on. The film sets its focus on the war itself and the individuals fighting, as we get to know each of the characters in this film, some better than others. You can tell that this is a soldier's film and nothing else, as the film is even dedicated to the brave men who fought in Vietnam.<br/><br/>As a personal opinion on taste, Platoon doesn't quite hold up to some of my favorite war films. I myself am fascinated by the idea of war and the effects it has on the minds of men, and Platoon doesn't examine this as much as other war films. But like I said, this is solely a film about war, while films like The Deer Hunter, a masterpiece in my book, examines the relationships of people and how war effects the before and after. Then you have a movie like Apocalypse Now, the greatest war film ever made, which is really a movie about the horror and atrocity mankind can inflict, and it only uses the Vietnam war as a backdrop. Platoon doesn't go as deep as these films, and really only strives to be an eccentric visual experience that tells the story of war and the men involved.<br/><br/>Where Platoon shines the brightest is its incredible visuals. This movie captures the sights and sounds of the fighting in Vietnam with the utmost brutality. Stone masterfully shoots the jungle in both day and night, rain and shine. He completely deserved the Oscar he received for directing this film. He manages to keep all of his frames tight and clear, depicting a view of Vietnam that is very focused and difficult to look away from, no matter how much you want to at times. However intense you think this film is going to be, it is more than that.<br/><br/>Platoon is far from one of my favorite war films of all time, but I can't deny that it is a masterfully made film. As a movie about war and soldiers it is masterful, but it doesn't quite reach that deeper, more subjective, level that other Vietnam films do. But it still quite the cinematic war experience."

","That's the title card to Oliver Stone's 1986 Vietnam War masterpiece ""Platoon"", but you're not going to see much rejoicing in this film 'cause it identifies the Vietnam infantry experience as no less than hell on earth.<br/><br/>THE PLOT: Chris Taylor naively volunteers for combat in Vietnam (late '67 through '68) and slowly adapts to the jungle warfare and becomes an adequate grunt. A rift eventually develops between the senior sergeant, Barnes (Tom Berenger), and the junior sergeant, Elias (Willem Dafoe); the former a veritable indestructible killing machine and the latter an expert soldier who refuses to allow the horrors of war to rob him of his humanity.<br/><br/>""Platoon"" is masterful movie-making in practically every way and towers over most other Vietnam war flicks, with the sole exception of ""Apocalypse Now"" (the original version). What works best is the ensemble cast and the numerous memorable characters who all smack of real life -- Taylor, Barnes, Elias, Lt. Wolfe, O'Neill, Bunny, Junior, King, Rhah, Crawford, Tex and Big Harold (amongst others). The idea that any filmmaker can effectively bring to life a dozen or more characters like this in a 2-hour film is uncanny to say the least.<br/><br/>Memorable moments abound, including: <br/><br/><ul><li>After stumbling upon a just-abandoned Vietcong nest where a soldier comes up missing, the platoon finds his corpse staked-up down the river and the camera slowly pans across the visage of practically every platoon member culminating with Barnes, who mutters with seething vengeance. This is a potent scene spotlighting a band of American warriors, from very diverse racial/ethnic/socio-economic backgrounds, forced together halfway around the world in some God-forsaken jungle to face an enemy of jungle wraiths.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>After the Barnes/Elias fight at the village Barnes is informed by Captain Harris that there will be a full investigation. Barnes leaves the meeting and walks by his two disciples O'Niell and Bunny. O'Neill asks Barnes if there's going to be an investigation. The laconic Barnes stops but doesn't answer; he just looks away, as if in thought, smoking his cigarette. The camera stays on Barnes while Bunny responds: ""O'Neill, man, you worry to much; the sergeant will take care of him."" Looking at Barnes' countenance you just KNOW he's contemplating murder. The scene is filmmaking of the highest order.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>In a dugout six of the soldiers who sided with Elias discuss what to do after it appears Elias had been shot by Barnes in combat. They all want to kill the scarred-face Barnes, but Rhah reveals Barnes' stature with the men is nigh mythological at this point; he's been hit seven times and still isn't dead. ""Barnes ain't meant to die! The only thing that can kill Barnes is Barnes"". A shirtless Barnes suddenly appears, drinking a bottle of whiskey; apparently he heard the whole conversation. He boldly confronts all six with a fascinating rant (""I am reality"") and challenges them to kill him. None of them take the bait because they deem him a human tiger, except Taylor, who's no match for Barnes in man-to-man combat. Although Barnes is the villain in the film you can't help but admire his sheer boldness and killer skills; it's clear why the men respect and fear him.</li></ul><br/><br/>By contrast, Elias is the compassionate, loving and righteous Christ-figure. If there's any doubt to this it's bludgeoned into the viewer via the melodramatic and unrealistic death scene, which can be (slightly) excused on the grounds of its iconic imagery (the cover of the DVD) and obvious symbolism. This scene is the only reason I rate the film 9/10 rather than 10/10.<br/><br/>Bunny (Kevin Dillon) is an interesting character. He's young, simple and likable but the war morphs him into a nigh-psychotic killer, so much so that he seriously creeps the other men out. But, again, he somehow maintains an amiable charm, unlike Tex who comes across wholly venomous.<br/><br/>Some have criticized that it's impossible to make a war film that's anti-war on the grounds that war films by their nature make war seem fun in an adventurous way. Not so with ""Platoon"". How did Stone accomplish this? Well, aside from skillfully showing the hard day-to-day life of infantry men in the jungle, the combat scenes are viewed from the grunt's disoriented perspective where, often, there are no clear battle lines of good guys/bad guys (even within the platoon itself!); the enemy -- ghostly figures who are never clearly seen -- can come from any angle. Anything can and does happen, at anytime. Stone denies the viewer the feeling that this type of jungle combat makes sense. Needless to ask, how can anyone go through such without being inwardly scarred for life? Some criticize the flagrant cussing but Stone was shooting for realism; I know from experience that this is generally how grunts talk. I don't know about you but, if I'm going to see a war film, I want to see the awful truth, not some cleaned-up fantasy BS.<br/><br/>The ending shows that Barnes & Elias are figurative of flesh & spirit, the conflicting forces within us all. (SPOILER) Taylor reflects, ""The war is over for me now, but it will always be there the rest of my days, as I'm sure Elias will be, fighting with Barnes for what Rhah called 'possession of my soul'. There are times since I've felt like a child, born of those two fathers. But, be that as it may, those of us who did make it have an obligation to build again, to teach to others what we know, and to try with what's left of our lives to find a goodness and a meaning to this life."" Amen.<br/><br/>GRADE: A"
"andy-933-696608","9","1","2","26 December 2010"," Platton movie review
","It's both invoking in the plot, but more engaging with its uniquely believable characters. Oliver stone directs a master piece of both modern, and psychological warfare, embarking on a quest where its focused soldiers must an enemy far greater than the gooks, themselves. It's very strange that when we fight a known enemy any actions, no matter how cruel or vile, they seem normal. However when we fight amongst ourselves, all goes to hell. In the time of the film, our apparent hero Chris Taylor (Sheen) narrates both his feelings, his clarifications, as well as his doubts on the subject of the war. As Taylor walks us through his own experience of the Hell that once made go into an infinite panic, we all get brief but accurate glimpses of the true Vietnam. If many people believed that being a soldier back then was a proud honor, no matter what unit, or what position they were placed in, then they were dead wrong. It was nothing more and nothing less. The grunts were able to take it , on the account that they were nothing before they had the military. It's quite graphic and yet enjoyable to watch as Oliver Stone digs deep into what many soldiers were like back then. Vietnam was a very difficult time, not just for this country, but for the very men fighting in it. In their gaze of that very Hell they resorted to drug use out of a necessity to escape that endless cold reality of death, and what struck me as intrigued was just how believable the characters were. They all felt screwed over in whatever way the war ,or the military had done to them. Some used their own moral compass to make actions any sane human would easily hesitate to make. The very performance by Tom Beranger as Sgt. Barnes was incredible, as he represented a soldier who has had his good time in Vietnam well enough to see how and what he can do. He gazes on the very pot heads he commands, saying he is reality, only to have viewers assume that he feels no repent for his less than prominent actions. Sgt. Allias (Daffoe) is portrayed as the more rational soldier, whom like Barnes understands the nature of how much insanity defines the very war they are fighting, while still maintaining his own dignity as a human being and not a murderer with authority. Its very clear that the established rivalry among these two Sergeants divides soldiers into two different sides, making the Gooks the least of their problems. Basically the film portrays Vietnam as general Vietnam. Early 5 a.m. wake up, daily digging and humping, and all night watches through dark infested Jungles. It's all very clear at just how little the gooks were as the enemy, for the true battle was between themselves. As Taylor's character goes through more improved developments, responding more commonly to the very site of war, everything becomes more clear to him. That very knowledge has given him the assurance that he can use what he learned in his experience as guidance, knowing he will never be the same again. Taylor came to Vietnam as a college dropout with very little Ambition, and he came out with more than an experience, but a forever lasting mark of the true nature of war. ""Platoon"" is a riveting war drama, combining a brilliant form of direction as Oliver Stone maintains focus on the elements of the Vietnam war, out of respect for those who died, and delivers characters that are very common and yet very unique by the personalities that define them. ""Platoon"" gives viewers a deeper look into what goes on inside the platoon, rather than what is outside it."

","Platoon is just another war film or its something else.Yes,it is just not another war film.Seems like a war film with strong undercurrents questioning man moments of honesty and his will to do good.Oliver Stone gives us Vietnams Vengeance on the morality of U.S army officers.The movie shows how U.S war soldiers hated Vietnam and hence in their anger and fury started hating each other.Charlie Sheen performance is commendable as he is the one who is haunted by the questions of good and evil in the jungles of Vietnam.But the movie describes the inner self of two men.Elias as William Defoe and Barnes as Tom Berenger.Both are warriors and both are haunted by war.Both have their own ways of surviving and satisfaction.Barnes turns to bad killing innocents whereas Elias finds satisfaction in taking of drugs and always helping others.The movie also has some famous actors like Johnny Depp and Forest Whitetaker when they were not famous.Some scenes like Elias running from Vietnamese and crying for help to his friends are amazing.The soundtrack of Samuel Barber's Adagio for Strings will surely leave you numb.War scenes are well carried out and character display is perfect.Oliver Stone here gives a film that leaves you numb and all think that war could turn all good to evil.Charlie Sheen ending lines are captivating and echoing.Platoon talks about hatred for Vietnam,love for home,innocence of youth and last but not the least morality of men who usually get consumed and lost in the war."

","Probably the most beautiful and most touching war film ever made, by the man directing it, Oliver Stone. He is known for his war-type films like 'born on the fourth of july' and 'jfk' and few others. He has made us experience a Vietnam dream with our own eyes.<br/><br/>Starring Charlie Sheen as one of the main characters, has an amazing performance, also starring Tom Berenger and Williem Dafoe. they show amazing performances as the two officers. it has deserved a lot of great respect over the years since '86, and still remains as a classic film. I would say it's better than 'saving private ryan' or 'full metal jacket'. I think this film wins as the most touching war film.<br/><br/>The amazing thing about it is, it's not as much blood in the film as it looks. it does have intense scenes with shooting, but it actually doesn't show the goriest blood ever seen, which i think is good that its not show much. the language in it is the most intense though. All im doing is just telling what is to come in the film. Im sure a lot of people have seen it though. another film i think is very good is ""the deer hunter"" which is another fantastic Vietnam experience.<br/><br/>Oliver stone has made very great achievements in his films."
"TheUnknown837-1","10","1","2","18 October 2008"," Oliver Stone's gritty and emotionally overwhelming portrait of Vietnam
","In 1986, Vietnam veteran-turned-filmmaker Oliver Stone directed ""Platoon"", a film that went on to score four wins at the Academy Awards, including one for Stone himself. And it is easy to see why a film such as ""Platoon"" could not only accomplish that but also go on to be considered one of the best motion pictures of all time. It is a gritty, horrifying, profanity-filled (but in a recommendable way) portrait of the unjustifiable Vietnam War and will continue to live on in the memories of audience members for ages to come.<br/><br/>""Platoon"" stars Charlie Sheen in what I think is one of his better performances (it is nice to see a gifted actor like Sheen occasionally stepping away from the dull low-budget comedies he and others like him are often associated with) as Chris, a young recruit who enlists to fight in the Vietnam War, only to find in his experiences it was all a horrible mistake. He becomes part of a platoon of soldiers who are divided between their two sergeants, a violent fighter named Barnes (Tom Berenger) and the more calm and patient Elias (Willem Dafoe). Chris soon discovers that as a newcomer, he is not expected to live very long through the war and as time marches on and killing after killing passes, he begins to believe it too.<br/><br/>Aside from Sheen, Berenger, and Dafoe (the last two received Academy Award nominations for their performances in this film) the film stars Forrest Whittaker, Francesco Quinn, and a very young Johnny Depp among other gifted actors. They portray characters who are so wonderfully modeled by Oliver Stone's screenplay and so well fitted into this horrible wartime setting that from start to finish, it is nearly impossible for the audience to decipher which characters are going to be killed off and which, if any, are not. This enhances the atmosphere of the film and makes it seem more like a true story rather than just a motion picture detailing a fictional chapter of a real-life conflict.<br/><br/>There is a lot of profanity in ""Platoon"" that many viewers will find so much as to even describe the film as anti-American. There is excessive swearing, drugs, a rape scene, and a lot of gritty violence used in Stone's vision to capture the war that he experienced. But I don't see the profanity as part of an anti-American film, I see it as elements of a true work of art and in its own strange way, it works. In other films that use the same profanity (Predator 2 for instance) it becomes offensive, but here it adheres to the allegorical point. And the addition of Samuel Barber's classic music composition ""Adagio for Strings"" works out very well in the dramatic, tear-jerking moments.<br/><br/>Oliver Stone's ""Platoon"" is a masterwork of the fabulous art of motion pictures and I am very thankful to see that it is ranked as one of the best war pictures not just by critics, but audience members as well. It is a thrilling, well-acted film that in some scenes, especially the death of a character whom I will not reveal, even succeeded in bringing tears to my eyes."
"emperor_bender","10","1","2","10 March 2008"," Best Vietnam Movie
","This movie was very confusing at first. I watched it in school and didn't really get what was going on too much. Then again, I was IN SCHOOL. So I watched, thought it was OK, then moved on with my life. However, soon I started to want to see this movie again for seemingly no reason. I was compelled to watch Platoon again at home...and so I did. Let me just tell you, it was 1000x better than at school. <br/><br/>The movie starts off simple enough, a new soldier from a middle class existence arrives in Vietnam, not knowing what he has in store. Soon after, the movie shows its true colors...<br/><br/>Charlie Sheen was terrific as the curious new recruit, Pvt. Chris Taylor. Sheen has a habit of either being in really good or really bad movies. This happens to be a really good movie. Possibly his best.<br/><br/>Tom Berenger was excellent as the antagonizing, shady, mysterious, tough Sgt. Bob Barnes<br/><br/>Willem Dafoe was also great as the sneaky, helpful, rebellious Sgt. Elias.<br/><br/>There were many other excellent performances but if I took the time to summarize each one of them, the comment would take up about 2-3 pages. BUT, I can say that most of the actors here were just starting off in their careers or are no-name actors, but they deliver MUCH more than was expected of them. For many, this was their best film. <br/><br/>Oliver Stone did a perfect job telling the story of his time in Vietnam, and showing things how he saw them. The war was a cold, demeaning place to him so that is how he portrayed it. With the exception of about 5 characters, everyone was mean, rude, heartless, and a bully. Particularly Bunny (Kevin Dillon). However, EVERYONE including the nice people were somewhat out of their minds, which is what seems to be closest to fact about the Vietnam conflict.<br/><br/>I truly enjoyed this movie. It was realistic yet fictional, and the 2 elements worked together well. Chris was well portrayed and showed us the ins and outs, ups and downs of Vietnam. If you're looking for a realistic, good movie, this is the one for you. I wouldn't say this movie is for the weak-minded or light-hearted, but if you're up to it, check it out. 10/10."
"johnnyboyz","9","1","2","31 December 2007"," Very strong war film that deals with not only the physical horrors of war but the psyche and masculinity challenges the soldiers face.
","Don't let any thing anyone says about this film fool you for Platoon has broken my top 50 and has very quickly etched its way into my list I have at the back of my mind detailing my favourite films in the war genre. A conclusion I came to when watching Platoon and something that is echoed during new recruit Chris Taylor (Sheen) in one of his voiceovers is that the real enemy is indeed the one from within your own side; the conflict that is going on within a band of people all attempting to prove how macho each other can be over the others: disagreements over authority is a common re-occurrence. This made me make a connection to how American's at home took to the Vietnam War at the time ie; they didn't like what they were seeing and hearing thus; were also against what was happening. The voice of authority is being heard and causing problems not only in the film's platoon but also on the homeland as people complain.<br/><br/>While this is just scratching the surface when it comes to dealing with the film's theme, Platoon on its own is a brilliantly well crafted; atmospheric and engaging film that shocks and pulls at your emotional strings with haunting music and issues that surround war. War is not merely two sides fighting in a jungle/desert/town but in-between battles it's about relations with your comrades; dealing with civilians and sorting out the messes that your squad encounter and I love it when war films deal with this subject matter. Platoon wastes no time in introducing itself: the ramp comes down to unveil new supposed cannon fodder as previous dead GIs are carried off. ""Welcome to the 'Nam."" jibes a soldier. But Platoon is more than fancy film-making; it's a film made by Oliver Stone who knows what's what when it comes to Vietnam: Taylor is fighting for a society back home; a belief that Vietnam (and the rest of the world) shouldn't fall to Communism and it's a society that will ultimately reject him and his actions as it will all the soldiers: ""F***ing politics"" says one character on multiple occasions which acts as a substitute for 'S*** happens' only the guy is forced to be made aware of the predicament he's in and now cannot dismiss where he is and what he's doing in a carefree manner.<br/><br/>I feel the best scenes in Platoon are not necessarily the fight scenes although they're still impressive. Platoon deals with the immediate 'just before' and immediate aftermath of gunfights. One such scene during which Taylor experiences the Vietcong for the first time is a good example: it's night, quiet and Taylor is the only one awake: he looks down a corridor of jungle and sees figures move towards him. Such a scene is shot using Taylor's POV, the reaction of his eyes and the close up of his head as he is frozen in fear, half putting is hood on. Such an atmospheric piece of film-making really puts you in the zone and briefly; I was there with Taylor in that clearing. Coming from Stone, a veteran; is the portrayal of Vietnam as a place where it's not just the gunfights that are terrible: Sheen narrates his letters to his Grandmother, not his parents showing a further emphasis of being cut off; that he has to dig all the time  he hates it in a week. Taylor must also face ants and mosquito's as well as emptying the toilets with fellow soldiers: the gunfights just seem like the filler in-between all the other crap. That is, after all, what they're there for.<br/><br/>Platoon also uses a scene during which the squad encounter a village to good effect. One reason I loved Apocalypse Now so much was the fact it moves the action away from the jungle and onto a river but they still encounter seemingly innocent people on a transport boat. In Platoon, the village is a substitute for the boat as seemingly innocents are searched and harmed in the aim to find something they can pin them for. Needless to say, both film's characters have dealt with loss very recently and are foaming at the mouth in search of revenge. While reminiscent of Soviet film Come and See, the village scene is an actual liquidation and contains, arguably, the film's most disturbing scene when a villager is shot and the rest of the family react in the way they do. A scene involving Taylor and a supposed execution challenges a soldiers psyche: 'talking the talk and walking the walk' since all Vietnamese are apparently the enemy, surely all of them must die at first time of asking. Taylor has that chance with a cripple and Sergeant Barnes (Berenger) has that chance with a little girl but his actions and macho image clash with his psyche thus putting himself in an eerie position which is very clever and involving film-making.<br/><br/>With its portrayal as Vietnam as a place that is not just guns, death and dying but including that as an emotional trigger; Platoon spreads its character development and interaction in a fantastic way whilst remaining real and violent with enough scenes to either have you evoking an emotion of some sort: anger, sadness, relief or any other along those lines. With a great soundtrack and enough content to truly put anyone off going to war, Platoon must remain in any war genre cannon as well as be used as an example of film-making."

"classicalsteve","10","1","2","22 October 2007"," Best Film About the Horrors of War--A Lesson We Still Need to Learn
","For about 20 years, from roughly 1950 to 1970, war films were largely about selfless heroes, often depicting World War II soldiers whose morality would make the likes of Gandhi or St. Francis of Assis proud. By the 1970's, film rhetoric about war began to shift to another angle. By the time of the release of Platoon, films began painting an altogether different portrait of the war experience from the perspective of the private on the ground rather than from a general or colonel. ""Platoon"" never depicts high-ranking officers discussing tactical plans in an administrative room or racing around in jeeps, saluting the troops. This is war at the ground level where the battles are fought and people suffer and die, regardless of the cause and the winners. From the perspective of ""Platoon"", nobody ""wins"".<br/><br/>Although war brings out heroism, it more often brings out the worst because the stakes are so terribly high. War is rarely about heroes; it is about survival at all costs which can incite much immoral behavior. More often, soldiers will hide the truth, debase themselves in front of superiors, unjustly blame inferiors, exploit circumstances for advancement, and kill without provocation. These behaviors are true as much among officers as enlisted men, and these are the realities that Oliver Stone, the director and writer of ""Platoon"", explores instead of the glossy triumphs of other films. And this is a world he knows intimately because Platoon is a semi-autobiographical account of his experience in Vietnam.<br/><br/>Aside from being one of the most terrifying films I have ever seen, ""Platoon"" is about finding meaning in a situation that appears to be about nothing more than senseless violence, destruction, and killing. But that meaning is not equated with the moral metaphors of earlier Hollywood offerings whose canvas depicted the good guys and the bad guys in very distinct colors. Here, everything is blurred from the American soldiers to the misty jungles of South Vietnam. Only the poor villagers who have been caught in the gunfire are truly innocent, and they are the ones who pay the highest price. The landscape is populated with the scar-ridden Barnes (Tom Berenger), who regards the war as a personal proving ground, Elias (Willem Dafoe), the lone moral voice of the platoon who comes into conflict with Barnes, Lt. Wolfe (Mark Moses), probably an ROTC graduate whose sum total of war experience is marching around college sophomores at the Ohio University campus, Sgt O'Neil (John McGinley), a hot-headed flip-flopper when it comes to loyalty, and Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen), who joins the platoon out of civic duty. But after about 20 minutes, Taylor realizes that no one has a sense of duty on this playing field.<br/><br/>The strength of ""Platoon"" is how real and devastating it all seems. The audience feels like they are walking along side these men and experiencing the war with them. And unlike most action movies, which build toward climatic sequences, the moments of combat explode from nowhere, often during a subdued moment, which is probably closer to the real experience of engagement. One of the most frightening moments is when Charlie Sheen, just relieved from guard duty late in the night, sees in the distance a group of enemy combatants combing the foliage for potential prey. We see the enemy from Sheen's point of view, silently moving through the shrubbery like evil specters. Neither Dracula nor Frankenstein were ever this terrifying. The private who relieved Sheen of guard duty has fallen asleep, putting Sheen in a precarious predicament. He can neither make a move for his gun which is just out of arm's reach or call to his fellow soldiers lest risk being a target of enemy gunfire. What can he do?<br/><br/>One other scene I found particularly convincing is a moment late in the film when Sgt O'Neil played with brilliant angst by John McGinley asks for a furlough from Sgt Barnes, played with subtle wicked believability by Tom Berenger. When Berenger denies the request, McGinley becomes emotional, letting his inner fears of their coming confrontation out into the open. I believe that McGinley's performance is one of the best I have yet seen in terms of accurately portraying a soldier's dread of combat. For a moment, I forgot I was watching a movie and thought I was in Vietnam.<br/><br/>These are the kinds of dilemmas that permeate throughout ""Platoon"": no win situations in which everybody loses, regardless of the outcome. Unlike the war films of the heyday of the studio system that featured the likes of John Wayne propagating how heroic the Americans were in the cause of the allied forces in World War II, the message of Platoon is far less romantic but many times more profound. War is hell, and the message is to tell others the story of this hell to prevent its recurrence in the future. In short, war should be prevented at all costs. It has probably been a profound shock to the filmmakers that this simple message was disregarded 20 years after the release of this film. We are still a country that has not quite learned the lessons of Vietnam."

A similar affect was gained with the use of Tomaso Giovanni Albinoni's Adagio which is used right at the end of Peter Weir's ""Galipoli"" (1981) and includes some great classics of the era like ""Hello - I love you"", ""Dock of the Bay"" and ""Respect"". Gotta love 60's music! You might cringe at the behaviour displayed by some of the US troops - sadly this is not altogether unfactual. It is a violent film also so definitely not for the squeamish.<br/><br/>Any good movie is one that makes you think ""what would I have done in that situation?"". For me this includes the treatment of the Vietnamese people and the battles. This is one of those movies.<br/><br/>Recommended! Confronting but Ultimately a superior war movie about a war that should never have occurred."

","That's what the movie does with you and anyone who watches it. There is a kind of no-holds barred feeling to it. And it's more than believable coming from a man who's been there (Vietnam) and has done his time ...<br/><br/>Oliver Stone sure knows how to make a movie about war, especially one about the Vietnam war. Although he was a somewhat acclaimed writer before Platoon (think of the Scarface script he did for Brian De Palma), this movie marked his real beginning to cult director and known celebrity. And this movie or the making of it is filled with beautiful trivia, which you can find here at IMDb. But even without those stories, it's a remarkable film, that anyone who has the slightest interest in war movies should watch! Nuff said! :o)"
"zennokangae","10","1","2","8 March 2007"," Perhaps the Most Important Film of the 1980s, One of American Cinema's Finest
","I remember when this movie released nationally when I was only a kid. I'm only in my 30s and was still a toddler when the evacuation of Saigon commenced, however I have been touched by the Vietnam Conflict in many areas of my personal life. Having viewed this feature over and again, it wasn't until I watched Charles Keyselyak's documentary on the making of this film when I realized and remembered the full scope of this magnificent piece of American cinema (one of the view to win best feature as well as best director). As one user on this board illuminated, Platoon, ""was also a success at the box office grossing $250,000,000 world wide, making it the third highest grossing film of 1986."" One of those three films was the jingoistic piece of fluff ""Top Gun""; a film so anathema in tone to Platoon and iconic of the Reagan-Era. It was a privilege to view this film as a 12 year old boy and I went on to study History at the graduate level, this film contributing greatly to my ambition to understand how these moments, brutal periods in history transpire. My first employer had been shot up on an armored personnel carrier on the Cambodian border, my best friend's father had served in a tank company and was very troubled emotionally and the man who helped my family adopt my younger sister from South Korea lost both legs to an anti- personnel mine. I'll never forget seeing, at the time, adult men leaving one of the theaters in my home town weeping. I didn't understand what was going on at the time, but this is one of the most poignant memories I carry of this film and its impact. Sadly, Stone says in the documentary on the film that he hopes younger generations will be smarter, ""when some politician tries to sell them a used war like this one"". As of 2007, being in Iraq, it seems America has not learned the lessons, the sharp, divisive, horrific lessons of Vietnam enlighten the country and her government."
"Danbrenno","9","1","2","13 February 2007"," Berenger and Dafoe represent the evil and Heroism of war in this excellent film
","The most common complaint i've heard about Platoon is its depiction of The two SGT's (willem Dafoe and tom Berenger). The two are polar opposites.Dafoe is the good-hearted Sgt. who takes the side of newcomer private (Charlie sheen). Tom Berenger's character is as cold-hearted as could be. Any possible way that oliver stone could make berenger's character hated by viewers, he did. An example of this is when berenger shoots one of the frantic Vietnamese women, and then you hear the screaming of her daughter and husband. It doesn't take long to see that Berenger is an undisguised monster.<br/><br/>Is this portrayal of these two characters exactly realistic? Probably not. I would hope there are very few soldiers as wicked as Berenger is in this movie. However, what is really important about this movie is not how realistic or unrealistic the characters are. The fact that dafoe and Berenger are so different could reflect the different feelings that some soldiers felt. Then again, this is an oliver stone film, so raw emotion, realistic or unrealistic is expected and naturally it adds to the feeling of sadness and tragedy that is displayed in the film.<br/><br/>There really is no war film that is entirely realistic. To me war films usually express certain exaggerations in order to emphasize something the film was trying to say about war. ""The Deer Hunter"", for example, is famous for its scenes of American soldiers playing Russian roulette while being held prisoner. There has never been any exact recording of this happening, but this game was trying to express the brutality of the war (personally i though Deer Hunter was a pretty weak movie overall, but that is a different discussion). In apocalypse now, the insanity of colonel kurtz, expresses some of the insanity of the Vietnam war. Overall Platoon is one of the best war films. It covers a very wide spectrum of war, but also it helps get the message across-that war is bad, whether or not this is always expressed realistically."

My partner watched the entire movie for the first time and her reaction was, ""oh my god, oh my god."" <br/><br/>I am Vietnam age but squeaked by with a middle lottery number.

","Platoon is the most real war movie I have ever seen. It is brutal and unforgiving. While watching, I almost felt as if I were there with them, that's how real it was. But Platoon is also an extremely touching and depressing movie due to the performances and the amazing soundtrack. This movie is probably more real due to the fact that Oliver Stone is a Vietnam Vet, his experiences help make this movie real. Charlie Sheen, Willem Dafoe and Tom Berenger all give outstanding performances. There all very real and most importantly, convincing.

","Platoon ****<br/><br/>People who have seen Platoon say that they didn't like it. Why? I can't tell you but I have to say it's one of the greatest war movies of all time. People might put Full Metal Jacket (Another great war movie), as one of the best war movies before Platoon, but Platoon shouldn't be compared to Full Metal Jacket. Just because both movies took place in Vietnam doesn't mean they are the same movie. Platoon is about lies and deceit among a platoon. Instead of fighting the enemy, they fight each other, and they get blind sited. Yes the movie may seem more of a character study then a war movie but so what, The Deer Hunter was more of a character study and like Platoon, they were given the Academy Award for best picture. Platoon is about the soldiers and what they would do in war, not about killing someone."

","I saw this about 29 years after it came out. I have to say that I've seen lots of Vietnam movies and this one, though slightly pretentious at times, qualifies as one of the top 4-5. Scholars researching Oliver Stone 30 years from now should definitely look at Platoon as being the rare vehicle that brings the best out of a skilled director.<br/><br/>Platoon has a message to get across, and it indeed does; it beats you over the head with the message. You accept it though, because the tone of the voice delivering the message is so strong and powerful. You watch this movie like you watch a drunk driver whose crash is inevitable on the freeway.<br/><br/>Anyway, the coolest thing about this movie is that Charlie Sheen virtually mirrors his father's performance from Apocalypse Now. Same theme, same story arc-both brought out beautifully in what may be Charlie Sheen's finest performance in film (it was all downhill from here). It's basically been a story told before...Charlie Sheen's character, Chris, comes to Vietnam wide eyed and idealistic, but the war turns him. That's all you really need to know about this movie. So watch the movie if you like movies of this genre."

","Twenty years later, after PLATOON was released in 1986 and brought some of the horrors of the Vietnam experience to the public's media-jaundiced eye, at last the film can be seen and discussed critically. 'At last', in this viewer's vocabulary, includes the fact that more time for healing from actually being in Vietnam in 1968 and 1969 has passed, making the response to Oliver Stone's film more rational. Now the film is a film, not a nightmare memory inducer, and that fact in no way diminishes the power of the message.<br/><br/>Oliver Stone wrote and directed this musing on the effect of war on the psyche and emotional crippling that Vietnam produced in those who survived. Stone was there and that makes his cinematic lead Chris (Charlie Sheen), an random kid from a privileged family who volunteers to go to Vietnam for 'patriotic reasons', an exception in the platoon to which he is assigned, the leader of which is the mentally broken and emotionally scarred Staff Sgt. Bob Barnes (Tom Berenger). Chris' positive influence is Sgt. Elias Grodin (Willem Dafoe), and the two are the polar opposites of evil and good. But the main characters of this gripping film are the other kids who daily are subjected to the horrors of life in the Vietnam jungles with the atrocious living conditions of filth, rain, heat, vermin, and the constant threat of the VC hidden in the atmosphere, ready to kill them at any moment. And these conditions along with the destructive effects of the government's insane war result in mankind stooping to its lowest level, such as decimating a village of people in the manner of My Lai.<br/><br/>The combat scenes are viscerally rigorous and well staged, but the odd thing about seeing this film as a veteran of that war is how watered down the atrocities now seem: scenes of dead bodies, both US and VC, lying on the ground or being scooped into mass burials ignores the fact that in reality what would have been seen are strewed body parts, unrecognizably torn by booby traps, mines, and powerful gunfire.<br/><br/>But there is only so much the public can tolerate and so the film must be tidied up a bit. The impact remains in the eyes of the actors called upon to recreate the veterans. Stone does his best to show the insanity of war, a statement as powerful as any that war must not be the answer in today's world. And we haven't learned. And that is what this viewer is remembering.

","I've heard of ""Platoon"" when I was searching for a movie that would contain violence that is not used to entertain, but as a symbolic violence. I decided to rent the movie... But I got more than I expected.<br/><br/>""Platoon"" is a very shocking anti-war film that tells the incredible story of a young American soldier named Chris Taylor who left college in order to fight in Vietnam. He quickly regrets his choice as he experiences the horrors and the wounds that come with the war.<br/><br/>We see a lot of combat movies, but few come with the real reality (weird words, but that's how I see it) of the Vietnam war: little hurting bugs, humidity, rations, marijuana to escape reality and those disgusting tasks, such as emptying the pots that the soldiers use as toilets. This IS reality. Director Oliver Stone took out his own memories of the Vietnam and he wonderfully put them into the movie.<br/><br/>Outside of Taylor, Sgt. Barnes (played by Tom Berenger) and Sgt. Elias (played by Willem Defoe), it's very difficult to follow the characters. The main reason is that they all look alike. That's one of the movie's hidden geniuses: Stone presents ordinary looking guys who surely got normal lives in the States and their insertion into the jungle war. Barnes and Elias are the only ones who are highly recognizable and they've got their own reason. Barnes owns a frightening face and a horrific soul, which stick perfectly together. Barnes is an inhuman soldier and the scenes where he intends to kill the innocent villagers of a Vietnamese village are a nice reflect of his personality.<br/><br/>Sgt. Elias is mainly recognizable because of his appearance. His face can't be missed and he wears an almost-trademark headband. Also trademark is his morality that makes him the least threatening of the soldiers we see in the film, along with Taylor. Elias also appears in the most shocking scene of the movie: as he's shot in the back by the Vietnamese soldiers, he lifts his arms towards the American helicopters in the sky and this is his final movements. This scene has an almost religious mood.<br/><br/>Also shocking are the soldiers' questionable moralities, which are mold by the difficult context of war and the tyranny of their superiors, mainly Barnes. There's also this scene where a barely wounded Taylor looks beside him and sees a young fresh deer.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Platoon"" is a perfect example of a proverbial anti-war film and its shocking images and lessons provide reflections on war and soldiers for anyone who watches it."

","#1 Best Film of 1986<br/><br/>Marvelous, Incredible, Powerful, Amazing. Those are just a few words to describe Oliver Stone's first Vietnam picture. It's a film so groundbreaking and authentic, that it takes the place as the very best film ever, ever made about Vietnam. Stone truly knows the hardships and terrors Vietnam had in store for every soldier involved, he knows this from his own experience (he fought in Vietnam as an infantry man -- he obviously survived). I'm pretty sure Oliver Stone places some of his own terrifying experiences in this war flick, but I don't know for sure. All I know is whatever Stone based the situations and experiences in this on (or if he didn't base it on anything at all), he succeeds in thrilling and enthralling us throughout the entire runtime of 'Platoon'.<br/><br/>The film takes place in the middle of the Vietnam conflict, and follows Private Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen). He's a honest, young soldier, who experiences horrors in war that change him forever. Besides fighting the enemy, Pvt. Taylor finds himself smack-dab in the middle of a brutal conflict between the American soldiers, involving a hardened, ruthless, and cruel scar-faced staff sergeant, Barnes (Tom Berenger), and a laid back, liberal hippie Sergeant, Elias Grodin (Willem Dafoe), who befriends Pvt. Taylor. Pvt. Taylor gets involved with this, and there's no predicting what happens next, in this macabre war story filled to the brim with deception, violence, treachery and life-changing decisions. This true to life Vietnam tale packs an all-star cast including Forest Whitaker (Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai), Francesco Quinn (Indio), John C. McGinley (TV's Scrubs), Kevin Dillon (The Doors), Keith David (Pitch Black), Tony Todd (Candyman), Chris Pedersen (Point Break) and a young Johnny Depp (Pirates of the Caribbean, Finding Neverland), back when no one knew who he was.<br/><br/>One of the many things that make this Best Picture winner so great, is Oliver Stone's keen and meticulous sense of direction and especially authenticity (for example, when the men are sitting around waiting for battle they are covered in insects, and exhausted from the hot sun and humidity of the jungle.) This is definitely Stone's greatest directorial achievement, and it's also his very best film. Oliver Stone also delivers a riveting screenplay with many scenes of engaging dialogue and interesting conversations (which were probably very close to what the real soldiers who fought over there talked about, ie, drugs (sometimes), women, what they are going to do when they get out, sports teams, etc.) The acting is nothing short of amazing in this romp of a film. Charlie Sheen is very convincing as the main character/narrator trying to adapt to the harsh life-style U.S. soldiers had to endure over in the swamps, jungles and trenches of Vietnam. Sheen's father, Martin Sheen, had a very similar role in 1979 Best Picture nominee 'Apocalypse Now' also about the Vietnam war conflict. Tom Berenger is absolutely amazing (in his very best screen or television performance) as the ruthless and diabolical, yet clever and calculating SSgt. Barnes. Berenger's acting goes as far as to give you goose bumps in certain scenes, along with a powerful and unmarred performance by Willem Dafoe (who along with Berenger received an Academy Award nomination, for his turn as the laid-back pot-smoking sergeant, who serves as a father-figure almost to Sheen's character.) Forest Whitaker is good in his role, and John C. McGinley is comical yet cultivated performance as SSgt. Barnes' lap dog, Kevin Dillon plays an impressive psycho and Johnny Depp is nothing short of sublime in his unfortunately short screen time. 'Platoon' has very few downsides (I felt it ended a little abrupt), but the other outstanding qualities of 'Platoon' pretty much make up for it.<br/><br/>'Platoon' is an incredible accomplishment, and it's one of the few films that actually deserved the Academy Award title of Best Picture. The film features top-notch acting (especially from Berenger and Dafoe), an excellent screenplay, mind-blowing cinematography and visuals, a powerful musical score, marvelous direction, and a hell of a lot of energy. If you haven't already, view the impressive Vietnam war epic that is 'Platoon'. Grade: A-<br/><br/>MADE MY TOP 300 LIST AT #45"
"sol-","Null","1","2","26 May 2005"," My brief review of the film
","At times horrifying and intensely realistic, this study of comradeship and fighting in war is a stunning, albeit imperfect, piece of cinema. The tropic setting is excellently portrayed, with natural sounds recorded brilliantly, but the explosions and noises of combats are equally captured well. The camera-work and editing and appropriately frantic, and Georges Delerue's haunting music sends a chill down the spine. The quality of the acting from the entire cast is superb and Charlie Sheen is fantastic in the lead - he is able to convey a sense of innocence for his character very well. Towards the end it all becomes a bit too monotonous, and the message feels like it is pushed a bit far, but the only really significant problem I found in it was that Dafoe and Berenger just seem too simply developed as symbols of good and evil. This is not however anything that detracts from the experience, but something that entered my after-thoughts. I cannot think of any war film that is so frightening as this, and few that I have seen have ever been as generally well made as this."

Sure Saving Private Ryan, Apocalypse Now, and Platoon are by far the war movies that are in the highest regards to us critics, many only have one war movie that we judge others by. And for me that movie is Platoon. The setting that stone brings us in when the movie starts mixed with sheens surprising performance narrating the story sets the mood for which is to come. One of the upsides to this movie is that it really doesn't concentrate that much on battle scenes as much as blockbusters nowadays do. The real sense is that of the troops inner struggle instead of the struggle between us and the vietcong. Berenger and Dafoe give extremely good performances and i would like to say that Berenger gave one of the best performances ever in the history of film. I would also like to say that no matter how many crappy movies sheen is in Platoon will always make him a star. This film is an absolute masterpiece from beginning to end. Then again i can see why others might not like it, what with the lack of high paid bombings, and shoot outs and whatnot that people might like from a war movie.

","Back before Oliver Stone forgot that a good film had to have a good story he made this one. It remains his best.<br/><br/>This is the Vietnam War as I remember it: dangerous, confusing, and disheartening. I've known soldiers just like Stone's (he was a front-line grunt) and situations like he describes. Platoon, for all its artistic license, rings far more true than any other movie about the Vietnam conflict that I have seen. (The only other films that come close are ""Casualties of War"" and ""Hamburger Hill."" ""Apocalypse Now"" is too much of a head-trip to really ring true but, in certain scenes, it captures the exact feeling of the confused fear of combat.)<br/><br/>The entire cast is excellent.<br/><br/>Those who haven't seen this film should. It is that good and that important.<br/><br/>And Stone should have to watch it, too. Maybe it will remind him that he used to be a capable, if didactic, director and script writer."
"Chrieon","10","1","2","23 November 2004"," It's not a movie about the war, it's a movie against it!
","Oliver Stone's very realistic and strong portrayal of the Vietnam war and how a young man (played by Charlie Sheen) and his own platoon (led and played by Tom Berenger and Willem Dafoe) are affected by it. Chris Taylor is based on Oliver himself, who was down there and fought and he if any other filmmaker should know about what happened down there while the ruling elite were rolling their thumbs.<br/><br/>The American Rambo-mythology is destroyed in a hell of napalms which are dropped by mistakes or even via order on their own, confusing battles where no one knows who is shooting at who or why, slaughter on innocents whose only guilt were being innocents, the fear of the unknown in an alien terrain, conflicts within the own lead, touchings of entire villages, rapes... well, the list can be infinite but most of what happened are included in this film with an intensive presence and thanks to Stone's directing feels like you are there fighting the war yourself. The final battle is one of the best and most realistic battles I've ever seen even though its nighttime it's probably the best, if not yet the most intensive night battles scenes ever filmed. When everything is over you realize that war is an incredibly destructive element which sadly the ruling elite and elected persons uses to serve his own interest wherever it's threat. This was a part of the American foreign policy, which tragically hasn't changed much.<br/><br/>The movie handles to be seen many times and might also be seen with and through critical eyes and I promise you the movie will grow, something 'anti-Stoners' totally have passed or even didn't care about and compares the movie with other movies and its sequences instead of letting it sink in as an experience. The acting has Oscar-quality, masterful and intimate photo, Samuel Barber's music adds a very special and depressing atmosphere and is almost describing, sound, screenplay and directing are near perfect. Without this film we wouldn't probably see some of todays antiwar movies. It is worth every prizes and should have won more. It's easy to understand why this movie is on the AFI's Top 100 Films List. It's not a film about the war, it's a film against the war.<br/><br/>In memoriam to those who fought in the Vietnam war and to the innocent people, mostly Vietnamese, who came in the line of fire. And not to forget; All respect to Oliver Stone.<br/><br/>10 stars out 10<br/><br/>""We're going to lose this war.

"haima","10","1","2","23 November 2004"," One of the most realistic war movies ever
","Oliver Stone knows what he's speaking. A Vietnam veteran makes movie that not only looks like war but sucks it's audience in to war in a way only few titles can. <br/><br/>Casting is good, music is good and scenes are the most beautiful. Those three things make good screen play to a unbelievable movie.<br/><br/>Beautiful scenery makes harsh contrast between ultra violent war and ages old jungle. Georges Delerue's impressive music makes the right atmosphere. It's just right, but not too sentimental Actors as a whole make great work. Especially Willem Defoe is something unreal as sgt. Elias<br/><br/>The Platoon is THE movie everybody to see and especially I hope George W. Bush would've watched it before war in Iraq."
"Manthorpe","10","1","2","10 June 2004"," War within war.
","Sometimes war isn't just a war pitting two armies together, but a war within the armies themselves. Platoon is a gut wrenching account of this and we see that sometimes the enemies in battle can be on the same side. Charlie Sheen plays a private in the Vietnam War who volunteered himself for battle to try and find himself. He quickly comes to notice while he's still wet behind the ears that things are not what he expected and that maybe he has bitten off more than he can chew. Led by two opposing leaders and father figures, he quickly learns the skills he needs to survive and kill.<br/><br/>
Platoon is an excellent movie that takes a somewhat different approach to the genre, in my opinion, in that you care more for the characters therein than in most war movies and find yourself rooting for the characters more than usual. There are two leaders in the group that are both excellent soldiers but are at each others' throats constantly, and the men must eventually pick sides as to who they decide to follow. Tom Berenger plays Sergeant Barnes, a man that has been shot 7 times and has served more than his fair share of time in the war. He has been hardened to the point of losing almost all moral and is a sick and twisted character that will do whatever it takes to win the battle. War has become his life. Berenger was born for this part. Meant to be a tough and scary son of a bitch, you end up believing that he is the character depicted in the film. ""Everybody got to die sometime Red."" And on the other end we have the equally formidable and seasoned Elias played by Willem Dafoe, the charismatic and sympathetic leader who has served several years in Vietnam and is more of an intelligent and charismatic character. Dafoe was also perfect for his part as well and is easily the most likable character in the entire film. I love his part in this film, it's just a cool character. Charlie Sheen was also a very good choice to play the fresh meat grunt who must earn his way, and we see the movie through his eyes and narration. Platoon is also filled with many other familiar faces including Johnny Depp, Forest Whitaker, and some guys who you will definitely recognize but may not know them by name. It all comes down to a simply excellent cast with excellent acting that is realistic at the same time. <br/><br/>Acting is not the movie's only strong point. The overall direction by Oliver Stone is masterful and educated, Stone having served in the war himself. The film includes many of his own experiences which positively gives it more credibility and realism. Probably his best film to date. Filming in the wilderness has got to be difficult, but what we're treated to is being dropped right into the jungle with the grunts themselves and we get to experience many of the aspects of the war, including being surrounded by death, the insects, the sounds, the marches into unknown territory, the hardships, the weather, etc. The battles are also not to disappoint and keep your heart pounding and ears ringing. <br/><br/>Also, the musical score sets the mood for the film perfectly...haunting sadness. <br/><br/>The story is the film's most strong point though. It's a war within a war with many characters to pull for and to identify with. We get to see all of the characters and their relationships develop throughout the battles which leads us to the inevitable. What we get is a heart churning epic that I will always remember. I have said in a previous review of mine that The Deer Hunter is my favorite war film, but after purchasing this DVD and watching it again recently, I honestly don't know which one holds that coveted spot. There's simply too many greats. Truly one of the best movies I've seen.<br/><br/>This is a must see for anyone. It's easy to understand how it won Best Picture."
"departed07","10","1","2","6 December 2003"," The only TRUE Vietnam movie
","I have to say that Platoon is a one of a kind masterpiece. Oliver Stone who was in Vietnam wanted audience to get a view of how unscrouplous American soldiers were. The film stars Charlie Sheen as the young recruit that notices the insanity of the U.S. soldiers. ""instead of us fighting the enemy, we were fighting ourselves,"" Charlie Sheen says in the film. Platoon also stars Willem Dafoe as Ellis, the stoner but cool character and Tom Barenger in his infamous role as Sgt. Barnes, the soldier that couldn't be stop. The film was great and emotional and showed audiences that american soldiers couldn't be consider heroes.<br/><br/>

"Ben_Cheshire","7","1","2","17 October 2003"," Supreme. An opera.
","The greatest war movie ever made, and one of the greatest movies. A breathtaking film. It is photographed exquisitely. My favourite shot is the sun coming through the trees right near the beginning. This is Director Oliver Stone's masterwork. Brilliant performances by Tom Berenger, Willem Dafoe, John C McGinley (who adds a bit of comic relief). Watch for an early appearance by Johnny Depp. The supreme aspect of this movie, however, which gives the events the gravity of an opera, is the original score by Georges Delarue - the main theme of which is one of the most memorable in all cinema.<br/><br/>This film ranks among my greatest admired.<br/><br/>5 stars."
"MF210","10","1","2","16 September 2003"," A Masterpiece
","My Rating: **** out of ****. <br/><br/>Out of the Vietnam War films I have seen, Platoon is definitely the best. It is also the best film I have seen yet from Oliver Stone. If I had to describe Platoon I would say it is a gut-wrenching experience. The film realistically shows a platoon of men with their deadly battles against the enemy and themselves during the War. <br/><br/>Acting is a big strength in a film. Charlie Sheen is quite believable here as Chris Taylor. Tom Berenger is perfect as the tough-ass Sergeant Barnes. Willem Defoe is also great as Colonel Elias (I think he is a colonel), who is much more understanding than Barnes. Everyone else is quite memorable too. <br/><br/>The Cinematography is quite stunning in Platoon, probably the best cinematography I have seen in a war film. Stone's direction is perfect. A rarity in war films is a really well-written script, Platoon is extremely well-written. If you watch you will notice some disturbing scenes that were quite effective to me (The Village Scene). These scenes represent the absolute horror of what we do to the innocent in war. Although, Platoon's score is not original (It was in The Elephant Man, 6 years earlier) it is effective, it illustrates the tragedy of war effectively. Platoon is a masterpiece that will stay with you for awhile."

"davesmooth","10","1","2","7 July 2003"," The ""REAL"" Vietnam
","This is the first movie, (although some will argue ""The Deer Hunter"" or ""Apocolypse Now"") that really tells how horrifying life was in Vietnam. The realism that Oliver Stone delievers, prior to this movie, had not been done. Hollywood had a history of making war seem romantic, and actually cool. Stone gave you the reality of war, with no holds barred, and thus paved the way for future films, like ""Saving Private Ryan"" (Another must see movie)<br/><br/>
If you want to see how a war really is, this is a must see movie."
"gj804","10","1","2","2 June 2003"," Awesome
","Probably Oliver Stone's greatest accomplishment. The extraordinary images behind that lament-like soundtrack made war seem what it really is: dark, unflinching, uncompromising, and lethal.

"andweburn","9","1","2","16 May 2003"," The best American-made Vietnam War film
","Aside from Oliver Stone's admitted use of dramatic license several times throughout the film, this is clearly the best American Vietnam War film I've seen. Stone's portrayal of American soldiers as belonging to several different camps within the ""American soldier"" label is a necessity when approaching this issue, that far too many films about this war skip over. You've really all seen this, so there's no point adding any more. Except this: also see Stone's Heaven & Earth, as it is a great alternative perspective on the war that is unfortunately so lacking in American cinema. And whatever you do, don't see We Were Soldiers - even if your life depends on it."

","Platoon is a great movie, enabling the grunts view of Vietnam to be seen. Berenger and Dafoe are excellent! Charlie Sheen is Chris, basically Oliver Stone and also does a good job. It is a pity that many of the people who were in the minor role did not get anywhere after this movie."
"mtiller12","9","1","2","18 December 2002"," In my opinion the best Nam movie
","Platoon is a very good film and inside the top five of that decade. The film is about new recruit Chris Taylor(Charlie Sheen)who comes to Vietnam and witneses the harsh realities of war. Sheen excells in the role of Chris Taylor,trying to keep his innocence in a place with no innocence.He is also helped by the fact he has a  strong supporting cast in Willem Dafoe as Sgt.Elias and Tom Berenger as Sgt.Barnes,both of whom got oscar nominated. This movie has a boost by the fact that the director was a soldier in the vietnam war,Oliver Stone used his knowledge of the war to pen a great script and then direct a great movie. Many believe that Apocalypse Now is the best Nam movie but Platoon`s emotional message gets across much easier and it is not as weird as Apocalypse Now,Platoon isn`t like that and Nam may not have been like that,remember Stone was there he knows what happened. The combat scenes are incredibly realistic and the movie has touching scenes. Another standout is the films main theme tune the Adagio for Strings,it matches everything about the film and touches anyone. Platoon is a great film and in my opinion the best Vietnam movie to date.<br/><br/>10/10"
"esteban1747","9","1","2","12 December 2002"," A film for promoting peace
","One of the best films ever done in Hollywood is Platoon, which I consider more a film for peace than a war one. It shows well the cruelty of this past confrontation in Vietnam, the miseries of both rivals, the lack of morale in some of the soldiers and officers, some of them coming from poor layers of the American society. The plot is very consistent and achieves what it aims. Today (December 2002) it has not lost its lessons, new generations have still a lot to learn watching this film. In addition of the excellent work of the director Oliver Stone, it is also important to acknowledge the serious work of Willen Dafoe, Tom Berenger and Charlie Sheen, perhaps in his best performance. Fighting scenes were conducted very accurately, sometimes one may feel that you are inside them and risking also your life. The environment was the typical tropical one, vegetation, landscape, etc."
"gnielsen1","7","1","2","12 October 2002"," Inaccurate but still powerful
","This is the only movie that I watched at home for the first time and immediately rewound and watched the entire movie again. Being a teenager in the 60's and actually being part of the birthday 'lottery' (I had a high number) everything about the war in Vietnam is very emotional. This movie was a great cinematic experience but if you have ever read a novel based on real experiences such John DelVecchio's ""13th Valley"" you will appreciate how unrealistic aspects of the movie were. Just as an example real soldiers in 'the bush' in Vietnam would never have made so much noise. The basic story of good versus evil battling for the soul of the Charlie Sheen character is excellent."

"dee.reid","10","1","2","2 August 2002"," This film is really something ***SPOILERS***
","Even after 16 years, ""Platoon"" still is something that is wondrous to behold. Directed by Oliver Stone, whose personal experiences in the Vietnam War were inspirations for the film's script, makes this movie simply stunning.<br/><br/>The four Oscars that this movie won including Best Picture and Best Director - Oliver Stone just goes to show how amazing this movie is. The musical score is also one of the best I've ever heard. <br/><br/>Evidently, some people today, don't really think that this movie is as great as it used to be. ""Platoon"" over the years has received quite a bit of criticism. For example, some people have attacked the possibility of a civil war ever erupting between two groups of soldiers in a platoon. I agree it is hard to imagine something like that happening, but that doesn't mean it isn't likely. The tension that grows between Barnes (Tom Berenger) and Elias (Willem Dafoe) has been growing for some time. Barnes believes that the Vietnamese should be wiped off the face of the earth. Elias, who is slightly more humanitarian, believes that the war is already lost and has deeply immersed himself in drugs just to escape the grim realities of Vietnam. Elias' demise at the hands of Barnes goes to show how far down the path he has gone. Two things to watch out for between these two: Elias' in his final climatic scene and Barnes' burning red eyes at the end of the movie. <br/><br/>Another criticism people seem to have with this movie, is its special effects, namely explosions, gunfire, etc. People have attacked the effects because to them, they say that they're dated. Well of course they are, this movie was made in 1986. Compared to today's war movies such as ""Black Hawk Down"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"", it's no wonder that it will seem out-dated.<br/><br/>But the effects in this film were pretty state-of-art when this movie was released.<br/><br/>The performances here are excellent. I've never seen Tom Berenger or Willem Dafoe in better performances. Of course, this is really Charlie Sheen's movie, as this is his best role yet. The supporting performances from Keith David, Forest Whitaker, Johnny Depp, John C. McGinley and Kevin Dillon are amongst some of their finest performances as well.<br/><br/>This is Oliver Stone's finest directorial effort to date. He's never matched it but has come pretty close especially with ""JFK"" and ""Born on the Fourth of July"" under his belt. <br/><br/>10/10"
"Angry_Arguer","10","1","2","21 July 2002"," Not pleasant (is war ever?)
","Vietnam, to most other countries, probably has the same meaning as 'nostril' and 'book'--pointless.  But here in America, it is a very sensitive issue that even today is hard to bring up and still be far in opinion without sounding bias or snobbish. ""Platoon"" takes the uncomfortable situation of being in a foreign, hostile country with comrades who can be as psychotic as the enemy and weighing that on your conscience for two hours.  It isn't a film where you can sit back, relax, and watch the fireworks.  You must use your mind to consider the situations of the unit and ""think with them"" to a degree. The first half, set in 1967, takes us into the war only two years old and rapidly gaining unpopularity at home. By the end, 1968, we come face to face with battle in a fashion not jingoistic like John Wayne or gritty like Saving Private Ryan, but rather a punch in the gut that doesn't try and give you $100 million explosions and brand-name actors looking clean and cocky. In all fairness, they are ugly, tired, and their mixed emotions of the growing conflict they're embroiled in is eating away at them faster than the leeches. I praise Oliver Stone for not putting 'glory' in the public sense of it into the film and presenting just how hellish, up-close-and-personal, and unforgiving war can be.  I guess only by serving yourself can you truly understand what it's like."
"bassfiend","10","1","2","27 June 2002"," The greatest, most harrowing war film of all time.
","Platoon is a film that isn't just about America's involvement in Vietnam, it's about the total and utter horror of war, irrespective of nation.<br/><br/>This film crosses boundaries in a way that Apocalypse Now, Full Metal Jacket, and any number of peer films do not.  The voice over and haunting classical music seer the humanity, and converesly the sheer in-humanity of war into the viewer's soul.<br/><br/>The total madness of war, even if one thinks it's justified, is presented to us, and as we find out, jingoistic rhetoric is easy to spout (and unfortunately follow), but it's the harsh truths of the battle field that make people realise what bollocks politicians talk while ordinary, everyday folks die.<br/><br/>A superb piece of social commentary, not just on the Vietnam debacle, but also a warning for the future, and please believe me I am not knocking the USA in any way.  It is simply a superb film."

We Were Soldiers is the only other war movie that comes close to how good Platoon was. I am so glad it won Best Picture in 1986, it definitely more than earned it.

","Platoon is one of the finest films ever made, war or otherwise. Platoon has several excellent performances (Tom Berenger as Sgt. Barnes, Willem Dafoe as Sgt. Elias, Kevin Dillon as Bunny, and, dare I say, even Charlie Sheen turns in a fine performance as Taylor), a gripping storyline, and some of the best dialogue I've ever heard in a movie. Oliver Stone successfully shows what war is really like: exhausting (both mentally and physically), confusing, and mad.<br/><br/>As previously stated, Tom Berenger and Willem Dafoe are great as Sgt. Barnes and Elias, respectively. Barnes is tough and cold, whereas Elias is compassionate and caring (as far as soldiers go). Sheen's line `.I fell like a child, born of these two fathers,' conveys the tone of the entire movie. At times, the soldiers feel like Barnes, full of rage and hate, willing to take it out on anybody that should be in their path. At other times, the common sense and compassion of Elias shines through. During the village massacre scene, the soldiers shared in Barnes' ruthlessness; after all, they killed some of ours, so let's kill theirs. It's not until Elias shows up that they realize what Barnes is doing is wrong. Viewing this scene, I feel like the soldiers: wanting revenge, but ultimately regretting what I've just seen. That is just one part of this extraordinary movie.<br/><br/>
Platoon is a classic, plain and simple.<br/><br/>10/10"

","Very simply a masterpiece of film making, coupled with outstanding acting. This study of war is an equal of the 'The Deer Hunter' and very possibly the supereror of Apolcalypse Now'. Very different to both these films, it is a staggering piece of cinema which gives the effect of being very real, although this impossible to tell, due to experiences of writer and director Oliver Stone. The script is very impressive, strenghtened with excellent acting from Charlie Sheen as Chris Taylor who throws himself into the chaos and madness of Vietnam, What is more astounding is the acting of Tom Berenger and William Dafoe in the supporting roles of sergeant Barnes and Elias. Its cinematography portrays a frightening sense of realism, 'Apocalypse Now"" manipulates the events and lighting to create some staggering imagery, in ""platoon' it appears that someone has simply put a camera in the middle of the confussion and filmed what is happening.differing from 'Apocalypse Now', it doesn't need a extrodinary story to make events interesting and shocking, in a simaler way to 'The Deer Hunter' it creates a feeling of terror and shock over the experiences of every person. Where 'The Deer Hunter' deels with the lives of the soldiers who have no prospects at home, 'Platoon' shows dark and confussed battles fought in a confined,moist and stuffy jungle where soldiers  fight among themselves.

"markguszak","10","1","2","13 October 2001"," The Greatest Vietnam War Movie Ever
","This film is timeless and describes the reality of the Vietnam war better than any other. This film is not hollywood and it is not surreal. It is reality. The film does try to be black and white and is not afraid to show the complexities facing fighting men in Vietnam. However, the real greatness of this film is in the gritty realism of the characters. Stone gathered a great and diverse collection of actors. Each character well developed and unique. In deed, the viewers are allowed to look at these characters and choose which one best represents them and in that, perhaps sees how they might have done in Vietnam. Charlie Sheen's character is innocence, heading for war. When he arrives in Vietnam, he must make the choice of what kind of soldier he will be. Will he emulate Sargent Barnes, a hardcore lifer that believes in killing them all and staying alive? Or will Sheen's character choose to join the souls under Sargent Elias, a compassionate veteran, who realizes that American soldiers are still human beings and should act as such. The greatness of this film, is that the choice is not cut and dry. Barnes represents the frustration of many grunts in Vietnam. The frustration of seeing many friends die and not knowing who your enemy is. The frustration of being placed in a foreign land and not knowing how to win. Many young men see Barnes as their savior, the man that will kill the enemy and keep them alive. Although Barnes is evil, one can see why men would be attracted to him. However, for many, Barnes is the worst of what war turns people into. These optimists cling to their humanity and to Elias, a Christ-like figure that attempts to keep the souls of those young soldiers pure. This film takes the viewer to Vietnam and puts them in the jungle. It shows us why we would never ever want to be there. It shows us many different and diverse characters, some we relate with, others that we abhor. It shows why Vietnam was unique and why we were not able to win there. It is not a fun film to watch, but war is never fun. Great film that comes as close to perfection as any film can. Great performance and great direction. See it!"

","It took Americans a very long time to accept the fact that our involvement in Vietnam, however well-intentioned it might have been to begin with, was in the end a tragic failure.  Not only were fifty-eight thousand of our finest young people killed, but so were two million more Vietnamese.<br/><br/>But it took the guts and the intelligence of Vietnam vet Oliver Stone to bring this point home in his masterpiece PLATOON.  Pretty much autobiographical, PLATOON stars Charlie Sheen as a recruit who, upon entering country, is put into a rag-tag platoon patrolling the Central Highlands of Vietnam during the fall of 1967.  After some truly horrific first combat scenes, Sheen finally gets his bearings but then realizes the tragic mistake he made in joining to fight.  Soon, he becomes involved in an inter-platoon war between his two sergeants--Barnes (Tom Berenger), the personification of Death and Reality; and Elias (Willem Dafoe), the personification of Humanity.<br/><br/>In the end, we come to the realization that the enemy was always staring us in the face; but instead of being Oriental or communist, that face was American.  It was us against ourselves, as Sheen points out in his closing narration.  Oliver Stone must be commended for portraying this misbegotten war for what it was: the death of a nation's innocence where we all found out just how imperfect we could really be."
"rogierr","Null","1","2","21 July 2001"," powerful but synthetic
","I think this is an important war-movie because the essential elements of the story are historically and personally important and because the many details (art-direction) are historically accurate.  Apocalypse Now and Catch-22 (MY single favourite film of all time) are still ahead of Platoon by a long shot, because they portray the horrors and insanity of war in a much more human AND horrifying way, and don't concern themselves with supposed realism.<br/><br/>So, definitely not the best war-movie, but absolutely worth seeing/renting/buying.  It is a movie about supposed experiences of one man and is actually a compilation (as many war-movies) of experiences of different people (mostly Stone's own though).  The cinematography by Robert Richardson (Casino, Salvador) is great, but the acting ('method-directed' !) is not brilliant and the whole is made digestible and cliche; it has not become cliche after Platoon-wannabee-movies, but it was already cliche when it was released in 1986.  Platoon feels synthetic, because it is too picturesque and the music drowns out the emotions and therefore destroys some of the realism, where the music in Apocalypse Now (Coppola, 1979) poetically stresses the horrors and Catch-22 (Nichols, 1970) doesn't need music at all.  Oliver Stone made it digestible when he wanted to show horrifying experiences.  That's its (commercial) power and its weakness.<br/><br/>Platoon succeeded however, to reach a VERY large audience.  That couldn't be said of the other two at time of release (don't count the IMDb votes: they don't represent box-office success).  So every war-movie is effective in a way, if only for the director to free himself from terrible memories. Platoon is in that way perhaps similar to 'The Big Red One' (Fuller, 1980), which is from another perspective very off-beat.  Platoon simply came a little bit too late.  Full Metal Jacket (Kubrick, 1987) a little bit more. Not to speak of 'Born on the first of July' (1989).<br/><br/>But after all I'm the kind of guy who thinks Saving Private Ryan (1997) was a terrible waste of time, apart from Janusz Kaminski's (Schindler's List, A.I.) great contribution.  Finally, 'Wild Palms' (1993, miniseries) is Stone's most interesting project so far, unfortunately not directed by himself.<br/><br/>9/10"
"mhasheider","9","1","2","10 July 2001"," Flat-out harrowing and very unsincere.
","Flat-out harrowing and very unsincere war epic, director Oliver Stone used his own experience in the battle to create this movie and I really admire for doing just that.  What I also admire in the film is the first-rate cast, headed by Charlie Sheen, Tom Berenger, and Willem Dafoe.<br/><br/>The film is seen and told through the eyes of Chris (Sheen), a college dropout who enters the Airborne Division and ultimately gets more than he bargained for.<br/><br/>Chris becomes a close friend to the patron saint-like SGT. Elias (Dafoe), while he despises the scar-faced and bitter Barnes (Berenger), the other SGT. who is a higher ranking officer in the company.  The hatred and disrespect that Barnes and Elias show toward each other eventually consumes everybody in both units.<br/><br/>Stone is very smart in setting up most of the shootouts and he does it so where any G.I. goes to for cover, they're always in danger of being hit by anything (enemy or friendly fire, a mortar or long-range shell).  To survive a single battle in this war without being shot or witnessing some god-awful sight like seeing a friend dying was very common.  That I can understand.<br/><br/>The performances given here are than memorable, it leaves an everlasting (and paralyzing) effect on one.  One example would seeing the reaction on Chris's face when he notices that Elias is still on the ground and being shot at by several V.C..<br/><br/>What Oliver Stone has made here is a classic and I was satisfied although Dafoe didn't get a Best Supporting Actor Oscar is a real mystery."

It had some very strong scenes, especially the Vietnamese village-part. They could have made this film much better, but because it was going to be a mainstream film, I don't think they had the guts.

","Disillusionment: it can represent an end; herald a beginning; and sometimes, it can do both to some degree.  Are we more than pawns in the battlefield of life, destined to accept what is generally acknowledged as reality?  In Platoon, writer/director Oliver Stone attempts to tackle this issue with varying degrees of success.  The film follows the exploits of an American military unit during the Vietnam War.  The group is ultimately divided by two feuding authority figures, Staff Sergeant Barnes (Tom Berenger) and Sergeant Elias (Willem Dafoe).  Caught in the middle is Private Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen), who is forced to decide where his loyalty lies.  On one hand is Barnes, a driven patriot who is will stop at nothing to achieve his goals.  On the other hand is Elias, a man who no longer believes in the war but has not lost his compassionate outlook. Elias has already realized that the whole war is a lie, and through the film Taylor arrives at the same realization.<br/><br/>Charlie Sheen gives an excellent portrayal of Taylor, a character loosely based on Stone.  Taylor is an upper class young man who could have easily avoided the war but chose to volunteer.  He wanted to be a hero: following in the footsteps of his grandfather, who fought in World War I, and his father, a World War II soldier.  Instead, he is trapped in a world where it is impossible to be a hero - where it is difficult to determine who the enemy is.  Stone explores how American soldiers were destined for hardships before even setting foot on the Vietnam battlefield.  For example, Taylor lacked sufficient training; he did not know what equipment was necessary to take on patrols.  After Taylor passes out from overloading his pack, Elias removes all the unnecessary items.<br/><br/>Another issue Stone delineates is how the rampant use of narcotics plagued many men in Vietnam.  Elias, one of the more respected soldiers, used drugs liberally.  When Taylor is just beginning to use drugs, there is a segment in which Elias blows smoke through a rifle barrel into Taylor's mouth. When the most influential men in the war not only advocate but partake in such behavior, what are the impressionable young men supposed to think?  While Barnes does not do drugs, he is an alcoholic.  Therefore, no matter who a soldier sides with, he is still exposed to the use of deleterious substances.<br/><br/>Platoon portrays the disappointment of America during the Vietnam War; its broken heart.  In his journey, Taylor's lose of innocence represents more than just one man.  He symbolizes every soldier that enters the war with a patriotic soul and leaves with a tarnished one.  His illusions are destroyed, his youthful optimism eradicated.  Specifically Sheen and Dafoe complement this film with moving performances.  On the other hand the writing was adequate, and the directing. lacking.  Stone's direction of the battle scenes was jumbled and confusing, leaving one squinting to determine what is going on.<br/><br/>5 out of 10 stars"

(R)<br/><br/>Oliver Stone's vivid, trenchant Vietnam War drama as seen through the eyes of Sheen's green, fresh-from-basic-training infantry volunteer (loosely based on Stone himself). During his tour of duty, he finds himself pulled in different directions by the conflicting viewpoints of two of his sergeants: the brutal, no-nonsense Berenger (with memorable facial scars) and the more agreeable, idealistic Dafoe. Transports the viewer deep into the jungle, at eye-level with the grunts, delivering a visceral experience that has rarely been equaled before or since in a war movie; narrative depicts not just the horrors of combat, but also the day-to-day misery of constant fear and anxiety in inhospitable conditions, without meaning or logic to guide their actions. Perhaps because his budget was so limited, Stone's showy and sometimes excessive directorial flourishes are nowhere to be seen--he just puts the camera down at ground level and records the chaos. Strong performances from a capable cast, large enough to include a handful of up-and-comers in small roles like Johnny Depp and Living Colour vocalist Corey Glover. Utilizes Samuel Barber's ""Adagio for Strings"" piece so well that many people think that it's the film's original theme composition. Flaws in Stone's script aside (all-too-clean division within the platoon, naÃ¯ve final line, etc.), this is a film that works on the gut level--and the punch it delivers to that region--and features numerous moments of harrowing power.

The acting, the story, the setting, all well done with realistic features. I connected with every single character. I felt empathy for the men at war. I was able to see how each character was feeling from their facial expression. Truly, Truly stupendous movie.<br/><br/>ACTING: Wow, the acting was incredible especially from Willem Dafoe, Charlie Sheen, and Tom Berenger. Dafoe with his soft side character who actually cares for his men blew away. Sheen as the naive person was funny I thought. The star of the show for me was Berenger as the darkest character, Barnes. Berenger portrays him with such power that it makes you want to hate him. Amazing performances by each of these actors.<br/><br/>STORY: The story is just marvelous but also sad. It devastating to see how much war can truly change someone. It is also devastating to see how morality changes with some of these men.

","Legendary Filmmaker Oliver Stone makes a film that moves you, shakes you, questions you, in 'Platoon'. A film where entertainment gets stabbed and reality takes it's place. Stone has made classics, but 'Platoon' is a rare film, a great film! <br/><br/>Several films have been based on the infamous Vietnam War, 'Full Metal Jacket' was one of those oh-so stunning films. 'Platoon' is a semi-autobiographical film about Stone's experience in combat, Stone had the courage to re-set all the violence, the gore, the back-stabbing in 'Platoon'. 'Platoon' is about living the war within, with the devil inside you. Stone surpassed himself so much, that I can't recollect any other classic this legend has made.<br/><br/>When I say that 'Platoon' is cult classic, I mean it in all means. The Performances deserve a special mention: Willem Dafoe is outstanding. An Icredible Talent which we'll never forget! Charlie Sheen plays the protagonist with amazing understanding. Tom Berenger, as the villain, stands out. Johnny Depp makes a terrific cameo, so does Forest Whitaker. Others are perfect.<br/><br/>'Platoon' is a experience..... A thousand thumbs up!"

","It's movies like this that makes you come to write and delete and then rewrite and delete like thousand times because you fear to write something not equally as powerful as these movies deserve one to write for.<br/><br/>Stone obviously has something about Vietnam that can be seen in most of his movies. I have seen almost all Nam movies (Born on the 4th of July ""Oliver Stone"", The Deer Hunter ""Michael Cimino"", Casualties of War ""Brian De Palma and Stone happened to be screenwriter"", Apocalypse Now ""Francis Ford Coppola"", etc..) and therefore, I can guilt-free-mindedly say that Platoon is by far the best of all. All the actors in the movie were excellent- Charlie Cheen, Willem Dafoe, Tom Berenger,Johnny Depp, John C. McGinley (scrub), Kevin Dillon and others can't remember now but all performed remarkably.<br/><br/>Stone, though has a clear empathy for the soldiers of Nam, exhibits in a very provocative way the brutal acts of the soldiers to the locals. There is this one scene of the young Korean (or gook as the soldiers referred to them)with one leg and deformed eye who was hiding with his mom under the ground and Kevin Dillon humiliates him and kills him. This scene is a clear sign that Stone sympathized with the locals and despised such indecent actions. Another master scene in the movie is when Taylor (Charlie) is finally in the helicopter leaving the battle and looks from above to the hole which is filled with corpses of soldiers (very brilliant of Stone).<br/><br/>Chapeau bas Stone!"

"tubby1","7","1","3","24 February 2009"," Emotionally engaging.
","The craziness and ugliness of war is told with such realism, grit and deeply disturbing moments that Platoon must be appreciated for its emotional engagement. The destruction of war on the human spirit and soul is deeply haunting.<br/><br/>Platoon is not an easy watch, and I was left emotionally drained by the experience. This is testament to Oliver Stone and his screenplay, which evokes raw emotion and a tense, alien environment through the cinematography.<br/><br/>Dafoe and Berenger are the most celebrated actors in Platoon, and that is how it should be. There characters do have more depth than the others of the platoon but they are both exceptional and draw you into their characters mindset. Although Sheen is very good as Chris Taylor, I did not feel that he was cast correctly. I understand that Taylor is an educated and affluent young-man but I felt he was a little too fresh faced, and rather unfitting for the role. I never succeeded in believing in his reasoning to join the forces.<br/><br/>I felt at times that the 'Adagio for Strings' was overplayed, if left to certain moments it would of been more poignant and powerful. The best moment was when Taylor joined Dafoe and his men for a night of relaxation to the music of 'Tracks of my Tears' singing/dancing away, it is so well-done that you are enraptured and share their moment of peace and happiness.<br/><br/>Platoon is one of the most poignant war films I have ever seen. Platoon is shocking and hard to watch, but tells one much about the sheer ugliness of the human soul when confronted with such pitiful and dire circumstances."

","This still is the best and most powerful and gritty Vietnam war movie around.<br/><br/>It's a war movie that shocks and confronts not necessarily with its graphic images but more with its psychological elements. It shows what a war can do to common man and how it can make and break characters. So above everything, ""Platoon"" is really a character movie that tells the story of two different sergeants who clash and a young recruit being in the middle of it all.<br/><br/>The movie shows the duality of men and isn't afraid to show the dark side of every person. It makes the movie confronting and effective to watch.<br/><br/>While watching this movie it makes a realize that it's a movie that only could had been made by a Vietnam veteran. The small little details such as of the atmosphere and characterize behavior are too detailed and uncompromising to have been written by someone who hasn't been even close to Vietnam. ""Platoon"" is a sort of autobiography movie by Oliver Stone, who put some his own Vietnam war experiences into this movie. The movie, like basically every Oliver Stone movie, handles controversial subjects and is very straightforward, without really picking any sides.<br/><br/>The movie features only 2 or 4 real visual confronting sequences. The movie doesn't need anymore than that to be powerful, or to try and make its point. It lets the psychological elements take of that instead. It makes ""Platoon"" a movie that doesn't try to impress but nevertheless leaves a powerful and lasting impression through its way of film-making. It also provides the movie with some really powerful sequences, with of course the death of Sgt. Elias Grodin as the most classic and memorable one. I still regard it as the greatest death sequence out of movie history, even though it's completely over-the-top.<br/><br/>The movie is mostly carried by the characters that are in it. None of them are really formulaic or predictable and they are being played by some great actors. This movie features some great casting, with lots of actors that later became huge stars, such as Forest Whitaker, John C. McGinley and of course Johnny Depp. Charlie Sheen does a good job at playing the character, trough whose eyes the entire story gets told. But it are Tom Berenger and Willem Dafoe who really form the movie. In a non-formulaic way they represent good and evil.<br/><br/>""Platoon"" is luckily not only just a psychological powerful movie with great characters but also visually a great movie to watch. The battle sequences are effective and impressive to watch and really give you a sense of how it must have been like over there, as does the entire movie by the way. The cinematography by Robert Richardson is wonderful and the Academy Award winning directing by Oliver Stone is just great.<br/><br/>""Platoon"" is of course also the movie that got Adagio for Strings eternal fame. The piece of classical music it features prominently the movie its most important sequences.

Platoon is a war film and I'm not crazy about war films in general but Stone's direction and personal experience with Vietnam is clearly an effective tool in this film's brilliance. It's raw, ugly, dirty, and filthy but then what war isn't any of those things? As far as Vietnam films, I preferred the Deer Hunter but I am going to say that Platoon goes further where other films have not gone before. It's different when the director has been there and done it himself as a Vietnam veteran like Roman Polanski who survived World War II POland as a child. There is nothing that they are not afraid to show as if they are holding something back. This film is about war and the young men who go only to return home differently. As far as I know, this film is still important today as it was twenty years ago. First rate cast include Charlie Sheen, Tom Berenger, and other young men."

It' s nice to see that these characters are very well build by Stone, who plays a very small part in the movie. The stupidness of the war is clear in this movie and no man there, Vietnamese or American is very happy with the situation, it s all politics. The movie starts with new soldier Chris Taylor (Sheen) who comes right into action in a very diverse battalion with sgts Barnes and Grodin (Berrenger and Dafoe), the first a killing machine and the second a man who fights for the goods of the war. The rest are a mixture of mainly poor under developed soldiers who take this chance to fight to escape from daily poverty. From day one they are in the fire-line at the border with Cambodja and the fights are heavy and ruthless. Every day people die and there s hardly a day of rest. The only real leisure time is when they can smoke some dope, to forget reality. Berrenger and Dafoe are constantly in a sort of fight and the Leuitenant is not really man enough to control everything. Soon there are two groups in the camp and this makes them more vulnerable for the enemy. At the end no one could really see the situation clear with a massive slaughter as a result. Chris Taylor is a volunteer in the war, because he wanted to do something for his country, but at the end he feels he could do almost nothing to change the situation."

Except that they have nothing in common. Well, that one thing. They both hate snakes. Tom Berenger was ruthless. Willem Dafoe did the best damn job I've ever seen him do in a film and I found him very likable, which is odd considering how much I intensely hate Dafoe on a personal level (even more than Saddam Hussein hates Kurds). Dafoe shines like a diamond in a field of A-holes.<br/><br/>Kevin Dillon was so despicable that I found myself actually feeling the pain of the Vietnamese people. In my soul. I wanted to channel the spirit of Ho Chi Minh to avenge the deaths of his people. I cried twice. It was very sad to see families torn apart and people treated like dogs or maybe even something worse. Johnny Depp will go down in history for his role in this film - it is by far his best role and he should have received a supporting actor Oscar.<br/><br/>But more than Depp, Dafoe or even Sheen - the scene-stealer was John McGinley. As Super-Lifer O'Neill he filmed the movie with anguish, anger, humor, sadness, hopeless bleak despair, and sheer acting constipation.

The acting is superb by all (the list is too long, although Tom Berenger, Charlie Sheen, and Willem Defoe take main characters), and each scene is a creation with only one goal in mind - to attempt an explanation of what it is to be a soldier in war.

Ultimately he attended a screening in the company of some two dozen other vets who sat together to provide each other with support. When the film was over they looked at each other. ""Great film,"" they said. ""But it wasn't like that. Not really."" Then they all went out for coffee and argued over some of the movie's technical details. Randy says he has never met any vet who had a flashback episode from viewing PLATOON, and he regards the story as so much Hollywood hype. Whether the stories of flashbacks are true or not, one thing is clear: PLATOON does not capture the Vietnam experience for all vets, and it seems unlikely that any one film ever could.<br/><br/>Once we get past the film's reputation and actually look at it, what we have is an extremely well-done film that posits itself as ""typical Vietnam experience"" and then offers us an not-very-subtle morality tale. Although the film focuses on newly arrived soldier Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen), the storyline focuses on the battle of wills between an ultra-hawk faction led by Sgt. Barnes (Tom Berenger) who don't care who they kill and an ultra-dove faction led by Sgt. Elias (Willem Dafoe) who want to maintain some sort of sense of humanity and self-respect. The factions soon erupt into an internal war, with Berenger increasingly portrayed as a demon from the pit and Dafoe seen as a Christ-like figure, both symbolically fighting for the soul of young and impressionable Sheen.<br/><br/>In terms of combat scenes and violence, PLATOON is less horrific than you might expect. There are shockers, of course, but the film achieves its effect less from graphic violence than from suspense, and here it is extremely successful. Interestingly, the film also contains a covertly homo-erotic edge quite unlike that of any war film I've ever seen. When the characters talk about women, they refer to them as objects and the few women who appear in the film are targets of rape and murder, so the film equates heterosexuality with violence; on the other hand, it is impossible to escape the connotation of the scene in which Sheen is introduced to (i.e. seduced by) drugs in Dafoe's lair, which comes complete with party music, twinkle lights, and such lines as ""put your mouth on this."" Although the black-and-white nature of the story is simplistic almost to the point of annoyance, a truly fine cast carries the film off extremely well. Sheen is actually the weak link here: although appropriately All-American-Good-Boy he is not greatly memorable. Dafoe, however, is astonishingly good, and although very one note Berenger is a powerful metaphor for evil. The supporting cast includes exceptional performances from the likes of Forest Whitaker, Kevin Dillon (particularly effective as the loathsome ""Bunny""), and even a very young Johnny Depp. But Oliver Stone's direction and script has a ""crusader"" mentality that undercuts any complexity the film would have, and PLATOON ultimately emerges as determinedly anti-war to the point of propaganda; consequently it never digs as deep as you feel it should. But what the film does do, it does extremely well. Recommended, but keep your critical faculties fully engaged throughout.<br/><br/>Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer"
"waytallwhitey","Null","1","3","19 March 2005"," Trivia Inaccuracies
","In the ""Trivia"" section, there are two inaccuracies. The first one mentioned is ""Prior to going after Elias, Sgt. Barnes threatens to ""article 15"" Taylor unless they return to the base camp. Article 15 refers to U.S. military punishment for serious insubordination."" Actually, an Article 15 is non judicial punishment, usually handed out by an executive officer, or sometimes a first sergeant. Serious insubordination would be a courts martial offense.<br/><br/>The second is ""At the end of the film, when the GI's are tossing the enemy dead into a mass grave, a stack of captured AK-47s can be seen piled up. American soldiers actually preferred the AK-47 over the M-16, because the AK-47 could be easily retooled to fire either U.S., or Vietnamese ammunition."" GIs did prefer the AK-47 over the M-16 because it was a more rugged gun with a more powerful punch than the M-16, and it held up better in jungle climate of Viet Nam. Also the Ak-47 fires 7.62 mm round and the M-16 fires a 5.56 mm, so it would be impossible to ""retool"" an AK-47 to fire the 5.56 round, let alone to fire either round as stated."

","""Everybody's gotta die some day, Red."" Sgt. Barnes (Tom Berenger), ""Platoon.""<br/><br/>I do not believe that there has been a more effective Vietnam War film than ""Platoon."" Of course, one could argue that Francis Ford Coppola's 1979 masterpiece ""Apocalypse Now"" is the definitive Vietnam picture, but that person would be quite wrong, as the latter film is not a Vietnam War film but rather a film taking place in the Vietnam War -- it's based on the novel by Joseph Conrad, ""The Heart of Darkness,"" which I have indeed read and I believe was written during the late 1800s. Before the Vietnam War. The Vietnam War was used as a setting in the film simply because it was current with the times. The Vietnam War was the nation's primary focus during the 70s. Nowadays the novel would most likely not even take place during a war, but rather be a story of an African trader journeying up the Congo to find a secluded man named Kurtz, which is essentially what the book was about in the first place.<br/><br/>No, ""Platoon"" is all about the Vietnam War and the side effects. We get to see the men before and after, as they gear up and prepare themselves for the dreaded hike through the jungles of Vietnam and into the heart of battle, and when they are finally through with the war and ready to go home.<br/><br/>The film's point of view comes from a young American soldier named Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen), a rich kid who has joined the war in an effort to appreciate multi-ethnic races and give something back instead of sitting around watching from the outside like all the other rich folk.<br/><br/>His platoon has two Sergeants, Barnes (Tom Berenger) and Elias (Willem Dafoe), the former of whom is a hard-nosed macho man ready to tear apart anything in his path and the latter of whom is an experienced soldier who came into the war with a sense of adventure and has now come to appreciate the fine things in life, and, for that matter, life itself. Chris forms a close friendship with Elias, put to a tragic end after Barnes murders Elias in cold blood, an attempt to keep the hounds off of his back after a savage attack on an innocent little farming town in Vietnam, of which Elias is able to testify to.<br/><br/>Chris knows Barnes shot Elias, and he tries to form an alliance with a band of other soldiers to help him take out Barnes before more people end up dead. During a savage final attack for the platoon in Vietnam, Barnes tries to murder Chris - but events don't always turn out the way you have them planned.<br/><br/>I don't know a whole lot about the Vietnam War. The history of it all has been contorted over the years by Hollywood and sympathizers. It's been made out to be the most brutal and disturbing war of all time, and I believe this might be true. Why? Because back in the early 40s, at the rise of World War II, the nation was not as angry as it was in the 70s. The 60s had created a decade of love and peace, and the 70s were the aftereffect of it all. People were angry. They took their vengeance out in many ways. Vietnam was one of them. I think it disturbed many people because of the ferocity of it all.<br/><br/>
The ferocity shines through in a truly disturbing scene, when Chris' platoon visits a local Vietnamese village and Bunny (Kevin Dillon) mercilessly attacks a disfigured man and his mother, some other soldiers attempt to rape a young girl (Chris stops them), Barnes shoots a woman, and they burn down the village.<br/><br/>Oliver Stone is a great director whose films have been criticized for historical pervasion over the years. He directed ""JFK"" (1991), which caused upset among the people who knew his facts were all incorrect. He then directed the Quentin Tarantino-scripted ""Natural Born Killers,"" which caused only more outrage. Many of his films have caused outrage, come to think of it. But I don't think that anyone can deny the power of ""Platoon.""<br/><br/>The film's Military advisor was Capt. Dale Dye, who has worked with Stone on numerous films and provides a commentary track on the newly-released Special Edition DVD. It's interesting to listen to -- he provides some insight into what went on during production, such as how the cast was shipped out to a boot camp to train for the movie.<br/><br/>The film has an all-star supporting cast, including Forest Whitaker, Francesco Quin, John C. McGinley, Kevin Dillon, Reggie Miller and Jack Sparrow himself, Johnny Depp. They all help make the film what it is. But it truly comes down to the triangle of Barnes, Elias and Taylor. Amidst the war they fight amongst themselves. The war is in them. And that, I suppose, is the message, after all.<br/><br/>5/5 stars.<br/><br/><ul><li>John Ulmer</li></ul>"

","Though I thought Platoon was a good film, it didn't seem long enough to me. I felt it should have established more character development for the characters presented.  Though I do look at it as an ensemble, it's obvious who the main characters are.  Yet, there just isn't enough emotional prowess to warrant a feeling of sympathy for what the characters are subjected to. I am not knocking this film though, I thought it was an entertaining piece of work and a strong comment on the atrocities of war.  However, I do not think it is Stone's best film.  JFK is his best, and Platoon ranks to me alongside of Born On the 4th, Talk Radio and The Doors.  Natural Born Killers was even better than Platoon.  I can also not believe that Platoon won the Oscar for director, Lynch should have won for Velvet which was far superior in every way to Platoon.  7 out of 10."
"yoyomagoo","Null","1","3","27 July 2003"," An Oliver Stone film
","The title of my comment really says it all. Oliver Stone is not known for his subtlety, his intelligence as a filmmaker or his writing skills. Such is the tragedy of Platoon.<br/><br/>Platoon tells the story of a young, innocent man, Chris (Charlie Sheen) who volunteers for the Vietnam war, to contribute to the country he has taken so much from. Here, he witnesses some terrible atrocities, and falls under the influence of drugs and apathy. There is a good vs. evil conflict in not just the war aspect of the film, but Stone's humanitarian aspect too. Tom Berenger plays the hard-nosed veteran who frequently clashes with Willem Dafoe's protective one. However, this is a war film, and as the bodies pile up- so does the chaos for Chris, both physically and emotionally.<br/><br/>Platoon, in a sense, has the same problem as Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket, itself a Vietnam movie made in the late 80s, over a decade after the end of the war. Platoon is essentially a film of two parts, but unlike FMJ, the two parts of Platoon do not comply with the narrative. (In FMJ, the training section of the film gave us insight to a part of Vietnam we never saw before- and so therefore the actual fighting, which we had seen before, was a let-down.) <br/><br/>The first hour of Platoon is masterful, and proof that Oliver Stone can be coherent and subtle as a director and a writer. The second half of the film however is a total mess. Unlike FMJ, it has not to blame the narrative constraints- but the writing and directing of the film itself. The immediately striking, coherent battle sequences of the first half become muddled and irritating in the second. The emotional impact of the film becomes deadened by over simplicity and the film becomes repetitive with Stone just lurching from one battle to the next.  <br/><br/>With Natural Born Killers, Stone used his excessive film making techniques as both self-parody and media commentary, with explosive and shocking results. The miscasting of John C. McGinley doesn't help, as the cowardly comformist and neither does the underuse of Willem Dafoe. That said, the final sequence of the film regains a sense of lost direction and rescues the movie from an otherwise ""A.I.""-like second half slump.<br/><br/>
Flawed, frustrating yet mind numbingly tragic, Platoon is a worthy addition to the Vietnam movie pantheon, although hardly the greatest of the Vietnam movies. Watch Stone's ""Born on the fourth of July"" instead, for a more satisfying Vietnam experience. Or Apocalypse Now, or The Deer Hunter for the best Vietnam films."

"jmorrison-2","7","1","3","31 July 2002"," Visually great, but...
","Visually stunning movie of a combat platoon in Vietnam. The atmosphere and settings were beautifully filmed and conveyed, and the characters were extremely realistic and portrayed well.<br/><br/>It's hard to know what to feel about this film, though, as a military veteran. For one thing it is hard to imagine a military unit getting this out of control. I have no doubt than many things portrayed here happened over there, but to this level? with no one stepping in? The Platoon had created virtually a ""Dodge City"" within their unit. I understand that this war really got out of hand in many ways, but it's hard to come to grips with the murderous and thuggish attitude developing to this level without someone taking notice and stepping in. Maybe it's my wishful thinking, but I would hope that this situation would not take place. It may be what Stone is showing us is the desperation that we found ourselves in over there, we were willing to unleash characters like Sergeant Barnes to wreak as much havoc on the enemy as possible, and turning a blind eye to the means and methods he used. Perhaps this is how a My Lai incident could happen. There was ample evidence of dysfunction and rage within that unit, but perhaps it is to our benefit to use that rage and psychosis to achieve the body count which became so important in Vietnam? I am not sure of the answers to these questions; maybe there really aren't any acceptable answers. Maybe this is the position guys like these were placed in, with no answers and no real guidance or objective, other than to achieve as high an enemy body count as possible. To achieve this, you do not need thinking soldiers, or even a cohesive military unit. You only need a rage, a psychosis, and someone to focus and direct it - Barnes.<br/><br/>How does this then apply to Sergeant Elias, obviously a thinking soldier, and an advocate and representative of a cohesive military unit? If he had won the battle for the hearts and minds of the men in the unit, would things have been different? He was certainly capable of achieving the desired body count, but with a tighter, ""watch-out-for-each-other"" leadership, as opposed to Barnes, who left you to your own devices, and presented death as a consequence for mistakes.<br/><br/>Some bits of this movie seemed overdramatized, and there is symbolism galore. However, beautifully filmed, and the atmosphere is pure hot, sweaty jungle, with mayhem lurking behind every tree.<br/><br/>Astonishing Job by Tom Berenger. This has always been thought of as Charlie Sheen's movie. Not to me. Tom Berenger's Sergeant Barnes character virtually dominated this movie. He has not shown this level of performance in anything else he's done, really, but this is simply the performance of a lifetime. His was a bigger than life character. He deserved an Oscar, plain and simple."
"sychonic","Null","1","3","1 May 2001"," overrated, get away from that it's an okay movie
","That this movie won the best picture Oscar back in the eighties is utterly mystifying. At heart, it's a pretty basic war movie, but its pretensions are what causes it to fail. Oliver Stone has never been one for subtlety, but he might as well have had subtitles explaining what the symbolism was, since it is so obvious. <br/><br/>The movie is, in fact, about a platoon. It hasn't much to say about the Vietnam War itself--or the Viet Cong, or really the Vietnamese, since they're mostly background. The movie itself is about America, and how it dealt with the War, which is all well and good. But if this is supposed to be some sort of social statement, about the conflict in Vietnam, and how wrenching the war was for American society, Stone really oughtn't to have been so mindlessly simplistic about this platoon. <br/><br/>The good and evil parts are almost parodies, at best comic book characters; most war movies are about the good guys versus the bad guys. Nothing wrong with that. But if this is a movie that's supposed to rise above the rest and be taken as a ""serious"" movie, something a bit more nuanced and complex is required. Stone offers up stereotypes instead: We have the platoon in a virtual civil war, with the southern Jack Daniels swilling, country music rednecks led by scarred Tom Berenger on one side, and representing evil; and the ""good"" guys led by Willem Dafoe, as drug addled peaceniks, including all the blacks. <br/><br/>This is in some fashion supposed to offer Charlie Sheen, the empty center of this movie, a choice between two poles, but he's never conflicted, he clearly moves into Dafoe's circle from the beginning. And the rest of the movie is just a standard war movie. Again, nothing wrong with that, Stone can use a camera pretty well, and the soundtrack, a little standard but okay, works. All in all a mediocre movie sunk by trying to be something that it isn't. <br/><br/>Try out ""Hamburger Hill"" instead, or possibly ""The Boys In Company C"", for something a little more interesting about Vietnam."

I felt so sorry for the women and children who were torchered in the movie when yet they haven't done a darn thing.

","Based on his own experiences in it, Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning director/writer Oliver Stone decided that he should create a representation of the war in Vietnam from what he can remember of it, obviously mixed with a story. Basically Charlie Sheen as Pvt. Chris Taylor helps lead a team of soldiers into the country to fight against all the enemies that they can find. They suffer losing men, trying to help them, arguing about stuff, e.g. betrayal, and much more incidences. Sheen looks exactly like his Dad (Martin, who was in the Vietnam film Apocalypse Now) and he is the best in the film. Accompanying him are Golden Globe winning, and Oscar nominated Tom Berenger as Sgt. Bob Barnes, Oscar nominated Willem Dafoe as Sgt. Elias Grodin, Forest Whitaker as Big Harold, young Johnny Depp in his third film as Pvt. Gator Lerner and Candyman's Tony Todd as Sgt. Warren. It won the Oscar for Best Film Editing, Best Sound and Best Picture, and it was nominated Best Cinematography and Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen for Stone, it won the BAFTA for Best Editing, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama, and it was nominated for Best Screenplay.

As far as I know, the U.S. hasn't apologized until today for what they did in Vietnam, in Japan, in pretty much all their wars.<br/><br/>Unlike most American war movies, Platoon stands out for not whitewashing U.S. atrocities and showing things a little more the way they were. Sure, you can imagine that those young grunts were emotional, tired, upset. They were thrown into a war they had no piece in. But it is so easy to forget the other side when you might feel angry at U.S. casualties.
I am not from the U.S., so I might be biased. But I really think America needs more movies like this with the proper explanation to make them realize how much pain and suffering they have caused to others, always thinking it was for some greater good while really it's just a case of cultural arrogance."

"daniel-ambia","6","1","4","17 January 2007"," A classic film?
","Willem Dafoe is outstanding in this film as he usually is in most of the work he has done. Forrest Whittaker, Kevin Dillon and Johnny Depp are enjoyable to watch as well simply because they are so darn young. I have read about the war in Vietnam extensively and according to friends of mine who served in that war Platoon gives the best depiction of the environment, uniforms, customs etc... of the time. Unfortunately, although Stone had a lot of the right ingredients to make a war film classic including funding and personal experience, he fell short in my opinion due to the final scenes of the film. As he so often does, Oliver Stone touched on a serious issue but did not have the guts to delve into it as he did in Born on the Fourth of July. The scenes reminiscent to the public of the My Lai massacre are sugar coated. Sheens character somehow turns from being a sniveling preppie private into a VC killing Captain America by the end of the movie. While I'm sure there have been cases of extreme heroism such as that,I felt the way the character metamorphed into a larger then life hollywoodesque Rambo was extremely unbelievable. It took away from the momentum of the film. It probably would have been better to kill off Sheen because in reality that is what would have happened. Anyway, I respect Stone for his politics and for well, some of his films anyway Alexander and Any Given Sunday excluded, but if only he had stuck to his guts and made a war movie with a little more realism then Platoon would most certainly be a great war film classic."
"jofitz27","8","1","4","7 May 2005"," Powerful but flawed
","Platoon puts films like 'We Were Soldiers' 'Tears of the Sun' and 'Windtalkers' to shame. And considering Platoon isn't the best war film of all time, or even excellent, that is saying a lot.<br/><br/>But I'm not writing this review to blaspheme those films. I'm writing to inform; and, if you are willing to view this film, information is required. OK, no: Platoon is not the best war film ever made, or even close. But what it lacks it just about makes up for, with a great script, superb performances from anybody involved and a very emotive anti-war message (for part of the film, anyway).<br/><br/>Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen) is a newcomer to the war. Living a reasonably middle class life, he joined up, seeing as he was 'educated', to defy expectations of his parents. But he gets more than he bargained for as early as the first week, and that's not even the half of it.<br/><br/>It takes a while for all the real atrocities to appear, but when they do, they really are atrocious. Particularly in a gut-wrenching scene where a man's face is literally reduced to pulp by the end of a gun.<br/><br/>It isn't perfect, however, no matter how ambitious; despite all of the above, I still think a deeper insight was completely necessary. This film being little less than two hours with the amount of explosions that there were proves my point. And if not a little short lived, this film can't really decide what it wants to be; sure, it shows all the horrible things in war, but rather contradicts itself; in the end scene, you realise this film is just as much pro as against. This really does take away some of the effect.<br/><br/>However, at least it isn't sentimental. The sad music does occasionally appear to frequently and in the wrong places, but that can be forgiven. One question to end though: will I remember Platoon? Despite the occasional brilliance and truly powerful scenes, I cannot be sure. If you asked me that about another war film, 'Saving Private Ryan' the answer was a definite yes. The difference is obvious.<br/><br/>8 out of 10"

","The first hour of ""Platoon"" is so poorly written I thought this was going to destroy the entire picture. It is the most basic humanist story imaginable that a little snot like myself who has never fought in war could have predicted that the message of the film would be ""War is hell"" yadda yadda yadda Charlie Sheen is so unconvincing. I like how Stone chose to show his growth as a person and a soldier in the span of five minutes:<br/><br/>Sheen cruelly shoots at the feet of the one- legged civilian boy making him dance. Less than five minutes later he walks up a hill to see platoon men raping a civilian and suddenly he's mister humanitarian. ""She's a human being man"" yeah OK mr. humanitarian.<br/><br/>The drug use in the film was portrayed as playful and cool rather than the cheap escape it actually was. Also Stone paints the good and evil lines so obviously apart that there is no conflict for hearts and minds. War is about good and evil not good versus evil. The Vietnam war is a prime example of that.<br/><br/>On the upside however, willem dafoe was great as elias barns monologue on death was compelling and the closing battle sequence was the best depicted chaos of the Vietnam war. Probably more realistic than the order and battle lines depicted in most Vietnam films.

"davism","6","1","4","1 July 2001"," Mixed feelings...
","This movie addresses the audience on many levels, and as a result has to be judged on a few different levels, if we are to give it an accurate rating.<br/><br/>The the basic movie, viewed simply on its own merits with no outside knowledge, is fairly standard fair for a war movie.  The special effects are so-so and a product of their times, the acting is sometimes good (Willem Defoe), and sometimes bad (most of the background characters).  I thought the dialogue was somewhat less than realistic in a lot of cases, but the movie keeps things moving and holds your attention, so I give it a 7/10 on purely technical merits.<br/><br/>If movies were simply judged on technical merits, we could stop here, but this film strives to go beyond pure entertainment and teach a bit of a lesson, and there is where I think it both shines and stumbles.  The moral is pretty in your face, war is foolish, war sucks, war is hell...  And Stone certainly makes it appear that way, constantly putting his protagonist in the position to make ethical judgements even the Pope would have a tough time with.  My main problem here is that Stone really hits you over the head with the message, and he doesn't really try to be even handed at all with the conflicts the troops faced.  For instance, in the village scene which is so obviously a reference to My Lai, the camera dwells on the US troops beating the Vietnamese, but not much attention is given to the deaths of the US soldiers in the previous sequence of events... they die, but because there really isn't time to develop all the characters, there's not as much of an emotional attachment to them... combine that with the (commendably) sympathetic way the Vietnamese are portrayed, and it's hard to fathom the motives of the US troops... they just look like monsters that are randomly shooting Vietnamese women for fun, and yet that's clearly a simplification of the situation, and Stone has to know that, so therefore my feeling is he deliberately biased the shot.  That's his call, but my feeling is that with an issue this serious, you shouldn't take the easy way out.  Propoganda is bad no matter which side it's coming from.  On the moral/ethical message, I'd give the film a 5.5/10... the film's heart is in the right place, but it gets lost in translation sometimes.<br/><br/>Last but not least, I have some serious issues with the historical accuracy of the whole film.  As other readers have mentioned, the likelihood of one platoon facing this many problems in the course of a tour of duty in Vietnam was slim to none...  While I have no problem with Stone taking some artistic liberty to get his point across, I am disturbed at the emphasis everyone places on ""Stone was there, so he must know what it was like.""  I don't buy that argument - to have a real picture of what's going on, you have to have some distance from the facts or personal bias will get in the way (as I think it does in this case).  Anyone who's ever played football knows what I mean...  any individual player (other than the quarterback) knows a little bit of what's happening, but doesn't really have any concept of the broad scope of the play.  Same goes for war.  Troops do what they're told, they don't get briefs on broad strategy.  Some might say that's a shortcoming of the system, and they might be right, but it's how it is...  If Stone based this movie entirely on his personal experience, then it's bound to be biased, short sited, and most likely factually innacurate, because of the faults of memory and lack of broad strategic knowledge - and if Stone went outside his experiences to make the movie, then his word can't be taken as gospel, like some would.  Warning, tangent :) - Anyone that's read ""The Red Badge of Courage"" knows that it's an excellent book and appears to be totally realistic.  Everyone that reads it assumes its author fought in a war... but he didn't.  He just did extensive interviews with many, many veterans of that war and others.  End tangent :).  On historical accuracy, I'd rate the movie at about a 6.  It caught the mood of the times, for sure, but it wasn't very balanced, and sometimes it pushes the limits of history to try to make its points and maintain the mood.<br/><br/>Overall I give the film a 6.25/10.  It was a good, solid movie, but the low budget and mediocre script/directing kept it from really becoming a classic. Unlike Apocolypse Now or Full Metal Jacket, I think this will just be a once-watched movie...  now that I've seen it, I don't think I need to again."
"JakeBrinkman","5","1","6","13 December 2019"," Not as powerful as I had hoped
","Platoon does well to portray the hopeless and wild emotions of US soldiers as they faced a war that seemed random, pointless, and inexplicable. I think it focused a little too much on the random and pointless, putting lower emphasis on the confusing emotions that the soldiers probably felt. That made me occasionally feel like the movie itself was pointless rather than allowing me to sympathize with the men, so I think the film missed the mark for me."

","Platoon has it's moments, but in the end, it's not really that good of a movie. I do remember that Charlie Sheen came within a hair of being killed during filming, when he almost fell out of the helicopter. Had his co-actor not grabbed him, he would have died. Anyway, I digress.<br/><br/>There are two better Vietnam movies that come to mind. The best by far is not Full Metal Jacket. It would have to be Hamburger Hill. That film is Vietnam in the best description possible. But Platoon really was lacking. It's a good movie and all, but definitely not a 10 star rating. The realism didn't come up to par, the character development didn't strike at the heart, it just didn't seem like that great a movie. The only things that saved it were the fight scenes, but even at that, they just seemed too predictable, and unrealistic. I'm sorry, but this movie did not seem to like me, and I tried to like it after hearing so many good things about it.<br/><br/>If you want a terrific Vietnam movie, you HAVE to watch Hamburger Hill. That movie is 2x better than Full Metal Jacket, and 5x better than Platoon."

","Oliver Stone took home his first Best Director Oscar for the hard-hitting ""Platoon"", about a young soldier (Charlie Sheen) arriving in 1967 Vietnam and experiencing the horrors of US operations there. Although Stone based this movie on his own experiences, I actually wish to assert that ""Born on the Fourth of July"" was better. I guess that this one seems sort of limited in its focus (I still say that ""Apocalypse Now"" was the best Vietnam War movie ever).<br/><br/>As for the plot, Sheen is harrowing in the lead role, but the two most harrowing characters are Tom Berenger as the cruel staff sergeant, and Willem Dafoe as the more logical-minded sergeant. The movie shows how Sheen's character is going to have to choose. But no matter what he chooses, the awful memories of this war will haunt him forever.<br/><br/>So, this isn't the greatest Vietnam War movie ever, but definitely worth seeing. Also starring Forest Whitaker, Kevin Dillon and Johnny Depp."

"harrylosborne","7","0","1","4 August 2019"," Vietnam's most faithful on-screen depiction
","Directed by a true veteran of Vietnam, Platoon devoutly follows Oliver Stone's vision and memory of the conflict - a humid mix of dense green jungles and invisible threats, poorly navigated by those young American troops thrust into its core. The focus is mainly on the narrator and rookie soldier Chris (a very new, slightly hammy, pre-drug-addled Charlie Sheen), a wealthier college dropout who realises his mistake instantly after joining the war effort. As he learns more about the true indecency of guerrilla warfare and the hopelessness of their plight, he slips further into the recesses of potential madness.<br/><br/>The cast is undeniably talented, featuring big names such as Forest Whitaker, John C McGinley and even Johnny Depp. The real talent on show is Willem Dafoe - the friction between him and his opposing Sergeant Barnes (Tom Berenger) is frighteningly believable, and makes you question what decisions you would make in their shoes. Each has their own motives, each their own feelings - but all undoubtedly feel an intense fear with each command from higher up.<br/><br/>Platoon hasn't aged amazingly (the clunky CGI napalm scene springs to mind), but the vividness of Vietnam/Cambodia's vegetation is still as identifiable as ever. The Vietnamese troops are rarely given screentime, making them seem ever more omniscient when fighting the relatively clueless American troops. The sparse gunfights are also mostly at night, meaning the disorientation of the soldiers is equal to that of the audience. Platoon will always remain a piece of defining war cinema, full of iconic scenes and emulating the true story of Vietnam; it holds a place as one of the most accurate depictions to date."
"Megamovies","7","0","3","23 July 2019"," Intense and enjoyable
","I am a child of the 80's, so Platoon came out at a time I was watching less controversial, intense or graphic flicks. As I got older I naturally was not as interested in war movies as others. This nature was most definitely affected by my experience watching Saving Private Ryan with my grandfather in the late 90's-he was a tailgunner in a B-17 in WW II and, during the film, was visibly affected by the graphic opening scenes, which also negatively affected my viewing pleasure to the point I turned off the film to finish the day with something a little more happy and positive. It was an uncomfortable experience that I still remember very well to this day.<br/><br/>That is the context for this review.<br/><br/>In recent years, I have rebounded a bit and have found a place for war movies. I love movies so perhaps it was just a matter of time to come around on this genre.<br/><br/>I watched Platoon for the first time last night. It of course is thought of as an all-time great war movie, winning best picture and all the other accolades. Generally, I really enjoyed the first half or 2/3 of the movie, as scenes are less graphic, chaotic and internal team divisiveness has yet to take center stage. The lead up to all that was enjoyable. The dialogue, the handful of ambush fighting scenes, the acting. I could see why this was a highly regarded film. I thought Charlie Sheen was incredible in the lead role. Chopping through the jungle to seemingly never really get anywhere or make any real progress-that is the general summary of what I have learned about being a soldier on Vietnam and that was captured perfectly here.<br/><br/>I rate this 7/10 because of the ending. It's not because it was a terrible ending from an accuracy standpoint (I'll leave that to the people that know more about fighting in Vietnam). It's just a personal thing. When a film goes down the road of internal turmoil, with things like hate, distrust and revenge taking center stage, I just simply don't enjoy it very much. It may be real. It may be accurate. It may make it Oscar-worthy. But for me, personally, I just prefer a more ""coming together"" story where a team comes together. I don't want it too Disney, but I don't want it to be the opposite either. I felt like Platoon was just too opposite.<br/><br/>Overall, I'm glad I watched it and I look forward to knocking some more war movies off the list."

","It's been nearly a week since I watched this and I'm still truly undecided on how I feel about the film. The stance on Vietnam is not really clear or as defined as say 'Apocalypse Now' and such has an impact on the film. At times there's almost documentary-esque footage of massacres and in fighting between characters which are juxtaposed in ridiculous and jarring fashion with ridiculous side plots such as the Elias death fake out and then the iconic killing scene of Dafoe's character which seemed to be there for a spectacle manner. Again in fashion that's worlds apart from similar films it adopts a smaller scale approach to all forms of conflict and character which in fairness does give the idea that people are stepping on each other's toes and such there's believable rivalry/conflict which sadly occurs few and far between. Character wise Dafoe somehow shines and steals the show as Sheen doesn't offer as much charisma as his father did in Apocalypse Now and the 'quasi-villains' in Barnes and his supporters are frail. Ultimately there's not a real threat, the characters aren't gauged particularly well over the arc of the film but there's the odd redeeming quality, it for one feels alive and suits the journal re-telling style of which it adopts and visually at times is quite stunning and iconic with the aforementioned Elias death becoming a sliver of cinematic history. For as much there is negative it has a balance of positive aspects too and such is hard to draw conclusions about"
"CubsandCulture","7","0","1","27 January 2019"," Overwrought but intense
","The film does a fairly good job of placing the viewer in the boots of a Vietnam soldier. The battle scenes are all visceral and wouldn't be surpassed in realism until Saving Pvt. Ryan. When the film is showing the foolish of the US military adventurism in South East Asia it is gripping and on point.<br/><br/>However, Stone doesn't trust his story to expound the points he wishes to make. Stone contrives voice over narration, as letters back home to a character we never see, that spoon feeds the viewer the basic story dynamics and central themes. Of course Chris's soul was in a tug of war between Barnes and Elias. I really didn't need that stated. It gives the film an theatrical feel that is at odds with the realism of the rest of text.<br/><br/>Likewise, Stone's flourishes-use of black and white footage, shifting the color palette, having eyes grow red etc.-stand out as too theatrical for the story. It makes the film overwrought which robs it of emotional heft. This film could have been so much more without these problems."

And to be quite frank I am convinced that this movie is one of the worst in this particular genre. It lacked a clear structure (the story was all over the place and felt inconsistent at times), there was basically no character development, and the special effects were laughable, to say the least. All of the explosions in the movie looked like fireworks going off. I kid you not. There were some scenes that I really liked but I can't get over the fact that they were followed up by fireworks explosions. In some scenes even the projectiles were replaced by ""fireworks"". In other words: it looked like they were shooting plasma beams out of their guns (just like in Star Wars). <br/><br/>The only good thing about the movie was the cast.

","As a pacifist, I don't find myself watching a war movie too often. That being said, I found Platoon, the 1986 Best Picture winner written and directed by Oliver Stone to be an engaging film. I do find myself a fan of Oliver Stone, so I'm sure that helped with my overall assessment of the film. <br/><br/>Platoon tells the story of a college-aged man, Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen) who volunteers for active service during the Vietnam conflict. Chris endures what most everyone who saw active duty during the conflict endured, the horrors of death and violence. In addition to the horrors of war, Chris also endured the moral conflict that was rife through Vietnam. He watched entire villages decimated because the men in his platoon thought it was funny. he witnessed one member of his platoon, Sgt. Elias (Willem Dafoe) stand up for the injustices they were witnessing, only to be murdered by another member of the platoon, Sgt. Barnes (Tom Berenger). The conflict can't end soon enough for Chris after all that he has seen.<br/><br/>Oliver Stone goes to great lengths in this film to show the horrors of war often ignored in American media; the mistreatment of people in the invaded country. It was an important light to shine on the reality of war. Stone himself, being a Vietnam veteran, focused carefully on this issue, showing war's horrors without assessing blame on the individuals performing the attacks. Stone isn't seeking to blame the soldiers themselves, but rather take a systemic look at the realities war brings. I will probably never watch Platoon again, but I am happy to have seen it at least once."
"lois-lane33","5","0","3","21 October 2014"," A good war movie that perhaps misses something important.
","The Vietnam War. From March 1965 to April 1975. Technically. They signed a Peace Treaty in January 1973 but the fighting continued until August 1973. The last US troops left in 1975. This film, Platoon, is a slice of the Vietnam War. Through the eyes of one film producer. In a way I think that Hollywood has never really talked much about the 'whats and the wherefores' of that particular war, in any of its films-even in the iconic 1979 film Apocalypse Now. Which is the best of the bunch of Vietnam War movies. In Platoon you get a fairly predictable depiction of soldiers who would rather be partying, struggling through hip deep swamps and cutting their way through dense packed jungle-hunted at all times and none too happy about it. None of the films about Vietnam mentions the ongoing US space program that just happened to happen at the exact same time as the Vietnam War. I wouldn't be impressed with the space program if I was lying down in mud, in the rain, in clothes that haven't been washed for a month, in order to avoid getting my head blown off by a bunch of people I'd never laid eyes on before, in a country I never had any interest in. I think the feelings of patriotism that followed the initial US decision to enter into a ground war in Vietnam in 1965 faded rapidly when the bodies stated coming home. By the thousands. This movie is a slice of life during the Vietnam War but its conspicuous avoidance of mentioning the ongoing US space program-which would have been on peoples minds-is 'selective memory' on the part of the scriptwriting. It wasn't ""that bad""-it was 'very much worse', in my humble opinion. Few haven't seen this film by now."

","The movie's story unravels a bit slow at the opening stages although with all those strong images of war. The story gets more interesting about half way the movie plays by depicting the internal conflict.. The set, props and makeup are done nicely, even for that particular time of the movie's production. The things that lack quite a bit are the sound and visual effects. The sound doesn't really give the real feel of stereo location placing, a technology that wasn't yet available. Yet the visual effects look somewhat too much forced, like we see on the lightning scene. The use of throwing flares in firefights is quite stupid since the damage of the unseen bullets are not really visible aside from what the makeup depicted. It's great to see that many alumni of this movie grew into big names such as Tom Berenger, Charlie Sheen, Willem Dafoe, Forest Whitaker, and even Johnny Depp. Most of them acted out really nice performances in this movie."

The the plot progresses the platoon through Chris' arrival, the power battle between Sgt. Barnes and Sgt. Elias (Tom Berenger and Willem Dafoe respectively), and to a series of events that illustrate the horrors of war.<br/><br/>The technical aspects of the film help in this illustration The editing, cinematography, and sound all come together to form a technical tour de force. This is one of the most technically accomplished war films I've seen to date.<br/><br/>The power battle between the two sergeants is the most interesting part of the film, as one officer represents the way war is perceived by outsiders: valiant and noble; while the other represents the true nature of war: grotesque and brutal. The film's standout performance comes from one of these soldiers, and that belongs to Tom Berenger as Sgt. Barnes. He's a ruthless and brutal man, and plays well opposite Willem Dafoe,mwho is also quite good.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Charlie Sheen's performance was one of the film's faults. His Voice-over is monotone and boring, as is most of his performance. There are a few moments where he shows some chops, but they were too few, and too far between.<br/><br/>My only other issue with the film isn't a problem per sey, and the film actually benefits from it.

"dansview","7","0","1","4 October 2012"," Watch With Mental Filter
","Remember that Oliver Stone has a reputation for being wildly Left Wing, with regard to the war in particular. He really stacks the deck in this one. He makes sure you know that only the lower classes fought, that any given platoon was filled with murderous sadists, that everyone smoked weed and drank, and that almost no one believed in the cause, except the one evil guy. Also remember that this is a movie starring Charlie Sheen, narrating what it's like to be in the jungles of Vietnam. Does that remind you of something? Yes, his dad already did that in Apocalypse Now, 7 years earlier. So that draws away from the originality of this one. But I did like the central conflict of a nice Sergeant versus a barbaric, yet effective one. Both were brave and effective soldiers, employing very different tactics. Before I get to the repeated sadism, let me remind everyone that the war was not just about some lower class American guys shooting up some local Asian peasants in funny hats. America was fighting the superpowers of China and the U.S.S.R., who were backing the North Vietnamese, and who had designs on world domination. Also remember that Communism murdered millions upon millions of people, including Cambodians, once the Americans went home. I think the movie did do a decent job of showing you the dialog and daily mannerisms of low class men, when left alone. In most cases, whomever you were back home, will still be with you in the jungle. If you were the type of guy who shirked responsibility or blamed others for your mistakes, or you were self-indulgent, or lazy, etc., you will be that at war too. Interestingly there is only one Christian depicted, and that is a quiet Hispanic Catholic soldier who never speaks. I would think that in real life, even many uneducated, small town soldiers would still be Christians. The two Sergeants were too old to be draftees. So they were career military. But they act like common soldiers. Even though Sergeants are not officially ""Officers,"" a career soldier might be more conservative that the way these guys were portrayed. I'll grant the fact that Stone was apparently a soldier there himself, and I was not. I don't doubt that some of the clichÃ©s you see in these movies are true. But they just tend to be one-sided. Tom Berenger was excellent, as was Willem Dafoe. Despite what a weird guy Sheen wound up becoming in real life, I have to say that I like him in those 80s movies. There was something very natural about his acting. I don't think Johnny Depp even spoke in this one, and Kevin Dillon played the same kind of guy he would wind up playing for the next quarter century. The gung-ho dumb-dumb. Music was not employed with the same degree of effectiveness in this one, as it was in Apocalypse Now. Too violent for me, but I did like the way the picture showed the daily frustrations of lack of sleep, leeches, personality conflicts, and fear."

Another thing I remember is that he wrote to his grandmother. He did not write to his mother and father, and that was because his parents did not want him to go..The least savory, or one of the least, was Junior, who almost got Taylor killed, and a lot others. I am pretty old now, yet I was too young for the draft, or Vietnam. I saw Apocalypse Now in my small town, and it blew my mind. . In Platoon, the mainstay of the military movements was to find the bunkers of the NVA. Taylor's commander was a Sergeant named Barnes, a rugged veteran who took it up himself to command the platoon. He was rough around the edges, maybe a little too. Elias was in the soft parade, or it seemed that way. He was not benevolent, that was not the right word. He cared about the soldiers a lot, and was willing to do anything for the troops.<br/><br/>Back at the canteen the soldiers were partying a lot, and Taylor had his first exposure to that kind of thing. But everybody loved him and thought a lot of him, until something happened that changed his whole perception of the infantry. Really, it was a lot of things that made him feel different, and that was when the platoon ran across a group of NVA. Taylor began to see the war in a whole new light. He felt that there were not any rules out in the bush.. An excellent movie. Every time I see it I see something different. My opinion of the film is that Keith David deserved a nomination. If for no other reason, I think so because of his attitude as a soldier and infantryman."

","Chris Taylor is a young, naive American who gives up college and volunteers for combat in Vietnam. Upon arrival, he quickly discovers that his presence is quite nonessential, and is considered insignificant to the other soldiers, as he has not fought for as long as the rest of them and felt the effects of combat. Chris has two commanding officers, the ill-tempered and indestructible Staff Sergeant Robert Barnes and the more pleasant and cooperative Sergeant Elias Grodin. A line is drawn between the two officers and a number of men in the platoon when an illegal killing occurs during a village raid. As the war continues, Chris himself draws towards psychological meltdown... Oliver Stone's Platoon is an epic film that depicts the Vietnam War and the horrific things that some men did and witnessed, it also shows the insanity of war, the terrible conditions the soldiers fought under, and perhaps more importantly, the psychological element that wore down so many men. Stone used some of his own experiences of being in Vietnam to write this story and the result is what seems to be a very authentic and realistic film. It's a gritty and emotional look at this terrible conflict, mostly seen through the perspective of the young recruit Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen). The main storyline and possible the most interesting aspect of the film is the realization by Taylor, that he is fighting two battles, the conflict with the enemy and the conflict between the men within his platoon. In terms of the story I thought it was terrific and it feels/looks authentic, however, with the exception of Sheen, the acting was a bit over the top and quite a distraction. The musical score is very effective with the ""Adagio for Strings"" composition really bringing all the emotion out of the scenes. In conclusion, Platoon is a great war film, it might be disturbing but it's also necessary. On a side note, I watched a version with not so great quality, so I might enjoy the film a little more upon a second viewing.<br/><br/>7.5/10"
"Ali_John_Catterall","7","0","1","13 November 2009"," The Way to Heal: A DVD Extras review
","War is hell, but for fans of Oliver Stone's tribute to the foot soldiers of the Vietnam War, this Sony Pictures Home Entertainment Ultimate Edition DVD (2006) is sheer Hanoi Heaven. Platoon: The Special Edition was originally released in 2001 - so what else is new? And is it worth flogging your old one on eBay to make room for this little war baby? The resounding answer comes with all the force of a purple-faced drill sergeant screaming suggestive remarks about one's sister in your face. That's a yes, then. Yes what? Yes Sir.<br/><br/>The extras, including TV spots, photo galleries and trailers, are legion - but the selling point here (aside from a cleaned-up DTS Surround Sound) are two new featurettes: at nearly one-hour long, 'Tour Of The Inferno' is a superb making of film directed by Charles Kiselyak, who also directed the marvellous One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest documentary 'Completely Cuckoo'. 'Tour...' begins with the young Stone ""entertaining ideas of suicide"", until Vietnam offered him an escape route; and Oliver was ravenous for it. His resulting screenplay may have authentically captured the first-hand experience of in-country combat but, as producer Arnold Kopelson notes, the script was initially rejected out of hand by almost everybody.<br/><br/>We then trace the movie from pre-production on, relating how the actors spent two weeks at boot camp in the Philippines under the rigorous, regimented auspices of military adviser Captain Dale Dye of the US Marine Corps (retired), who'd spent three months in Vietnam, ""almost all that time on the line"".<br/><br/>Willem Dafoe recalls contracting jungle fever while Johnny Depp remembers eating something called ""bean component"" for dinner. (""I'd rather have eaten my own socks.""). Stone and Dyer's commitment to realism ensured production was equally fraught for the virgin soldiers, who remember Stone bullying, cursing and generally hounding them as far as they could physically and psychologically go.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the short featurette 'Preparation For The Nam' describes the reality of training from the veteran's perspective. (""It was hard to sit and listen to some of those sergeants try and lecture, coz they were terrible speakers."") Stone, who arrived for his own tour of duty in 1967 on his 21st birthday, provides an intensely personal audio commentary, reeling off his experiences in synch with the action, and at times identifying so closely with Sheen that the film and his voice-over resembles the second-by-second memoir-cum-confession that, for all intents, it is. ""There's my command sergeant... a fat drunk."" He's re-living it all over again, and it makes for compelling listening. ""These boys returned old and fractured souls"", says Stone. ""Part of them was dead forever."" And his near-monosyllabic voice-over is most effective when describing the horrors he's seen and carried out; alternately ""making friends and jokes with North Vietnamese villagers - and killing them."" <br/><br/>For first-person insight, it's also hard to beat Dye's audio commentary. Part Rambo, part drama teacher, Dye describes how he kept the actors in character throughout - and Tom Berenger in particular (""He would have made a damn fine platoon sergeant."") Dye recalls cutting the cast's ""Hollywood hair off - something I enjoyed immensely"", and, ""using what I call field experience"", jumped in that bodybag himself in the opening sequence to add verisimilitude.<br/><br/>According to Captain Dye, he and Oliver had differences of opinion over Stone's approach to directing - ""me screaming and yelling and calling him 'Ho Chi Minh' and Oliver calling me 'John Wayne'"". And it's certainly disquieting to hear him describe the climactic bloodbath as ""beautiful, man. Hear that sound? That's a bayonet in the chest. We actually did that by stabbing a watermelon. With a bayonet."" <br/><br/>But to return to the real reason we're here, and the reason Platoon was written: catharsis. 'One War, Many Stories' finds a roomful of veterans treated to a special screening-cum-gestalt therapy, moderated by one Dr James Lull (formerly Army 1st Cavalry Division 1963-1966). Dr Lull invites the vets to use the opportunity to express their feelings and recollections about Vietnam, prompted by what they've just seen. Bill Hutton (USMC Battalion 4th Marines) recalls ""the uncommon courage of some of the people I saw""; while Odas Flake (Charlie Company 1965-1966) just thanks God he served when he did, ""when it was a true war, with good leaders - there was no smoking dope in the tents or in the bush"".<br/><br/>Well, mea culpa interjects Paul Gold (Army 1st Cavalry 1965-1968), ""I was one of the guys who was smoking dope and was using heroin, and I remember getting a whipping from a bunch of Southern white guys coz I hung out with the black guys - they had the parties and the drugs."" Soon, the screening room is filled with animated conversation, soul-searching, a few tears - and healing laughter. There may be an untapped vortex of howling pain present, but these guys are mostly keeping it together; if there's a Travis Bickle among them, he's probably curled in a foetal position under his chair, softly banging his head on the carpet and weeping soundlessly. As Stone, with ""the soul of a murderer"" soberly states, ""It's better to talk. That's the way to heal."""

","Simply a fantastic film! I have developed a hatred for director Oliver Stone, largely due to rubbish like Natural Born Killers, but I am glad I gave him a second chance. Platoon is a gritty look into the real Vietnam War. Charlie Sheen and Willem Dafoe give their career performances in this film. Sheen portrays a transformation from innocent to bloodthirsty with brilliant execution. The action is very intense, the acting is spot on perfect and the story is compelling and original. In my opinion, Platoon is the 2nd greatest war film in history behind only Apocalypse Now. This Best Picture winner was not only the best picture of that respective year, but the overall best film of the 1980's."
"hentschellm","10","0","1","22 October 2008"," Oliver Stone's Best Film and the Greatest War Film Ever Made
","This was one of Oliver Stone's first films, and his best. No other film he has made has had the impact on me that Platoon had. No other war film has given me as hard of a punch as Platoon. Some may be thinking of Ryan but Platoon had a more lasting impact on me. It is a truly amazing film. Very well written, feeling very real, and some of the best acting and casting I've seen in a movie. This is probably my 2nd favorite film from the 80s after Raging Bull.<br/><br/>Story: A story from probably the ugliest war that America has ever fought, the Vietnam War, is told in this film. Oliver Stone who was a veteran of Vietnam weaves an amazing work of art out of this messy war. The writing and the actors are so good and work so well together, you can feel the pain that many of the characters are feeling. You can feel the friendships between some of the men and hatred between some others as Vietnam left more than physical marks. While very violent, it's the psychological and emotional scars of war that are shown here. Two sergeants, one a compassionate disillusioned Elias who helps rookies grow accustomed to the war, and sergeant Barnes who ruthless and would kill a child to find information. They butt heads morally throughout the film and the war has given Barnes both physical scars and psychological scars. Watch this movie and you will love this story.<br/><br/>Acting: Tom Berenger, Willem Dafoe, and Charlie Sheen give the performances of their careers with these films. Charlie Sheen makes a very sympathetic narrator who tells the story through letters to his grandmother and is basically in the center of the conflict between the two sergeants. Dafoe creates a sergeant who you would love to be friends with as he cares about everyone. He basically represents Christ throughout the film. Berenger creates probably the second (second to Marlon Brando in Apocalypse Now) scariest military man I've ever seen in a war film. He is so effective that despite having some sympathy for how the war has twisted someone who may have once been a good man, you still have resentment and horror at some of his actions. All of the actors fulfill their part as well. Some are compassionate and some are as ruthless as Barnes. This was definitely one of the best casts I've seen in a war film.<br/><br/>Visual/Audio: The jungles they used for this movie really gives the feel that they are in Vietnam. They create confusion in order to enhance that feel. The music heard at times also makes you feel like it's the 60s. The battles are set up very well to show the carnage but also to make you sort of confused to give you that feeling that many soldiers had. The jungles are both frightening and beautiful to look at.<br/><br/>Overall this is in my opinion the greatest war film ever made. Or anti-war film. Stone tries to paint the war very negatively and tries to show how horrible its effects on people were physical or psychological. SEE THIS MOVIE! 10/10"
"JackBenjamin","7","0","1","18 October 2008"," Simplistic Morality
","The theme is the same as Apocalypse -- the tenuous existence of justice in war. But the treatment is very different. Where Apocalypse was about the insanity of war, this is about the pathos and the beauty of it. Both involve thoughtful men (and both Sheens) who journey through war's landscape and come out alive on the other end, transformed. Charlie develops wisdom and pathos. Martin's transformation is from one type of dysfunction to another. My gut tells me the latter is truer to life, but then again Stone is real veteran.<br/><br/>Elias is Christ. ""He's a water walker,"" ""he thinks he's Jesus F-ckin Christ,"" his arms are outstretched as he dies for everyone else's sins. Barnes is his antithesis, the machine of war. He's (nearly) invincible, with an independent justice, but a system nonetheless. The ultimate message is that the purveyor of these two is a spineless bureaucrat from officer training. <br/><br/>But war isn't a morality play. Good and evil are relative, there is no standard coordinate plane from which to judge right and wrong. Oliver Stone knows this, but he still gives us the simplistic treatment. Apocalypse makes no mention at all of good or evil, just the diseased system and everyone's roles in it. Kind of a David Simon world, but rotting. I prefer that version. This one evokes the same tender emotion that Barber's music does -- beauty in a tragic world. But Apocalypse probes the depths."

","""Platoon"", simply put, is one of the best movies I have ever had the privilege of seeing. Besides the incredible performances of Charlie Sheen, Tom Berenger and Willem Dafoe, the music sets the perfect mood. The cinematography and directing are superb, and as you watch the transformation of Sheen's character, from a doe eyed, naive young soldier to an animal. His metamorphisis is astounding, as you watch the innocence washed from his face, replacing it with blood. Perhaps the most interesting part of this movie is that the major part of the war isn't between the vietnamese and the Americans; it's the Americans against themselves. Tom berenger is perfect in his character. The hate you build for him is incredible, and by the end of the movie, you want Sheen to kill him. You don't want the court system to take Berenger to justice, you want to see him shot, and die in the Vietnam jungle.<br/><br/>Oliver stone delivers one of the greatest cinematic accomplishments ever captured on film.

"bandw","9","0","1","22 August 2008"," Intense, difficult
","Most will find this ultra realistic Vietnam war story a difficult film to watch, especially those who lived through that era. I had put off seeing this all these years since I was afraid of the memories it would bring back, and I was never even in the service. One of the few statements that Dick Cheney has made that I identify with is, ""I had other priorities in the '60s than military service."" Truth be told staying out of Vietnam was a priority of mine, as well as most of my friends - the specter of the draft was always there. Student deferments were the method of choice for accomplishing avoidance for a lot of kids. But then in 1969 came the draft lottery - every day of the year was assigned a number and the lower your number the more exposed you were to being drafted. The lottery was televised and I remember sitting in a large room with about sixty guys and hearing the groans as the low numbers were drawn out of the hopper. This was truly a surreal experience, a mild version of Russian roulette. Many of those with low numbers opted for the method of last resort - flight to Canada. I offer this memory as but one that this film triggered. Almost everyone who lived through the Vietnam war era was scarred by it - few got off scott-free, including of course the countries involved (estimated U.S. deaths 58,000, with 300,000 wounded; estimated Vietnam deaths in excess of one million). The wounds are still healing.<br/><br/>The most acute memories this movie brought back were recollections of the clips on the nightly news which indeed had the same feel as this movie. Oliver Stone's having served in Vietnam lends credence to this harrowing tale; you have to assume that it is to no small extent autobiographical.<br/><br/>The satire of ""Tropic Thunder"" notwithstanding, no matter the the backstage antics, judgment should be rendered on the quality of the final product. And ""Platoon"" ranks high on that scale. The performances are uniformly good, presenting us with an ensemble of believable characters.<br/><br/>The real quality of the film lies in its focus on how the soldiers dealt with the constant backdrop of anxiety, chaos, and fear. This is captured so well that those emotions are transmitted to the viewer, albeit at what is probably a one per cent level of what the actual soldiers experienced, but enough to cause troubled sleep. There are no battle charts or high level officers discussing strategy here, just what the men in this platoon were facing on a daily basis. One of the values of the film is that it dispels much of the mystery as to how some of the horrendous things that were reported at the time (like civilians being killed, villages burned, officers fragged) could happen. And you see why using any drugs to get you through the day made perfect sense. It makes you a lot more hesitant to pass judgment on the actions of soldiers while sitting in the comfort of your home.<br/><br/>I think this is the least political of Stone's films. There seems to be a desire just to ""tell it like it was."" The political back-story never enters into the picture. There were not many people who served in Vietnam with the intelligence and movie-making skills of Stone and it is good that he has given us this film as one portal to understanding what happened on the ground in Vietnam.<br/><br/>I have always been curious as to whether I would have lasted ten minutes or five on the ground in Vietnam. Seeing this movie indicates to me that the latter is probably the case."

","From arguably the best director of our generation (definitely the most confronting and controversial) came the most disturbing and harrowing war film of all time.<br/><br/>""Platoon"" tells the story of raw recruit Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen) who volunteers for service in the Vietnam war only to discover that he has committed himself to a year of pure hell, which he so aptly describes as ""the impossibility of reason"". Stone uses Taylor's shocking story (one many veterans could recount I'm sure) to show us the terrible horrors of war, and does so with gut wrenching effectiveness. The slaying, the brutality, the senseless destruction of both land and people's lives, along with man's shameless inhumanity to man are all painstakingly recreated by Oliver Stone (writer-director), who drives his strong message home relentlessly.<br/><br/>All the players are outstanding, with Charlie Sheen passionately portraying the young, confused and scared Taylor, Willem Dafoe marvelously encapsulating the tireless, freedom fighting Sergeant Elias and Tom Berenger coldly bringing to life the heartless Sergeant Barnes. Great support is also given by Forest Whitaker, Kevin Dillon, Francesco Quinn and even Johnny Depp, among others.<br/><br/>Oliver Stone thoroughly deserved his best director Oscar for this riveting and heart rending motion picture, which also deservedly won best picture. Due credit also must go to the technical teams editing, sound editing and art/set design as well as cinematography and the fine choice of music, with Samuel Barber's Adagio for strings being most effective.<br/><br/>Very disturbing and aggravating, ""Platoon"" is a must see!<br/><br/>Wednesday, January 26, 1994 - Video<br/><br/>Oliver Stone is the man behind this devastating drama about the horrors of the Vietnam war, as seen through the eyes of raw recruit Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen).<br/><br/>Writer-director Stone gives a powerful tour-de-force of Taylor's tour of duty, full as it is with harrowing real life experiences and atrocities, which are presented to us in a shocking and affronting manner.<br/><br/>Every single performance here is outstanding. Charlie Sheen's strong interpretation of young Chris Taylor's personal metamorphosis is fantastic, Tom Berenger's harsh portrayal of black hearted Sergeant Barnes is frighteningly effective and Willem Dafoe's superb showing as the compassionate and world weary Sergeant Elias is inspired. Fine turns also from Francesco Quinn, Kevin Dillon, Forest Whitaker, John C.

I was hoping that this would be the ultimate Vietnam-war movie, with all that it takes, with a mature yet challenging view of the reality of war. <br/><br/>Wellit wasn't bad but I definitely expected more.<br/><br/>My first sensation after I finished watching was this sense of surprise. I actually can't say I have learned anything new from Platoon. It struck me as a too predictable and due to that not very convincing. Yeah, I knew people were killed in wars, I knew that there were atrocities, I knew some were accepting them and some weren't- what I lacked was some kind of higher self-consciousness of the characters, some above-average assessment and assimilation of the things, because this movie seemed like a bunch of robot guys acting, doing the first thing that came into their minds, everything happening exactly the way you think it would.<br/><br/>This takes me to my second point- I really felt that some of the ""explanations"", or ideas were stereotypes or lacked substance. Like the letter in the beginning: with ""this place feels like hell"", or with the lines about duty for your countryI don't know, I'm no veteran, but this doesn't sound very realistic to me. What was again very freak, Bunny killing that guy, or Barnes shooting the woman- it is supposed to show the degrading effects of war, but I can't look to it just like that. Those guys, especially Bunny, would have probably been psychos outside the war; their attitude is not one war can explain, it's a lot sicker than that. OK, we can understand that war brings out the worst in a human being or that it offers the place for otherwise restrained sick behaviors - yet as an other commenter on IMDb put it, too many things happen to that small platoon in a very short period. Of course movie time is limited, but this way we might get the wrong idea about that war."

","This semi-autobiographical account of Oliver Stone's time serving in the Viet Nam war remains as powerful now as it ever was. Essentially a filmed journal, it is narrated by Chris (Charlie Sheen), a young volunteer recruit just starting his first tour, and viewed mostly through his ""grunt"" perspective we see the nitty gritty of daily life for the ""grunts"" who paid so dearly for their government's folly during this terrible conflict. It also illustrates with devastating realism the attitude many American GI's were forced (or chose) to adopt: that ANYONE could be the enemy, even seemingly innocent, benign villagers. This was very true during that war, and resulted in horrendous civilian casualties.<br/><br/>Chris encounters two ""father figures"" in Sgt Barnes (Tom Berenger) and Sgt Elias (Willem Dafoe). Barnes plays the cynical, hardened vet, Elias the more humane and less psychotic voice of reason and truth. No more is this division evident than in the ""underground"" scenes, where the two groups (those loyal to Barnes, the others to Elias) split up, one partaking in cards, whiskey and prayer, while the others retreat to an underground bunker to indulge in the harder side of Viet Nam life: heroin, weed, and everything ""white rabbit"". Chris takes up with the underground crowd, headed up by Elias, and including a young Johnny Depp in a role that unfortunately was mostly cut from the final release.<br/><br/>After a vicious attack on an alleged ""Viet Cong"" village, the two groups are inexorably pulled apart and towards conflict from within, which proves to be far more destructive than the enemies they are supposed to be fighting against. The real war becomes a personal one, raging inside them all, and illustrated through Chris' experiences.<br/><br/>The final battle scene perfectly captures the absolute chaos and confusion, noise and terror of war. You can't really tell where the enemies are, you just know they are there by the bullets whizzing by your head...<br/><br/>Another thing illustrated with realism is the tunnel rat sequence with Willem Dafoe infiltrating a Viet Cong tunnel. While I would have liked to have seen more of this (as it was a HUGE part of the initial stages of that war) it was good to at least see it presented once.<br/><br/>(As a side note, the Viet Cong tunnel system was INCREDIBLE. If you are keen to find out more, track down the book ""The Tunnels of Cu Chi"" can't remember the authors' names but it's a great story, told from both sides, about the extensive network of tunnels the Viet Cong dug, even right UNDER some American army camps!) The ""Gold Edition"" contains a Director's Commentary and also a commentary track from military adviser Dale Dye (USMC Ret) who also served in Viet Nam.<br/><br/>While budget and resources limited the scope of what could be done here (no CGI), Oliver Stone dispenses with big spectacle battle scenes and instead focuses on a riveting, engaging and indeed very moving storyline, complemented by great actors and some really nice photography and production design of the Vietnamese jungle and villages, American camps etc.<br/><br/>Now while I haven't seen EVERY war movie out there, this one certainly struck me as a definitive ""anti-war"" message (with its bloody, brutally realistic portrayal of the violence and insanity that goes hand in hand with war), the only recent war movie to match it, I believe, is ""The Thin Red Line""."

","Platoon is as gritty, intense and devastating as any war film you're likely to find, in any language. Without a profound stance against the pro-war characters, like Apocalypse Now! does, it presents the realities of Vietnam. The drug use, the individualistic conflicts, the tension within the army and the varying degrees of commitment within platoons. Charlie Sheen, surprisingly, is excellent, but his performance does not compare with the Oscar worthy performances of Tom Berringer and Willem Dafoe. They are both spectacular, bringing the harsh kill or be killed mentality of Vietnam to life, on both sides of the Vietnam debate. The film is gritty, there are no frills about the look of the picture, the grainy, washed out palettes illuminate the destitute nature of the soldiers, while simultaneously bringing out the majesty of the natural side of Vietnam. Oliver Stone provides an excellent counterpoint to most other Vietnam movies. There are no winners here, all of the characters find themselves suffering for the sake of political strife at large. Oliver Stone's film is heavy to its core, bringing the soldiers, and the civilians, sacrifice in war to poignant stand still as the staggering numbers of war causalities become people you've watched struggle through personal loss and moral marginalization.

This platoon company has plenty of conflicts, differences of opinion, and culture problems all within themselves. Those themes and problems make this film all the more important as the viewer will come to value life just like the central character of Chris Taylor. The performances given from Sheen is good but fails in comparison to his two commanding officers played by Tom Berenger and Willem Dafoe, especially Berenger's is outstanding because he's so direct and serious. You will find plenty of pot smoking, foul language, and death with this picture, but that's just typical stuff in war.

He shows us a bunch of mainly poor people, a drug taking behaviour beyond the border of the acceptable and military leaders that are anything else than exemplary. But this film wants much more to be a vivid documentation of reality. Stone wants us to feel the deadly insects on our own skins, he wants us to feel the heat, he wants us to feel the fear, what it must be like to sit in the middle of an unknown jungle knowing that the enemy is going to attack any second. He wants all of this, so that the viewer can at least get a glimpse why the soldiers are carrying out this horrible massacre. He doesn't want to apologize it, but give us a psychological insight. Until the massacre the film is extraordinary good, after that I had a bit of a problem with the extreme black/white characterization of Elias and Barnes."

War is an ends to a political means no matter whether it is a ""righteous war"" or not. This will always be true and is the reason even radical Islamics are waging the war they are waging against the rest of the world to achieve their goal of Islamic domination. Same old story, new era. The issue was that the character of Chris and the others in his platoon held out hope of living when a soldier like Barnes has already recognized he is dead which allows him to function as a soldier needs to in war. That is the essence of Barnes' statement when he asks the men after pulling the knife on Chris ""killin', what do you know about killin'?"" I thought some of the drama was very predictable and contrived as well. The idea to put the American soldier in a bad light in many instances.

It involves a protagonist who is also a throwback to the old war movie, a man out of of his element, learning to deal with people he usually didn't. He is a ""rich kid"", but a thoroughly likable, believable rich kid who does a lot of thinking. I'm sure you've already heard about the two NCOs whose names are synonyms for the kinds of soldiers they are ""Barnes"" and ""Lyle"". The acting, directing, and writing are all exceptional. The action and dialogue mingle in a very entertaining, logical, and informative process. What the film also shows is the way of life in that era. It is hard to think about supporting the ""Barnes"" point of view today in an era in which we are so well informed, but in the late sixties and seventies, when Americans were spoon fed only bits and pieces, even by the press (I was a high schooler then, and believe me, the war was downplayed. The killings and battles were described as small skirmishes then by the press.) Probably more than half of Americans would have been ""Barnes"" supporters then, while his supporters today would be the rich mercantile types, the very naive, and the very uneducated (in other words, Republicans). However, when Barnes kills the granny, he probably would have a bit more than half against him, and the film depicts this. Make no mistake, Barnes is the epitome of evil, however. And other characters more in the middle probably reflect how most people would react, Particularly O'Neil, who probably represents the actions most of us would have taken. Anyone who ever thought about being in combat has felt positive they would have done exactly what he did in battle, and would have said exactly the same words he said afterwards. One thing lost is the captain's guilt in all of this. He proclaims that he will investigate and prosecute illegal killing, but then proclaims ""Not now!"" and puts Lyle's life in jeopardy from his comrade quite knowingly. The captain is too smart to get caught, but his mercantile character should not be overlooked when teachers show this film to students. It is he, more than the junio officer, who is truly the ""butt buddy"" of Sgt. Barnes, allowing Barnes to deal life and death and play God. The movie makes clear how he even cheats his friends. He is no comrade, and all his actions are meant to get his comrades killed. The mood of the film is also magnificent. And after seeing it, I can't imagine anyone hearing ""Sweat of My Tears"" without thinking about it. The famous death scene of a certain main character gets the advertising it deserves for being so well made. I could go on for weeks about the assets of this film. The best war film since ""Jungle Fighters"", which was made in the same spirit."

"BobStage","9","0","1","7 January 2007"," A great cast, a great director, a great score: a great movie!
","""Platoon"" is one of those films where you really feel like you understand the topic better. The film is almost like a documentary, as Oliver Stone based the script on his experiences as a soldier in Vietnam. The characters in the movie are based on real people he met while during his time in the battlefields and fox holes.<br/><br/>The three elements that make this movie great are listed in the title. Those three things are the score, the director, and the cast. The score of this movie is very haunting and powerful, taking you to the atmosphere of the film. Some might argue that is over-used, but I don't mind at all. The main theme is incredible, filled with a sorrow. Having also watched ""The War at Home"", I would say that the score bears some resemblance to the main theme in ""Platoon"". The songs used are also very smart choices. Examples are ""White Rabbit"", and ""Tracks of My Tears"".<br/><br/>For the director's role, only a Vietnam veteran could have done such a good job (except for maybe Steven Spielberg). Oliver Stone put his heart, soul, and his past into this film. The characters in the platoon are based on real people that Oliver had known in Vietnam. The central character of Chris is based on himself. This was a struggle to make, and his hard work paid off, in the form of an Oscar, and in the box office success of the film.<br/><br/>The cast is a young one, a cast that had a lot of promise. It was a cast of wide variety. Some were established TV actors, like Tom Berenger and Willem Dafoe. Others had older relations in the film business, like Kevin Dillon and Francesco Quinn. Some, like Forest Whitaker and Keith David, would go on to continue a mediocre film career. Still others were unknown at the time,but would soon rise high, like Johnny Depp and Charlie Sheen. Behind the scenes, they were trained in army-fashion, they were only spoken to by their character names, and they grew very resentful of it by the time that filming started. What then resulted was a very convincing bunch of acting, and the movie goes up many notches because of it. <br/><br/>Special mention should go to all of them, but some really up there include the three main stars. Charlie Sheen is a naive volunteer who grows up in the face of war. Berenger and Dafoe play the two main sergeants of the platoon, and they are constantly on edge with each other. Dafoe is a decent person who realizes that this will be a defeat for his country. Berenger is the soldier's soldier: a hardened killer who is almost tunnel-visioned in his efforts in the war. Then there's the men of the platoon. Francesco Quinn is Rhah, the drug addict who is also very streetwise in the platoon's 'politics'. Kevin Dillon is Bunny, a flawless example of how war makes young teenagers into rapists, killers, or worse, corpses.<br/><br/>""Platoon"" is an eye-opener for those who know very little of the Vietnam War. The movie shows what the soldiers went through for a country in which many had almost no future. It is almost a romantic tragedy, the way it plays out, and is a powerfully emotional piece of cinema."
"amlewin","10","0","1","7 December 2006"," A Great, Classic Masterpiece
","I thought that Platoon was a great classic movie by Oliver Stone. It starts off with Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen) as a scared, college dropout who joined the army to get back at his parents, and try to make a statement about the system. After getting treated like dirt from all of the veterans for being the new guy, Taylor wants to go home or die. As he said ""Its better to be killed during the first few weeks of war then drag out through the whole process."" <br/><br/>When Taylor becomes part of his first ambush, he is not only grazed in the neck, but he is falsely accused of falling asleep on the job. Taylor thinks he is going to die, telling his platoon mates that it ""everything seems so quiet when you die."" Though Taylor was only grazed, he was so scared that he actually got shot, so he acted the way he did. <br/><br/>After spending three days in the medical center, he came back and some of the platoon mates welcomed Taylor with open arms: He was now part pf the platoon. <br/><br/>He joined Elias' (William Dafoe) group, which was more of the wild, party animal bunch. Taylor increasingly became more fearful for his death, and because of that started to act in ways he never thought he would do before. This was evident in the scene in the village raid where he shoots at a boy's foot to make him dance. He became overly frustrated with the boy, who would not listen to his instructions, and just snapped. After the incident, Taylor broke down and cried, realizing he did something horrible. It wasn't until the following scene that made Taylor a killing machine. <br/><br/>When Sgt. Barnes (Tom Berenger) left Elias by himself, telling that the platoon was moving forward, when in fact the platoon was moving back that Taylor snapped. He thought something was fishy and went back to find Elias. He instead found Barnes, who said Elias was dead. Taylor reluctantly went back to the chopper, where he found Elias, shot and wounded, running with an enormous limp for about 50 Vietcong soldiers. Elias then did a Jesus like pose and fell dead on his face. Taylor knew right then that he had to kill Barnes by the end of his time at Vietnam. <br/><br/>In the final battle, Taylor was in the middle of a huge ambush that wiped out almost the entire U.S camp base. Taylor, seeing Barnes fighting for his life with another soldier, tried to help Barnes kill the Vietcong soldier. However, Barnes turned on Taylor and pointed a knife at his stomach, when all of a sudden a huge bomb goes off and everyone is knocked to the ground. <br/><br/>The next scene we see is the next morning, Taylor gets up and limps around in serious pain. Out of the corner of his eye, he sees Barnes crawling on the ground. Barnes demands a medic, but quickly realizes that Taylor will not get one. Taylor points his gun at Barnes, which made Barnes say, ""Common shoot me..."" and with that Taylor shoots Barnes three times in the stomach. Taylor is then put in a helicopter to a medic, where he throws his hands up in the air in joy, but yet sadness because of Elias. <br/><br/>I thought Oliver Stone did an outstanding job of portraying Vietnam and what went on in the platoon. I have seen many biographies and documentaries in school about soldiers in Vietnam and everything that I have seen was dead on in this movie. Charlie Sheen nailed the part of Chris Taylor with a progression of scared, to angry, to not caring about his life with his reckless killing in the last scene. This role lead him to stardom with ""Wall Street"" and ""Major League"" to follow. William Dafoe also did a great job as always as playing Elias. Elias takes Taylor under his wing and is a man who is reckless in partying, but plays by the rules of war. Lastly, Berenger nailed the part of Barnes with his mean streak, and look that got him the part of playing the tough Bear Bryant years later. Berenger's scowl gave fear in everyones eyes, especially O'Neill's (John C. McGlincy). <br/><br/>This movie won best picture in 1986, but should also go down as one of the great war movies every made."
"Doylenf","7","0","2","21 October 2006"," The ugliness of war as seen by an infantry platoon...
","I saw this one years after it was made and the biggest imprint on me was making me feel depressed after watching how the men struggled to keep their sanity in a war that made no sense to anyone at the time.<br/><br/>CHARLIE SHEEN is excellent as the college youth whose innocence about man's inhumanity to man gradually changes during the course of ground combat in the jungles of Vietnam; and WILLIAM DAFOE and TOM BERENGER excel as two Marine sergeants who oppose each other (hate is a better word) with Berenger being the brutal bully and Dafoe representing a saner approach.<br/><br/>Oliver Stone won his Best Picture/Best Director award and it's easy to see why. He kept the film's narrow focus on the men and the struggle they all have for survival under brutal circumstances. Missing are the stereotyped war buddies so commonly seen in the '40s films (the guy from Brooklyn, the dumb newbie, the baby-faced Marine) and instead we have more realistic characters facing a relatively unseen enemy hidden in the thick brush and using the kind of profane language servicemen commonly do whether in wartime or peace.<br/><br/>It's quite an achievement in capturing all the ugliness of war up close and personal--but clearly not a film for everyone. And because it doesn't paint a rosy picture of America at war, it can be particularly depressing to watch at this time. Another possible flaw is that it has no clearly discernible plot and you're left constantly wondering where the whole story is going."
"Vic_max","Null","0","1","18 September 2006"," Well Done ...
","I liked Platoon because it was able to achieve an intenseness needed for an effective war movie - and then tell a story. A great contributor to the tone of the film was an excellent cast. Everyone had distinct and believable personalities. In fact, because they were believable, the story can be effective. We can understanding and experience the good and bad of human nature.<br/><br/>One aspect of the movie that I really liked was lack of constant 60s music playing in the background - I think a war movie (for me) works better than infusing it with period rock music.<br/><br/>A good indicator that a movie is working is the presence of suspense - and there was plenty of good suspense throughout this movie. Another good indicator was the presence of highly emotional scenes. Stone did a great job with some heart-wrenching scenes - shocking and horrific and all too believable. Finally, Stone put in some good surprises - great writing job.<br/><br/>In general, if you're in the mood for a good war movie, Platoon is an excellent choice - one of the few I'd recommend."
"fimimix","10","0","1","2 August 2006"," ..well-made drama..
","Even for ""Platoon"", a quote from ""Apocalypse Now"" says it all: ""a bunch of 4-star clowns were giving the whole circus away"" is just as relevant here. Add to that, two US presidents who were busy lying to us. Those ""users"" who wrote ""an army who fights itself cannot win the war."" also tells a loud tale. Once the draft set-in, it was all down-hill, because the younger the soldiers were, the more unprepared they were for jungle-warfare- maybe all those guys who went to Canada had insights the other grunts didn't, plus officers who were totally unprepared for combat and useless at trying to lead. Kids who had just graduated from high-school and were reveling in their budding manhood, from owning their first automobile certainly weren't ready to leave the nest of home and fight in a savage jungle. AND - I want to correct ""Polaris_P.b"" for saying there were too many Black soldiers in the movie - wake-up, guy: that race was the most vulnerable to be drafted and volunteering, because they had no future to look forward to. They were about half of the fighting-force. You noticed their presence in THIS movie, because in other wars they were segregated from the general troops, and ALWAYS had the most dangerous assignments. Lots of horrendous tales to be told about them....<br/><br/>Although much was made about Charlie Sheen almost being eaten alive - several times - by ants, no one mentioned the two cobras he encountered at close-range. That would have kept me out of the jungle entirely.<br/><br/>This movie is near being flawless, but that characteristic can be really gleaned only after several viewings. With the war raging between Beringer's and Dafoe's characters - and the danger of not knowing whom you are shooting at - how could there be any morality among the troops? I worked in Hawai'i during that war, which was a big ""R-&-R"" retreat. I met so many guys who were just as frightened at every sound THERE as they must have been in Vietnam. I suspect a lot of them went AWOL from there. As so many ""users"" picked-up, the whole thing was about staying alive. Even if they did, they had no idea how terribly they would be treated when they went home. ""War is hell"" is just an announcement that the war to keep your sanity, at home after the battle, would be almost as bad. See ""The War at Home"", which just happens to star Martin Sheen as the father of a Vietnam veteran......one of his real sons.<br/><br/>This movie dulls the senses even as you watch it. I get so involved, I can't even separate the characters - I'm amazed I can recognize the three main actors, and that's only because they're in almost every scene. I never did recognize Johnny Depp, who was almost chosen as the main character, but was too young.....and Oliver Stone predicted he would be a future major-star. As hateful as he was, Beringer was brilliant, as was Defoe underplaying his more humane officer with bravery to spare, as was Charlie Sheen's ability to act from ""cheese-d--k"" to seasoned fighter. The whole scene of destroying the peasant village was too realistic and heartbreaking. Sheen's rescuing the girls from being raped, outstanding - after all, ""rape and pillage"" were a bi-product of every war since the beginning of time.<br/><br/>Turning our youngest men into ""killing-machines"" (""Jarhead"") absolutely guarantees they will never live a normal life. If a movie can arouse such fear, how much worse can actually taking part in one be? The big battle at the end of the movie - when the soldiers are begging to be spared from close fighting and willing to injure themselves to get out of it - certainly points-out American troops can't always hack-it when the going gets rough. Especially, when the enemy has been fighting longer - and has a stronger determination to win because they are fighting on their own territory - as the VC were, and about the same in Iraq. If this country has ever fought a deceitful war, that is it.<br/><br/>Oliver did create a real classic - how skillfully he controlled every aspect, how brilliant was his script to depict the only salvation for the troops was to get lost in drugs and alcohol. The cinematography, simply gorgeous; special effects, totally real-looking; ""Elias'"" final scene expected but devastating; Sheen's shooting Beringer, bravo ! Every actor was stellar and the crew brought all of their skills to the front to make this movie timeless - with a deep prayer ""can't we just get along?"" Required viewing for everyone........even the weak-hearted."

"tnhelliott","7","0","1","11 March 2006"," Jesus as a soldier
","This is a stirring character piece set in the Vietnam war. It is clearly more than just a War picture. The film seems to be more about religion and free will as a conflict than it does a war film. Throughout the film the characters are forced to make choices based on circumstances that most of us will never have to contend with. There are influences in the daily lives of these men that would bend the mind of a sane person. So much seems to happen to them that they almost lose themselves to the heart of darkness. On another note, it is great to see Willem Dafoe playing a Jesus like character before he went on to play Christ in ""The Last Temptation of Christ."" For anyone who has not seen this film, I highly recommend it for a night when you want to have your perspective of good guys and bad guys and what war does to a man adjusted. Upon watching this film, you may never view the Vietnam conflict the same again."

","I think this movie was pretty good. lots of violence and swearing which was OK.. i guess...i feel sorry for Sgt. alias because that barn guy back stabbed him which was not really nice. I also think that maybe Taylor or w.e should of helped barn get out of there instead of killing him so he can look like a good person. overall this movie was pretty good. Some parts i didn't really pay attention to because it was boring, but the shooting parts were cool. In the beginning i thought barn was kind of a good guy, but after i watched most of it i learned that he was a bad guy. They should maybe make another Platoon movie, but with better graphic and effects because the effects were not that good it was OK. I hope that there won't be another war because killing other people seems really mess up and seeing friends or family die is not a honor.

Growing up in the 60s I had become scared to death of having to go to war and kill someone. This movie verified my fears. It's a horrifying portrayal of what fighting in the Viet Nam war was probably like. I found it much more moving than Full Metal Jacket, and although I can't say for sure which is more accurate, this film felt more real. Director North got the most out of his actors, especially Charlie Sheen and Tom Berenger, both in perhaps their best roles ever. Willem Dafoe was, as always, excellent. Unfortunately for the actor John C. McGinley, because of his role in this movie I will never be able to trust in any character he plays.

","Platoon certainly shows the harsh realities of modern warfare. Our character, the ever-stereotypical wide-eyed ""Naive Private,"" slowly grows more and more gritty, dark, and harsh with each new experience. While it does not have, say, the ridiculously overdone graphics of the movies that our children watch now, nor a particular scene thrown in for the ratings-grabbing ""eye candy,"" it truly shows war as the hideous, realistic catastrophe that it is now. The viewer will watch a scene at the start of our movie, with our private staring, disembodied, at the body bags being shipped to America. Eventually the war rears its ugly head, and one body becomes 10, 10 becomes 50, 50 becomes a scene in which you cannot see the ground through the napalm.<br/><br/>As our private struggles with the ever-elusive ""Charlie,"" or ""VC,"" he is taken under the wing of one of his superiors. As he grows emotionally, and slowly becomes more used to the war, his teacher becomes more acknowledging of his presence, and indeed treats him as an equal. The echo of this would be his other superior, a battle-ready bruiser who definitely defines the word ""prejudice."" After the two sergeants fight against each other, the ""teacher"" *PLOT SPOILER* mysteriously dies... Our hero always has a feeling that his other superior was behind it, but can't prove it. After a particularly devastating attack, the private notices his senior, lying on the ground, completely untouched, but still acting completely arrogant. Our hero manages to salvage a Vietcong gun (Soviet AK-47 model, to be precise), and aims it threateningly at the sergeant.<br/><br/>""What are ya gonna DO, kid.

This film truly showed what happens in battle, and sometimes it's not what we expect. Washington post says that this film is: ""A Triumph! A staggering study of war."" This film is filled with action, drama, and of course war. But its primary focus isn't on the war with the Viet Cong, but the war between each other. It teaches you life examples through action, excitement, and death. This dramatic war film tells the truth about what happens in battle. In the film Chris (Charlie Sheen) said: ""Somebody once wrote: 'Hell is the impossibility of reason.' That's what this place feels like. Hell.""

","Probably because I'm not American and certainly because I'm not young, I find it hard to feel much empathy with characters seeped in American street culture. In consequence the film left me stone (sorry Ollie) cold sober at the beginning. A bit like the whole of Apocalypse Now. Soldiers swear and get doped, they're incomprehensible, ill breed and ugly. When they get blown to smithereens and blood flows, arms come off and characters scream and screech, all I feel is yeah, yeah, yeah, if you learnt some decent human values maybe I would care that you're suffering. And then came the sequence in the Vietnamese village and that really got to me. Outrage and anger, and did they really murder and crush like that, but it's not that simple, were the villagers harbouring the enemy, and so on. It's the best film I've seen on the Vietnam war, although I've yet to see Full Metal Jacket. I score 8/10.<br/><br/>Anyway ... The reason for me writing a comment is that it occurs to me that there's a similarity between The Magnificent Seven and Platoon. In the same way that Seven consolidated the careers of a number of young 1960s film actors (Yul Brynner, Eli Wallach, Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson, Robert Vaughn, James Coburn), Platoon deepened the careers of a number of young 1980s film actors (Tom Berenger, Willem Dafoe, Charlie Sheen, John C.

Platoon has a brilliant cast in my opinion and deserves all the praise for being one of the greatest war movies of all time.

","Maybe? Well... Vietnam is a personal war, or more to the point, a personal opinion of that particular war. Like the American Civil War a hundred years earlier historians will never be able to stamp a definable image on that conflict. Platoon is a movie about Oliver Stone's Vietnam. He may have hit the nail right on the head or he may be wandering around out in left field somewhere. Only he and the closest few around him would have a better idea of which image is which. The rest of us simply watch the movie and think about it afterward. The combat sequences are without a doubt some of, if not the best ever shot. This aspect of the film is brutally real. So is the interplay between the individuals themselves. Through this fascinating maze of characters and story is woven the moral tale of an everyday All American Boy Next Door who is figuring out that he has made one of the worst mistakes in his life so far. And now he doesn't know if he'll even live long enough to make any more. This thread-morality play-is what makes Platoon a very personal movie. A real masterpiece is for everyone. Platoon is not for everyone. A common soldier is presented in an unmistakable image of the Christ. Gut wrenching? Yes. Moving? Yes. Real? That depends a lot on who is watching and taking it all in. One vet says ""There it is!"" Another says ""What a load of crap."" The only thing the rest of us can do is wonder about it and try to piece second hand facts together. Is this a good war movie? Without a doubt, one of the best ever. Is it a good movie in general? Definitely! Is it a masterpiece? I don't know, I wasn't there. I whole heartedly thank all the poor bastards who were there regardless of personal politics at the time, and I thank Mr. Stone for both his services to me when he was young and in uniform and for becoming such a brilliant and personally honest film maker.

Where the hero was eager to enter the war and fight and die for his country and felt that the war was justified. The hero in ""Platoon"" Pvt. Chris Taylor, Charlie Sheen, had no doubt at all about the war that he entered as a green replacement in the battered and bloodied Bravo Company 25th Infantry. Chris felt that the war in Vietnam was a necessary evil at best or an unnecessary waste of lives, American and Vietnamese, at worse. <br/><br/>Volunteering for combat duty Chris felt that as a more or less privileged young American he had to pull his own weight and not stay out of the service of his country at it's time of need and dropped out of collage, were he was safe from being drafted for military service, to do that. During his time serving in one of Bravo company's platoons Chris realized that not only was he at war with the dreaded and deadly North Vietnamese regular soldiers and Vietcong troops and guerrilla fighters he was at war with the men in his own platoon as well as himself. <br/><br/>Graphically violent as well as penetratingly thought-provoking Vietnam War film by director Oliver Stone that not only shows the war in Vietnam but any war for what it really is: Hell On Earth. Were given the story of the actions of the Bravo Company platoon from the thoughts and writings of young Pvt.Chris Taylor that takes place from the late summer of 1967 to around the time of the Tet offensive in January to March 1968. Which witnessed some of the bloodiest fighting in the war. <br/><br/>By the end of the movie Chris' platoon was cut to pieces in a series of ambushes night attacks and fire fights and finally a major North Vietnamese assault that breached Bravo company's forward perimeter in the Vietnamese jungle. The enemy forces overran and virtually wiped out the entire infantry company which was saved, in a last act of desperation, by a USAF bombardment of it's own positions. The film shows that war, no matter how right or wrong it is, dehumanizes and brutalizes all those involved in it.<br/><br/>We see Chris who went from an innocent young man who never fired a shot in anger, if at all, before he entered the US military to a hardened and cold-blooded killer in the less then six months that he was in Vietnam. There's also a powerful story between the two sergeants who ran the platoon that Chris was in. Sgt. Elias Grodin, Willem DaFoe, and Staff/Sgt. Bob Barnes, Tom Berenger. The two seemed to be more at war with each other then with the enemy Vietcong and NVR. Sgt. Grodin was on the sensitive side who tried to keep at least some of his humanity in light of the madness swirling all around him and was by far the most likable person in the movie. Staff/Sgt. Barnes was a horribly scared psychotic killer who took no prisoners, military or civilian, and was both feared and hated by almost everyone in his platoon. <br/><br/>As brutal as Staff/Sgt. Barnes was he never the less motivated his men to fight and survive in the savage jungle combat that they encountered all through the film. It was Staff/Sgt. Barnes brutish treatment of innocent Vietnamese civilians that the platoon came in contact with that split the two, Barnes & Grodin, up into enemy camps. <br/><br/>In one of the most gripping scenes in the movie when Sgt. Grodin was lost in the jungle after an enemy ambush he's spotted by Staff/Sgt. Barnes. You can see by the look in Sgt. Grodin's eyes how happy he is to see him and you get the impression that they'll both make up and bury the hatchet and once again become friends. Yet just by looking in the crazed stare coming out of Staff/Sgt. Barnes eyes you, and Sgt. Grodin, knew that was not to happen as he put a barrage of slugs into Grodin's chest from his M16.<br/><br/>""Platoon"" is one of those movies about war that really hits the nail on the head about the horrors of war and that the most righteous of all wars are those wars that are never fought at all."

","Weird as I am, I'm very interested in history, and the Vietnam in special. By that, it made this piece a lot more interesting to me than other war movies - so I just had to see this one with my friend and discuss it afterwards. I found this Oliver Stone piece so tight, scary, dramatic and it sent this huge vibe that stroke me that, this was real - no fake action here ladies and gentlemen. I do believe that this movie gives a fair shot of how it might've been being an American trooper down there in those flood deltas, and the way Oliver delivers this story to the viewer it's simply amazing and stunning. No other Vietnam piece can beat this I believe, and the movie really shakes your brain around a little bit, and afterwards I felt cozy and very touched. It's just simply a masterpiece!"

","I just viewed the film ""The Mission"" again last evening, and couldn't understand why it didn't do all that well with the Academy Awards seeing the world wide acclaim it did receive. Which brought me to researching which films received the awards that year.  On to Platoon.  Now I know, of course, Hollywood and the antiwar groupies, Oliver Stone, etc. What else could one expect to receive the honors.  As for those out there who think Platoon was such a wonderful Vietnam film, I suggest they view ""We Were Soldiers"", starring Mel Gibson with his portrayal of Lt. Col. Hal Moore, later Gen. Hal Moore, in the accurate account of a bloody battle in the la Drang Valley, from the book written by Gen Moore. It wasn't necessary to invent heroes or events there were enough very real ones. Gen. Moore said the film was the most accurate portrayal of Vietnam and war that he had ever seen.  It is a powerful film."
"Conspirator","Null","0","1","3 March 2004"," Stone's War of Attrition on Vietnam
","*SPOILERS* -- Just in case :)<br/><br/>Now that nearly 20 years have passed since Platoon's first screening (can you believe it?) it seems more like an 'ok' war movie.  ""We Were Soldiers"" is a much more respectful and accurate portrayal of our troops and the VC of the time (granted, it covers a different time in the war than ""Platoon"" does; politics & attitudes were vastly different between the two times, as well). Like all Stone films, it must be taken with a dose of salt.  Sure there was plenty of chaos encountered by our soldiers (especially what my relatives have explained to me and accounts I've read by respectable individuals who served honorably), however, a unit like Chris's(Charlie Sheen) was simply a work of inspiration and agenda.  No I don't know everything so save your breath, but people need to realize that Chris' unit is an art of fiction created to emphasize Stone's agenda with drama. Truly, where would the drama be in this film if there weren't the two polar oposite personalities of Barnes and Elias?  Undeniably, the drama is created by their opposing attitudes, those that choose to follow them, and those torn between them.<br/><br/>I cannot think of another war movie that preaches at you like ""Platoon"". Oliver Stone, who is considerably anti-war-at-all-costs (perhaps more -- heck he's eulogized Castro and Arafat in some recent films at Sundance), served in Vietnam and chose to make a film that consisted of characters comprised of a multitude of personalities/attitudes he came across.  And Chris, well, that's Oliver himself (so he says in the commentary).  As I said before there was no Barnes or Elias, they were figments of inspiration. Stone, and many Vietnam critics, fail to mention why were really there. It's just the same, ""old white men sending young black/underprivileged/poor men to go die for them for no particular reason.""  Um, let's not forget about communism, and JFK's(our) war against it.  I would like to go into further detail to answer some of the uninformed critics on this board, but that's not what this review is about.  However, I will say, if any one good thing came from Vietnam, it was the fact that apart from South Vietnam, communism spread no further in Southeast Asia, or the rest of the world for that matter.  It also dramatically changed the way the U.S. approached war, used reserves, and used (or have not since used)drafts.<br/><br/>I would recommend seeing ""Gardens of Stone"" for a balance after seeing Platoon.  It deals with the war on the home front and deals with the tough home front issues of that day.  Directed by Coppola (not his best but still worth a watch)."

","The action and effects alongside the emotional trauma of war films makes them so powerful. Maybe it is the fact that although we are watching fiction we know that the suffering we witness actually happened to many people. Either way this film is very effective and moving. There are times you can suggest Stone may excessively preach but this film has a lot to say and delivers it just perfectly. Its not the arty self indulged war film the Thin Red Line is. This film is poetic without removing the grit and jagged edge we associate with Vietnam. Possibly the best war film, probably the best Vietnam film"

","Platoon is uncomfortable viewing. The film focuses on Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen) who is a new recruit to Vietnam.

People die in war and the soldiers become familiar with death. Those soldiers that do survive will not be the same again.<br/><br/>Excellent direction for Stone and a good all round cast make for a fine film, but it's probably a little too close to the bone to be genuinely enjoyable. 8/10"

Quite possibly was intentionally part of the scene.<br/><br/>Otherwise, an excellent portrayal of the real cruelty and suffering that went on in the Vietnam War. Nothing sugar-coated here! I still shield my eyes during the scene in which Sheen's character kills the young villager in the hut. Another scene which causes great pain is the shooting of the woman and the cries from her daughter and husband.

","Probably the best war-movie to me is Platoon. It is a movie who is so realistic that it even makes it looks that you were in the Vietnam-war. Compared with other war-movies or series like 'Tour of duty' for example, it is much better. 'Tour of duty' was very entertaining to see, but it was a little romanticized and unrealistic. In Platoon, you can see that America lost that war because of bad strategy and attitude. The simple-minded, poor Americans were sent to Vietnam to fight for the rich Americans. They were young and no natural born killers so that is why they lost the war. Director and writer Oliver Stone showed really good how this happened, it even made me a little emotional. Especially the very memorable (to me anyway) invasion of the American soldiers in the Vietnamese village and the big battle at the end were very impressing to me. Oliver Stone, congratulations."

What caused his hatred, anger to his fellow soldiers? Why was he on a personal sucide mission? Nothing!I would of love to found out, what made him tick. How did he get those facial scars? One could only surmise with his attitude.  To this he was nominated for supporting role? For the most part, his role was small as compared to Martin Sheen.

I consider this movie to be only the third film to legitimately reflect the reality and aftermath of battle (""Coming Home"" and ""Deer Hunter"" being the first two).  The film is visually stunning while at the same time bearing witness to the impact of war on the human psyche.  The impression it leaves is profound.  On the one hand it's encouraging to see that the era of sugar coated war films has reached an end, but this film proves that in war time the screen audience that bears witness to these recreated battles is not alone in sharing a loss of human innocence."

","In general, I'm not a fan of war movies. But ""Platoon"" is literally a war movie. Other 'war movies' seem to concentrate a lot on the soldiers' life before the war, their families, etc. In ""Platoon"", the only civillian characters are the Vietnamese. The film is powerful and gripping. It is also quite gory, which is a turn-off to some people. But, after all, there is a lot of gore in war, right? Tom Berenger's portrayal of Sgt. Barnes was magnificent. Willem Dafoe and John C. McGinley weren't half-bad either.<br/><br/>    In response to those two guys who criticized it(hockeyguy and Mike Fleming), I think you don't know what you're talking about. First of all, I don't believe soldiers would use politically correct terms to identify the enemy(""We wasted three Asian people"" would sound strange). Hence, the frequent use of 'dinks' and 'gooks'. <br/><br/>    We Were Soldiers- accurate? The US was promoting peace in Nam, right? Please. If you've heard about the My Lai Incident(it was mentioned in the film when soldiers talked about Charlie Company), you'll know  that Oliver Stone could have gone even further in his depiction of raping and pillaging. I've read that some soldiers refused to participate in such acts but they didn't want to 'spoil the fun' for the others. So the only unrealistic thing in this case was that Charlie Sheen's character saved the little girl from getting gang-raped. As far as the 'awful actors' part, I guess it's just a matter of taste.

I do not believe in gratuitous violence or the like, but Vietnam was a hell that cannot be imagined by those who weren't there, as Spielberg so aptly demonstrated about the hell of WW 2.

This is the gritty story of a group of soldiers and the hell they endure during the Vietnam war. The mis-en-scene in the film is incredible. A key feature in Platoon is the lighting. It serves as an important function to the narrative. One scene that really accentuates this concept is about five minutes into the film. The viewer sees a beautifully crafted long shot from the forest ground looking up at the forest trees. The enormous trees block out most of the sunlight except for a few rays that penetrate down, all the way to the forest floor. The light illuminates the leaves and surrounding areas, but the rest is dark. This feeling of being trapped fits in the theme of the film, as well as the soliders general ideology about the jungle. The music is completely haunting, which they use to emphasize the film's tragic tone. The narrative formula is a young man torn between good and bad father figures. The film is bold, disturbing, and gut wrenchingly powerful. A must see. <br/><br/>10/10"

Platoon is less a war movie than the ultimate clash between good and evil, and between those two forces is the main character Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen). Volunteering for the war, not drafted, the main character quickly learns what he has really signed up for, and he is definetaly not ready.  Being blown away by the helicopter that sets him down, body bags of all the dead fly away and we see what the future holds for our main character and for the entire movie.<br/><br/>Platoon presents itself in sections, first being the welcome to Vietnam, making friends, and deciding what kind of people you plan to spend your time with there. It basically comes down to three groups in Vietnam, the weed-smoking grunts which view the war in a calm manner, the booze drinking officers and wannabe officers who do whatever they say, right or wrong, and the commanders and regular drafted grunts which aren't followed that closely.<br/><br/>Chris chooses to join the pothead group, run by Seargent Elias (Willem Dafoe), which treats him kindly and is offenly attacked by the other main group, run by Seargent Barnes (Tom Berenger). Under Barnes's brutal command Chris and his fellow soldiers, who have lost the regard for human life under Barnes's command, are ordered to search a town of Vietnamese people who are totally innocent and then burn the entire village, and kill whoever they think is the enemy. Chris is pulled into Barnes's plans but quickly realises that he has made a horrible mistake when Elias brings everyone to their senses and tells Barnes he will do everything in his power to court marshall him. Knowning that he will be shamed and given a discharge from the Marines if Elias gets his way, Barnes shoots Elias in the middle of the jungle during a firefight.  Chris is sent to find Elias but instead finds Barnes, Barnes tells him Elias was shot by the VC and he is dead.  Soon after the platoon leaves on choppers only to see from a bird's eye view that Elias, full of bullet holes, uses his last amount of soul and energy to try to escape from the VC which are simeltaneously shooting him in the back, and there is nothing the rest of the platoon can do.

Mark Moses is also superb as the overwelmed westpoint Lieutenent. The soundtrack complements the film perfectly from the emotional climax of Adagio to the very profound ""tracks of my tears"" sequence.

"Lee-107","Null","0","1","4 June 2002"," An Anti-War War Film
","This is the first Oliver Stone film that I watched. And I did so only because it was directed by him. I found the film disturbing, quite frankly, it's an assault on the senses, visually and audibly. But somehow while in the middle of it I got the feeling that even when there's continuous firing action most of the time, the message of the film was more against war and the futility of it than for it. I know that no one expressly states that they are ""for war"", but wars do take place and have taken place, haven't they? In one way or the other, the past wars took place because people endowed war with many qualities it just didn't have. Brainwashed by propaganda, they were ""for war"" without even thinking about it. I don't know about the realism of this film, what I know is, as Sheen's character discovers, that most of his fellow soldiers were either under-educated or not well-off. Usually it's not the rich and the educated who go to war, but the most deprived of the society. I'm glad Stone showed this in the film. His film, much before Spielberg's vocal anti-war message through 'Saving Private Ryan', is a grim warning of the physical, mental and emotional destruction that a  war causes. <br/><br/>     A few minutes into the film and I knew it HAD TO absolutely have a narrator. Nowhere is the need for the protagonists voice-over more felt than in a film which is a) centered around that one person and b) has him/her in some situation of conflict, especially War and more especially on foreign soil. All this is, I think, established in the few initial minutes of the film itself. More than anything, narration acts as that one voice talking directly at you, usually in retrospect to make sense of all the chaos happening on screen. Needless to say I was most relieved when Charlie Sheen's narration started. Not only did it provide audible relief but it helped to put forth the theme of the movie. The Cast is superb, especially Willem Dafoe. I couldn't help remembering his role in the World War II film 'The English Patient' in which, though he plays a small role, he's equally brilliant. The only other film I've seen Tom Berenger in is 'Sliver' and I must say, he can be as good a hard-nosed almost psychotic Army officer as he can, a slick smooth-talking womanizer. He made my flesh creep by his nonchalant attitude towards life, or rather death... I've not seen any other Charlie Sheen film, partly because I saw him as just another pretty face on screen. I'm glad to eat my words because he's quite a man in this film! Enough said. Those who must be reading this review have likely already seen the movie and may agree that, though not very palatable, it's quite an experience..."

","This is certainly a war movie.  Is it realistic? I cannot say, as I have never been in a war.  It does portray war as a very unpleasant experience. It also portrays Americans committing war crimes.  These two elements make many moviegoers say that it is the most realistic Vietnam War movie ever made, even if they were not even alive during the Vietnam War.  I thought it was just another war movie.  If you've seen other movies about the Vietnam War, this does not cover any extra ground and also lacks intelligent delivery of some meaningful message.  If you think Charlie Sheen is a stud, or you like watching fight scenes set in the jungle, don't waste any time. Go rent it right now.  If you're looking for a movie that uses the Vietnam War to teach you some important life lesson, watch Full Metal Jacket or Apocalypse Now.  If you want a realistic portrayal of a soldier's experience in Vietnam, I doubt Hollywood can offer you that.  I give it a 7."

","*** CONTAINS SOME SPOILERS ***<br/><br/>Unlike much of the director's work, Oliver Stone's ""Platoon"" is not politically orientated, at least not to the extent that his later films were. Oh, there's the occasional mention of politics and class division, but for the most part, his film is simply a time capsule of the Vietnam War.<br/><br/>It does not claim to hold all the answers to the social, political, or moral issues raised since then. It is nothing more than a record of what it was like there, and that's all it needs to be. I must note that it's more restrained than most of Stone's body of work; it's not that subtle a film on its own, but at least he editorializes less than he usually does.<br/><br/>As a combat veteran, he must have realized that the subject matter is best left without excessive embellishments or overdramatization.<br/><br/>One way that Stone breaks from convention is his portrayal of the day-to-day drudgery of Vietnam. Much of the protagonist's experiences consist of long, hard marches. He is frequently besieged not by enemy troops, but by exhaustion, humidity, and insect bites. He is given the cold shoulder by the more experienced troops, who adhere to the unwritten rule that the worth of one's life is directly proportional to the length of his stay thus far. As he comes to realize, many of his conflicts will not be with the Viet Cong, but with some of his own comrades...and himself, as well. The conflict has divided American society to such a degree that even our own troops are always at each other's throats. How can we effectively organize a combat unit whose members dislike and mistrust one another, even the commanding officers? This situation will eventually be taken to its worst extremes in later scenes.<br/><br/>The internal discord of the infantry is best illustrated by Platoon's most chilling sequence, as the troops run across a village hoarding weapons and food for the enemy. Their leader insists that they are being forced to do so by the Viet Cong, but that does not alleviate the suspicion that they are in league with their foes. The viewer believes him, but that's easy to do when your life is not at stake. The situation deteriorates, almost turning into another My Lai-style massacre, as the leader's wife is coldly put to death on the spot. Right after that, we see a weapon being put to the head of a child, bringing us to the realization of the dehumanizing, demoralizing nature of war. Anyone acting in that manner has lost a vital part of himself, a tragedy in its own way.<br/><br/>The film takes the effort to give us realistic, well-defined characters. Charlie Sheen and Willem Dafoe evoke our sympathy as kindred spirits; Sheen as the green recruit, Dafoe as the three-year veteran; both as decent people trying to make the best of a bad situation. Tom Berenger is chilling as their moral foil, a man who's seen too much and experienced too much, to the point where he can no longer distinguish between right and wrong.<br/><br/>The supporting cast members all deliver solid performances. <br/><br/>""Platoon's"" only serious flaw is that the voice-over narration seems intrusive at times. Much of the information given is already conveyed--whether explicitly or not--through what's shown onscreen.<br/><br/>Towards the very end, there's one odd bit of heavy-handed symbolism that doesn't quite ring true, though I could see what Stone was trying to get across there. Nonetheless, taken as a whole, the film is a valuable historical document, a vital record of a much-debated chapter in American history."

This movie won film of the year in 1986 and anyone who objects need to study not only the amazing performances by all of the men in the film but also the storyline that shows us how man's feelings are hardened to the point of breakdown in War. This movie is a presentation meant for everyone to see what Vietnam Veterans had to go through, done specifically so that the public embraces them now and does not shun them like the whole nation did after the war. Like Veterans, anyone who has had some or tremendous emotional difficulty with some of life's obstacles will relate to this film more than the average person. Platoon provides us with a glimpse into the insanity of war, the brotherhood of combat, and most importantly the deterioration of feelings until the point where trust can only be placed in the man who fights by your side."
"ken_vandenbussche","Null","0","1","10 February 2002"," One of the best Vietnam-films ever made
","In this great film Oliver Stone paints a nice but realistic (and therefore sometimes shocking) picture of what the Vietnam War must have been like in those days. In a brilliant way, Stone shows us how the Americans were rather fighting amongst themselves than against the 'real' enemy out there. He also points out that this must have been one of the main reasons why America didn't win the war. This piece of information is what the film is all about. Besides the actual Vietnam War you can see the development of another 'personal' war that starts with a stupid incident but becomes just as strong and dangerous as the real war.  Good men were killed when they could have been saved.<br/><br/>In this film, Charlie Sheen is a young soldier who's just started out in Vietnam. He's caught between two superiors who (as he said so himself) fight for the possession of their souls. There's the morally corrupt, merciless 'killer machine' Sgt. Barnes and the much more humane Sgt. Elias who wants to teach his men a sense of compassion and responsibility.<br/><br/>""Platoon"" is a great film, in particular because Oliver Stone creates such a thrilling and realistic atmosphere throughout the entire picture. The camera-work is great but unusual as Stone becomes a part of his own film by acting as if he were one of those soldiers.  This technique is often used to create a rather claustrophobic and panicky atmosphere and it's best-known as 'subjective camera shots'. <br/><br/>Most of the film takes place in the jungle, but this so-called lack of variation is never boring. The scenes in the jungle are really nerve-wracking, as you never know what could happen next.  One moment you have piece and quiet where you can literally hear the birds singing; it's almost as if the war has suddenly ended ... and then there's the ear-deafening noise of gunfire and grenades which, to anyone's surprise, immediately follows in the scene hereafter.<br/><br/>Because of an interesting story with great acting performances, Oliver Stone manages to keep you emotionally involved for the whole time being.  Both Tom Berenger and Willem Dafoe do a good job, but the most notable performance comes from Charlie Sheen.  Interesting to know is that Charlie Sheen's father Martin has also starred in a Vietnam movie many years ago.<br/><br/>Personally, I think ""Platoon"" is a very good film that gives the viewer an insightful representation of how the Americans may have lost the Vietnam War."

He narrates the film as well, explaining the chaos that is all around him and it really let's you feel what he is feeling. Overall i'd rate this flick an 9/10.

","""Platoon"" is one of many Vietnam war movies. It's also, in my opinion, one of the very best, to run alongside ""Apocalypse Now"" and ""Full Metal Jacket"".<br/><br/>
""Platoon"" tells the story of a platoon (funny that) of Vietnam soldiers. It's mainly told through the eyes of young new recruit Chris (Charlie Sheen) and we hear this thoughts and meditations on what happens. Central to the story-line is the brutal treatment of a group of Vietnamese villagers at the hands of the platoon and how the group reacts to the execution of one villager by Officer Barnes (Tom Berenger) - one half siding with Barnes and the other with Elias (William Dafoe). The story becomes quite brutal (in a dark fashion - not a bad one) and Stone ably handles this with consistent use of rain and darkness. The battles are deftly handled and reflect the chaos and confusion they find themselves in (noticeable particularly in the final battle). There is a constant struggle going on between the dark side and the light side - without and with morales - reflected in the characters of Barnes and Elias which is very interesting. Th characters also have depth here - we do end up caring for them and they are drawn in a far superior fashion to many war movies where characterization is second to pretty effects (""Black Hawk Down"" springs to mind).<br/><br/>""Platoon"" is certainly one of the best war movies I've seen as it handles multiple elements effectively - the people and the action, as well as issues of morality. It looks and feels good. I recommend this movie to all, especially when those inferior features like ""Black Hawk Down"" are currently getting (somewhat unwarranted) praise from this site's reviewers. 8/10."

","SPOILERS<br/><br/>This sits right behind `The Godfather' as my all time favorite movie. Actually I have probably watched this film more times than any other.  A friend and I had seen this so many times that if one of us quoted a line from it the other would answer with the next part of the script and then we would go on for about 15 minutes verbatim from the dialogue (much to the annoyance of anyone around us).<br/><br/>Though I've never been in combat, I have been in the Army for 17 years and I have a feeling (from knowing my fellow soldiers like I do) that this movie is accurate in portraying combat and the life of the grunt in Vietnam.  And if it is this verite that compels the film, it the acting that keeps it focused.  The supporting cast is tight and the three main players (Sheen, Berenger and Dafoe) are outstanding.  Stone really inspired these men and brought out indelible performances.<br/><br/>The intensity of this work is severe.  It is commensurate with a good horror film that keeps you on the edge of your seat, but in this case the horror is all too real.  Three scenes are particularly nonplusing: the playing of `Tracks of My Tears' in the middle of the film as a clear point in which to delineate the hopelessness of the soldiers; the fulminating village scene culminating in Barnes with the gun to the little girls head and the disconcerted face of Chris as he strains with emotion, wanting to say something; and the incomparable tableau of Elias' death, arms outstretched to the sky as the chopper flies by.  That scene has affected me like few scenes ever have, and it always takes me a few minutes to recover from it. It is one of the most powerful film moments I have ever seen. And Stone's choice of `Aidiago For Strings' for the background music was very perceptive.<br/><br/>The only question I have about the movie is the ending.  I can't praise it or condemn it.  I suppose that it is realistic, but it seems to lessen the humanity of Chris especially considering his final words about going from this point to make a better world.  It just seems like such a great film deserved a better ending but, as I cannot come up with one myself, I'll keep my criticism low.  <br/><br/>A quick side note: I met Corey Glover who played `Francis' (the guy who stabs himself in the leg at the end in order to go home) in Stuttgart Germany.  He was the lead singer for the band `Living Colour' (they had a hit with the song `Cult of Personality') and they were playing a club there. He was very cordial and talkative.  I didn't realize at the time that he had even been in the film until I watched it for a second time on video and noticed his name."

Whereas there is no argument as to whether Stone is an excellent director, or that the cinematography is spot on and the principal actors  especially Charlie Sheen  play their rôles acceptably well, this bellicous drama more or less redeems itself as being a historical documentary rather than a film made for entertainment in the cinema  or on TV. One tends to tire of so many war films; however Oliver Stone does strike a chord, albeit only in a remorseful sense, and we have to remember that the cinema must also reflect human conditions at any given moment. Unfortunately Viet Nam's war existed, and somebody had to tell it. In the space of three years Stone turned from a war story-teller to a definite anti-war activist between these two films mentioned. I would rather like to see his `Heaven & Earth' (1993) in order to see where his thinking has led.<br/><br/>Stone does not stop short of showing all the ugliness and horror of war: he positively bombards us with it. There is nothing subtle. Indeed, it seems that such ingredients, together with assassinations and attempted murders of presidents, are the staple diet of his fetishness. `Platoon' is a visual impact that simply leaves you reeling; but from there to considering it a `great film' there is a great void.<br/><br/>Far more useful as a deployment of evoked sympathies over the Viet Nam war is `Casualties of War', directed by Brian de Palma and with Thuy Thu Le's soul-destroying peasant girl. <br/><br/>As far as the war in Viet Nam and films related to it are concerned, I have had enough. Hopefully we will not, in years to come, get more of this medicine in the form of Afghanistan .. bin Laden . Lebanon  Hezbollah  Iraq"

I don't veer towards war films, especially about 'Nam but like I said, I saw it for the sake of Berenger. He was compellingly 'evil' but it's understandable why. It's also understandable why many who return from war are apt to relive their worst nightmares from over there & end up in prison or just continually violent throughout their lives.

One is Sergeant Barnes as ""our Captain Ahab"" leading the platoon on a doomed mission into the hell of the wartime jungle. The other is Sergeant Elias as a Christ figure.<br/><br/>The battle is for the soul of the naive Chris Taylor. Chris goes through the classic American journey of initiation into evil. The events are harrowing and the film leaves the viewer stunned by the savagery that human being can create. The film can also leave the viewer enlightened about the potential for goodness in human beings."

","This movie was amazing.  Platoon was one of the first DVD's I bought when I bought my DVD player and I was not disappointed.  Watching it the first time was mind blowing.  Each character is so real and each scene beautifully shot that by the end of the movie you are left is awe staring blankly at the screen...of course the first thing you do after that is watch it again. One of my favourite movies of all time."
"martymaster","Null","0","1","19 August 2001"," Maybe the best war movie ever made.
","One of the reasons why this is a great movie,is because Oliver Stone directed it,and the fact that almost all of his movies are great.<br/><br/>This movie describes the Vietnam war much better than other movies in the way that we see everything that happens to a young boy (Charlie Sheen),from the day he gets there and till he leaves. It shows how innocent people are killed and that the americans are wiling to do everything to win the war. The american generals send their men into a certain death.<br/><br/>
The battles scenes are very realistic and explicit and this movie is not for people who cant handle violence.<br/><br/>This movie has so many famous actors that it was doomed to be a hit.Among the actors are,Tom Berenger,Willem Dafoe,Charlie Sheen,Forest Whitaker,Francesco Quinn,John C. McGinley and  Johnny Depp.<br/><br/>
So if you are a fan of war movies and want a realistic view into the Vietnam war the go rent this one."
"Skullbussa","Null","0","1","4 August 2001"," Does not live up to its reputation...
","I put off seeing this film, despite being an Oliver Stone fan, after getting more than my fill of Vietnam war movies. 15 years after its theatrical release, I had the chance to catch it for the first time on the special edition DVD (an excellent disc, btw).<br/><br/>My reaction?<br/><br/>This film has aged very poorly. Either that or it wasn't much good to begin with. I noticed that almost all the situations are hackneyed (young, innocent solider getting killed without any reason, the Southern ""good old boys"" as war mongers, the immoral murder of simple villagers, etc).  The dialogue is flat. Charlie Sheen is, as always, absolutely horrible. It is embarassing to see him up on the screen with such talented actors as Tom Berenger and Willem Dafoe. He is just absolutely out of his league. Johnny Depp is given a tiny supporting role when Stone should have given him the Sheen part...Depp being the (much) superior actor.  In fact, we spend way too much time with Sheen and not enough with Forrest Whitaker, Depp, and Keith David.<br/><br/>As others have commented, this isn't a narrative but a collection of individual scenarios that Stone has put together. Unfortunately, most of these scene are present in other films and done much better (Full Metal Jacket).<br/><br/>The lines that Stone draws between the ""good guys"" and the ""bad guys"" is absolutely ridiculous: the bad guys are generally racist Southerners and the good guys are enlightened potheads. They're about as two dimensional as you'd expect from a war movie.<br/><br/>If you want to see a great war movie, skip this one. Full Metal Jacket and The Thin Red Line are more raw and engaging than this film will ever be.  To be perfectly honest, the documentary included on the special edition DVD is much, much more interesting than the movie itself.<br/><br/>One final note: Tom Berenger holds his own against Dafoe, Whitaker, and Depp. I am very curious as to why his career never took off as those others did. He controls every scene he is in and this viewer was hanging on every line that he delievered.  What a shame he is stuck doing garbage like ""The Substitute""...."
"dotmic","Null","0","1","29 July 2001"," The truth about Vietnam
","It is odd, isn't it, that the most realistic war movie about Vietnam was made by Oliver Stone. Stone gave us his ""theory"" movies about the presidency of Richard Nixon and the assassination of John F. Kennedy. But it is ""Platoon"" that most vividly shows us the reality of the Vietnam War. It is based on Stone's personal experience and that perhaps is why it was so much easier to stick to the facts in this account, rather than try to fill in huge gaps with mere guesses as he did in ""Nixon"" and ""JFK"". (Just so you will know, I like both of those films but too many people view them as Gospel truth rather than one man's take on what MIGHT possibly have happened. <br/><br/>In Platoon we are carried through a private's personal tour of duty from start to finish. His name is Chris and his story is based loosely on the director's own experiences. Chris and his Platoon are soon torn between two points of view between conflicting leaders. Sgt. Barnes is tied to the code of following the orders of superiors. Barnes doesn't believe in questioning (as long as he is not the one doing it), much less out and out not obeying orders from a superior officer. That is the machine and as Barnes says ""if the machine breaks down we break down."" Sgt. Elias is more of a diplomat and steps in when Barnes takes things into his own hands and disobeys the rules of humanity. Barnes is still intent on winning the war. Elias has given up hope and sees his job as trying to get out alive and take as many as he can from his Platoon back home with him. Killing for survival is allowed, but killing for revenge or for advantage is no longer a part of the war for him.<br/><br/>Chris ultimately has to choose which one of these voices he will listen to. There are times when Chris seems very much in agreement with Barnes and there are other times when Elias shines through his actions. It is this conflict for Chris' soul that drives this film to its final climax. Who Chris ultimately sides with may not even be clearly answered. Remember actions speak louder than words. <br/><br/>Aside from the characters themselves Platoon clearly demonstrates that most Americans who died in Vietnam were viewed as expendable human beings whose worth back home was not much. The American government sent these men over there to fight the government's war. Of course if you were in college you didn't have to fight and where do you think the government official's kids were? <br/><br/>Stone does a great job in not letting us know exactly what the soldiers were trying to accomplish. This took away our ability to see some ultimate goal in this mishmash of gunfire and explosives. Instead we are allowed to understand the fear of moving in one direction or another. Platoon does not glorify war in the least, but let's us view the hell that it is.<br/><br/>
There are some who went to Vietnam who did not like this movie because it shows alot of the ugliness of the American soldier's relationship with Vietnamese civilians. I think it is safe to say that village annihilation did not happen all the time. I do think it happened more than we would like to admit. Were innocent people killed in Vietnam? Yes. Were children and women killed by inhumane American soldiers? Yes. Give Stone credit for not trying to sugar coat this at all, but presenting it with all its ugliness. If anything this movie has promoted healing as many of us who did not serve can at least have some way of understanding the hell that the vets went through. <br/><br/>This picture deserved every award and accolade it got and is a must for anyone who is interested in knowing more about Vietnam. If you liked this film I highly recommend ""Born on the Fourth of July"", Stone's work that deals with the return from Vietnam."
"HomieG","10","0","1","24 July 2001"," Best portrayal of Vietnam War ever made.
","""Apocalypse Now"" and ""The Deer Hunter"" come close, but ""Platoon"" is the best Vietnam war movie made bar none.  Oliver Stone's supposedly autobiographical account of two sergeants, Elias (Willem Dafoe) and Barnes (Tom Berenger), who fight over seemingly everything, is moving and has many memorable scenes throughout the movie.  Charlie Sheen is a man who foolishly offers to join the army without being drafted and pays dearly for his mistake.  Sheen, Dafoe, Berenger, and many others give great performances that give the movie a horrific feel.  If you look closely, you can actually see Oliver Stone make a cameo near the end of the film as a general that gets blown up by a kamikaze Vietcong Soldier with a bomb on his back.  Very good film - 10/10."
"cocaine_rodeo","Null","0","1","18 July 2001"," My Favorite War Film
","Platoon is my favorite war movie and my 6th favorite movie. Oliver Stone has created the perfect surrounding for frightened and inexperienced soldiers.<br/><br/> Charlie Sheen has not been in a better movie since. I don't know what it was like in Vietnam, and I'm sure that the terror of all those hundreds of thousands of soldiers would not be able to compare to any movie, but I think Platoon came as close as any movie could get.<br/><br/> Willem Defoe dose a great job as Sergeant Elias, but Tom Berenger stole the show as the cold Sergeant Barnes. <br/><br/> The destruction of the small village was almost too hard to watch, and the final battle was intense as well as magnificent. Platoon deserves all the credit it has gotten over the years, and it will become a movie classic. 10/10"
"will-54","10","0","1","8 July 2001"," Quite simply one of the greatest war films ever made.
","This 'staggering study of war', this accurate picture of the Vietnam war, this brilliantly acted and powerful film rightly won best picture of 1986. The film is based on Oliver Stone's own experiences in the Vietnam war, and this makes the film as real as an actual true story. The story is seen through the eyes of Chris Taylor, a young middle class volunteer who was at the begining of the film, unaware of the things he would go through. Chris Taylor joined the 'Grunts' in this gruelling war to follow the family tradition, his Grandfather in the First world war and his Father in the Second, but he quickly realised that there was no such thing as fighting and dying with honour, just fighting and dying with pain and fear. He had to watch war crimes that he could not stop nor ignor. While Tom Berenger and Willem Dafoe provide stunning performances, the suporting cast show chilling cruelty not only to each other but primarily to the Vietnamese villagers. In a war of this kind the tagline is very true, 'The first casualty of war is innocence'. I also strongly respect people who realise that the Americans weren't always the heros. In this film, no-one was a hero, both sides comitted terrible atrocities and had their innocence lost. In my opinion, Oliver Stone's 'Platoon' is quite simply one of the greatest war films ever made."
"motorcrow","10","0","1","7 July 2001"," Platoon is all you want to know about Vietnam.
","Let's start before I see this movie I have seen others movies about Vietnam like The Deer Hunter,Casualties Of War,Apocalypse Now....etc from the bunch the best was Apocalypse Now and in a distant second was Casualties Of War because The Deer Hunter was good but it has no reality.Then I see this movie about Vietnam called Platoon and this was one of the best,I like everything the realism,the action,the drama,the suspense between who was to be killed everything now I had Apocalypse Now and Platoon in a tied number one."
"Cardassian","Null","0","1","6 January 2001"," Forget Private Ryan, this is how it's done
","I was dismayed to see that Saving Private Ryan is way up on the IMDB top 250 films list.  Platoon is in a different league and belongs way above that piece of schmaltz.  There are 3 awesome Vietnam films in my opinion - Platoon, The Killing Fields and The Deer Hunter.  All show different aspects of that terrible conflict.  <br/><br/>Platoon puts across what it must have been like to be an American GI, living one day at a time, not knowing what on earth you are fighting for. Berenger, Sheen and Dafoe make very effective leading players and Oliver Stone directs with an expert hand.<br/><br/>Brilliant."
"madguy","Null","0","1","11 August 1998"," A man's struggle to survive Nam.
","Wow...  That's the kind of movie that leaves me just staring at the blank screen for ten minutes after the credits have ended, mouth opened.  I mean, that's one of the best movie to show to a guy who would like to sign up for joining the army.  Not that I've ever been to war, but I think this really confronts you to the reality of being a pray in the jungle.  Oliver Stone is a pure genius, and that's all I could say!"
