"MR_Heraclius","6","40","43","24 February 2020"," Ghost Rider
","This demonic Marvel adaptation is visually groundbreaking, no doubt, but is not an easy ride. Ghost Rider's exaggerated tone and dialogue and hell-driven sequences provides many speed bumps on this less-than-anticipated ride."
"mystywolf","9","237","353","16 February 2007"," Awesome flick if you like some cheesy fun
","First off, I'd like to say that I really enjoyed this movie. I have read a lot of the bad hype that the flick has receieved, and I believe that this is partly due to the fact that people go into these types of movies expecting amazing advances in cinematography as well as a gripping and dramatic plot. Well, I hate to burst everybody's bubble, but that is really not the purpose of this type of movie. These bad reviews make me wonder just how serious you have to be (or just how snobby a critic) going into the theater to hate this type of movie making.<br/><br/>Far be it from me to say that this movie was perfect. It had its flaws and there were times when I found myself snickering at the silliness of it all, but that to me is good entertainment. The scenes where Cage turned into ghost rider for the first time were fairly intense, and I found myself marveling at the coolness of his transformation and powers. I also enjoyed the battle scenes including one involving ghost rider and a helicopter (I won't tell you what happens there, but it is pretty amusing). I also felt that the movie was pretty well-acted overall, and the entire flick maintained an aura of fun throughout (which I believe was the main purpose of the whole thing) while flowing smoothly through a simple plot.<br/><br/>If you are the type of person to over-analyze plots, scrutinize special effects, whine about some cheesy acting or if you get offended when a movie doesn't have a deep and philosophical meaning behind it, this is definitely not a movie you should waste your time or money on.<br/><br/>If, however, you are the type of person who enjoys some good laughs, some over the top (and at times cheesy) comic book acting, cool battle scenes, action and adventure, or if you simply just like to see some guy with a flaming skull, this is worth the 8 bucks to get into a theater seat."
"Blackout2K5","7","338","538","16 February 2007"," Hell of a Ride
","If you go into this movie hoping to see Academy Award caliber acting or a dramatic plot that's going to move you emotionally, then you're going to the wrong movie. However, if you're looking for a movie that's a lot of fun and is going to keep you entertained, then this is exactly what you're looking for.<br/><br/>The visual effects in this movie are, simply put, amazing. Ghost Rider is just one of those movies that's cool to look at. As I said before, the acting sometimes falls a bit flat, but Nicolas Cage does exactly what's expected of him for the role. It's a bit cliché and humorous at times, but this is a movie based on a comic book, so you have to expect that sort of thing.<br/><br/>Sam Elliot and Peter Fonda provide the best acting in the movie, while Wes Bentley does a solid job as Blackheart and Eva Mendez is just a very beautiful actress who fits in well as Roxanne.<br/><br/>There are a lot of little gripes about this movie if you look too hard and overthink it, but as a die-hard Ghost Rider fan, I didn't mind these things so much. It stayed relatively true to the original series, while borrowing elements from the 90's series to help make the movie more visually impressive, which I felt worked really well.<br/><br/>I've been waiting for this movie since they started trying to make it over eight years ago and overall, I'd have to say I really enjoyed seeing my favorite comic book character finally make it onto the big screen.<br/><br/>If you want to go see a movie where you can just sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride; then go see Ghost Rider without any worry of disappointment."
"dfranzen70","1","161","257","23 February 2007"," Hysterically funny
","Ghost Rider is hilarious. Unspeakably, hysterically funny. Sadly, though, it's all unintentional humor. The movie manages to pack in every comic book and action movie cliché imaginable, laughable casting, an illogical script, wooden acting, and jarring direction for straight-faced amusement.<br/><br/>Johnny Blaze is a 17-year-old tyro who works in a circus as part of a daredevil motorcycle act with his father. When he learns his dad's got cancer, Johnny makes a literal deal with the Devil (played by a cardboard cutout of Peter Fonda) to save his dad's life. That lasts about one day, because the next evening Johnny's dad dies during a performance. ""Nooooooooooooo!"" shouts Johnny. Which is kind of what you'll be yelling when you watch the movie.<br/><br/>Johnny has a girl, too, Roxanne. The night before the fateful performance, she tells him she's moving away - her dad, skeptical about Johnny's ability to stay alive in such a dangerous line of work, is sending her to live with her mother. Roxanne informs Johnny of this the very moment he's done carving an elaborate ""Johnny + Roxanne Forever"" mark into a huge, old tree. Apparently she didn't want to ruin his concentration before dropping the bombshell. The two decide to run away together anyway, but then Johnny's pop dies, and Johnny runs off on his own to become the World's Awesomest Motorcycle Dude.<br/><br/>Meanwhile! Elemental angels in league with the Devil's son, Blackheart, are trying to get a contract giving them control over the souls of some long-dead town. With these souls, Blackheart can rule the world, or something. (It's unclear how all of the souls of one tiny town in the middle of nowhere would give anyone the power to rule anything bigger than a hamburger stand.) And, it seems, when Johnny made his deal with the Devil he became the Ghost Rider, responsible for transporting the contracts of souls to the Devil; Blackheart wants to intercept the contract so he can usurp power from his dad.<br/><br/>Fast forward one year later. Yes, one year. Johnny has changed from being 17 to being... Nicolas Cage. Cage is 43 years old. This makes no sense. Oh, and of course he runs into old flame Roxanne, too, now played by Eva Mendes. Or, more accurately, played by Eva Mendes' chest, which is prominently on display whenever possible. Mendes is 32 years old. She is, ostensibly, playing an 18 year old. Even more amusingly, Roxanne is now a television reporter. At 18, it's more likely she'd be assistant gopher to the producer. Ever the professional, even when on the air Roxanne wears low-cut tops, the better to distract the viewer from her inane questions.<br/><br/>One gets the impression that Cage signed on to this role merely because he sports a Ghost Rider tattoo, which, ironically, had to be covered up for the movie. It's kind of as if Jerry Seinfeld were tapped to play Superman. You get all of Cage's mannerisms - the tics, the hangdog expression, the mouth-agape gaze, the laconic attitude. Not really what you expect from a comic-book hero. Mendes is fun to look at, but her delivery is paradoxically flat. Rounding out the cast are a couple of old timers - Sam Elliot plays Caretaker, a wily old coot as only Sam Elliot could play him. Elliot's a fantastic actor, and he's a much better fit for his role here than anyone else in this sludgy claptrap, but he can't save the movie. He's not even on screen until around the halfway point of the movie. Peter Fonda, looking weathered and sort of beaten-down, is The Devil; he's sort of aloof and unconvincing. Oh yeah, and Wes Bentley, who once was in American Beauty, is Blackheart, sans Joan Jett. Geez, they could have gotten any gothy-looking nitwit to play this role, it was so over-the-top. Bentley does not make a good villain.<br/><br/>Let's be clear here. This isn't supposed to be a funny movie. It's a straightfaced, comic-book tale of a haunted young man. And yet the movie's so ineptly presented, one can't help but laugh. Questions abound: Why does Ghost Rider not even show up until a good way into the movie? Why are we told Johnny's jumping 300 feet (a football field) when the distance is longer than that (360 feet)? Why, when Johnny asks the Devil if he's the one responsible for keeping Johnny alive through all his death-defying feats, does the Devil say, ""No, that was all you, Johnny""? (Was it? If you're the Devil and you NEED this guy to be your Ghost Rider, and your guy is in a line of work in which he's constantly in harm's way, wouldn't you help him so he doesn't, you know, die?) When Johnny stops his cycle on a busy freeway so he can chat with Roxanne, blocking traffic, how come no one drives around his bike and her van? There are two lanes. Why, if Blackheart's a supernatural (and presumably immortal) being, does Caretaker toss Johnny a kick-ass shotgun with which to attack Blackheart? Why is the church where Caretaker lives and works sacred, hallowed ground that Blackheart cannot trod upon, but other churches - including the one in the tiny, middle-of-nowhere village - are not? Why, when Ghost Rider races through the city one night, inadvertently causing destruction, does exactly one car flip up and smash into a window, despite there being dozens of other vehicles around it? How come Ghost Rider can be hurt if you stab him in the shoulder blade, but you can't wound him by shooting him? (Some of these questions may have actual answers, but I didn't get them from the movie.)<br/><br/>So the movie's pretty much useless, and in a week or so we'll have forgotten it ever existed. It's poorly acted, directed, and written and offers little in the way of solid entertainment - unless, of course, you're looking for some unintentional laughs."
"Merklin","6","119","188","3 March 2007"," Ghostrider is the best thing in it.
","Ghostrider is a brilliantly designed character . The chain ,the bike , the flaming skull for a head -he's just plain cool. In fact hes TOO cool - it seems that in any comic , cartoon or game hes involved with, he always comes out as the most interesting thing.<br/><br/>It works the same way with the movie: seeing ghost rider in action provides almost all of the films entertainment value. Watching him ride down buildings , fight villains and flip the bird to the police is a cool sight to behold. When hes not on screen though ,things aren't that interesting. Nicholas cage is funny and quirky as johnny blaze and eva mendes is impossibly sexy (as per usual)but for the most part its all very cheesy and feels rushed and episodic.Also, the villains are frustratingly lame , including black heart who's severely downgraded from his comic book incarnation.<br/><br/>When sitting through ghostrider , your best bet is to wait for the flaming skullhead to show up- watching him do his thing is tons of fun. Sadly the same cant be said about the rest of the movie.While its not bad it doesn't quite do ghostrider justice . Why ? Because hes TOO cool.........."
"s-lock","8","25","36","28 February 2011"," Nicholas Cage's head skinned and on fire! A must see!
","The idea to do a film of Ghost Rider actually came after Nicholas Cage had his head skinned and his skull set on fire by critics, as a punishment for Knowing. The scenes where Johnny Blaze apparently has Cage's old facial features are the only CGI effects in the entire film.<br/><br/>Seriously though, if you like Marvel comics, and/or superhero films it's a great romp, that doesn't waste a character that could so easily have been wasted by the Hollywood machine. Sure there's a few clichéd set pieces, but there aren't many superhero movies (or Nicholas Cage movies) that don't have them, and fans of the Ghost Rider comics will see all the scenes and set pieces they'll be hankering to see done in a movie."
"michael-connelly3","9","352","622","18 February 2007"," Better Than Critics Think
","Okay, this movie has taken a lot of heat (ohhhh) but in fact, it's good at what it is. You can't criticize a Snickers Bar for not being Creme Brulee. This is not High Art. It's a movie based on a comic book, and it does a great job of bringing that comic book to life, and of keeping the comic book nature of the story intact. This isn't a bad thing-- it is what it is. It's not a chick flick, it's not clever and witty, it's not deep and mysterious. It's a comic book brought to life on the big screen with nice fx and a decent score and appropriate acting. It's fun. It's a hoot. The bad guys are bad, the good guys are good-- and the end isn't a cop out which is nice. If you are not the audience for which this movie is intended, you will not like this film. If you are, you won't be disappointed. Is it as strong a movie as Spiderman? No. But the story isn't as strong either. It is, however, a good yarn, something my kids liked-- something I liked, and I'm not even a comic book guy."
"w00f","7","207","369","18 February 2007"," Somewhere Between X-Men and Spiderman
","There won't be any Academy Awards for ""Ghost Rider,"" and deservedly so. Great cinema it ain't. It is fun stuff, though, and very much in the spirit of the Marvel comic book of the same name. Nicolas Cage works well in the role; his dead-pan humor is well suited to the role of motorcycle stuntman Johnny Blaze, and the scene in which he attempts to explain himself to his long-lost girlfriend is classic stuff, full of awkward pauses and an eyebrow put to good use.<br/><br/>Granted, things get a little melodramatic from time to time, but that's as it should be. This is, after all, a movie based on a comic book hero, and what superhero worth his heat-vision doesn't indulge in a dose of the melodramatic every so often? It comes with the territory. Still, there's a sense of humor at work here, something that didn't play out well in the ""X-Men"" franchise and led to that abysmal third installation. There are a good number of laughs in ""Ghost Rider."" This isn't a movie that takes itself too seriously, which is a nice benefit considering how heavy the subject matter could become. It's rough around the edges, no doubt, and isn't quite up to the same level as the Spiderman movies to date.<br/><br/>I saw an early (11:45 AM) show and the theater was still nearly full. The audience laughed at points that were intended as humorous and even jumped at a couple of scenes. All in all, everyone looked like they were having a good time, from the six year olds with their parents to the older folks like me who were fans of this comic as kids. If you're looking for something fun, ""Ghost Rider"" isn't a bad bet at all."
"elprofessional","7","10","13","11 June 2007"," A fantastic movie to just sit back and enjoy
","If you like movies that just entertain you and blow you away but doesn't has that much of a plot, Ghost rider is the best choice. Although IMO the plot was decent, a man sells his soul to the devil to save his father and is forced to work for the devil to take down demons. The special effects are fantastic, you'll be blown away when he turns into Ghost rider the first time. Although there could have been some more action, but the action was intense and wonderful. This move is great on a Friday or Saturday night. But don't see this movie on a Sunday, wanting a dramatic emotional movie like spider man. This is a movie to entertain, not make you fall in love with. So just sit back and enjoy one of the greatest Marvel movies ever"
"algjgg","8","14","20","16 June 2007"," Enjoyable and one hell of a ride.
","This is yet another comic-book movie that, this time, doesn't dissappoint. It certainly does not. It's definitely one hell of a way to start off the 2007 movie blockbuster list. <br/><br/>Ghost Rider had high expectations of showing off a new side to comicbook based movies: horror. There are some pretty cool horror moments, especially involving Blackheart. When Johnny Blaze turns into Ghost Rider for the first time, it scared me not only by the look of his eyes, but how frighteningly realistic it looked as well. <br/><br/>That brings me to another point: visual effects. They're a lot better than your average comicbook visual effects. When Blackheart's face turns into his more demonic-looking face, it looked so REAL.<br/><br/>There were a lot of amazing things about this movie that caught my attention, but like every comicbook based movie, there has to be something bad about it as well.<br/><br/>First, the GOOD things:<br/><br/>1: visual effects were off the chart in Ghost Rider. They all looked extraordinarily real, including Johnny's first ever transformation into Ghost Rider. Other nominees include Blacheart's demonic face, and especially Gressil's sand transformation.<br/><br/>2: Most of the acting was well put and directed quite well. Nicholas Cage isn't the best Ghost Rider, but Ben Affleck sure as hell isn't the best Daredevil. Cage still stayed true to the role. Eva Mendes and Roxxanne Simpson was OK. It wasn't the perfect acting, but it worked for me. Last, but CERTAINLY NOT least, is Wes Bently as Blackheart. There was something about Bently that made me believe Blackheart was actually real, that it was the actual Blackheart acting as himself. To me, his best line had to be ""He sent you to bring me back. Well I'm not going back!! I LIKE IT HERE!!!"". Thanks to the voice sycncronizers, this wouldn't have been possible. He definitely brought the character to life, and thats why he is the best actor in this movie.<br/><br/>3: Electronic guitars and drums in a original soundtrack: INSANE!!<br/><br/>Now, unfortunately, the BAD things:<br/><br/>1: One thing that kept bothering me throughout the movie was Cage's acting. Some of it was OK, while most of it made me feel like I was watching a mix of Saturday Night Live/Soup Opera. I think the cheesiest line was when he told Roxxanne who he really is. Was he mumbling? Was he trying to exagorate? I'll never understand it.<br/><br/>2: Now in most action/superhero movies, there has to be some form of side villain. In all three Blade movies, you got Quinn, Reinhardt, and Triple H. Now in Ghost Rider, we have three fallen angels: Gressil, Wallow, and Abigor. All represent an element of earth. Do they provide a challenge for Ghost Rider? NO. They're OK, but each one had little screen time, and they were all unfocused to a point where we didn't really understand them that much. <br/><br/>3: Now not that this isn't important, but isn't this movie TOO scary for little 12 year old kids? When I saw Ghost Rider in theaters, some 11-12 year old kid screamed and cried when Blackheart was walking out in the desert and put his face to the camera to show his demon face!! And he was siting in the very first row, right by the screen!! I got a look at this kid and he had to be around 12 years old. Embarrassing. <br/><br/>Ghost Rider is as amazing and breathtaking as any other Marvel/DC Comic movie. It ain't perfect, but it doesn't mean to be. It totally beats the failure of Daredevil and Elektra, but doesn't beat the perfection of Spiderman and Batman."
"vivianlabertew","4","116","214","23 May 2007"," So bad...
","Oh where to begin. How could they screw up a movie with a premise like this.<br/><br/>The acting and the dialogue was awful even with actors like Cage and Peter Fonda delivering them, and the set up was rushed, like most of the rest of the movie. The FX ranged from OK to GOOD with the first transformation scene of Blaze to Ghost Rider being pretty well done but every change from there on in is in cheap and nasty morphovision and the morphing motorcycle looked stupid even if the flaming bike itself looked cool. The bad guys were non-entities and although they were supposed to be really powerful etc they don't do anything threatening through most of the movie and Ghost Rider eventually offs them with ridiculous ease, even the main dude at the end.<br/><br/>Honestly this movie has so many clichés you'll be bored less than half way in and after waiting about 30 minutes for Ghost Rider to appear you just want him to get off the screen straight away since apart from looking cool he comes across as a complete dork and his dialogue consists of really bad corny one liners. Every time he comes on screen you just hope to hell he doesn't say anything and when he does you'll be so embarrassed for the poor bloke.<br/><br/>Go get the comics instead."
"michaelbatroni","10","97","177","11 February 2007"," A Great Time
","I got to see Ghost Rider at a sneak recently in Los Angeles and I was pleasantly surprised. Johnson has said in his interviews that he didn't believe in taking it too seriously and I think that was the right way to go because the film is a lot of fun. It balances humor and horror and adventure in a way that I haven't seen since Army of Darkness, the 3rd in the Evil Dead Trilogy. Nicolas Cage is hilarious. He has a face that is like a silent movie actors and I kept thinking about movies like Nosferatu or Phantom of the Opera. He's been waiting for years to play this role and you can really feel how much fun he's having just going crazy, especially in the first scene when Johnny Blaze turns into the Ghost Rider. The movie just borders on the edge of campy but always manages to pull itself back before going to far. And Sam Elliott. It's got Sam Elliot. What more could you ask for?"
"MistyMovies","10","24","38","17 February 2007"," Absolutely loved this movie
","I am still in awe of this movie. There are scenes that will make you go ""how did they do that?"" and some scenes that are just cool. At the beginning when Johnny Blaze first figures out his powers / curse as the GhostRider he lays both hands on his motorcycle and it begins to transform itself into a really cool bike.... Almost like it goes to 'just bones' which is the point. There are a lot of cool action scenes in the movie but the best part is that there is actually a good storyline as well!!!! I was not very happy with the fact that he doesn't end up with the girl, but at least we know that she does love him and he loves her, so that's something! I am very impressed. Also Nicolas Cage is one of my favorite actors!!!"
"robjob2","8","14","21","26 February 2007"," the tribute to easy rider
","I loved this movie...mainly because I love motorcycles and the forces of good and evil battling with each other. Ghostrider is a super entertaining movie, good action, thrilling rides, cool villains, I loved this movie. I especially liked the following that I noticed. I may be dating myself a little here but the not so subtle homage to Easy Rider was definitely there and appreciated...not only was the devil played by Captain America himself, Peter Fonda, but Johnny Blaze's regular chopper is a blend of the most notable motorcycles in bike history, the Captain America and Billy bikes from Easy Rider. The characters and the special effects are good enough to keep you watching, the acting is all as good as you would expect for this type of movie. Love Sam Elliot...this guy always plays a cool western type character...I think he must be this way in real life as well."
"fredericksmith1952","7","10","14","23 February 2012"," While not the best adaptation of a comic book (graphic novel if you prefer) to the screen...
","I remember watching this film the first time and thinking it was just a lot of special effects without a lot of plot. Then I watched it a second time, and started to realize you have to really pay attention to the details to get the story. While not the best adaptation of a comic book (graphic novel if you prefer) to the screen, the special effects are awesome and the photography is Oscar worthy. Cage is Cage, that stoic actor who seems somehow devoid of emotion in most of his films. Mendez is hot, goes without saying, and equals Cage's level of emotion. Sam Elliot and Peter Fonda are the saving graces of the film, both adding a dimension of emotion lacking in the main characters. The prelude scenes of young Johnny and Roxanne are somewhat necessary, but could have been trimmed down to include more footage of the Ghost Rider and his missions. I haven't seen the newest film, just released at this writing, but hopefully the characters have been ""fleshed out"" and the plot concentrates more on the present than the past. With Cage being the only holdover for the new movie, perhaps the new directors can up the game a bit. The original film is rated PG-13 for violence and language, but nothing the teens haven't seen in their video games. Collectible? If you are a Marvel fan like I am, probably. As as classic film? No way. But entertaining."
"FosterBreadford","Null","101","193","28 April 2007"," It angered me it was so bad
","I am a Nicolas Cage fan. I love all his comedies and think his serious ones are okay. After seeing the Wicker Man, I lost my respect for Cage in serious films, and went to see Ghost Rider thinking it would be an average movie, but probably easy to make fun of. It was bad. . . very bad. It was funny at times, I will admit that, but Cage just is bad in the role, the story is not very complex and has many plot holes in it. You know it is bad when you go into a movie only wanting to make fun of it and coming out just depressed because it was SO bad. In short, don't see this movie, if you want a superhero movie done right, see Batman Begins or Unbreakable, or basically, any other superhero movie was better than Ghost Rider. Thumbs extremely far down"

","Thought it was a fine movie based on a comic book. Never read the comics so didn't have preconceived notions about it. There will be no Oscar nominations from it (wink wink) but who wants that in a movie such as this. I wanted to be entertained and was. My kids also loved it. I've read reviews saying the movie was cheesy and it was, but really so has every movie based on a comic book. That's kind of what I<br/><br/>enjoy about them. I very much recommend this for people that aren't going to take it seriously. If you want that go rent ""The Piano"" or something. Want to have some fun with the kids...have a good time with this one. Had some scary moments so use your own judgment if your kids can handle it.

"kankawin25013","8","5","6","14 March 2009"," Very good as action-hero movie!
","I accepted that I never knew about ""Ghost Rider"" comic books before I heard about its movie. The movie made me knew about the comic. I had a chance to look up the information about the comic when I watched the movie which I could received many interested topic for the comment.<br/><br/>In my opinion, this is a very good action-hero movie. Maybe some comic books' fans could disappoint or dislike the movie due to it made them feel corny to their comic. However, for my comment, everything is very good. The cast, plot, action scenes and special effects make this movie great to follow. I believed the many fans who never read the comic books or have the little information about it could like the movie, it made everyone very funny. Nevertheless, I have some issue with make me a little disappointment.<br/><br/>First, from the climax scenes. Killing Blackheart with the ""Penance Stance"" by the Ghost Rider was very stupid. Everyone could know that when the Ghost Rider tried to kill Blackheart first with the Penance Stance, it was failed because Blackheart had no soul. (he was the pure evil like his father, Memphistos, so the Penance Stance was not able to effect with the evil with no soul.) However, when Blackheart absorbed the 1,000 souls to make him ""Legion"", he could be killed with the Penance Stance later. Err.... I have to say that this scene made the Blackheart looked foolish! Did his father taught him about the logic? Why you upgraded your power only to be killed by the Ghost Rider? Ha! that's idiot.<br/><br/>Furthermore, I had some doubt at first when I heard that Nicholas Cage would receive the role as Johnny Blaze. (Ghost Rider as well) Many movie viewers could believed some fact about the action-hero movie, the newcomer actor/actress in the hero/heroine role could made the movie huge successful more than the abundantly well-known superstar (For example, Christopher Reeve and Toby Maquire could made the dominant successful with their ""Superman"" and ""Spider-man"" respectively). So from the fact, I had the question with Nicholas Cage and the film's crew that did Cage could fit his role as the Ghost Rider? and did it looked freak for using the biggest star as the hero? However, when I watched the entire movie, I agree that Nicholas Cage could fit his role but it still fey. After all, it didn't make this movie no interesting.<br/><br/>For conclusion, the movie is very good. Everything is rational, except the climax scene liked my previous issue. But this is only comment from the viewer guy who didn't read any Ghost Rider series' comic books, so some fans maybe had different comment from me."
"SonicStuart","8","5","6","11 October 2008"," A Great Thrill Ride
","Ghost Rider<br/><br/>Starring: Nicolas Cage, Eva Mendes, Peter Fonda, Wes Bentley, Donal Logue and Sam Elliot<br/><br/>Genre: Action/Fantasy/Drama/Thriller<br/><br/>Rated: PG-13<br/><br/>Ghost Rider is just one of those movies where you don't have to take it so seriously in order to like it. This movie is almost like the Blade movies in terms of how Ghost Rider fights evil that's from hell but this is way better than Blade. So anyway, Nicolas Cage plays the wild stunt biker, Johnny Blaze who makes a deal to Mephistopheles (Peter Fonda) in order to save his father and in return has to forget about his life and his love, Roxanne Simpson (Eva Mendes). A few years later, Johnny's path crosses again with Mephistopheles to give up his soul to have Johnny become the fiery bounty hunter of hell, Ghost Rider in order to take down Blackheart (Wes Bentley), a son and enemy of Mephistopheles. Nicolas Cage did a great job playing Ghost Rider and of course it's always nice to see Eva Mendes on screen of course. The only thing that I didn't like about this movie is how they decided to put in a villain who turned out to be an easy defeat instead of picking one that would be more of a challenge but then again it's an origin movie so everything has to start off easy i guess. But hopefully there will a more challenging villain if they do a Ghost Rider 2. Overall i'd recommend this movie and I hope they do a Ghost Rider 2."

","Well, to start it off, the animatuon for ghost rider looks like the animation you would expect to see in a movie from 10 or 20 years ago, so yeah, the CGI of Ghost Rider is bad considering marvel studios IRON MAN came out one year later, and that GREAT animation. However, the story and villains are interesting, and although it wasn't that big of a success, I'd still recommend marvel and ghost rider fans watching it, and I'm glad Ghost Rider still had a movie. I just wish the MCU would make there own Ghost Rider movie about Robbie from Agents of Sheild, or even Johnny Blaze."

Eva Mendes is hot as ever, Nic Cage does a fantastic job and looks fantastic for a man in his 40's. Sam Elliot was perfect as the Caretaker and Peter Fonda does well also.. Lastly, I don't know what all the negative comments on the CGI was for...I thought it looked pretty damn good myself... anyone who likes comic movies or action movies that are a little darker that spiderman and superman (think Punisher in the sense it is more dark) needs to see this damn movie!!!!"

","I've never read any of the original Ghost Rider comics, so I didn't go into this film with any preconceived notions. I don't know how accurate it is to the original, or how the comedy and action balance out with what has been established in the comics. All I do know is that it was an enjoyable film, and I was thoroughly entertained. Isn't that all a movie is supposed to be? I have highly recommended this film to all of my friends, but I must warn you: if you're not used to horror pictures, this one has a few horror elements, so brace yourself for some unpleasant stuff. Other than that, the action was exciting, the humor was funny and the romance, although a little over the top, was sweet. This film garners a solid 8 out of 10."

","And it was awesome. Seriously, wasn't expecting to have such a good time with it after all the internet bitching. It's a straight on popcorn flick, unabashedly pure fun. Was nice to see something like that after all of the recent academy flicks. Nicolas Cage is back in a big way. He goes totally mental when he changes into the Ghost Rider -- you have to see it! Screaming and laughing while his skin is exploding and burning, it's intense (surprisingly so for a PG13). Sam Elliott is one of my favorite actors and he does an awesome job as well. And Wes BEntley (where has he been?) shows that he remains one of the best actors of his generation. Eva Mendes is hot!!!!! There were so many huge set pieces here -- the biggest one would be a spoiler so I won't give it. But the final fight is awesome, reminded me of Raiders of the Lost Ark with the spirits flying all over the place. Warning to kids thought -- it's scary at times. Pay attention to the rating!"

","I've been a comic book freak for years but just recently started reading the ghost rider series. After reading countless issues, ghost rider has easily became my top favorite comics to read. Then after going to see X-men: the last stand, i saw a preview for this movie..... and i almost freaked out, not because they were making a movie out of one of my favorite comics, but for the fear of how well it would be made. I have been disappointed with many of the last comic movies over the years, but movie this raised my spirits. Sure there were a couple of lame one liners, what comic flick doesn't, but the cgi was really sweet. i really loved this movie but it probably isn't a movie for everyone. Sam Elliot was awesome and Nic Cage was pretty great too (i was worried when i found out they casted him). This is most assuredly going to be a movie that i will have to get."

","I really had a great time watching this film; although i have never been a Ghost Rider Fan, i loved comic books. I had been a Superman fan all my live, but in the comic stores the character of Ghost Rider had some attraction to me, as the non-typical superhero. Now that i saw the movie, i was amazed of the great story behind this guy. A superhero that fight evil of the worst kind!, just great, a combination of a superhero and some horror - type characters; great complement!. It isn't an Oscar worth movie, but is a film to have a good time, is fun, entertaining, with action, and the type of movie that you can see in company with kids. Great special effects and night scenes that put a special charm in the film. Eva Mendes is absolutely beautiful as always!<br/><br/>ABOUT THE MOVIE: Nicolas Cage plays here Johny Blaze, a motorcyclist that used to make dangerous shows with his father Barton Blaze (Brett Cullen), when doctors detected to his father a cancer in his terminal stage, a demon called Mephistopheles (Peter Fonda) offers to save him in change for his soul; Johny do this, but this demon or devil, deceived Johny, when at the next day his father dies on an accident in the show. Johny has his soul sold, and loses his all-life love, Roxanne (Eva Mendes), years later Blaze became a famous motorcyclist, who performed very dangerous shows; with a great team leaded by Mack (Donal Logue) he even jumped over helicopters. Suddenly he meet again with Roxane, but in that moment, Mephistopheles claimed the right for Johny's services, and turn him in a Ghost Rider, one of the servants of the devil that looked at night like a skeleton on fire. Mephistopheles order him to defeat his ""cold"" son Blackheart (Wes Bentley) who wanted to claim the old contract of San Venganza, with the help of other demons that represented the natural elements earth, water and air; this contract was hidden by a previous Rider to the devil, in order to prevent the possession of 1000 souls!. Blackheart threaten to bring hell to earth with these 1000 demons! Here Blaze mission start as an incredible action quest as this new Rider! <br/><br/>7/10, good work of Mark Steven Johnson in another of his hero movies, and a good performance of Cage and great special effects!. Worth to watch!"

","First of all, i'm not someone who bash a film without seeing anything about it or watch a trailer and said, it stinks. But really, this movie blew me away. It gives the viewer everything he want to see. Action, Comedy, great special effects, great one-liners, Eva Mendes hot as usual, and a Nicolas Cage as the main hero. He does his job the good way because he looks like a hero that don't want to be one at first because that's what the Ghost Rider is all about. A anti-hero that will become one! I really hope they will make a sequel and with all the money they make at the box-office, i'm pretty sure we will get one. It's really too bad that it's not this Mark Steven Johnson that directed Spider-Man, which in my view, was pretty bad considered all the hype. Ghost Rider dosen't fail on every levels just like SM did, this movie is what it is, and it's a movie we never thought will see the day because it's not easy to make with all the special effects. And the presence of Wes Bentley as the main villain, Sam Elliott and Peter Fonda as the devil add a lot to this great film full of action and excitement!! I found myself really entertain by the story! I recommend this one!"

"wgeddings","8","21","37","19 February 2007"," More than good enough to see - ignore the bad reviews
","Sometimes, I think critics and such miss the point of a comic book movie. A comic book movie is not about romance, or exploration of self or moral sermons or parodies of real life. Comic books are about imagination and they move fast while taking some things for granted to let you work out on your own. A comic book movie should be similar in my opinion. To me, Spiderman is the best comic book movie of all so I will compare to that a lot. The Dolph Lundgren Punisher (not to be confused with the more recent far superior Thomas Jane Punisher) was one of the worst.<br/><br/>What makes them different? In Spiderman, things happened and people just accepted them and it moved to the next frame. Some wonder but not a lot of long speeches and introspection. Oh, you can shoot webs and stick to buildings, cool. In the DL Punisher, everything had to be discussed and thought out and the motivations pointed out, etc. Leave aside that DL's acting was bad and the other factors, it made for a boring slow story that even the critics hated. Spiderman snapped because it kept moving, made it points and left some things for people to just imagine or figure out on their own. Spend several scenes on making up believe that Uncle Ben loved Peter or just have Peter say it and assume we will take it at face value. You go with making the statement and keeping the movie moving. That is what a comic book would do. They would not spend an issue trying to develop a issue or emotion usually, just say it and then let it be motivation for the real story.<br/><br/>Well, that is a lot of how Ghost Rider (GR) is. Critics complain because too much is just assumed. Johnny Blaze gets bad news about his father yet barely reacts other than going to work on his bike. Johnny makes a deal with the devil and his dad is miraculously healed only to have an accident. It all happens quickly and is more of a matter of fact type situation without prolonged examination about the emotions. That is what it should be! A comic book would keep moving and so should (and does) this movie. No wondering that there is a devil, that the devil wants to make deals, etc. It just is what it is and the story keeps going. Just like a comic book.<br/><br/>Having said all of that, I actually liked this movie. I did not plan to like it but it was a lot like the Thomas Jane Punisher. It was clear, superficial and stayed in line with most of the comic book. Sure, in the comic there is more of the tortured soul but there was just not enough time for that in the movie so they fineesed it. There was a lot of flack about how in the Spiderman movie, Spidey's web was natural whereas in the comic it is a webshooter he made which showcased his incredible science talent. That is an important point in the comics because Spidey relies on his brain as much as his brawn usually but the movie saw that the time it would take to highlight the creation of the webshooter was just not worth the trade-off so ditched it in favor of natural ones. It maintained the crucial part (webshooter) while keeping the story moving and that is what GR does in many points. I would like to have seen more development of how he struggled with the curse, with having to try to gain control of the demon aspect and how if he relies on his power too much, the demon part gains strength but that will hopefully be for a sequel to explore. With so much to cover and only 1 movie to do it, many things have to be glossed over.<br/><br/>The visual effects are not incredible but they are perfectly acceptable. I did not like the thought of Nicholas Cage in the movie but he did fine. There are complaints about Eva Mendes doing poor acting but she was not hired to act in this one. She is eye candy and she does that really well just as the female love interest in a comic book would do. This is not Cannes and this film is not trying for an Oscar or critical acclaim. I would not want to see such a movie anyway. I wanted to see the Ghost Rider like I remembered reading when I was growing up in the 70s. I wanted the cool motorcycle (really a chopper). I got that. I got the visual effects I wanted and the story that made me remember the comic books. I was not inspired to save the world, to protest oil drilling or to volunteer for political duty but that is NOT what a movie like this is about. This is about the wonder of a comic book and the critics seem to be unable to understand that. I have it an 8 out of 10 only because it might have had some better scenes but I feel like I got my money's worth and to me, that is the real merit of any movie.<br/><br/>See this movie if you liked comic books. If you want art, go see Babel or The Queen or whatever and save yourself the frustration but leave the fun mindless movies to those of us who do enjoy them."
"bujinbudoka","10","13","21","19 September 2007"," One hell of a ride
","As far as comic book titles too often the directors or producers try to present the characters in their own vision. This can at times be OK, I mean let's look at the X-Men trilogy, Spiderman trilogy, Hellboy and Daredevil. All were presented in the director's visions while at the same time capturing the feeling of the characters in their respective environments (e.g. Hellboy's color and cinematography were dead on as far as the comic books go, and to me remains one of the best comic to movie translations ever.) Sometimes even making steps to create a certain realism which would pass off as more true to us moviegoers! To me Ghostrider delivers as well as these other flicks.<br/><br/>Ghost Rider is a personal favorite in terms of comic books and novels because of the tragedy which is Johnny Blaze. And Mark Stephen Johnson manages to capture the concept and look, feel and vibe of this great Marvel Character. It even has the feel of an old 70's motorcycle flick! The story revolves around the protagonist Johnny Blaze (Cage) and his life since making a deal to save the life of his father from the ravages of cancer with Mephisto (Fonda). Sticking directly to the comic book and its storyline we move forward many years later where Johnny is now a celebrity biker/stuntman/daredevil and Mephisto comes calling on his end of the deal. He tells him if he will bring down his son Blackheart he can have his life back and their deal will be fulfilled.<br/><br/>Along the way we see Johnny trying to deal with the agonizing pain of losing loved ones (his father and girlfriend played by Eva Mendes.) To me this was a good part Cage played, and the acting while not the best ever was certainly not bad at all. I'll give it a 7 out of 10."

The special effects are awesome. And the motorcycle scenes (especially when it's riding on the skyscraper, as seen in a trailer for 'Ghost Rider') would be great in IMAX. I can't believe they aren't releasing it in IMAX. It would look so cool! I think this movie will be a great hit when it comes out in theaters.

","Ghost Rider tells the story of stunt motorcyclist Johnny Blaze who sold his soul to the Devil as a teenager to save his dying father. When he's an adult the Devil returns to cash in on the deal, telling Johnny that he will become the Ghost Rider, a spirit of vengeance sent to capture anybody who's escaped from hell. His target: Blackheart, the Devil's son, and three elemental demons, Earth, Wind, and Water, who intend to create hell on Earth. As Blaze struggles to gain control of his powers, his childhood sweetheart Roxanne returns, and he's forced to protect her from the evil forces around him. Though not the best comic book movie ever made, this movie was entertaining just like I wanted it to be.<br/><br/>First off, Ghost Rider was never really a top notch Marvel character to begin with. He has a smaller group of fans than someone like Spider-Man or the Hulk, but it's an interesting story and this movie definitely had the potential to be better than a lot of comic book movies. Unfortunately, it ended up just being a fun action film to watch when you've got nothing to do. The story wasn't bad, and the action was a lot of fun. All the Ghost Rider scenes were cool. The best part was his ride up a skyscraper where he lassos a helicopter and tells the pilot that he's pissing him off. What was good about the film was the action, most of the special effects and some of the comedic moments such as Ghost Rider giving the finger to the cops as he escapes them. Now onto the bad. The villains were weak. Mephisto was alright, but he was off to the side most of the time. Blackheart was an underdeveloped villain that didn't really do much. His three demonic henchmen were even worse. Ghost Rider destroyed all three of them within seconds when there could have been a massive battle there. The climax could have been a tad more action packed too, though it was sufficient. The dialogue at times, was brutal. There was no wit or thought put into any of the one liners. For instance, Ghost Rider says to Blackheart ""You're going down!"" and Blackheart hastily replies with an age old classic...""I don't think so."" <br/><br/>The acting was okay. Nicolas Cage did a pretty good job as Ghost Rider, and Peter Fonda wasn't too bad as the Devil. Sam Elliot was average as the Caretaker. The worst acting in the film came from Wes Bentley and especially Eva Mendes. He acts with one tone of voice and one facial expression, she acts like she's in a high school play and it's her first time.<br/><br/>Overall, I wasn't expecting a Spider-Man 3 or a Batman Begins, but I was expecting a fun movie to see on a Saturday night, and I got it. For entertainment purposes, Ghost Rider delivers.<br/><br/>6.5/10"
"rparham","6","29","55","29 May 2007"," Hardly a ""Ghost"" of a chance for quality
","So, let's be honest right up front: Ghost Rider has a somewhat silly premise. Sort of a modern-day homage to Faust, it involves motorcycle stunt rider extraordinaire Johnny Blaze selling his soul to the devil to save his father from cancer, only to have the devil pull a fast one on him (that sneaky devil). The deal Johnny agreed to transforms him into Ghost Rider, the devil's bounty-hunter, who goes two-wheelin' on a motorcycle with flaming tires, complete with flaming skull of his own for a head, whenever he is in the ""presence of evil"". So, yeah, whatever you want to say about men crawling up buildings or people who can heal themselves, Ghost Rider has it beat. So, it's perhaps fitting, although unfortunately so, that Ghost Rider the movie is a somewhat silly affair as well. Hardly bottom-of the-barrel film-making, Ghost Rider can't help but come up a little short of the mark that would allow it to be classified as good.<br/><br/>As with any ""origin story"" comic book film, there is some backstory to Ghost Rider, involving a host of contracts the devil made in a town in the old west named San Venganza. The devil's son, Blackheart (Wes Bentley) has decided to take a vacation from Hell to obtain this contract and use it to conquer Hell, or Earth, or something (the film is a little vague on this point), because this particular contract made these souls apparently a special kind of evil. Well, the devil, known by his traveling name of Mephistopheles (Peter Fonda), isn't quite ready to let sonny boy dethrone him, so he calls in Johnny Blaze (Nicholas Cage) aka Ghost Rider to stop Blackheart and his minions. Johnny is a somewhat reluctant hellish bounty hunter, however, as he is trying to reconnect with former teenage love Roxanne (Eva Mendes) who is now a television news reporter, and find a way to get a second chance after his mistake of taking the devil's deal.<br/><br/>Writer-director Mark Steven Johnson, who last brought Marvel superhero Daredevil to the screen, appropriately realizes that this material doesn't exactly lend itself to a straight faced approach, so Ghost Rider has it's tongue firmly implanted in its cheek. Many scenes involve characters explaining some of the plot to others and appearing to hardly believe it themselves. Bystanders in the film have the appropriate slack-jawed reaction to a guy on a motorcycle with a flaming skull for a head that you could imagine yourself wearing if you were in their same position. However, Johnson makes the mistake of not stopping short of letting the film become borderline camp. In one scene, Ghost Rider gives the middle finger salute, tells cops they are ""Pissing him off"" in another, and features a ridiculous scene in which Johnny, during an interrogation, tells two cops how much he respects their profession and has plans to be a police officer himself once his stunt-riding days are over. There is a degree of self-referential humor that works for this material, but then Ghost Rider just keeps going past the point of light humor into near parody.<br/><br/>Ghost Rider also manages to be fairly lame action movie when the fights between Ghost Rider and Blackheart's henchmen kick in. Those scenes are relatively rote, lacking any excitement and energy, and most of the scenes involving Johnny riding a motorcycle are without any visceral thrill as well. There is also the practically unnecessary love story between Johnny and Roxanne that lacks any chemistry. Why do comic book movies always think they need a romance subplot? The cynical side of me knows it's to provide something of interest to the girlfriends who get dragged to this movie by their significant others, but if the filmmakers are just going to phone it in, they should leave it out. Yeah, he's supposed to be a tragic hero saved by love, but in this case, you don't believe these two are really in love.<br/><br/>Ghost Rider's silliness isn't helped by Nicholas Cage's performance. Cage knows he is working with material that is pretty ridiculous and takes his performance a bit too far over the top. His performance falls into the ""quirky"" category, and while amusing at times, doesn't help save Ghost Rider from being interpreted as a joke. Eva Mendes is just, well, there, as Roxanne, not terrible, but hardly memorable or outstanding. Ghost Rider really comes up short in the villain department. Wes Bentley's Blackheart is a clichéd, one-dimensional villain who doesn't inspire much fear or distaste from the audience. His minions are both silly and non-threatening and may be cause for a few snickers. The only saving grace here is Peter Fonda as the devil. He's not around much, but he is effective.<br/><br/>Ghost Rider would be sunk without decent visual effects, and on this front, the film is reasonably successful. The flaming skull effects are believable (well, as believable as flaming skulls get), and most of the bike-riding while on flames scenes hold up well also. The music score, by horror specialist Christopher Young, also is strong, being something of a fusion of Gothic orchestra, western and hard rock. Unfortunately, these elements can't completely save a screenplay that is wallowing in tired dialogue such as ""You will pay for this!"" or ""Mephistopheles, I knew you would come!"" For $110 million, you would hope that would buy something a little deeper than a guy who just looks really cool with his head on fire."
"tburke85","5","7","10","7 June 2009"," Ghost Rider A Halfway Decent Comic Book Movie
","Ghost Rider is a halfway decent comic book movie brought to the big screen but it's not memorable like Spider-man 2, X-Men United, Batman Begins, or The Dark Knight. The movie isn't all that bad. Ghost Rider is no Elektra, Punisher War Zone, Daredevil, or Spider man 3 but it's not that much better either. Director Mark Steven Johnson does an okay job of bringing Ghost Rider to big screen but the bad outweighs the good in this one. I'll get back to that later. Nicolas Cage whose recent films (The Wicker Man and Bankok Dangerous to name a few) haven't been that great but fortunately in this one he's all right as Johnny Blaze who becomes a hell blazing vigilante with a skull thats covered in flames for a face. Eva Mendes is decent as Johnny's love Roxanne Simpson but she doesn't really get much to do. The rest of the cast are admirable in their roles including Wes Bentley as the devil's son Blackheart, Sam Elliot as a mysterious cemetery caretaker, and Peter Fonda as Satan himself. Donal Logue makes a brief appearance as Johnny's friend Mack and he does a good job with the small part but he like many other characters in the film doesn't have much to do and lacks screen time. Some other flaws with this movie was that the dialogue wasn't the greatest at times, the CGI to create Ghost Rider and his bike looks cool but nothing we haven't seen before, the action/fight sequences are good but none of them stand out and the lack of a central villain. There are about three other villains for Ghost Rider to face besides Bentley and Fonda. The special effects used to create their powers were impressive but none of them are in it long enough to leave an impression. If you're a Nicolas Cage fan you might like this one better than I did because Ghost Rider isn't one of his best movies. No offense to Cage who is a good actor but Ghost Rider overall is a movie that could've been much better than it was."

Also there's the fact that when ever the demons are around lights explode. I don't know why, they just do.<br/><br/>As I touched on above this isn't the best movie in existence, but the critics are just too harsh on it. The acting, for the most part, was accurate to the setting. The soundtrack was good, but I like my re-vamped 80's rock. The special effects were wonderful, and several scenes sent shivers down my spine. Especially when Black Heart... well, never mind. That'd spoil it for you. The plot was very good and well translated onto the screen.<br/><br/>Overall Ghost Riders a decent movie with a nice plot and awesome effects. This is one of those movies where you can go turn your brain off and enjoy. 6.5 out of 10 defiantly gives you a good feel for what to expect. I'd give that in my vote but they won't let me, so I'll round up.<br/><br/>But remember, there's only one way to tell if a movies good or not and that's to see it yourself."
"howellgirl2011","10","9","14","17 January 2011"," Johnny deals with the devil know he gives up everything to serve him but can his girl come back to him before it's too late?
","Best special effects I have ever seen in 2007! This movie was really good I thought that Roxanne would faint when she had first seen Johnny in ghost rider form. But this was a good versus evil film and that is how i like these films, to be a fight between good and evil and to save the girl of your dreams from dying in the hands of the devil's son who is way more eviler than the devil himself. Blackheart was super creepy when I had first watched this film and I thought he sort of liked Roxanne at first, he looked at her like he wanted to kiss her or something. But when he told Johnny to get that contract or he would kill his girl. He looked at her I thought he would run over there and kiss her or something. <br/><br/>I thought the film overall was great and I hope they make a sequel to this film with a bit of action and adventure into the next film. Because I thought that even though that Johnny made a deal with the devil he could have a chance at life and go see his ex-girlfriend, who he still loves dearly, and slow down on his wild life and relax a bit. At the end of the film I thought that Roxanne would go with Johnny anywhere that he would be at. Because I know she still has feelings for him and plus he saved her life and millions of people from dying at the hands of Blackheart(also now called Legion)."

","I have seen worse movies that I can remember, just awful movies. Ghost Rider(GR) is one of these terrible movies, but a little better than the most awful film conceived. It is a boring movie mostly. I did expect it to be corny so I wasn't disappointed or surprised about that. Some of the film is vague in explanation and plot. I understand it is a graphic novel and sometimes this is how they are written. I used to read comics and graphic novels until I lost interest in simple, childish, impractical writing. GR is intended for a younger than adolescent audience or at least seems this way. I also didn't like how some of the characters were introduced and scripted. As far as action goes, it was lacking. Action scenes were short,generic, and boring. It's funny that Nick Cage and the Hispanic chic actually agreed to act in Ghost Rider. If you want to see, see it, spend the money. Don't let any review persuade your decision. I would not recommend Ghost Rider to anyone. There are plenty of other movies worth one's price and time."

"TheWildGoose","5","11","18","6 April 2007"," Plot holes and a poorly written story are slightly ameliorated by special effects and decent visuals.
","Frankly, this movie left me slightly annoyed. I am not speaking as a fan or even a casual reader of the ""Ghost Rider"" comic books (I've never even seen one). I simply felt that the plot was poorly organized, unfocused, and fairly dumb. It wasn't a horrible story, just one that consistently fails to deliver on any of the expectations it creates. It feels almost as if ""Ghost Rider"" was filmed with an unfinished first draft of a script, or that half of the important scenes ended up on the cutting room floor.<br/><br/>The film is also hampered by what appears to be a complete lack of ""rules"" for the operation of the supernatural in the film's world. One minute demons are pronounced unable to walk on ""consecrated ground"", the next minute they're waltzing in and out of churches (this is only one of the most glaring inconsistencies; there are plenty of others). I'm not demanding that a movie depict demons accurately (since I must concede that real demons are probably not very visually interesting), but a little consistency would be nice. As a side note, I am getting a bit tired of movies that depict demons and the like, but don't bother depicting their logical counterparts, such as Angels. If there were no Angels, there could not be any demons.<br/><br/>On the plus side, the movie at least has decent visuals, and the atmosphere is sufficiently interesting to keep one looking at the screen. The special effects are nothing special in this world of CGI wonders, but neither are they laughably stupid. All in all, ""Ghost Rider"" is dull and idiotic, but it does not begin to plumb the depths of true cinematic awfulness (trust me on this one- I own ""The Beast of Yucca Flats"" on DVD). You probably have better things to do with your time, but there are also plenty of worse ways to spend it, I guess."

If this highly visual and somewhat atavistic image gratifies you, then I think you'll be well pleased. I was. If this doesn't appeal to you, then it's a solid actioner with a logical(ish) resolution, and for us baldy guys has the added fantasy quotient of seeing Nick Cage with his hair restored.<br/><br/>The effects are well nigh flawless and I got my value for money. Old Zarathos was done proud.<br/><br/>Most of the acting is OK to solid - Mendes is a bit wooden and I found Bentley bland as Blackheart, but Sam Elliott and Peter Fonda walk through their roles with gusto, and Nick Cage is well, Nick Cage.<br/><br/>Finally not much of a spoiler, I admit, but it was a joy to see a version of the original Ghost Rider!

","Ghost Rider is about stunt man Johnny Blaze (Nicholas Cage) who's father is dying of cancer. When Johnny finds this out that his father Barton Blaze is dying the devil or Mephistopheles (Peter Fonda) visits Johnny and offers his his father's heath for his soul. In the deal the Mephistopheles will leave Johnny alone until he needs him to do his bidding. Johnny excepts and the next morning his father is cured. But Mephistopheles tricked Johnny and during a stunt the next day Johnny's father dies. When Barton dies Johnny leaves the town and his girlfriend Roxanne Simpson (Eva Mendes) behind. When Johnny gets older he becomes a professional stunt man who travels the country doing dangerous stunts on his motorcycle without ever getting injured. When Roxanne comes back into Johnny's life everything changes. When Johnny is about to leave to meet Roxanne odd things start happening and Mephistopheles shows up. Mephistopheles' son Blackheart (Wes Bentley) shows up and wants to create hell on earth. Now Johnny is turned into Ghost Rider and must defeat Blackheart with the help of a cemetery caretaker (Sam Elliott) in order to win back his freedom from Mephistopheles.<br/><br/>Ghost Rider started out slow but eventually got very exciting. Although Ghost Rider was not as good as I had expected I still enjoyed it very much. Ghost Rider had a good story, a cool hero, cool bad guys and a lot of good action. Ghost Rider is not for little kids. Although it has very little swearing it still is very creepy for little kids mostly because of the bad guys and how Ghost Rider kills the bad guys (Ghost Rider makes his victims look into his eyes and see all of the evil they have ever done and makes them feel the pain). All in all the movie was very enjoyable.<br/><br/>Ignore all those elderly people they cannot handle fast paced highly stylized modern films This film is a great effort at excelling in storytelling many older folks won't get it or understand it This is an epitome of greatness for 2007.<br/><br/>If you cannot appreciate quality. Than go back to watching b&w noir films, this is strictly for fans of the series, please refrain from giving 1 star reviews if you didn't fully manage to sit through the film, I feel sorry for those who share hatred towards great films."

So we watched it together and back home, I watched the end. <br/><br/>I remember that at its release, critics were bad and they make fun of Cage's hairstyle (was it a wig?). As a Marvel fan, I add that the character isn't among my favorites and I only know him for being on the cover of the first Wizard magazine. So it's a super hero whose fame is changing and I suppose the movie won't help, even thought I had fun. <br/><br/>The look of the ghost rider is really terrific and there aren't dull moments. I really appreciate the feeling of this road movie in the West and finally, this movie gives an excellent modernization of the western genre: the old town, the lone ranger, the bad guys, the gun fights, the horses. Everything is here but depicted in a new way and it's cool! <br/><br/>Cage is fine with his faustian character on the contrary of Eva Mendes who plays like a tart!

","Caught this on DVD for the first time after avoiding it in the theater and I was pleasantly surprise. I thought the story was pretty good, and the cgi competent on the whole with some very stylish color and looks. (spoiler) Also the final fight was very well visualized with Legion. Nicholas Cage does an decent job in the title role and Eva Mendes plays pretty much herself every time - satisfactorily. I especially enjoyed the 2 main fallen angels who let it go just a bit over-the-top and definitely Sam Elliot who fit his part outstandingly - better supporting actors than leads and that definitely helps. (spoiler) A couple of things they might've changed - raising the difficulty in vanquishing the lesser devils and some parts of the CGI needed cleaning up, but Ghost Rider is actually a stronger comic-book/super-hero movie probably because I knew nothing of the storyline going into it and a fresh story.

In the film, I noticed many terrible elements including the terrifying dictatorship of the Taliban and the fear of the inhabitants of Kabul, the film makes good idea of what he meant to live under the Taliban. The problem is that when you are not directors, is behind a monitor, you can write what you want, reaching even to write untruths. On the Internet everything happens often, most of the films are rejected, not because the films are produced evil but because there are few characters particularly receptive. It must be very insensitive and apathetic to define this film minimalist and reductive, if you do not like the film then you become directors as there attenete word by word to the book.

","Despite having a lack of action and being chock-full of goofs, 'Ghost Rider' is fairly enjoyable and mildly exciting. Yes, there are some definite plot holes, and while the acting isn't the greatest, this movie is good enough to watch a second time; especially when you're just looking for a few laughs, some merrymaking, and a cure for boredom.<br/><br/>'Ghost Rider' contains some *very* nice visuals and an interesting concept: Johnny Blaze, a young man who sells his soul to the devil in order to save his father's life, is forced to become the same devil's bounty hunter--giving up love, friendship, family, and ultimately any chance at a normal life. But with a gracious turn of events, decides to use this disadvantage TO his advantage--by turning his ""curse"" as he calls it--back against Satan, the one who initially created it to begin with.<br/><br/>Though I've read some bad reviews for this movie and some harsh criticism, I *would* recommend 'Ghost Rider' to watch on a Saturday night when you have nothing else to do. All it is, is complete entertainment, pure and simple. No deeper meanings, no hidden agenda involved; and sometimes, that's just the kind of film you need.<br/><br/>6.5/10"

"moviegeek310","6","28","56","17 February 2007"," Ghost Rider is Just Fun Eye Candy
","I went into ""Ghost Rider"" with zero expectations. I was expecting some cornball, cheesy superhero movie like the ""Hulk"". I actually was surprised. It was still cheesy, but in a deliberate way. But how can it not be cheesy when you have a plot like this. It's about as unbelievably as you can get. Johnny Blaze is a motorcycle stunt rider along with his father. But when his father gets cancer, the devil comes along and makes a deal with Johnny. He will cure his father as long as Johnny sells his soul and becomes the next Ghost Rider. So he accepts. Nothing happens until many years later when the devil calls Johnny to bring back the devil's son, who has decided to go behind his father's back and take over the world. Instead, Johnny chooses to fight against both the devil and his son to rid the world forever of their evil. That's the premise, it's quite implausible, and actually, it's downright silly. Especially since the devil is just an old guy in a trench coat, and his son and his friends look like a Gothic, punk rock band. <br/><br/>Even though the plot aspect is stupid, the rest is descent. Usually I'm not a big fan of Nicolas Cage's, but he actually did fairly well as Johnny Blaze/Ghost Rider. He added some intentionally humorous scenes. The action scenes carry the film, and are what earns the positive review. Seeing the Ghost Rider ride his motorcycle up and down skyscrapers while doing battle is pretty sweet. Mostly the visual effects are good as well, but there are some scenes where all you can think is, ""What?!?!"" One scene had Nic Cage in a towel and had CG sculpted abs that looked absolutely horrible. I almost choked on my popcorn. Sam Elliot as Johnny's mentor added a certain grace to the film. He is always brilliant, and always looks like a cowboy with his huge mustache. Ironically, he is a cowboy in this film. Eva Mendes who plays Johnny's girlfriend is really bad. Fortunately, she isn't in the action scenes, so she didn't ruin those. Unlike most Marvel films, this one has some scary visuals that you should probably be aware of before you take your 8 year old along. Just a little caution for you. <br/><br/>Otherwise, this is a great geek-out movie. People who enjoy Marvel movies or comic books are going to adore it, and others will think its garbage, and compare it to ""The Hulk"". I liked it for the most part, but still had my quibbles. ""Ghost Rider"" is mostly just mindless, fun eye-candy. It is Rated PG-13 for horror violence and disturbing images."
"frankdiscussion07","10","27","54","14 February 2007"," A Blast!
","Don't believe the Hate. I am astounded to see so many hating on Nic Cage and this movie. Especially after seeing it the other night. That's right, I actually SAW the movie unlike some of the w*nkers on these boards. If you don't like the movie, that's fine, that's valid. But I'm shocked at how many of these so-called reviewers are writing in after clearly not seeing the film. Blackheart doesn't transform? Scarecrow is a crappy villain? Maybe. But we'll never know since he's not in the film to begin with! The action, as you may already suspect, is full on! Some of the best action and fight scenes that I've ever seen. The audience I saw the film with was way into it -- audible gasps and laughter at all of the appropriate spots. Granted, this was a cast and crew screening for the locals. But in my experience those are usually the worst screenings as everyone is obsessing over their work instead of just enjoying the film. It's a full on roller coaster ride and the kind of movie you can't download or watch on DVD and get the full effect. Sorry, but when I go to the movies I want to be swept away into a fantasy world and that's what the filmmakers have done. Cage (and what IS is with all that hate?) is hilarious -- reminded me of Face Off how big he went and crazy things got. The movie rides the line of camp throughout but never goes too far. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.<br/><br/>p.s. My mate was on 2nd unit for this so props to them!!!"

If you enjoy watching a film for its pure beauty, this movie is for you. Between the camera angles, transitions and scenery; it makes totally worth seeing. People may think that the entire Ghost Rider is CG the entire time, i feel this is not true, he looks to good, or maybe it was just amazing CG. I waited years for this film to come out. Now that it has, i feel that it was well worth the wait. If you don't want to spend so much money to go see a movie, or if you only see one movie a year, make sure this is the movie that you see.

For those who complained about how long it took in the beginning to set things up, keep in mind that if you are not familiar with the character, which the majority of people who will see this movie will not be, this setup was critical. <br/><br/>Yes, the whole thing is pretty hokey but I definitely enjoyed the movie a lot. As usual, the fanboys will nitpick it to death, just like any movie that is made from a comic book or video game. <br/><br/>Some of the acting is a little suspect and some of the lines are cornball, but I thought that added to the comic book flavor of the film. <br/><br/>I thought the special effects were outstanding and especially (possible spoiler for some) when the Ghost Rider came charging up out of the river and went whizzing through the water spraying water and flames in equal amounts. That was fantastic. <br/><br/>This movie is not for everyone obviously but I suspect it will do very well overall and there will probably be more of them if it does."

","It's official! Mark Steven Johnson is the new Joel Schumacher. It took Schumacher two movies to bring the Batman franchise to its knees, and with only two movies, Johnson has already buried two comic book franchises with 2003's Daredevil and this month's Ghost Rider, which arrives in theaters dead-on-arrival; flat-lined, from it's hokey beginning to it's clichéd video game ending.<br/><br/>Nicolas Cage stars as Johnny Blaze, a famous Evil Knievel-esquire stunt performer that sold his soul to Mephistopheles (or Mephisto for short), played by Peter Fonda, in order to save his dying father, stricken with cancer. In a moment of young, naïve, foolishness he signed, with his own blood no less, a life contract to become the devil's bounty hunter; damned to hunt down fallen angels cast out of heaven.<br/><br/>During the day Johnny is normal, but at night, in the presence of evil Johnny's skin burns off and his skull lights aflame with hellfire. His motorcycle transforms into a speed demon able to travel fast enough to melt parking meters and vertically climb up sky scrapers, and in its wake, leaves behind a fiery trail of destruction.<br/><br/>The idea sounds kind of, well cool, actually. Unfortunately the studio  in an attempt to cash in on the Marvel product  limited the film to a PG-13 rating in order to reel in a wider audience:10 and 12-year-old boys, which was a terrible, terrible move.<br/><br/>Instead of a fun and wildly entertaining ride, what we got is one of the worst comic book adaptations to crash land in theaters since Batman & Robin and Catwoman. Yes, it really is THAT bad.<br/><br/>Instead of cranking out another soft and wimpy flick about demons, hell and tortured souls straight from the formulaic, cardboard factory of clichés, what we should have gotten was a fun, dark, R-rated blast more along the lines of Blade or The Crow, heck, even Spawn had more bite and attitude! It seems like Johnson isn't even passionate or interested in telling his own story, and it shows.<br/><br/>The heavily forced and completely uninteresting romance between Johnny Blaze and his long-time love, Roxanne Simpson (played by Eva Mendes) has but not a spark of chemistry. Mendes is given little to do, and does little more than stand around and look pretty as the ""damsel in distress"", whose only real talent is an impressive bust-line.<br/><br/>Nicolas Cage  who is an expressed fan of the Ghost Rider comics  is one of the film's biggest flaws; completely miscast as the macho avenger. Cage is a talented actor when working with the right material (see his performances in the underrated Bringing out the Dead and Matchstick Men), but at the age of 43 (pretending to be 28), and his James Stewart persona of acting just isn't what this particular film calls for.<br/><br/>What it needed was an actor with a hard edge and some grit, someone with the kind of tough-guy presence, like a young Clint Eastwood. Thomas Jane might have made a nice Ghost Rider, and I'm sure if someone like Robert Rodriguez had been working behind the camera we would have gotten that fun, R-rated ride that we should have had to begin with.<br/><br/>The film tries to do many things, and succeeds at nothing. It tries to be humorous, but nothing is funny. The scene in which Johnny tries to explain his night-time dark side to his girlfriend aims to be funny, but all I could think about was the scene in Batman, where Michael Keaton compares his superhero gig as being just another job to Kim Basinger.<br/><br/>Ghost Rider also tries to be scary, but nothing comes close to being frightening, and in the end, after all its constant failures, amounts to little more than boredom. Normally I don't do it, but I was tempted to walk out.<br/><br/>Throughout the film Johnny Blaze talks about deserving a second chance, in order to turn things around, for the better. Cage is an actor who deserves a second chance, especially coming off last year's ""it's so bad, it's good"" remake of The Wicker Man. As for writer/director Mark Steven Johnson, he's had his second chance. This whole comic book movie thing just isn't your game, kid."

","Ghost Rider was always a cool comic book character. So why not make it into a movie? Although this movie had a great financial success, its screenplay is actually quite sloppy. I'm surprised it did so well. I liked Ghost Rider. I liked the visuals, the action, and the villains (a little). But I felt things could have been polished. Mark Steven Johnson who directed and wrote the story for this movie could have done better. <br/><br/>To start off, Nicolas Cage plays as the anti-hero Johnny Blaze/Ghost Rider. I really like the way they made Ghost Rider look in this film. Just like a bat out of hell, his skull is cloaked in flames, his jacket has spikes on it, he has a flame chain, and his bike has a mind of its own! Much of it is fun to watch. Just seeing Ghost Rider for the first time on screen was pretty awesome to see. The action was good too. Any of the sarcastic comments Ghost Rider makes in this film is funny to hear. I even thought the actors who played the villains were good. What destroyed all these good moments, was how the character's dialogs were brought out.<br/><br/>Most of the dialog in this movie is weird, if not awkward. Mostly due to Cage's character, Johnny Blaze. I guess Mark Steven Johnson figured because Blaze lost his soul to the devil, he might as well lose his personality too. If that's the case, it was not a smart choice. It almost seems like Cage AND ONLY Cage is uncomfortable with his character. I know he's a fan of Ghost Rider but it seems like the script was written out of wack for him. There are parts where it seems like Cage is lost in himself and doesn't know what to say next. I don't quite understand that. One other thing I didn't comprehend was that there was way too much ""pointing while zooming up on the face"" business. Was the director trying to make a trademark for himself in this film? Not only is it redundant, it can be very obnoxious.<br/><br/>The other element that does not work here are the villains. I liked the bad guys in this movie. They looked frightening to me when I first saw them. But then I noticed a trend as Ghost Rider had finished one off at a time. None of the bad guys really did anything. Blackheart, the son of the devil, has henchmen who have powers like the characters from Avatar: The Last Airbender, except they don't involve all the martial arts moves. Before Ghost Rider is about to finish one of Blackheart's henchman, we don't even see him use any of his powers. Well that was kind of anti-climactic. Even Blackheart himself barely uses his ""almighty"" powers against Ghost Rider. It's really disappointing to watch.<br/><br/>Besides these parts of the film, I enjoyed Christopher Young's soundtrack. It has a lot of guitar in it and creates a punk tone to the action. Sam Elliot appears in this movie as a minor character, he's always fun to listen too but even he can't make up for the bad screenplay. It's unfortunate because I really like Ghost Rider as a character and was expecting something a little more darker for a dark character.<br/><br/>Ghost Rider will please fans to a point, with its good action and awesome special effects. But nothing can help the film recover from its lazy screenplay, awkward dialog and dull villains."

Nice effects, really nice actually, I especially liked the skull. Good action and a few jokes. Not much to think about, but that is sort of the point. Actually this is a very well made movie with some really nice touches and attention to details. For example see Mephistopheles shadow on the tent in the beginning.<br/><br/>In my opinion clearly better than it's reputation.

","I've read reviews from journalists and viewers both giving this movie a lambasting over the past few days and I saw it last night....and it's nowhere near as bad as they make you believe. In fact, it is quite entertaining if you forget you are a logical adult, and realize the fact that absolutely everything on screen is preposterous because it is meant to be. What I can't understand is that some of the same people who reviewed the HULK movie and canned it for trying to be too cerebral when all they wanted was a smashfest (you know who you are) are pol-axing this movie because it is a mindless smashfest. The Ghost Rider comics, especially the early runs were comic book shlock designed to gratify adolescent boys fantasies and guess what... the movie is exactly that! Some are calling this the worst comic adaptation ever and this is ridiculous when stacked against movies like Batman and Robin, Catwoman and even Howard the Duck. If you want to talk about disappointing adaptations of comic books you need go no further than Spiderman 1! Hardcore Spidey fans were bombarded with 12 months of hype and then treated with a plastic looking Green Goblin, a Spiderman shooting webs from his veins, and hit and miss (mostly miss) special effects. Given Ghost Rider's convoluted origins and different treatments given by a bunch of different writers it's hard to imagine Ghost Rider comic fans seeing too much wrong with this."

","I agree 100% with w00f's previous comments - not Oscar material by any stretch but check your brain at the lobby and go along for the ride.<br/><br/>The bad acting that, it has to be said, is prevalent throughout the movie (especially by Wes Bentley, I feel) can be forgiven if it is taken in the context in which it is intended, i.e a comic book strip. It plays out exactly like a comic book of old with menacing close-ups of the villains eyes and over-exerted facial expressions and cheesy dialogue abounding. Whether this can translate effectively into a movie is still open to debate but for my part, I reckon that the cast and crew have made a fine attempt at carrying it off.<br/><br/>It's a bit slow to start, can be irritating if taken too seriously but is ultimately, viewed with the right attitude, a good fun action movie with some nice effects.<br/><br/>Oh, and did I mention that Eva Mendes is BEYOND fine in this movie...?

"pninson","1","6","9","11 March 2007"," The critics are right
","This was one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. The setup is OK (the ""origin"")but there's no follow-through. The movie is essentially plot less, and the villains are stick figures who are easily dispatched. Wes Bentley, burdened with some awful makeup and tricked up to look like a pasty-faced Elvis impersonator, is given little to do. He is never threatening and our hero (so to speak) has little trouble wrapping things up.<br/><br/>Ghost Rider tries to be funny, with some howlingly bad dialogue (I admit, I laughed most of the way through, which has to count for something), but it's never more than a caricature of itself. Even a comic book movie has to have something for the audience to identify with. Spider Man 2 was a strong picture largely because Alfred Molina's characterization of Doctor Octopus had a human dimension.<br/><br/>Yes, character and story matter even in ""fun"" pictures. There's little to enjoy here other than some visual effects, and that's not worth the price of a movie ticket. I was ready to leave an hour before it ended; it is that boring.<br/><br/>As for the adaptation, I'm not a purist, but there was nothing of what made the comic book exciting (at least in the first couple of years). Gary Friedrich and Mike Ploog, who created the character, put him in a situation in which he was struggling for redemption. There's no sense of any tension between good and evil in the movie; it's just Cage being doggedly Cage-ish and wisecracking his way through a limp, lifeless, by-the-numbers formula picture.<br/><br/>I'd rate this one at the bottom of the heap for the genre. I can forgive lapses in logic and corny dialogue, but just don't bore me. That's all I ask. Ghost Rider darned near put me to sleep."
"tedg","Null","22","45","27 August 2007"," Burned Out
","Superficially, this is yet another mildly interesting Marvel comic turned into an excruciating movie. When will these guys learn? When we stop buying tickets I suppose.<br/><br/>The comic is mildly interesting for the way it targets a certain demographic. As a matter of mere accident, the devil, skulls and motorcycles have become associated with each other. Separately, power and flames. These by themselves, just the symbols alone, are enough to define a life for some people, so strong is the semiotic power they have accumulated. In a sense, this meme is the demon.<br/><br/>The interesting thing about this is how that meme is coming home to cinema.<br/><br/>The modern motorcycle gang was an invention of the movies, pure and simple. The history of the Hells Angels, name, style, leather jackets, even the type of bike (war surplus), is all from movies. (A similar thing had happened earlier with American gangsters emulating their film types.)<br/><br/>Then that meme was colored by Peter Fonda's ""Easy Rider,"" which overlaid an excuse, even a noble one, beyond a simply justified one, on the ""motorcycle culture.""<br/><br/>From that movie manger, this sprung forth into tattooland and eventually into Marvel's marketing department. And now it comes back, Peter Fonda, his Captain America bike and all. The interesting thing is that it is all symbols and no narrative.<br/><br/>That's the danger with comics in the first place that the temptation is to go with icons. The tradition is from stained glass and the role it played when people couldn't be bothered by words. Icons first, generating stories, rather than the way it usually is in film: the two coweaving each other.<br/><br/>So we shouldn't be amazed that this taxi with one wheel goes only in circles. Its dumb, as dumb as the symbols it uses close themselves into.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life."

The actors that portray Nick Cage and Eva Mendes in the opening of this film should probably look elsewhere for a career choice because there acting ability truly shows how bad they are as actors. Now once the film gets going, it picks up with the false feel of nostalgia. Nick Cage, needs to stop. I mean really stop, he shouldn't take himself so seriously, cuz it ain't workin'. Eva Mendes, who is smoking' hot, can't act. And I really can't recall any time when she could. Thats the biggest grief of this film, the acting. Peter Fonda, appears to be smoking' the same stuff that he's been doing since Easy Rider, so he's the same. But in this role he's just stupid. With a line like, ""Far Out"" as his first it truly take you bag to the late sixties and the time when everything and everyone was truly free. Thats why the film gets two stars, and thats it.

"dee.reid","6","17","34","16 February 2007"," A review of ""Ghost Rider""
","In the Marvel Comics pantheon of superheroes, Ghost Rider stands out as one of the more unique personalities in the fact that he is not a mutant (i.e., Spider-Man, X-Men, Daredevil), or a human being at the peak of his physical stature (i.e., The Punisher). No, Ghost Rider receives his unique qualities in the fact that he's a demon, manipulated by the forces of both good and evil for their respective purposes.<br/><br/>Created by writers Roy Thomas, Gary Friedrich and artist Mike Ploog for Marvel Comics in 1972, the title features stunt motorcyclist Johnny Blaze, who finds himself at the disposal of the forces of Hell after selling his soul to the Devil. By day (I love that ""by day"" line), Blaze is pretty much himself: a reckless daredevil motorcyclist who loves to risk his life for the sake of his fans. At night, however, he hops on a revved-up motorcycle, possessed by the demon Zarathos, as the mystical Ghost Rider, to collect souls as a hot-rodding bounty hunter for his boss, Satan. But ultimately, circumstances in the world force the Ghost Rider into acting on the side of good, and trying to find a way to regain his soul.<br/><br/>This would all make for some pretty intense entertainment with philosophical discussions dealing with the matter of choice, but it seems that with this latest comic book adaptation, writer/director Mark Steven Johnson's ""Ghost Rider,"" such themes take a backseat in what is essentially a Hollywood-ized, special effects-laden spectacle that goes many places and savors stylish craftsmanship, but lacks any real substance. I'm not a huge ""Ghost Rider"" fan, but what I do like about him is the fact that he's a demon and not a mutant (like so many others), and that makes him so much different from the rest.<br/><br/>Johnson made a name for himself four years ago when he wrote and directed ""Daredevil"" (2003). The film was initially a box office and critical disappointment, but has found a new afterlife on DVD with a highly praised director's cut that made the Man Without Fear shine in a whole new light. But the problem is ultimately with Johnson's writing, which has imagination and ideas, but lacks substance. I guess this is why ""Ghost Rider"" gets off to a slow start, even with some rather stirring scenes of a young Johnny Blaze working with his dad in a carnival motorcycle stunt show.<br/><br/>When his father is diagnosed with cancer, a stranger offers young Johnny a deal: sell his soul, and in the process spare his father's life. Blaze does so and his father recovers. But an accident takes his father's life, and now Blaze is at the mercy of the stranger, later revealed to be the demon Mephistopheles (Peter Fonda). Mephistopheles states that Blaze is now the mythological Ghost Rider, and will allow Johnny to lead a normal life until he needs him. So Blaze grows up, leaves behind his true love Roxanne Simpson, and goes about on a lifelong journey of waiting for his second chance at redemption.<br/><br/>Now an adult, played by the oddly appealing Nicolas Cage (who is a die-hard Ghost Rider fan and had to have his tattoo covered up for the film), Blaze is continuing his life's mission of stunning the masses. On the side, however, he is still haunted by his father's tragic accident and his deal with Mephistopheles, which as an aside, he reads up on books that could offer clues as to how to break his contract with him.<br/><br/>The main plot of the film gets under way when Mephistopheles's son, Blackheart (Wes Bentley), arrives on Earth seeking to bring about Armageddon. It seems that Blackheart has grown too powerful for his father and wants the Ghost Rider to help him find a hundred-year-old contract that contains the souls of the residents of a condemned desert town. Meanwhile, Blaze's heart goes bing-bing-bing by the sudden arrival of his old flame Roxanne (Eva Mendes), and she has a hard time accepting his life's choices. But Blackheart proves to be a big problem, and Blaze must now assume the identity of the Ghost Rider, flaming skull, chain, hot rod and all, and save the world.<br/><br/>Stan Lee, who frequently pops up in Marvel adaptations, doesn't here (just so you know). As Johnny Blaze, Cage is sufficient, in a role that he obvious loves and sinks his teeth into. You have to admire his attempts at attracting Roxanne by revealing his true identity as the Ghost Rider and having her look at him cross-eyed and recommending psychiatric help. Also, Mendes generates a sense of warmth and provides a nice love interest. Peter Fonda and Wes Bentley both make for decent villains, and even Sam Elliott appears as a former Ghost Rider. But the problem, again, is with Johnson. I just wish that with his next film he leaves the writing to someone else and remains a director.<br/><br/>""Ghost Rider"" may not have shared the potential of something on the magnitude of say a ""Spider-Man"" movie (the preview trailer for ""Spider-Man 3"" was simply excellent, BTW), but it could have been really good on its own accord. I suspect that like Johnson's earlier ""Daredevil,"" a director's cut is probably in the works, with much of the really good stuff that was left on the cutting room floor inserted back into the film. We'll just have to wait and see.<br/><br/>6/10"

This is the best role Cage has had in years. He's much more fun, much more interesting than in other action fare and that's why I think the movie works so well. Story is pretty good, nothing special. Blackheart (Wes Bently) is the son of the Devil and he has escaped from Hell. His father, Mephistopheles (Fonda), uses the Ghost Rider to get him back. Blackheart collects three demons called The Hidden. I don't think he ever anticipated them surviving the Ghost Rider, but instead uses them to keep the Ghost rider busy while he is searching for the Contract. It's a list of names that he thinks will help him to defeat his father and bring about the end of times. There is FANTASTIC action in this movie and anybody who says that the CGI sucks is a moron who doesn't understand anything about visual effects. The effects are amazing and, in fact, could get nominated for an Academy Award next year. Some of the fights are over too quick -- feels like the money ran out to me -- and I would have liked to see more of Sam Elliott in the movie. He's awesome. But all in all, I had a great time.

My expectations may have been a little high, but still the movie was pretty awful. It is the only movie I have ever considered walking out on. It certainly had great potential, but truly the execution was off. Throughout the film bad blocking, very corny lines, and bad editing plagued a great comic movie idea. I think that the editing crew was aware of the failures. It was clear that they sliced out every possible plot transition, but were somehow able to keep the extensive camera time devoted to squished cleavage. Maybe this was to distract most people from the train wreck of a movie they had paid good money to see. Lines were always delivered like a bad high school play. They had the opportunity to save it with a little self mocking--you know Evil Dead style, but apparently, no one recognized how awful the script was even as they said it. What a shame. The director, producer, and even some of the cast deserve a penance stare for the mediocrity they have unleashed upon the world."

","It wasn't that easy to figure out exactly what was going on until Sam Elliot's character explained things 60 percent of the way into the film, but it sure was a fun ride watching it, at any rate. Watching this, I wondered several times how or why a veteran actor like Nicholas Cage (or Elliott) can play these goofy roles. I can't imagine actually immersing oneself in roles like this for several months. No wonder most actors are whacked. Anyway, I like Cage and he's fun to watch, whatever crazy role he plays. He was good in here, and they gave him some excellent lines to deliver.<br/><br/>This movie had a comic-book style for much of it, but then seemed to go more with a horror story, becoming too dark, in my opinion. Then again, my comic book experience goes way back and today's comics apparently are mostly-dark stories. If Marvel Comics have become that dark well, I am sorry that kids can't enjoy some lighter material and still enjoy real ""super heroes."" However, the end of the film espoused some good values, I'll give it that.<br/><br/>Speaking the ending, that was my major complaint. It went on too long. This film, with the fun special-effects that were really ""hot,"" pun intended, would have been far better had it been cut down 20 to 30 minutes. Two hours was too long, as it turned out. <br/><br/>The other complaint would be the acting of Peter Fonda. He had a great role as the Devil but botched it up with one of the most wooden deliveries I've ever heard on film. After all these years, you'd think a little of his father's acting talent would have rubbed off....but not so.<br/><br/>Overall, this turns out to be what a lot of other people thought: better than anticipated in some areas, and worse in others and making the movie as a whole just ""fair."""

","A lot of people don't like it, mostly everyone who I know who has seen it found it mildly entertaining at the very best. Most just straight up hated it and think it's a poor attempt at making what could have been an incredible film. I, on the other hand rather enjoyed it. If you can get to grips with the fact that its about a man who change's into a guy with a flaming skull for a head, and the mildly humorous one liners which make the film extremely cheesy then you should enjoy it. The story line isn't up to much, and the enemies are easily defeated in what can only be described as incredibly stupid ways that make you think, ""What was the point in them?"" With that said, if you go expecting a cheesy, action packed film, which is clearly there to simply entertain you, not like some other films, which set out to lull you into thinking this could actually happen in reality for the duration of the film, then you should enjoy it. Just a few words about the storyline's inability to please many of the films critics. With 'Ghost Rider' not being a highly popular comic in the Marvel chain the story had to be improvised quite a lot. With that being said, the writers have done a fantastic job on the storyline, with plenty of action and plenty of scenes as Johnny Blaze as the Ghost Rider. Nicholas Cage (Johnny Blaze/ Ghost Rider), although not exactly challenged by this role, makes it his own and makes it as realistic as is possible for you to believe his character, who essentially is a man who becomes the Devil's Bounty Hunter by night. Finally, I come to the question is it worth going to see? Well my opinion, which is one of a person who enjoyed the film is yes go and see it on the big screen and then buy it on DVD. I know I'm going to be getting it on DVD at some point in the near future, probably on its release date. Having read this review, it is up to you weather you think it's worth going to see or just waiting for it to come out on DVD. Either way I suggest you watch it to make your own mind up about it. Don't just take the word of the people around you, from this review you should be able to realise weather you will enjoy it or weather it is not for you. Just remember...don't expect a highly intellectual film with outstanding acting performances and an incredibly believable storyline because you will come away disappointed. It is merely, in my opinion, a fun, action packed, COMIC BOOK based film, made to simply entertain."

Years later Johnny Blaze (Nicolas Cage) becomes a famous motorcyclist, who risks his life in his shows, and he meets Roxanne (Eva Mendes) again, now a TV reporter. However, Mephistopheles proposes Johnny to release his contract if he become the ""Ghost Rider"" and defeat his evil son Blackheart (Wes Bentley), who wants to possess one thousand evil souls and transform hell on earth.<br/><br/>The comic book ""Ghost Rider"" is not released in Brazil, but the movie is entertaining and funny, with a good story based on Faust and great special effects. The fight between good and evil has a great cast, with Nicolas Cage, Peter Fonda, Sam Elliot and Eva Mendes and I have seen exactly what I expected to watch. For a Tuesday night in a movie theater, and later on DVD, this film is an excellent option. My vote is six.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Motoqueiro Fantasma"" (""Ghost Rider"")"
"dunmore_ego","1","8","14","1 August 2008"," Queasy Rider
","If there's another word for idiocy, I think that word is GHOST RIDER.<br/><br/>Sloppy editing, directionless direction and idiotic writing make this the number one feel-retarded movie of the year. And Nicolas Cage in eternal mourning-faced mode as the Ghost Rider doesn't help any. He is stunt biker, Johnny Blaze, employed by the devil (Peter Fonda, embarrassing himself) to stop the devil's son dominating the world. Oh yeh, and when he turns into Ghost Rider, his head turns into a flaming skull. For no reason other than it looks kinda cool.<br/><br/>Sam Elliott lends his balls-grit voice to the narration and appears as a supernatural gravedigger, but even that compounds the stupidity. His first lines narrate how every generation spawns a Ghost Rider, whose job is to collect souls sold to Satan. Okay, nice premise  now start confusing me Seems the Wild West Ghost Rider (from the 1800s, I'm guessing) ""outran the devil himself"" because he didn't want to collect 1000 souls on one particularly meaty contract.<br/><br/>Where to start with the stupid questions, knowing there'll be stupid answers at the end of all of them? Is it within the Ghost Rider's capacity to discern how many souls the devil should be bagging? He's just an apprehender, a bounty hunter; it's like bequeathing that redneck moron Dog the Bounty Hunter or one of those Nazi cops from COPS jurisprudence and the ability to execute sentences on nothing but their own cognizance, when we all know they are merely apprehenders with zero powers or intelligence beyond clicking on cuffs.<br/><br/>So what about the Rules for Supernatural Beings? How fast can the devil run? And since the Ghost Rider is a supernatural being himself, how fast was HE actually running to outrun the devil? And was he galloping across desert plains, or in some other dimension? If in some other dimension, were they ""running"" physically - with feet touching the ground for traction, or in some invisible medium? Any answers from geekboys forthcoming? <br/><br/>Every single minute of GHOST RIDER raises more idiotic questions about supernatural rules. For example, the GHOST RIDER is a supernatural being, so when evil supernatural beings fight him (beings fashioned from earth, air, fire and water), why do they bother punching each other? They're not operating on the same rules we are in the physical plane  for cryin' out loud, when a truck runs into the Ghost Rider he is unharmed, so why does the being made of water even *think* that he could debilitate him by PUNCHING? Or hanging him by the neck with a chain? <br/><br/>Later, a supernatural being made of wind laughs when Ghost Rider tries to punch him, then he eats crow when the Rider whirls his whip around and somehow creates a vortex of fire that sucks the wind being into nothingness. Riiiiight..<br/><br/>At one point, like some kind of superhero, Ghost Rider saves a girl from a pursesnatcher and then condemns the pursesnatcher to hell as if he had lied Amerika into a false Iraq war, causing the deaths of 100,000 people and consigning Amerika to a trillion-dollar debt which four generations would have to shoulder. It's the SUPERMAN conundrum: while he saves a cat in a tree, a million African children die for want of diverting a river to save their village. Get your priorities right, Bonehead! <br/><br/>Marvel really screwed the pooch with this D-Lister; Stan Lee didn't even bother making a cameo. The origin tale works gangbusters as a comicbook, but in this age of semi-realism in Marvel films (SPIDERMAN, X-MEN, PUNISHER), GHOST RIDER gasps for credibility with its insanely convoluted mythical storyline and rule-less landscape.<br/><br/>Frumpy Eva Mendez is Johnny Blaze's long-suffering romantic interest, Wes Bentley gives a pointless performance as the devil's son, and Donal Logue tries overacting to save the movie. Didn't work, but at least he's got some cheese for his demo reel."

","I love a good action flick full of romance, dangerous stunts and eye-popping special effects. So, I was thoroughly entertained by Ghost Rider. I don't know why some people aren't going for it, just personal opinion and preference, I suppose. But this is my kind of film. I love danger, great fighting sequences, and the fact that you can really sympathize for Johnny's situation, because despite the flaming skeleton deal, the rest is very believable. I want to go see it a few more times in the theater, it gets my approval for fun action flick that is plenty entertaining, and I hope for sequels to follow. I think it's nice to see a comic book character seldom talked of...as opposed to the ones that we all know so well, and then complain if something isn't done just by the book. I knew very little about the comic Ghost Rider, but would actually enjoy reading it now that I've seen the flick.<br/><br/>Good stuff :-)"

","When I got a free pass to a prescreening of Ghost Rider at my comic shop, I was thrilled. I'd already been planning on seeing it, as I am a fan of the character, and I typically enjoy Nicolas Cage movies. The trailers I'd seen had not filled me with hope, so I was expecting a bad, but still enjoyable movie, along the same lines of Daredevil and X-Men 3. I was thoroughly disappointed.<br/><br/>The movie began, and I was entertained to see that they were including the original western Ghost Rider in the story, even if they had to completely change the character in order to do so. The movie continued, and I was further impressed that they got Johnny Blaze's origin story right. My nervousness about the quality of the movie began to subside. But then the movie continued further.<br/><br/>It seems that part of the Ghost Rider curse is constant pointing and the spouting of one liners. To say nothing of the re-use of CGI. I don't know how many times I saw the same clip of Ghost Rider flipping his chain around his torso to put it away. Some other reviews have said that the fights were excellent. What fights? I don't know what movie they saw, but I did not see any fights that lasted longer than several seconds.<br/><br/>As I said, my ticket to see the movie was free. I want my gas money refunded. And leaving the theater, I was not the only person muttering that. Nor were we in the minority.<br/><br/>All in all, all I can say is ""Mark Steven Johnson, your soul is tainted with the blood of the innocent. Look into my eyes."""
"snow0r","6","11","21","28 March 2007"," reasonably entertaining
","Nicolas Cage seems to have a random process for selecting movie roles. The man who won an Oscar for his self-destruction in Leaving Las Vegas has also taken on action movies such as Face/Off and Con Air with great success, and has even found the time to star in family films such as National Treasure. <br/><br/>It's not with great surprise then that we find him as Johnny Blaze, a motorcycle stuntman by day who, via a clichéd twist of fate, becomes a fiery vigilante by night after selling his soul to the Devil. The plot was clearly not a priority, and it seems to have been overtaken by the CGI, which is successful in its attempt to adapt the comic book style to the big screen. While it never looks real (how real can a man with a flaming skull for a head look?), it's impressive, especially as computer-Cage rides down particularly tall buildings and jumps helicopters. <br/><br/>Cage, ever the over-actor, takes to his role with a typical eccentric enthusiasm that effectively sums up the spirit of Ghost Rider: sit back, switch off, and enjoy the ride."
"javaelemental","9","13","26","17 February 2007"," Just saw Ghostrider, loved it!
","I've heard that Nicolas Cage offered to pay for a chance to audition to be Ghostrider. It shows -- the man clearly loves the character, and is obviously having a ball playing Johnny Blaze.<br/><br/>The special effects were spectacular. I particularly enjoyed the transformations from Johnny Blaze to Ghostrider, which were nicely handled, and the demons -- especially the water demon.<br/><br/>The writing could have been a bit better. I enjoyed the movie enough to forgive the few problems I noticed. There were a couple of scenes that left you saying, ""Wait -- what?"" but the movie was entertaining enough and fast-paced enough that you could generally over-look those bits and just enjoy the ride. The characters suffered somewhat due to the fast pace, though, I think. A lot of movie time was necessarily spent on back story, and setting up the plot, but some character development, especially Roxanne's, suffered for it. She ended up basically being a cookie-cutter love interest.<br/><br/>Over all, I must say that I enjoyed the movie. It was funny, scary in places, action-packed, and generally an all-around good time. I expect that fans of the book will complain about the canon having been ""butchered"", but frankly, you have to expect some rewriting of the history. Any comic good enough to rate a movie is going to have a metric ton of history behind it, and you have to rewrite and truncate that history to fit it into a ninety minute movie. I think the writers did quite well with Ghostrider's back story, and I think they did a great job with the movie over all. Here's hoping for sequels!"

","Mark Steven Johnson is the new Joel Schumacher and what Schmacher did with Batman Johnson did with Daredevil and now, Ghost Rider, namely give a bad name to comic book adaptations. Ghost Rider is the epitome of what turns people off about comic books and the movies made from them: all special effects, little logic, characterization or drama.<br/><br/>Admittedly, the movie starts out fine by telling the story behind Johnny Blaze's deal with the devil. But once Ghost Rider is introduced, Johnson eschews coherent narrative for a series of ""cool"" scenes cribbed from the comics, with little logic or coherent dramatic context.<br/><br/>Among the actors, the movie's saving grace seems to be Wes Bently, who aptly plays the role of Blackheart. Nicholas Cage is entertaining to watch, particularly when he tries to explain his ""situation"" to childhood sweetheart Roxanne (Eva Mendes) but his flippancy otherwise undercuts his character's should-be mythic status.<br/><br/>Overall, the film is a big disappointment, although it shouldn't have been given Johnson's track record with Daredevil. He is losing whatever goodwill audiences developed for 'comicbook'movies in the wake of Batman Begins and the Spider-man and X-Men films."
"DICK STEEL","5","25","57","14 February 2007"," A Nutshell Review: Ghost Rider
","Mark Steven Johnson, I hate to break it to you. 3 strikes and you're out. I understand your earnestness in trying to write-direct Marvel superhero movies by trying to stay close to the source material, but somehow they all turn out to be mediocre efforts. Although you didn't direct Elecktra, you produced and wrote it, and wrote-directed Daredevil and now Ghost Rider. I enjoyed Daredevil even though most others did not, and that unfortunately was your best effort.<br/><br/>Marvel superheroes have their fair share of material being translated to the big screen, the largest cash cow being Spiderman, which opened the doors for efforts like The Hulk and Fantastic Four, creations of Stan Lee, and others, which I deem on the lower echelons, like Daredevil, Punisher, and Ghost Rider. The floodgates have not closed, as Spiderman and Fantastic Four will spawn their sequels this year, with Iron Man coming our way as well. Naturally not all the movies are hits, and too bad, I had hopes for Ghost Rider to join the hit list, even though I've not faithfully followed the comic books nor am a fan.<br/><br/>I'm not quick to dismiss that comic book material can't be turned into powerful motion pictures. Batman Begins and the Spiderman movies have earned their mark of respect for having that emotional oomph to engage the audience, coupled with effects and stunts to wow. I guess we're spoilt from the excellent efforts of Christopher Nolan and Sam Raimi, as they've raised the bar and their movies are now the de facto benchmarks for comic book adaptations to reach. <br/><br/>The first sign that things aren't going all that well, was that this movie was postponed, if I recall correctly, for almost one year, on the pretext of jazzing up the special effects. True, the flames on the skull were as realistic as can be, but that's about it. Every other effect seemed quite ordinary, and nothing to make the jaw drop. In fact, some CGI shots became so repetitive, that you start to wonder if the same clip was being recycled to save time.<br/><br/>In essence, much like the origins of Daredevil, Johnny Blaze (Nicolas Cage) unwittingly signs a pact with the devil Mephistopheles (Peter Fonda), and indirectly caused the death of his father. Blaming himself, and because of the sale of his soul to the devil, he abandons all hope in life, and his true love Roxanne (Eva Mendes), and leads a dangerous life as a stunt biker who throws caution to the wind, knowing that he can't perish because of his secret ""guardian angel"", and awaits the day when he can be free from fear and blame.<br/><br/>Fast forward to the quick introduction of the main villain Blackheart (Wes Bentley), son of the devil, who recruits the Elementals (Earth, Wind and Water spirits of sorts) in his cause to bring hell on earth. Yes, it's Constantine all over again. The plot was too vanilla plain, lacking much conflicts to challenge our anti-hero, besides his love interest. The villains, especially the Elementals, were a joke, and were so easily dispatched, that you'll scream for your money back.<br/><br/>Given that it's an origin story of sorts, you'll get to see how Johnny becomes the rider who can walk on both worlds, and slowly get introduced to how he got his tools of the trade, including his jacket, gloves, chain, bike and shotgun. Unfortunately, one of the Rider's powers, the Penance Stare, is overused, and to cinematic audiences, we've probably seen a similar version in Alex Proyas' directed The Crow starring the late Brandon Lee. While there are some remotely funny moments, most of the time the humour seemed contrived, and you'll probably cringe at some of the cheesy Western reference, no thanks too to one of the tracks performed by Spiderbait.<br/><br/>If you're on the lookout for Stan Lee, who frequently pops into the Marvel films, don't. I think by steering clear, it's another indication that well, perhaps it's not as good a job as it should be. The narrative sagged in the middle, and contained some illogical, lazy plot moments, like a public transformation, and a busy jail house with no cops (yeah right).<br/><br/>Nicolas Cage could have been Superman with a hairpiece, but I thought he looked good as Johnny Blaze with a hairpiece. To his fans, you would've already seen the acting range he showed here, especially from John Woo's Face Off. That crazed look with the eyeballs almost popping out is repeated here, and at times, his Castor Troy scene comes to mind. Eva Mendes was largely wasted as the buxomy Roxanne who cock teases Johnny, and you actually wonder what Wes Bentley is doing in a movie like this. Sam Elliot shows up as the Caretaker, and is actually involved in a pretty cool scene which you might have seen revealed in the trailer.<br/><br/>All in all, I would still say an enjoyable movie if you don't compare to, or have seen some of the other movies which I've mentioned above. It should do well at the box office in the initial week, before word of mouth gets to it. Fans of Ghost Rider, I sure would like to hear your views if you've liked it, or not, because after all, the fans are the ones who hold their hero dear."

One of the best Marvel comic films I ever seen with a high budget about $110 million. The action and cinematography was excellent. The story is quite similar to Daredevil because of the same director Mark Steven Johnson e.g. Death of father and boy grew up to be a super hero. So this movie is recommended to those who liked Daredevil. In my opinion Daredevil was also good but Ghost Rider is a 1000 times better! The best scene in the film has to be when Johnny Blaze turned into the Ghost Rider the second time while he was in prison & after he broke out he was riding his bike over the bridge then onto the lake later he drove upwards to a building & jumped off after spinning the helicopter with his chains and the way his bike goes with flaming wheels it is simply just Awesome.

"myword2k3","5","11","22","14 February 2007"," Moderately entertaining generic superhero flick.
","Reviewed By Sarhan ""MyWord"" Rashid, Singapore<br/><br/>Every cinematic genre sooner of later arrives at a point of stagnation. A point where the characters, their conflicts, challenges and circumstances may vary but the plot doesn't stray too far away from a given formula.<br/><br/>Good examples are rom-coms. How many times have you sat through the story of an ugly duckling who transforms herself into a glamour queen so the high school stud would finally take notice of her only to realize in the penultimate scenes that her prince charming was always her nerdy best friend who saw her real beauty (Awww!). Make a few changes here and there and you have the script to another predictable and often lucrative rom-com.<br/><br/>No genre can be free of this curse as long as the Hollywood money machine is willing and able to fork out the big bucks for the ""visions"" of uninspired creative minds such as the director of ""Ghost Rider"" Mark Steven Johnson (MSJ).<br/><br/>Comic book adaptations, namely those based on superheroes, have largely stuck to a simple structure - <br/><br/>01. Lead protagonist gains one or more extraordinary powers. 02. Learns to use them. 03. The evil plan(s) of a sinister villain is unveiled. 04. Title character(s) sets out to stop sinister villain.<br/><br/>By now you should know how it ends. Just like rom-coms, or any other genre, sticking to a formula isn't always a bad thing (see ""Batman Begins""). It is however a step backwards for the genre when the movie fails to set itself apart from the rest. ""Ghost Rider"" lavishly succeeds at that.<br/><br/>That isn't to say it is without any merits or that the makers didn't try. <br/><br/>Kudos to MSJ and his team for adapting a complicated character such as this whose convoluted back story would be enough to deter most away. <br/><br/>The problem lies in the entire movie feeling like one big ""been there, done that"" moment. Hardly anything grips you and each scene plays out just as you would imagine it to.<br/><br/>Fortunately there's Nicholas Cage to save the movie with his fun performance. His dual performance as both Johhny Blaze and the Ghost Rider light up (no pun intended) the screen. <br/><br/>The film makers however seem dead set on canceling out any positive element with a negative. Here it's Eva Mendes showing off the wonders of the push-up bra. Tantalising as her mammaries might be they can't distract from her miscast appearance as Roxanne, Johnny's love interest. <br/><br/>For a hero to win over an audience one needs to pit him against a formidable foe. A creation so reprehensible the viewers would want nothing more than to see his demise at the hands of their hero. In this case we're treated to Wes Bently hamming it up to laughable results as Blackheart, the son of the devil (Peter Fonda as daddy dearest Mephistopheles). A lot of detail has gone into the appearance of all the characters including the Blackheart's poorly utilised henchmen. Too bad they didn't spend as much time etching their characterisations.<br/><br/>Besides Nic Cage's energetic performance the only other saving grace are the fantastic effects on display. Don't be fooled by the shoddy special effects you've seen in the trailers. The Ghost Rider has been visualised perfectly. I just wish they didn't ruin his first transformation with all those quick jarring cuts.<br/><br/>""Ghost Rider"" succeeds moderately as another generic superhero popcorn flick. Sadly it is easily forgotten by the time the end credits roll. This doesn't weigh in too well for the chances of a sequel but $30 million plus over the weekend (plus foreign box-office gross) will go a long way in proving any critic wrong.<br/><br/>Reviewed By Sarhan ""MyWord"" Rashid, Singapore"

","Due in no small part to its sometimes self-effacing humor, GHOST RIDER rolls along at a pretty brisk clip and is very, very rarely (despite what you might've heard to the contrary) tedious going. Nicholas Cage sometimes has a way of making potential misfires sure hits (or near misses- although even he couldn't make the remake of THE WICKER MAN worth sitting through); his just-a-hint-of-Elvis delivery helps. Eva's cleavage is mighty danged impressive, no doubt about it, but the real star of this one- make no mistake about it- is Cage. The way the story ties into the original GHOST RIDER mythos is likewise noteworthy (fellow comic fans will feel the urge to clap and cheer, I'm sure: I did, and I've read very few of the ""reincarnated"" GHOST stories). Don't make the mistake of passing on this one: it's supernatural superhero fun on a grand scale. I can't wait to see THE SPECTRE and DEADMAN on the Big Screen..."

After that pact he made, Johnny Blaze becomes a flaming-skulled avenger, The Ghost Rider. The effect of Cage becoming the Rider was amazing. And that chopper, who knew having your own custom design would made a difference. Or better yet, make other owners jealous. At the jail scene, Ghost Rider made the character more extreme when he got the prisoner's jacket and gloves, and it was very funny when that innocent prisoner fainted after The Rider escaped. Sam Elliot was awesome playing the first Ghost Rider, Slade. He was cool and collected, and he never showed any sign of worry or doubt. This movie has got some humor to it, and it's worth my while as well. They weren't kidding about burning up the road, Ghost Rider really puts that down hard and fast! 4.5 out of 5 stars!"
"Colts3051","9","8","15","18 February 2007"," A fun and entertaining movie.
","What do you get when you hire a director who really understands and loves the material? A faithful adaptation of a comic. In recent years it happened with Bryan Singer and X-Men, Sam Raimi and Spider-Man, as well as Christopher Nolan and Batman. It is now safe to put writer/director Mark Steven Johnson in that class as well for Ghost Rider.<br/><br/>Superhero Hype! got a chance to watch the anticipated Ghost Rider movie, opening February 16 and starring Nicolas Cage, Eva Mendes, Wes Bentley, Sam Elliott, Donal Logue and Peter Fonda.<br/><br/>In the Columbia Pictures release, superstar motorcycle stunt rider Johnny Blaze (Cage) makes a deal with the devil (Mephistopheles, played by Fonda) to keep his father from dying. But Mephistopheles tricks Blaze, who leaves childhood sweetheart, Roxanne (Mendes), in order to protect her. Years later, the son of the devil, Blackheart, wants to take control over the world with the help of three fallen angels, called the Hidden. It is then that Mephistopheles comes to Blaze, who must now hunt down the rogue demons as the Ghost Rider.<br/><br/>There's quite a bit of comics history for Johnson to cover in the film (just look at Wikipedia's rundown of the Ghost Rider comics to get some kind of idea), which makes the beginning of the film seem forced. The backstory is about your typical father/son who jump motorcycles for a living (!), but it's this relationship that forces Johnny to sign his soul to the devil and we never really see that overwhelming love between father and son. There's not a lot of time to tell the origins either, so you're moved quickly to the point where Nicolas Cage and Blackheart & Co. take over the story.<br/><br/>It's probably a good thing, because that is also where the movie starts getting good. We need a bit more setup until Johnny Blaze (Cage) is called upon by Memistopheles. But when he does, we get the treat we've been expecting. Soon after, you get to see Blaze transform into Ghost Rider for the first time, which looks extremely painful for Blaze but enjoyable to the Ghost Rider.<br/><br/>When Ghost Rider does battle with Blackheart and the Hidden (or the elements, so to speak) it's an all-out slugfest with no holds barred. Their powers give the Ghost Rider a challenge in having to figure out how to defeat them. The scenes feature impressive special effects that'll have you say many times, ""cool!"" We won't spoil them here, but many of the best visual effects, including the full transformation, you haven't seen yet in trailers or clips. For example, the riding up the building scene from the trailers is quite long and is definitely a highlight of the film, with much more happening before and after.<br/><br/>Nicolas Cage really hits one out of the park here. We noticed a similar southern accent to how he talked in Con-Air (hey, the movie takes place in Texas after all), but Cage has created both a tragic yet fun character on-screen. It's entertaining to watch him play Johnny Blaze/Ghost Rider. Fonda and Elliott are great as always, while Bentley was good casting for Blackheart and Logue adds comic relief to the dark story. Eva Mendes is definitely nice to look at, but she doesn't add much as Roxanne. We didn't really feel to close to her as we probably should have.<br/><br/>Those who were afraid that the film's initial release was moved from summer 2006 to February 2007 should be assured that the FX team has pulled out all the stops. CGI flames can be tricky and Ghost Rider's flaming skull, body and hellcycle are awesome and well worth the delay. The special effects for Blackheart and the Hidden were also very well done.<br/><br/>Naturally, since this is the story of Ghost Rider, parents should heed the rating for this film, which is PG-13 for horror violence and disturbing images.<br/><br/>Ghost Rider is a fun ride and definitely worth checking out!"
"Bored_Dragon","8","3","4","12 May 2018"," Terribly underrated
","""Ghost Rider"" has very low ratings and reputation of one of the worst Marvel movies, and it slowly starts to worry me that this is an increasingly common case with my favorite movies. I'm watching Marvel chronologically, and of the 24 films and series I've seen so far, this one is in my top 5. I can not say I'm amazed, but it was close enough.<br/><br/>The story is one of the most powerful in the Marvel universe, and a dark and fairly serious atmosphere is more in the spirit of DC than Marvel. Considering one of the lowest budgets in the genre, the film is very well done and I have no objections from the technical side. An excellent balance of action, drama and humor, which is rare in Marvel films, keeps the attention from start to finish and, if you are a more careful observer or you watch it several times, you will notice a lot of interesting details. There are Bible quotes, characters borrowed from other Marvel stories, references to ""Apocalypse Now"" (a film directed by Nikoilas' uncle), scenes made as a homage to painters and all sorts of interesting stuff. <br/><br/>It is interesting fact that Nicolas Cage is a big fan of comics, especially this one, so he fought tooth and nail to get this role, and even has a tattoo of Ghost Rider that they had to hide when shooting. He is such a fan(atic) that he took his stage name from comic character Luke Cage, and he named his son Kal-El after Superman. Director does not fall far behind Cage, because he gave money from his pocket for shooting some of the scenes that the studio didn't approve. All in all, this is the movie that true lovers of comics made from the heart, and it's really sad that it is so badly (un)accepted by the audience and criticism. I rate it strong eight.<br/><br/>8/10"

"dwpollar","7","3","4","4 December 2008"," Fun and well-made comic book adaptation...
","1st watched 12/2/2008  (Dir-Mark Steven Johnson): Fun and well-made comic book adaptation that was much better than I expected. I had heard a lot of bad talk about the movie and Nicholas Cage's performance in the title role but it definitely wasn't the case to me. Cage plays the older version of the main character who made a deal with the devil(played wonderfully by Peter Fonda) when he was a young so that his dad would get better. Unfortunately, the devil kills his dad during his next motorcycle stunt and the young ghost rider is stuck with being a helper for the dark one for the rest of his life. He's called to bring back the son of the devil back to hell and from this point on at nighttime he turns into the fiery-skulled character from the comic books. There is a side story about a caretaker(a former ghost rider), played by Sam Elliot, who protects and mentors the younger ghost rider and another side story involving an attempted romantic involvement with an old flame who becomes a reporter, played by Eva Mendes. She just happens to be following and reporting on Johnny Blade, who is a popular stunt rider and Cage's normal daytime character. These extra stories add to the piece, but the basic storyline is really all that is necessary to make this an entertaining movie. Cage's performance is dead-on and this unique storyline makes for a different superhero movie. Sure, Mendes isn't much more than nice to look at and Elliot pretty much plays the same character that he's done in hundreds of movies but overall the movie was a positive experience which I'm afraid won't have a sequel although I'd like to see one"
"vamplad79","8","3","4","15 October 2008"," Really Enjoyed !!!!!
","I haven't read that many reviews on this film and only happen to pick it up because it was going really cheap. I am really disappointed it has taken me this long to find this film as i really enjoyed it and would have paid full price to this on the big screen.<br/><br/>I am sure there will be lots of negative reviews for the film and I can't be bothered to read through all of them. At the end of the day what i ask myself when going into a comic book movie is - Was i entertained ?. Ghost Rider had some great visuals, a solid story and great acting (loved Cage's maniacal transformation into the Ghost Rider). I will go on record and say i enjoyed this better than Spiderman but then i am more a horror freak than an action one so i liked the more dark side of the film than the light and poppy friendly Spiderman.<br/><br/>I don't mind Nic Cage and can basically watch him in anything though i have friends that hate him and thus hate the film so i guess it is all personal preference. everyone keeps raging on him cause they don't like the guy or the films he does. I am not saying that The Wicker Man is a freakin classic but once again i could handle it because i like watching Cage. I would never say the guy is a bad actor though as he has proved over and over that he has a certain screen presence and has had some great roles. I mean Pacino and De Niro considered greats have been in some crap films. doesn't mean that they are bad actors all of sudden.<br/><br/>I don't know .....sounds like i got a hard on for Nic.....but i really did enjoy the film and his performance !!!! :P"

","What are the popular or well-known supernatural heros or legends from the comic world? I believe they are the Spiderman, Batman, Superman, Daredevil, Constantine, the Fantastic Four, the X-Men, etc. But recently, there is another supernatural legend appearing on screen from Hollywood's Marvel comic books which I have not seen before. It is the ""Ghost Rider"".<br/><br/>""It's said that the West was built on legends. Tall tales that help us make sense of things too great or too terrifying to believe. This is the legend of the Ghost Rider."" The movie began with these attractive sentences.<br/><br/>According to the DVD of this movie, the comic books of the Ghost Rider was first published in the 50's. It was changed and being popular since the 70's. The story of it was modified or edited to make a movie.<br/><br/>The movie story was about a brave stunt biker, Johnny Blaze(Nicolas Cage). He sold his soul to the devil dealer, Mephistopheles(Peter Fonda), in order to save his father, Barton Blaze(Brett Cullen), who was also a stunt biker. After signing the contract ""Pactum Pactorum"", Johnny Blaze owned a power of controlling the hellfire, gained a skill called the ""penance stare"" to burn the souls of the evils. But that power also made him painful as being cursed. Every night he would change into a monster-like skeleton which was on fire, wearing on a black leather hell-styled jacket, riding on a cool Hellcycle, carrying on a metal chain attached on the jacket.<br/><br/>Johnny Blaze was good in possess but he was influenced by that evil curse. He aimed to own this curse or power to save the innocents. He tried to stop Blackheart(Wes Bentley), accompanied with Gressil, Wallow and Abigor, to steal the ""Contract of San Vengaza"" which carried a thousand of evil souls in order to increase his power. That contract was kept by the Caretaker(Sam Elliott).<br/><br/>There was a funny love story about reincarnation in it. Roxanne Simpson(Eva Mendes), who was Johnny Blaze's long lost love, met him again after 56000 years! About the soundtrack or musics, some classic songs from the Carpenters were used. The theme song was the ""(Ghost) Riders In The Sky"", by Spiderbait.<br/><br/>There are choices to make in our life. I think the nice visual effects and the surround sound, with this legendary story and the beautiful comics of the Ghost Rider"". it is one of a good choice for people who like comics or movies."

","This was hilarious! OK so it sucked big time, but i got great laughs out of it. Eva Mendes is a complete robot, her chest the only useful thing about her character. Nic Cage is great...he seems to be doing all these crap movies lately and I think it works out great for him (Wicker Man...wow!!!) Every look on his face, everything he says, it s downright hysterical! The movie itself: The plot sucked, the dialog sucked harder, the special effects could have been way better...the close-ups, the slow motion, the one liners...it is way overdone. I expected way better from the guy who brought us Daredevil, a Marvel-production I did appreciate as a movie. Ghost Rider just isn't a movie, it's a joke...<br/><br/>But that didn't stop me from enjoying it just this once... on the contrary, I m glad I've seen it (just this once) 5 out of 10 for this comedy classic"
"c_hardy20","Null","3","4","15 October 2007"," Riding With The Devil
","I have chosen to do Ghost Rider as my film review because it is a very action packed movie. Some of the major movie actors in this movie are Nicolas Cage who plays Johnny Blaze, the person who does all the tricks on his motorcycle just like his father; Donal Logue, also known as Mack, plays as the famous Johnny's assistant; Eva Mendes, or Roxie, is a news reporter and Johnny's childhood sweetheart; Peter Fonda is the devil that tricks Johnny into selling him his soul.<br/><br/>The events of this movie begin when Johnny discovers that his dad has cancer. A few days after Johnny finds out about his dad's cancer he is visited by the devil. The devil promises him that if he sells his soul to him, he will cure his dad's cancer. Young Johnny does not realize is that the devil makes no deals with anyone and cares for no one. The next day Johnny's father's cancer is gone, but his dad dies upon doing a stunt for the circus that day. The devil does not care that he lied and cured his father's cancer, but killed him another way instead. The devil shows up upon Johnny's dad's death and promises Johnny that he will be back at a later date for Johnny to pay his part of the deal. Johnny is now a famous, older stunt person who will try anything because he is invincible in his eyes. Now the devil decides to come back to retrieve Johnny's part of the deal. The devil asks that Johnny find the one known as Blackheart and permanently get rid of him. This where Johnny turns into Ghost Rider, with the flaming motorcycle and body in a leather jacket. The flaming bike with the Ghost Rider can go up and down buildings, fly through streets, etc. in no time doing tons of destruction. Roxie, Johnny's childhood sweetheart, comes around again in an attempt to get an interview from Johnny for the television. Johnny sees Roxie as his way to possible get help out of his rut with the devil and reaches out to her.<br/><br/>This is the coolest by far that I have seen in a long time. I like this movie because I love motorcycles and the movie is just so eye-catching with all the flames and action. From a normal motorcycle turning into a flaming skeleton, to a human turning into a flaming person, it is awesome. You will not be able to take your eyes off the screen!"
"BA_Harrison","7","3","4","7 June 2007"," Great comic-book fun.
","After reading some scathing reviews, I was fully expecting Ghost Rider to be a festering pile of stink. I am glad to report, however, that it is not as bad as some have made it out to be: it's a comic book adaptation that actually dares to be fun (unlike that recent Superman movie!) and as a result, it is a thoroughly enjoyable piece of mindless action.<br/><br/>When Mephistopheles (Peter Fonda) promises stunt motorcyclist Johnny Blaze that he will cure his terminally ill father in exchange for his soul, Johnny jumps at the chance. The Devil, true to his word, cures Mr.Blaze senior, who promptly snuffs it anyway when his next stunt goes horribly wrong.<br/><br/>Johnny, now in the employ of Mephistopheles, is told that when the time comes, he will become a 'ghost rider'a bounty hunter whose job it is to collect the souls of the damned. Johnny's only hope of being released from his contract is to defeat Mephistopheles's son Blackheart (Wes Bentley), who is plotting to overthrow his father and unleash hell on earth.<br/><br/>Knowing full well that the plot is pure nonsense, the makers of Ghost rider decide to concentrate on delivering as much fun as possible, and with a typically kooky central performance from Cage (plus able support from Eva Mendes as buxom girlfriend Roxanne, and Sam Elliot as his mentor, Carter Slade), some great special effects, and loads of comic-book action, they pretty much succeed.<br/><br/>Ghost Rider won't change your life, and it's unlikely to become your favourite film ever, but it is not a bad way to spend your time (unlike that recent Superman movie!)."
"jmuntmootcourt","7","3","4","3 May 2007"," Fun but not great
","Perfect comic movie. Nobody's getting Oscars for their parts, but they were mostly convincing. Couple of funny parts, great effects, cool fight scenes. Also, the storyline stuck close enough to the comic to be ""true"" to it, but it wasn't overdone. I mean, they didn't just pull it straight out of the series or anything, it was an original story, so it wasn't just an adaptation, which is always appreciated (though some other comic fans don't seem to like that, not sure why stagnation is good to some people).<br/><br/>Almost every scene with GR in it was so freakin' cool looking that I almost creamed my man-panties."

","When I first found out about this movie by accident, I wanted to see it because of its reputation. When I saw it just recently, I was not disappointed. I was not bored at one point throughout the movie. A friend of mine commented that it should have had better special effects, but I thought it was fine as it was. As usual with a superhero movie, it has a girl for which the main hero is in love with.<br/><br/>The story of Ghost Rider is about a young stunt rider called Johnny Blaze who, in exchange for his fathers help, makes a deal with the devil, allowing the devil to have his soul if he fulfills his end of the deal. However, although the devil does uphold his end, he also ensures the death of Barton Blaze in a stunt accident. Having fulfilled his end of the deal, and getting rid of Johnny's father to prevent distraction, the devil has Johnny seek out a powerful contract for him, giving him the power to become the 'Ghost Rider', a being who could pass for a human were it not for his head being a flaming skull. While searching for this contract, Ghost Rider must fight the son of the Devil, as well as a few demons.<br/><br/>One problem I had with the movie is that the enemies don't seem to last very long in fights, dying almost instantly, such as the Wind Demon. Put simply, fights resolve themselves too quickly.<br/><br/>Apart from that, it was very enjoyable, and I would recommend viewing it at least once."

Go into it knowing full well that Nicolas Cage will over-act like crazy...that many of the lines and scenes will be very cheesy...and that the story will be ridiculous.

"lynnlefey","6","3","4","20 February 2007"," A Surprisingly fun film
","Okay, look. I sat through both 'Electra' and 'Catwoman'. People who rate Ghost Rider a 1 out of ten need to see 'Manos: Hands of Fate' and get their scales readjusted.<br/><br/>I am a long time fan of comics, and read mostly Marvel Comics as a kid. I actually have a reprint of the original Ghost Rider comic that I recently reread, and now I realize just how bad those 1970's comics really were. People should consider how palatable this movie is, considering its source.<br/><br/>Things I liked about this movie: Sam Eliot; Apparently he can say anything, no matter how ludicrous, and it will sound deep and meaningful. The song 'Ghost Riders in the Sky' hyped up on heavy metal playing during the scene where the two Ghost riders ride together. The visuals; Yes indeed, a cyclist with a flaming skull for a head does indeed look just as cool as it sounds.<br/><br/>Things I didn't like about this movie: The dialog; I have to agree that Mark Steven Johnson should work on his craft. I'm not a fan of one-liners either. Eva Mendez; I never noticed her before, but apparently, either she can't act, or MSJ can't direct.<br/><br/>This is not a movie of high craft. It is a fun movie though. It's not quite so bad that you have to completely leave your brain at the door, but you do have to strap on the James Bond one-liner defense guard. It is cheesy in parts. It requires a good deal of suspension of disbelief, even within its own reality, but I mean... it's a movie about a guy that somehow bursts into flames, burning away his flesh, that will later return unmarred, so maybe leaving other questions of logic behind is the best thing for all concerned.<br/><br/>In my opinion, it rates under Spider-Man, and X-Men, but better than the rest of Marvel's recent efforts (Daredevel, Fantastic Four, etc.)"

","Ghost Rider turned out to be a really good super hero flick. As you can tell though, there really isn't much in the way of story. But hey, that's why I like this movie. Sit down, shut off brain, enjoy the movie with a couple of buddies. <br/><br/>Ghost Rider follows the simple story of Johnny Blaze, vigilante from Hell. It takes 45 minutes to really get going, but when it does, it's awesome. The soundtrack fits in perfectly with the film and the noises are wonderful. Some may find the cackling Ghost Rider a bit cheesy and over done, but it gives it the strangely funny/evil feel that the Clown/Violater gave to the movie and comics Spawn.<br/><br/>And don't listen to all the idiots in the boards bashing this movie like hell. It still is pretty good. And the CG is better then everyone gives credit for. Plus the end has a really cool Spagetti Western from Hell feel to it. All in all a great movie. Lots of fun!"

","I keep reading that Ghost Rider has a cheese factor. Although as a stand alone movie, this would be true as a comic book adaption I didn't find it like that at all. Was the outfit correct? YES. Were the character names correct? YES. Did he have the penance stare and did they call it Penance stare? YES,YES. Chains, Bike, Flaming skull? Again I say YES YES YES. They even have the pointing that is found in just about every book that Ghost Rider was drawn in. Overall as not only a comic movie but a movie it was enjoyable and holds your interest. Sam Elliott is great as Caretaker, and always a pleasure to watch. The greatest homage in my book was getting (Easy Rider) Peter Fonda to be in what is destined to be another great Motorcycle film. Yes, it's true I am a comic nerd through and through, but I think anyone who enjoys a good action film with a nice spattering of humor is sure to enjoy Ghost Rider."
"freaky_dave","7","3","4","18 February 2007"," Good popcorn fun
","Ghost Rider is better than I expected. After all the complaints about the movie, I found myself pleasantly surprised with it. This is not a movie to be taken seriously. It is just simple popcorn fun.<br/><br/>Nicholas Cage plays stunt motorcyclist Johnny Blaze who years ago as a teenager sold his soul to the devil in order to save his father from the cancer that was killing him. Jump to the present and we discover that the devil has come to collect on the bargain they made. You see Blackheart(Wes Bentley), who is the son of the devil, has escaped from Hell. He has come to Earth to collect a document which will give him the power to create hell on Earth. The devil of course doesn't want him to have it, and so he gets Johnny, giving him the power of the fiery Ghost Rider, to bring him back to Hell. Of course Blackheart isn't ready to go back and so a battle ensues between the two.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the story, and enjoyed Sam Elliot in his role as a cemetery worker who tells Johnny about the curse and explains all the information we need to know. Of course Sam Elliot's character has a few secrets of his own, even though they were not really too surprising. I sort of knew where the story of Sam Elliots character was going when he first appeared on the scene. Enough of that though.<br/><br/>Ghost Rider is not the greatest comic book movie ever made. It has its flaws, but it was purely entertaining and has its place among other comic book adaptations. I would give it about the same rating as the Fantastic Four from 2005. And to those people who are trashing it, maybe you should all lighten up and enjoy the movie for what it is, a fun paced thriller that is much better than some of the lame movies I've seen so far this year. By the way, the special effects were really good too."

","This movie...well, it was pretty decent. I had seen the bad reviews and thought that maybe i shouldn't see it, but my girlfriend really has a thing for Nic Cage and I couldn't tell her no, so we went to see it today.<br/><br/>Now, I did want to see the movie when i saw the trailers. I thought it looked badass. It's the Rider, man. One of the coolest looking comic characters of all time, and in that regard, the movie delivered. Ghost Rider looked super cool in this movie and he did all the cool stuff you wanted him to do. From there, it takes a turn for the worst.<br/><br/>""The thing about legends is...sometimes, they're real."" Lines like this hit your ear like nails on a chalkboard and others just seem so forced. There's plenty of bad lines and awful jokes to go around. I had heard that Cage wrote some of the scenes in the movie, I'm betting that every line of bad dialogue came from his bald little noggin. Nic Cage is a good actor, I'll admit that. But if you don't control his performance, he will, and you don't want that.<br/><br/>Wes Bentley has a terrible performance, so does the old rider. I don't even know what the actor's name is, and I'm not going to look it up right now. He's the old guy though. The caretaker. And he has some very bad lines, so i guess with the material provided, he did a decent job. The rest of the cast performs abley, but nothing noteworthy.<br/><br/>In closing, if you wanna see some cool Ghost Rider effects, then you should check the movie out (The Grindhouse trailer alone made it worth 6 bucks to me), but if you are looking for a great flick, maybe you should wait for 300 (here's hoping 300 turns out as we all dream).<br/><br/>Let's ride.."

Marvel has overall done a good job with their recent movie adaptations a few misses but the recent crop is way above the 80's versions even the sucky ones. Now some will say the fight scenes of the minions were short but that was because they are just cannon fodder and to help show GR power so you can judge Blackhearts power better when the fight. Were are dealing with magic something you can not just look at and judge strength. IF the dialog and story were comicy at parts lets not forget the source material here people, a COMIC.

","The theme of humans selling their souls to the devil in exchange for earthly advantages is a classic one that has never before received quite the spectacular kind of treatment as it does in GHOST RIDER. Anyone who has any doubt that we have entered the golden age of comic book movies can watch this film with complete satisfaction and doubt no more.<br/><br/>Taken for what it is, Ghost Rider as a movie achieves magnificently exactly what the best of the classic comic books achieved with pen and ink and paper. It weaves together challenging human drama, moral dilemma, and super-sized action to create brilliantly mesmerizing stories. As fantastic as the special effects in this movie are, what makes them super extraordinary is that they somehow appear completely natural. A burning talking skull is one thing but a flaming motorcycle that drives up walls and through water is not to be missed.<br/><br/>At the beginning of this movie, viewers may find themselves only intrigued when learning about the age-old legend of the Ghost Rider and some may even dismiss it as boring bullish hype. That changes when we see the young Johnny Blaze discover his stunt-rider father has terminal cancer, then sells his soul to the devil Mephistopheles (played wickedly enough by Peter Fonda) to save him. The only problem is that Mephistopheles, as everybody knows, is a liar, and he saves the senior Blaze's life just long enough to end it in a freak accident. Nevertheless, the deal stands and costs Johnny Blaze, among other things, Roxanne, the love of his life. He matures into a man whose phenomenal success does nothing to prevent him from being haunted by a death wish and the knowledge that he one day will have to give the devil what he promised him.<br/><br/>What Blaze does not know is that his entire being has been infused with the power of hellfire that not only guarantees his soul to the devil but will transform him into the monstrous Ghost Rider. In a twist of hellish fate, Mephistopheles offers him the opportunity to win his soul back if he will help him fight his own son, the incorrigibly malevolent Blackheart (Wes Bentley is that really you?) and his band of renegade angels. The beautiful irony here is that by helping the devil to defeat his rebellious demons, the Ghost Rider discovers the way to best fight his own.<br/><br/>At first thought, Nicolas Cage seems anything but the most likely actor to play Johnny Blaze/Ghost Rider. However, to quote a character describing Ghost Rider to the reporter Roxanne: ""It was an edge look but he totally pulled it off."" So did Eva Mendes, who as Roxanne Simpson demonstrates she's not only ten-star gorgeous but a very capable leading actress. Matt Long and Raquel Alessi get the movie off to a solid start as the younger Blaze and Roxanne. The 62-year-old Sam Elliot is in fine form as the cemetery grounds keeper who turns out to be something much more than that. Have to give kudos as well to director Mark Steven Johnson for placing Elliot in a role that simultaneously pays tribute to the western genre and to the legend of the Ghost Rider.<br/><br/>There is no sympathy for the devil in Ghost Rider because in Johnny Blaze's struggle to achieve heroic integrity by overcoming negative circumstances, naive choices, and personal inner demons, it becomes easy to see one's own struggles to live a life of meaning and substance. Such portrayals are the reason many classic comic books have never been just ""funny books."" In actuality, the medium as cultivated by Stan Lee, Malcolm Wheeler-Nicholson, and other pioneers of the art has given us some of the best characters, myths, and stories of modern literature. Anyone looking for proof need only count the number of blockbuster films that have been adapted from comics and graphic novels over the past decade. Ghost Rider is one of the best yet.<br/><br/>by Author-Poet Aberjhani, author of ""Christmas When Music Almost Killed the World"""

","Ever since the release of Bryan Singer's ""X-Men"", movie based on Marvel Comics' popular superhero team, the first decade of the 2000s saw a revival of films based on the adventures of comic book heroes even bigger to what Donner's ""Superman"" did in the late 70s, and Burton's ""Batman"" in the late 80s. After ""X-Men"" came ""Spider-Man"", ""The Hulk"" and many other classic names of the main comic book pantheons (even the Batman franchise got a reboot) as modern technology made possible what in the past years was impossible: to represent the fantastic abilities of the characters in a somewhat realistic way. After more than 6 six years of troubled development (it was one of the first to be announced), the supernatural hero created in the 70s by Gary Friedrich and Mike Ploog, ""Ghost Rider"", has now joined the ranks of superheroes with a movie adaptation.<br/><br/>The movie is the story of Johnny Blaze (Matt Long), the son of a stunt motorcycle rider (Brett Cullen) who one day discovers that his father is dying of cancer. On that day the demon Mephistopheles (Peter Fonda) appears to him, and offers Johnny the chance to save his father if he is willing to give him his soul. Blaze sings the contract and his father gets cured, but later gets killed on a motorcycle accident, making Johnny's soul the Devil's property, and he'll find a use for him someday. Many years later, Johnny (Nicolas Cage) is now a famous stunt driver, and is in this way where he gets reunited to the girlfriend he abandoned as a teenager, Roxanne (Eva Mendes). However, the Devil also returns to Johnny's life and forces him to become his warrior, the Ghost Rider, as he needs him to kill his son Blackheart (Wes Bentley), who plans to overpower him.<br/><br/>Written and directed by Mark Steven Johnson (who previously worked on ""Daredevil""), ""Ghost Rider"" is essentially, a movie to spent the time and have some fun. This is not a movie that explores the complexities of its hero, but one that seems to celebrate the fun and entertainment that comic book superheroes represent. Unlike what one would expect of a title like ""Ghost Rider"" (and its themes of demons and ghosts), Johnson makes a story that owes more to adventure comic books and the Western serials of old than to the Faust myth, as he adds a good dose of tongue-in-cheek humor that lightens up things a lot. Johnson truly captures the feeling of a comic book in his story, but sadly it also carries the problems that this kind of stories have, like for example a very shallow characterization, several underdeveloped subplots, and a predictable and clichéd plot.<br/><br/>Now, while Johnson's work as a writer is average at best, he fares a tad better as a director, as he manages to bring to life his comic book adventure with all the wry humor and action he put on paper. As written above, Johnson's movie owes a lot to Western serials and pulp fiction, and this carries out to the visual style too, as even it makes a big nod to the Phantom Rider, the classic Western character that originated ""Ghost Rider"". Since the main character is literally a living skull on fire, the special effects had to be excellent, and fortunately, they are the best part of the film, as their creation of the rider and his fire is simply outstanding. Sadly, a movie can't be completely about special effects, and to his great misfortune, Johnson's skill as a director of real life actors are considerably inferior to his skill at making great visuals.<br/><br/>Nicolas Cage is surprisingly effective as Johnny Blaze (an improvement over his disastrous performance in the remake of ""The Wicker Man""), and against all odds makes a convincing tortured antihero with a very black humor. Peter Fonda and Donal Logue are also pretty good in their small roles, although the real highlight of the film is Sam Elliott, who plays the mysterious Caretaker of the local cemetery. They all make great jobs in their arguably underwritten characters, but sadly, the film is also plagued by awful performances, starting with the one given by Eva Mendes, whom at best feels severely out of place, and at worst looks like an amateur trying to act. Definitely not her best moment. The other cast member who brings the movie down is sadly Wes Bentley, who not only isn't remotely memorable as the main villain, but also overacts to the point of ridicule.<br/><br/>While certainly the bad performance of some cast members hurt the film a lot, it must be said that there really wasn't a lot for them to work with, because as written above, the writing isn't exactly the best material and no matter how good one actor is, the quality of the script will play a major role in the final output. This is specially obvious in the way Johnson fleshed out his villains, as if some characters are insipid, the villains here are dull, uninspired and serve no other purpose that to let the hero show off how amazing he is. A good villain has a definite personality and in ""Ghost Rider"" they only exist to look good, and that's a real damage to the movie, as there's never a real sense of danger with such weak counterparts for the hero. The complete opposite are Fonda and Elliott's characters, whom are easily the best thing about the film.<br/><br/>Despite all its flaws, I enjoyed ""Ghost Rider"" for what it was: an action movie with a touch of the Western genre meant to translate the fun and entertainment of comic book adventures to film. I probably liked it more that I should have, but that's mainly because while it certainly lacks a lot of quality, it had a lot of heart, and sometimes that's all that matters. Not a particularly good movie, but it is a good ride. 6/10"
"funkyfry","7","4","6","9 October 2007"," good campy film
","Nobody will be saying that ""Ghost Rider"" is the best cinematic achievement of 2007 in future years. But I will personally say it was one of the more enjoyable films to see at a drive-in, and it does hold up pretty well with a few drinks and a DVD as well. Cage is in full-on Elvis mode in this film; he even resurrects the famous finger point from ""Wild at Heart"" for this film. It's great to see Cage in a fun movie again, and he seems to be having fun in it  his performance as stunt-rider Johnny Blaze, who made a crooked deal with the devil to save his father from cancer and is now forced to become the devil's bounty-hunter, has just the right amount of dignity and humor. The way the film is set up basically makes it a ""white trash"" superhero movie. Cage is paired with Eva Mendez, who plays his high-school sweetheart who he had to leave because of his deal with Mephistopheles (Peter Fonda). Yes, the devil truly is a main character in this film, and his son (Wes Bentley) gets in on the action too; after his escape Blaze is sent to hunt him down and bring him to the devil's own justice.<br/><br/>The Rider's coolest trick is when he looks into the eyes of a criminal and cause the evildoer to feel all the pain of his victims. Oh yeah, and let's not forget the fact that his head turns into a burning skull. He's also got a really cool bike, I guess. I don't really know because I'm not a big car/bike person. But what I did enjoy was the carnival setting for the early scenes and the way that theme carried over to the modern sequences  Johnny Blaze is definitely a show-off, but in a fun way. I liked the silly scene where he stops traffic to declare his love for Mendez' character.<br/><br/>I guess what really sells the film for me is Fonda as the devil and Sam Elliott as his nemesis representing the forces of good. This is smart B-movie-making, giving the audience 2 polar opposite authority figures and casting them with dynamic iconic actors who can hold the kind of weight on screen that such a role demands. This is reminiscent of George Lucas' casting for Star Wars, with iconic actors Peter Cushing and Alec Guinness holding down these types of authority roles in his film, and a lot of films followed this lead with varying degrees of success. Here it is particularly pleasing because of the iconic associations between Fonda and the ""bad boy"" biker scene of the 1960s through his association with ""Easy Rider"" and Elliott's association with Western films which is another element of this film's fantasy. <br/><br/>The secondary villains played by Bentley and others were far less effective and made me feel a bit like I was watching some kind of television fantasy like ""Charmed."" The scene where they went into a honky-tonk reminded me very much of ""Terminator 2"" except for the fact that Bentley doesn't have the kind of screen presence to make the scene memorable. This is the only aspect of the film that just didn't work for me.<br/><br/>Since I have some space I will respond to some of the comments on this board -- it seems like some people are trying to analyze it far too much and make sense of things that in my opinion are just humorous and silly and therefore enjoyable. One person even complained that it wasn't a superior film in the mold of ""Pan's Labrynth."" It is pretty amazing to think that this movie cost over $100 million, and this type of extreme action/fantasy story would have been done on a much lower budget and received much less scrutiny in the pre-Star Wars age. So many ""blockbusters"" take themselves too seriously. I saw this the same night at the same drive-in where I saw ""Spider-Man 3"" and this film was very fresh, fun, and suitably light compared to that film. It takes itself just seriously enough that kids will enjoy the action and scares while adults will easily see the intentional humor. I can understand if someone didn't like the movie because it's not the type of thing that everyone enjoys and, as I said, in another age these kind of movies didn't get the kind of criticism they get now because they didn't have the same stars as ""serious"" movies and they didn't have the huge budget and exposure that they do now. Nobody slammed ""Planet of the Vampires"" because they saw the star of the movie in some kind of serious drama one time and felt that he was ""slumming."" But we don't have ""B movie stars"" anymore, and I respect an actor like Cage who obviously knows his craft and applies his skills in a way that's appropriate to the subject matter and style of any film he's involved in. I'm fine with movies about dudes with names like ""Spider-Man"" and ""Bat-Man"" that want to make some kind of point about the fleeting nature of fame, personal responsibility, right and wrong, etc. Whatever. But it's pretty ridiculous that so many people nowadays actually EXPECT a fantasy movie to be some kind of treatise on morality or some kind of dramatic character story. Maybe it's because movies like ""LOTR"" actually pulled it off, but I don't go into every fantasy movie expecting an epic discourse on the nature of good and evil. This is just a film about a biker dude with a flaming skull and a magic bike. If you go into this film just expecting a campy thrill-ride I don't think you'll be disappointed. It's a feast for the eyes and it has a charming way of approaching the more ridiculous aspects of the story."
"jvdk151","8","4","6","8 August 2007"," fun
","If you go to see a movie just to analyze how everything is done, and to find out what mistakes are in it, just stay at home. It's fun, the film could need a little bid more depth. The transformation in the ghost rider after the first time could be better, but for the rest, it's nothing more than fun. Forget everything, don't think to much and have a good time. You'll have a good time, if you like the kind of movies naturally. if I have to compare him with resent others? It's not like the x-men - that's made with a higher budget, but he's certainly worth more than the spider-man movie's, he's like daredevil. I've rented the film, a week later, returned and bought him."
"TheFabulousThomasJ","9","4","6","29 July 2007"," WOW!!! What A Great Film!!!
","I missed Ghost Rider when originally released in theaters, so I received the DVD as a party gift.<br/><br/>I sat down this evening to watch it finally, with a bit of trepidation.<br/><br/>Surprise, surprise, as Gomer Pyle used to say; this is one delightful amusement park ride.<br/><br/>Nicolas Cage is Johnny Blaze, small-time circus daredevil, who in his younger days, made a deal with Mephistopheles (a quietly menacing Peter Fonda) to cure his father of cancer, in exchange for his soul. Deal done, young Johnny's father soon dies of a cycle mishap.<br/><br/>Good ole Mephistopheles! Grown now, Johnny Blaze gets wilder and wilder with each new cycle stunt; of course, with the devil on his side, he has no fear, thus becoming the hero to one and all.<br/><br/>But ole Hot Pants Himself is not quite done with him; see, there's an outstanding contract of a town who gave their souls in greed, and that contract is missing. The collector absconded with the document, and Mephistopheles' son, Blackheart (a deliciously evil Wes Bentley) wants that contract, so he can become the new Big Kahuena.<br/><br/>Thus, Johnny Blaze becomes Ghost Rider, the devil's bounty hunter, and in spectacular fashion, he literally becomes his last name.<br/><br/>Sam Elliot, steady as she goes, is the wise older man who seems to know about all that is going on with Johnny's situation, and steps in to lend a hand and dispense advice.<br/><br/>The action is thrilling, the special effects are spectacular (talk about 'flying down the highway with your hair on fire!'), and the wonderful editing of this film swoops and soars effortlessly.<br/><br/>There's not one wasted scene; Ghost Rider is a lean, mean dancing machine of stella mysteriosa and verve of the highest order.<br/><br/>Normally, this type of film is not my cup of tea, but wow! I'm a believer, now! Kudos to all involved!"
"pilot_dan_98","8","4","6","19 June 2007"," Interesting Movie
","I watched this movie not sure what to expect. It actually was a good movie with some really good actors. It had that western type feel but at the same time a religious type feel. Nicolas Cage does a fantastic job of bringing the comic to life and Sam Elliot puts that western yet philosophical feel to it. I do recommend this movie to anyone who just wants to see a good movie and has an open mind. It has lots of action and keeps your attention. The movie also had some surprises to it but you have to watch for them through the movie. Eva Mendes does a great job also of playing her role. My only question now is will there be a second one."

I think that the only bad thing about this movie was the acting for the last 10 minutes. But other than that, it was a great movie. There were great special effects, a really good story, and enough action to keep me entertained. I love this movie. I think that it is one of my five all-time favorite comic book movies of all time. In order, it is Batman Begins, X-men 3, Ghost Rider, Spider-man 2, and then Spider-man. Those are my five favorite comic book movies ever made. I give special effects a 10, acting a 9, action 10, and story/script 10. All in all, I loved this movie. One of my five favorite so far this year next to 300, Disturbia, Pirates 3, then Ghost Rider, and then Blades of Glory. I love this movie and I think that it is incredibly underrated and that all the critics are wrong. 10/10."

","Went to watch this with some trepidation having read the dismal reviews, but I thought It cant be that bad, I mean, its got motorbikes, and Nicolas Cage with his head on fire.......<br/><br/>Well, very glad I went. This was an excellent thrill ride of a movie, straight to the point, simple but effective plot and wonderful visual effects. I really can't fault any of it (although Mr Cage didn't look quite like the Mr Cage we're used to, must be the dentures and dodgy hairpiece) <br/><br/>They've turned a comic fantasy into a highly enjoyable full tilt movie blast.......with motorbikes and Nicolas Gage with his head on fire."
"Elswet","9","4","6","7 March 2007"," Perfect Capture of Characters
","I'm a comic book fan. Ghost Rider is one which many collectors and readers found obscure in comparison to many, but it was always one of my personal favorites.<br/><br/>As such, I expected an effects-extravaganza, a good performance from Cage, and a barely palatable story line. You know...the usual.<br/><br/>Well, I'm happy to say that I got more than I bargained for with Ghost Rider. The effects were beautiful-lovingly done, and the performances by all involved were exemplary...that was no surprise; with a cast like Sam Elliott and Nicolas Cage, I would never expect anything less. But the STORY. THAT was what caught me by surprise.<br/><br/>You know, a comic book series-any comic book series-is constructed of a chronologically progressive story. Sure, there are prequels and spin-offs, flash-backs, flash-forwards, and even a few that flash sideways, but the base story line goes from beginning to end. Therefore, it has been difficult for many screenwriters, studio executives, directors, and producers to commit comic book lines to film. A few have done it successfully. Batman Begins, X-Men the Franchise, and Spiderman are about the best, in my opinion. I had serious issues with the new ""Super-""man, but that's for another review.<br/><br/>In Ghost Rider, the story doesn't attempt to do too much, and thereby, does not contain the huge holes, missing chronological chunks, base characters, and/or supporting cast members. This story is about Johnny Blaze, what he was, and what he becomes.<br/><br/>It is also a beautiful homage to the idea of ""Passing on the Torch,"" in its inclusion of the Sam Elliott character.<br/><br/>This movie was probably THE best comic book movie I've ever seen. It wasn't the flashiest. It didn't have the most KABOOM effects. It didn't give you the most kills, or the best splatter. This movie was a story-driven, graphically supported vehicle, which superbly entertains.<br/><br/>Beyond that, however, is the fact that the writers here have epitomized Ghost Rider's principal characters; Blackheart and Blaze. This demonstrates more than the embodiment of the heart and fire of these characters-it captured their essence.<br/><br/>My one gripe? Okay, I thought that Elliott should have ridden into the town with Cage. Okay, I said it.<br/><br/>I absolutely loved this movie, and cannot WAIT for another.<br/><br/>It rates an 8.9/10 from...<br/><br/>the Fiend :."

","as far as comic book adaptations go,this is not a bad movie,i can't say how accurate it is to its source material,but i didn't mind it.it's basically about a young motorcycle stuntman named Johnny Blaze.as a young man.johnny is tricked into selling his soul to the devil for reasons revealed in the movie.years later,the devil calls upon his services as ""Ghost Rider"" a flame skulled entity from the dark side who is basically the devil's bounty hunter.i liked this movie quite a bit,although it seemed a bit rushed.i think they could have fleshed it out a bit more.but to be fair,there is some voice over narration in the film,which does provide an overview of the whole Ghost Rider Legend.if you're a fan of the comic,you probably know all you need to know.Nic Cage,as the older Johnny Blaze/Ghost Rider is well cast.he seems to suit the role well and is believable(in the context of the movie).i like the music.it went well with the movie.there is a lot of action in the movie and some cgi,which is well done,but not groundbreaking or anything.(although Ghost Rider's flaming skull was kinda cool)The beautiful and talented Eva Mendes plays the love interest,but her screen time is far too short.her character should have had more to do.she is very charismatic,so the scenes she was in left me wanting more.oh, well,hopefully her character will play a larger role in the sequel.as for the movie itself,my friend and i had free passes,so i can't really complain.it is a fun movie to watch,but doesn't linger long after viewing.i will go see the sequel when it comes out,as i believe it will probably improve on this one. 8/10"

Actually thought to be fair, it had some good music at different parts in the film and the effects were pretty good, but that was pretty much the height of the good, well other than playing rock paper scissors with my friends near the end which was great craic :p.

","I loved this movie! It was totally thrilling! I haven't read any of the Ghost Rider comics but maybe I will when I have a chance to. This movie has many brilliant visual effects! Including the way the Ghost Rider looks with his flaming skull and skeletal hands and when the Ghost Rider rides his flaming motorcycle at breakneck speeds leaving a trail of fire and destruction. I also liked the Ghost Rider's signature weapon, a flaming chain! It was also brilliant the way the Ghost Rider rides his flaming motorcycle across the surface of a river and up tall skyscrapers! Nicolas Cage was brilliant in his performance as Johnny Blaze, the motorcycle stunt rider who changes into the Ghost Rider. There were also two veteran actors in this film, Peter Fonda who plays Mephistopheles, and Sam Elliot who plays this mysterious ""Caretaker"". Ghost Rider's archenemy is a demon lord and the son of Satin named Blackheart played by Wesley Bentley. Another of the main cast members is Eva Mendes who plays Johnny's love interest Roxanne, and she is certainly a very beautiful actress. As I already said this movie has brilliant visual effects, but I'll admit some of the visual effects are gruesome, especially when Johnny Blaze transforms into the Ghost Rider for the first time. I like other supernatural antiheroes like Spawn and Hellboy, but I think Ghost Rider is the ultimate supernatural antihero! So if you like comic book antiheroes then I highly recommend that you see this movie!"

However, this film is bad, It's what we were told Employee of the Month would be.<br/><br/>The film contains numerous Clichés, each one cheesier than the other. For the first 20 minutes I thought I was watching something that you would find on Youtube, made by American teenagers, who found their daddies video camera. The Acting is just so bad. In fact the theme of bad acting carries on through out the film, with only Nicholas Cage (Blaze) managing to give a believable performance, and then again it's not that good.<br/><br/>The story itself is pretty bad. A young Blaze is sitting working on his bike thinking about his ill father. Suddenly a STRANGER appears out of nowhere, telling him he will heal his father in exchange for the young boys soul, (Pedo alert). The kid obviously agrees, and signs his soul away no question asked. later on in life he realises that he is the Ghost Rider, and must defend the world from the evil BlackHeart (Wes Bentley). Whilst still trying to win back the heart of his once childhood girlfriend (Eva Mendes). Makes you want to burn the theatre just listening to it.<br/><br/>However, this film does have soon (well one) good point. Now don't get excited, cause really it's not a surprise. Yes thats right, the special FX. These are very good, and are what really got me interested in the film. When I first heard of it i thought; ""How are they going to make Nicholas Cage look as if he's on fire"". Well i can tell you they did a good job. There not ground breaking, but still pretty good. Also they've done a good job on the element guys, (Earth, Water and Air). All of which are very well done. These are the reason why I give it a mid mark instead of below. I thought all of the SFX team shouldn't go unappreciated for their efforts. It's not their fault the script and acting is vile.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'll leave you to contemplate what I've said, and make up your own mind.

I normally don't criticize movies like this, and like movies a lot of people might think are bad, but this is going too far. This movie should not have been released. It was incredibly drawn out, which isn't surprising given the fact that they had to take no story and stretch it over a couple of hours. The previews make it look bad enough, but if you see the movie you will discover the degree of awfulness this movie possesses. Take my word, don't put yourself through it.

","My wife and I went and sat for Ghostrider this weekend and really enjoyed ourselves. Sure, some of the dialogue was overwrought and took itself too seriously but I really think Cage's performance more than balanced that out. This is a movie that with some dialogue changes would have been amazingly good but just ended up being an entertaining sit. In some of the reviews I read they mentioned Cage's character wearing a black Elvis wig. That wasn't in the version we saw at all. Perhaps part of why we enjoyed it so much was that we hadn't been exposed to the source material so we were able to enjoy Cage's version of Johnny Blaze more than if we'd gone in with a characterization already in mind."

Electra was the son of that crap. Spidey 2 left a sour taste in the mouth, so did X3 and Superman Returns we all know that that is one Superman that should be shot. Ghost rider was surprisingly good.<br/><br/>My suggestion: Watch it and make your own decision. Don't flame it as a 0 star movie because as I mentioned there are a lot worse out there. It's what I call a ""Saturday night Movie"": enjoyable, fun and entertaining."

","I actually registered to IMDb to give this comment. Don't waste your time with this movie. It's the most annoying, dumb and worst movie (3 in 1) I've ever seen. I really mean it. As said before me, no plot, no good visuals. Looks like a 9 Year old's bad dream. I can imagine this worked as a comic book, but not as a movie, for sure. I can't believe such movies can appear in the theaters nowadays. And finally, how come Mr. Cage plays in such a bad movie??? He is one of my favorite actors, with a lot of good titles, e. g. The Weather Man, Matchstick Men, e.t.c. So, even if you have seen these, you better re-watch them, instead of giving a try to this one. I actually watched it till the end only because I did hope that it will still get somewhere later. Believe me. It did not."

","At various points during this movie, the trite villain Blackheart kills people in cold blood by pushing his icy fingers in their hearts. This frozen emptiness where the heart should be in a way sums up this dreadful adaptation. Blackheart murders many people in cold blood and we, the audience, are not supposed to feel anything about it. By far the worst instance of this is when (Ghost Rider) Johnny Blaze's best friend (and the one character in the whole film who is sympathetically drawn) is murdered in said fashion in front of GR. GR sheds no tears about him and he is never again even mentioned. His death and those of others has no other function but merely to show us the badness of Blackheart who would otherwise be a faintly comical white-faced Goth. This callousness extends elsewhere in the movie. At the start, Johnny Blaze's dad is killed by Mephistopheles after being on screen for what must be less than a minute in total and speaking about two sentences. Since we do not see the bond between father and son, the father's death, which is of cardinal importance to the storyline, is thus robbed of any emotional power beyond Johnny's melodramatic scream of ""nooooooo""! Likewise perfunctory is the treatment of Johnny's girl, Roxanne, which in some ways is the most hilarious aspect of this unintentionally funny film. Having watched Johnny diligently carved ""Johnny & Roxanne 4 ever"" in a tree, she then informs him she has to leave him at her parents request. He objects and suggests they ride off together into the sunset. However, at the appointed time, and having become the devil's apprentice, he leaves her standing under the tree.<br/><br/>This frankly makes little sense, but worse is to come.<br/><br/>A year having passed but everyone having aged at least 20 years, she is now a TV reporter while Johnny is a stunt cyclist. An inept comedy sequence ensues with Johnny eventually getting a date. Alas, he finds himself turning to fire (Not surprising considering Nicholas Cage's wooden performance) and goes on his first Ghost ride, leaving her in the lurch yet again.<br/><br/>Roxanne turns up at his place the next day (somehow getting in-) and throws herself at him! He then reveals his is the emissary of Satan which has her leaving yet again.<br/><br/>An odd scene with Blaze being arrested and thus having to reluctantly fight prisoners is next. It is hilarious and I wonder if it is not some kind of tribute to a similar scene in the even more inept Death Wish 3 film?<br/><br/>Another ghost ride ensues with the usual clichés -swat teams, helicopters, etc. This is of course witnesses by Roxanne who realises at once that the flaming headed cyclist is actually her Johnny. Blackheart notices this and announces ""now we know his weakness. Hmmmmm."" a classic of movie badness.<br/><br/>I could go on. The script is so inept that you wonder if anyone actually read it. We are supposed to have a villain who has acquired a power so potent that it can literally bring about Hell on Earth yet Ghost Rider is able to defeat him ....<br/><br/>...by looking him in the eye!"

"fortey","2","5","9","11 October 2007"," Yet More Nic Cage Fun
","We should all know the plot of the movie by now. Forget that. Instead, let's appreciate some hidden gems this movie had to offer.<br/><br/><ul><li>The Devil can wander the Earth at will. He can take your soul and make you a fire-headed demon bounty hunter. He can cure cancer and then have you die in a motorcycle accident. What he cannot do is take a piece of paper out of the handle of a shovel that belongs to the Ghost Rider he made himself.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Despite any preconceived notions you may have about Hell and the potential for many millions of burning souls therein, apparently the real power lies in some little backwater town. Those souls are extra juicy or some such and they will lead to all manner of badness. Need specifics? Well, you can't have them. The movie doesn't offer any so you'll just have to trust that for some reason, apparently, it would be bad if the Devil got like 1,000 souls from this little town that slaughtered itself, never mind the bajillion other souls that would have conceivably made their way into his hands over the course of human history. I don't wanna split hairs but I think the most heinous thing that ever happened in human history was not some middle of nowhere crap town offing itself.</li></ul><br/><br/>-Nicolas Cage can stand and point like no other. In fact, throughout this movie he will take up the awkward and curiously head-scratch inducing pose of standing and pointing at others many, many times.<br/><br/>-Young Johnny Blaze and his girl defy the very nature of reality as we understand it. How so, you ask? Well, they inexplicably were both 18 together, yet Nicolas Cage ends up aging far faster than Eva Mendes when they're adults. Cage is actually only about 10 years older, but thanks to genetics he looks about 20 years older. Good casting, guys! Pat yourselves on the back.<br/><br/><ul><li>I'm Roxanne Simpson, on scene.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>For those who loved The Wicker Man (and who didn't?) you'll be pleased with the prison scene in this film, in which Nic Cage is back in fightin' form, swinging wildly at the group of thugs who want to molest him, or whatever. Watch out thugs, he's flaming! - This movie shows real love by the filmmakers. What kind of love? Love for the same lame special effect. In this case, it's a morph applied over an actor's face. It happens to almost every single key character in the film, in fact. From the obvious Ghost Rider, we also get to experience it with the Caretaker, Mephistopheles, Blackheart and his 3 useless as all get out, totally unoriginal and laughably pathetic cronies. They all morph back and forth from regular joe to some toothy character and back.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>You may not be aware, but the son of the Devil is an effeminate Goth boy.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>You may also not be aware that the Devil is about as menacing as an insurance salesman.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Nicolas Cage's hair will most likely distract you in every scene. Lately it seems like they try to give him a new, awkward hair piece in every movie int he hopes that one day they'll stumble on an appealing look, but they missed the mark a little here. It resembles the back of an angry badger, prickled up and ready to strike at any moment.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>When Ghost Rider first uses his flamey montage power on a random street thug, we're treated to what may be the most bizarre scene ever in a film, in which a chunky goth girl describes Ghost Rider for the camera. Like something out of a poor sitcom, devoid of laugh track so you know you weren't wrong in thinking it wasn't funny, that one moment stands head and shoulders above all others in the movie as a triumph of awkward, bizarre choices that were made in the making of this movie. Why does it exist? We don't know. Is it...light? Funny? Did someone write this and laugh? Does God hate me? Such questions will plague you for a good 10 minutes after watching the film, after which you'll just stop caring.</li></ul><br/><br/>I could go on, but many other aspects were already covered. I will, however, give a superfluous nod to the stab wound vs gun shot debacle. Why that happens, no one can explain I'm sure. But it's just more icing on this very, very bad cake."
"ramificating","7","5","9","5 June 2007"," You can't complain if you knew from the start it was going to be about a skeleton on fire riding a motorcycle.
","Having seen this film, I must say it's probably not the best Marvel film, not even close but when you look at the others, there's one thing fans should draw into perspective: Previous Marvel films like Fantastic 4, Daredevil, the Punisher and now Spider-man 3 all did bad(not putting the box office inconsideration) due to the fact that they tried to be too serious and spun out of control turning every moment in the film into something cheesy, unfunny, unrealistic and unnecessary which made those films do bad and not succeed viewer's expectations. This film did the opposite, it was intentional with the cheesiness, unrealism, and humor and in my opinion portioned it out well, so it wasn't over the top much like those other films. It also was more controlled and stayed in its limitations and didn't make a running gag go to long to the point it was lame or embarrassing to watch like those other films did, such as spider-man 3, with spider-man dancing in the streets or Fantastic four having Johnny Storm doing bike tricks at a stadium and coming up with the groups names - very unconvincingly; Doctor Doom with his one liners and Daredevil with Matt Murdock's unrealistic montage.<br/><br/>Why else do you think with the Ghost rider film, they created new villains (aka the fallen) instead of doing what every other marvel film did and take them out of the comics to draw in more fans? Because it's not suppose to be taken so seriously and its not suppose to be 100% based off the comics. They don't want to waste fans' times with big villains like sandman and venom just popping up for no reason and doing barely anything to the storyline.<br/><br/>In my opinion the whole purpose to the film was to see a skeleton on fire fighting demons and riding his motorbike, why do you think they delayed the film from 2006 to 2007? So Ghost rider would look great on the big screen, not so the story could be developed better or the acting be improved. Your not paying money for good acting or a great storyline your paying to see exactly what the title advertise's and if your not happy then you shouldn't of ever assumed in the first place such an unimaginable thing could be a realistic very well made blockbuster like Little Miss Sunshine (odd comparison, I know) or the Matrix or batman begins(not realistic but was as realistic as you could get a character like that to be)<br/><br/>So see this film for what the title actually advertise's and not for what you'd expect it to be."
"Aaron1375","8","5","9","23 February 2007"," A super high concept movie that will move you to tears and change your life, no...still a fun ride all the same.
","Yes this movie was probably in the end a pure popcorn flick that many will hate, however I thought it was a good fun movie. Rather nice treatment for a comic book hero that isn't exactly super well known or famous. Ghost Rider blazes on the big screen and the effects are rather good considering the character of Ghost Rider is essentially a skeleton in leather riding a motorcycle and he is on fire. The story seems to combine the two Ghost Riders I am familiar with from the marvel universe...the first one was Johnny Blaze who sold his soul to the devil. The second one being more a spirit of vengeance who used his stare to show evildoers the wrongs they have committed. I thought Cage was rather good in his role as were the other actors...I mean this is a comic book movie not an Oscar caliber movie we are talking about here. So all in all it is fun, could have used maybe a little more Ghost Rider here and there and perhaps a trim or two here or there to cut the running time, for the most part there are very few complaints by me. Ghost Rider is a comic I collected at one time, so it is kind of cool to see him on the big screen. However, don't go by my review alone in determining whether you will see this flick, as I love comic book adapted movies to a fault...that and horror so I may like stuff other more casual fans may not."
"Moovybuff","7","5","9","17 February 2007"," Not your average ""comic book"" movie (mild spoilers)
","Admittedly I'm an avid viewer of movies based on comics, having grown up in a house where comics were my brothers' major source of reading. Considering the comic at hand, I was afraid that this would be a sad addition to quite an impressive repertoire of Marvel Comic based films.<br/><br/>I couldn't be more wrong. The impression you get when the movie starts is a big question mark; and not in the good way. But once the ball starts rolling, you become very intrigued with the path that the movie might take, and where Nick's character will go.<br/><br/>Brilliant casting was done to this film, particularly with Sam Elliot; Wes Bentley; Peter Fonda; and most definitely Nicolas Cage, who brings such fire---no pun intended---into Johnny Blaze that you wonder what he'll experience in the next scene.<br/><br/>There's more to this movie than action hero in spandex with personal troubles. This is an Evel Knievel hero in a leather jacket with paranormal problems. It's not the typical Marvel movie that's meant for Stan Lee fans (who doesn't make his usual Marvel film cameo), but it can also be for those into cult and fantasy genre movies due to the fascinating demonic themes.<br/><br/>A high positive in this movie is the eye candy; in more ways than one. Yes, we all know about Eva Mendes (who I honestly think the movie would have gone better without maybe), and there are certainly some pretty good looking men to stare at (Nicolas Cage in leather pants), but the CGI is most definitely visually appealing. It perhaps can seem a bit overwhelming at times, but with the way it's utilized is a big contributing factor to the picture's greatness.<br/><br/>I would most certainly recommend this movie to someone, especially if you're craving a comic book movie that isn't so cookie-cutter.<br/><br/>7/10."
"Quinoa1984","6","8","17","21 February 2007"," a possibility for the perennial MST3K movie of the year; it's bad, but it's consistently funny
","Did Mark Steven Johnson know what he was doing with Ghost Rider? More than anyone else, I'd figure. Yet it would be probably just as funny as the movie itself to see him try and work legitimate claims to big-action movie clout with this one. It makes Daredevil look classy in comparison, but in a way it's actually better than Daredevil in the point that matters- where Daredevil was just run of the mill, Ghost Rider is a horrendous exercise in the ludicrous in special effects, stunts, cheesy-bread dialog (look how far it stretches!), and Nicholas Cage's ultimate decline as an actor. By this account I shouldn't recommend, but...damn it all if it isn't worth seeing once; it's like a disposable item bought from a mall that works great once in the worst possible ways, and then probably never will again. Unlike some of the bad movies from last year (i.e. Apocalypto, Lady in the Water), it doesn't totally offend the sensibilities even through its numerous faults. Actually, a part of me WAS offended, as I thought seeing it 'this is what action movies based on comic books have come to, good Lord', but the other part of me, that was expecting it to be bad, had a lot of fun in savoring every trashy, campy, whatever-the-f*** moment.<br/><br/>And how about Nicolas Cage, huh? Summoned from the spotty parts he's gone to in the dozen years since he nabbed an Oscar, he plays Johnny Blaze, a character who might be one of the dumbest characters in modern movies, and who's motivations amount to 'I love to ride, I love my girl from my teenage years, and I hate the son of Satan (played by Wes Bentley, who's another sign of the decline of the American Beauty kids), and I got to lift the curse from Mephastopheles'. So, he's turned into the Ghost Rider, a creation of visual effects and cheesy grit that COULD actually be a legitimate marvel, but ends up being better for laughs, all unintentional I'd guess. But all the while though- and I might actually give credit to the filmmaker and star(s) for this- they don't make it necessarily a dull-bad movie. Few things get more entertaining than seeing how Ghost Rider vanquishes with his fiery whip his un-dead foes, including one who is made of wind! Or just the appearances of Peter Fonda and Sam Elliot, actors who might've been amazing at one time or another, but now seem like extreme caricatures (I was almost expecting Big Lebowski quotes in the dialog/voice-overs of Elliot's). And Eva Mendes becomes almost a counterpoint for Cage's plastic, trying-to-break-cardboard performance.<br/><br/>But there's a lot of great lines to go with the wacky visuals too, as the inanities of style and substance start to go hand in hand (i.e. the cops just seem to know without much evidence that Johnny Blaze is responsible for the first set of crimes when he becomes Ghost Rider the first time, or when Ghost Rider rides up the side of a building). And by the end, my friends and I couldn't help ourselves, and went full-blown into what had already been happening for a while watching the flick- we became like the characters of Mystery Science Theater 3000, making wisecracks at every turn when not busting a gut over Bentley's turn into being ""Legion...We are MANY!"". The material just lends itself completely to that kind of deconstruction, yet that's what ends up making it not a complete waste of celluloid at the same time. Well, some would argue it is a waste, and they might not be wrong, but what a waste! It's probably up there in the ranks of the most shamelessly entertaining train-wreck Hollywood spectacles, right up there with the likes of Howard the Duck and Zardoz. Just don't, for goodness sakes, expect a respectable adaptation from original source to screen."
"JoeytheBrit","Null","4","7","1 July 2008"," One of those guilty pleasures...
","If ever a film looked like a cert for the thumbs down this is it. Nic Cage, an actor of limited ability with a propensity for wearing ill-fitting wigs, in an effects-heavy adaptation of a lesser-known comic-book character. Early indications gave me no reason to hope for anything better but then, after half-an-hour or so of fairly clunky exposition something strange started to happen: it started to be fun<br/><br/>Make no bones about it, this isn't a well made film but, like all good films that know that they're bad, it doesn't worry too much about pleasing those looking for polished performances, meaningful dialogue and semiotics. In fact, like a hairy biker gunning his engine, it raises a finger at all those with lofty expectations and goes its own delirious way. This is a film about a skeleton with its head on fire, after all.<br/><br/>Cage gives exactly the same performance he has given in every film he has ever made. His syrup sits atop his head like a fat lazy spider dreaming of the time it spied its soul mate perched atop Elton John's dome. Its difficult to be sure whether Cage is trying to play it straight in order to raise laughs or not  perhaps he didn't even know himself. Perhaps director Johnson told him to play it straight knowing it was a sure way of winning laughs. Either way, Cage is at his least irritating here. Eva Mendes doesn't have much to do but looks delicious doing it in a succession of tight-fitting outfits. Peter Fonda makes one of film history's more insipid Satans, while the guy who plays his errant son fares little better. Sam Elliott plays the crusty caretaker of a cemetery who appears to be based on Clint Eastwood's western characters and shares an exhilarating night-time race across the desert with the Ghost Rider to the strains of Ghost Riders in the Sky.<br/><br/>This is one of those films that wants you to crack open a beer, kick back, and empty your brain before the opening credits end. Watch it on its own terms and you're sure to have a blast."

As someone who has been a fan of Ghostrider (no, not some snot nosed punk who picked up one issue after his mommy paid for his blackbelt at the YMCA) I can honestly say that although very different and somewhat ""campy"" compared to the comic, this was an enjoyable version of the concept and if you watch the extras you can appreciate the effort and time put into the movie by the entire staff to make something visually fun.

The inclusion of Phantom Rider (The unofficial original Ghost Rider) was a cool touch! And Peter Fonda as Mephisto was a wonderful nod to the ultimate classic biker movie, Easy Rider! And Fonda pulled off the whole 'source of all evil' thing quite nicely.<br/><br/>All in all, The movie had good balance of character development and action. There's only a couple minor quibbles I have, and those are pretty much unimportant comic book purist geekery.<br/><br/>1) Ghost Rider burning/melting/blowing up everything by just simply riding down the road, not to mention setting everything on fire everywhere he goes... makes for a funny Jackson Hewitt commercial, but it's not practical for a superhero (or antihero in this case) to make more collateral damage than any good.<br/><br/>2) Blackheart almost seemed to mirror Deacon Frost from the Blade movie, except instead of a hip goateed gen-x'er, you got a Marilyn Manson wannabe that was slightly more powerful. Heck, even his big ""power up moment"" in the final climactic battle was taken directly from Blade, complete with ghosts flying into his body and turning the whites of his eyes red. I was hoping he'd morph into the giant dreadlocked lizard thing like he is in the comics during the final battle.<br/><br/>3) Texas *IS NOT* Arizona. Texas is mainly ugly, flat plains full of rocks, crusty dead grass, and scrub bush. Not sand and cactus.<br/><br/>Anyways, in the end, great movie. I might just see it again!

There are some folks who just lose the kid inside where you forget what it was like to invite a good friend over to the house, listen to tunes, read comics, gossip and eat candy and slurp down some sodas. I don't know about you, but I think it would be wicked cool to ride a flaming bike like that up the side of a skyscraper. Sure Traffic, Million Dollar Baby and American Beauty are good movies. You also leave them wanting to jump off of a bridge. I've always loved Sam Elliot and his narration and then portrayal of a key Texas Ranger like character couldn't be better. I liked seeing Peter Fonda again as the devil. Fonda isn't as good as his sister but it was still good to see him in a film again. Eva Mendez was good but I would have liked to see them beef up her part a bit....and I don't know how they squeezed her into her outfit. And of course Cage does all of the Cage type of things that we have come to love and expect. The special effects are fun but I certainly wouldn't rate them as A list.<br/><br/>So don't go see this movie with adult types (people who have forgotten how to think like kids).

Innocent, as innocence goes and great acting, ""Roxie,"" with ""Johnny-Nick-Cage-Blaze"" (BTW, Nick, my faith is restored-excellent acting and glad you got the part).<br/><br/>Thank you, thank you, thank you producers, cast, writers, Marvel, everyone, for creating, doing, acting and putting your hearts and souls in Ghost Rider.<br/><br/>No lame-horse acting and no broke-down script in Ghost Rider. Loved it! Will see it again and again."

","This movie is like porridge. It's easy to consume, yet offers no interesting taste, gives a false sense of being full before it continues its journey and finally ends up where it belongs. Leaving no special memories or useful nutritions behind.<br/><br/>It's the story about how the Marvels comic book character Ghost Rider became the Ghost Rider, by selling his soul to the Devil. And how he challenges his own curse in the name of goodness. Sounds kinda cool, and should have been cool. I loved the recent movies of Batman, Spiderman, Superman and most of the rest of them. But, this one is all dumbed down for the masses, and with some totally out of place romance added so that the movie makers wont risk losing money from your girlfriend refusing to see the movie with you.<br/><br/>Yep, it's the classic money press Hollywood style movie. Take a comic book brand, mix with a famous actor, add some special effects, action and romance. Oh, and don't forget that sweet happy ending. Viola, you got yourself a safe little money machine. Only this time, it ironically lost all of its soul.<br/><br/>As most mainstream movie goers I like Nicholas Cage, and you will find him perform as usual. But, you will need to be less than five years old for this movie to provide any suspense or thrills. You have seen every single thing here before a million times. If you are easily amused it might give you a kick, but then again, you would probably be better off watching Tele Tubbies.<br/><br/>The special effects, which are the only possible reason I can think of to see the movie, are on par with what you can expect, although I was surprised to see some very poor budget movie'ish face morphing effects that gave me flashbacks from the early 90s. They wont blow you away, just barely keep you from falling asleep.<br/><br/>Tame, cowardly, boring and mostly an insult to the comic strip."
"tolkienmex","8","5","10","23 March 2007"," A surprisingly good film
","Ghost Rider Directed by: Mark Steven Johnson With: Nicholas Cage, Eva Mendes<br/><br/>2005 and 2006 weren't the best years for Nicolas Cage, his films: Lord of War, The Weather Man, The Ant Bully, WTC and The Wicker Man, were resounding box office failures. As a result, the actor desperately needed a movie to get him back to the superstar status that he once held in Hollywood's competitive environment.<br/><br/>That chance came with Ghost Rider, the film adaptation from Marvel's comic about a man who sold his soul to the devil and became something like Satan's payment collector. Yes, the plot is ridiculous, however, the film itself turns to be surprisingly good<br/><br/>The plot unleashes when motorcycle acrobat Johnny Blaze (Nicolas Cage) sells his soul in exchange for the mend of his father, sick with cancer. The buyer, a kind of comical mephistopheles (Peter Fonda) turns Johnny in a sort of hit man and ask him to finish off the rebel group that, lead by mephistopheles' own son, is trying to overthrow the devil and take his post.<br/><br/>At the center of this UFO-like plot, lies the lost contract for the property of 1,000 evil souls from the Town of San Venganza, seek by both mephistopheles and his bad-mannered son.<br/><br/>The main achievements of Ghost Rider are, doubtless, the special effects, that turn Blaze from an average guy to a scaring flame-surrounded skull, with a matched motorcycle.<br/><br/>The Director, Mark Steven, gives us an entertained product in the best way of the comics. A film that must be seen in a really big screen to fully appreciate its beauty.<br/><br/>Ghost Rider is a good omen for the herd of mega films coming this next summer. The year, at least for the popcorn eaters, has begun in a great way."
"jellyneckr","Null","5","10","24 February 2007"," A must see for comic fans
","I stated in my comment for last summer's X-Men: The Last Stand (a movie I loved the first and second viewings, and found many flaws with the third time around) that with 'Stand' and the preview for Ghost Rider that ""This could be the beginning of a long line of great Marvel pictures."" It seems that I was one of the only fans that thought so as the anticipation for Ghost Rider was lukewarm at best. Critics and moviegoers took notice of the delay from its summer release date and lambasted the unfinished special effects as well as the story. Still, I always maintained that the picture would be nothing short of great. It met my expectations. <br/><br/>Taking cues from the underrated and brilliant John Landis, Ghost Rider mixes comedy and elements of horror perfectly, combined with over-the-top action and an occasionally unusual sound track to form a truly different and highly entertaining motion picture. Simply put, it's the best John Landis-esquire film not to be directed by Landis himself. Writer/director Mark Steven Johnson, almost always reliable in the story department (with the exception of 1998's Jack Frost), provides the audience with the right amount of character development, back-story, and exposition to keep the two hour running time from getting bloated. Directing with attention to detail, Johnson has managed to make a comic book flick seem like an art form as opposed to just a blockbuster extravaganza. <br/><br/>However, credit must also be given to the amazing cast Johnson has put together. Nicolas Cage IS Johnny Blaze. There could have been no substitute. Eva Mendes as love interest Roxanne Simpson, is actually a character as opposed to just eye candy (although there is some of that). Wes Bentley makes for a fantastic villain. Last but not least, is Donal Logue, an actor who despite almost twenty years in the business, has yet to become the gigantic star he deserves to be. <br/><br/>As a fan of the comics, I was not disappointed. My only nit-pick is there were times when it was painfully obvious the filmmakers were forced to stay within the limits of the PG-13 rating (I don't remember a drop of blood in the whole picture). Rest assured, this is nowhere near being the cinematic atrocities of Fantastic Four and Hulk, which are two of the worst movies I have ever seen. This is a must see for comic fans. 9/10"

","Initially, there was no way in hell I was going to watch this movie. First, I didn't really like the actors in this movie. Second, I felt that the commercials were really cheesy. But it was a marvel film, so I them the benefit of the doubt. This movie was pretty good, I really enjoyed the story line, which is always the most important part of a movie to me is. The movie was pretty fast pace, from the intro to the end of the movie. It was fascinating enough that even the mediocre actors in this movie was ignored by me.<br/><br/>The special effects, sounds, music wasn't great.

"xfuneralofheartsx","10","5","10","18 February 2007"," Screw all of the nay-sayers!
","I, personally, think this is one of the greatest Marvel comic-to-movie adaptations of the last few years. Here's why: It's fun. Plain and simple. In a time where all of these movies are trying to take themselves too seriously, here comes Ghost Rider, a campy, fun, funny when it needs to be, comic book movie. Fantastic Four tried and failed. Daredevil may have been a little dark for some, same with Elektra. The last X-Men movie was full of political messages. But Ghost Rider is what it is. A throwback to when comics weren't as edgy as they are now.<br/><br/>In no way am I saying this is one of the greatest movies of all time, but, in comparison to other Marvel movies, this one is definitely a stand out and well worth the wait. When I saw it, everyone was having a good time, laughing when we needed to laugh, being frightened when we needed to be frightened, and just having fun with it, which is what the point of these movies are.<br/><br/>If you want to see a serious movie, don't see Ghost Rider. But if you want a good night out, with some action, some laughs and some horror (not a lot, but some), then go see Ghost Rider."

Peter Fondas portrayal of Mephistopheles (the devil) gave me the willies. There was no question as to how powerful he is by the way he walked and his seductive tone of voice. I'm glad they left the end open for a sequel. Although the story differs from the Marvel series, they did a great job with the altered story line. I WILL have this one when it's finally released on DVD. Ghost Rider was filled with action, suspense, humor, and horror all wrapped up in one great movie."

"noraa58","2","6","13","16 February 2007"," Terrible movie, absolute trash.
","This movie was god awful. Truly a terrible piece of garbage. I was (un)fortunate enough to have a seat for the ""WEST COAST PREMIER"" of the film held at Cal. State Long Beach (No Joke). Let's put it this way: There was a reason this film was premiered here and not in Hollywood. It was terrible! The acting was poor to the point of hilarity, the visual effects were mediocre, and the writing was abominable. I am truly ashamed to say that the writer (Mark Steven Johnson) is an alumnus of CSULB. I might have to drop out to be disassociated with him. Wes Bently, who played ""Blackheart"" in the movie was atrocious. Absolutely the worst acting I've seen in a long time, I mean there were times when I was wondering if his poor delivery and awful composure were intentionally set up for jokes. I tend to think not because the entire audience was laughing at him, not with him. Not with him.<br/><br/>Now, the fight scenes. Are you kidding me? Here's my summary of the fights of this movie: First fight with sandman, pretty sweet actually. Some blows on both sides, and sandy died in a fairly cool way. Next fight, on roof top, was totally lame. I mean seriously. Wind dude is like ""you can't catch the wind"" and then Ghost Rider creates a fire tornado (not as cool as it sounds) and the wind guy is like ""oh noes I guess I was wrong"" and dies. No fight just... lameness. And is it just me, or did he not even kill the water guy? Granted I left 5 minutes early because it was a bad movie, but I left after he killed hell-boy. That battle, man. GR throws a fire ball, but it was just like a clump of fire. Then he shoots him and he's like dude you cant even hurt me. Then he tries to do his like soul stare thing into the inferno of bad acting Wes and he's like ""lol ya rite, I don't have a soul!!1"" so GR fails. Then the villain from hell absorbs the souls of 1000 (or was it 5,000?) disgruntled Mexicans or something and GR realizes that now the baddie has A FREAKIN THOUSAND SOULS so he can kill him by looking him in the eyes real romantic like. This is where I left. The only reason I didn't give this movie a 1 is Eva Mendez is hot and was decent in the movie. No comment on Nick Cage, seen him do better and do worse."

","...Don't step on Karen!! Ghost Rider is a great film. There, I've said it. For those people who think they are more intelligent/better for watching a movie that is based on more serious/""real"" material please stop it lol! Notice how I deliberately referred to Ghost Rider as a film not a ""movie""...well, that's for you; if you're the type who goes along with this belief that what it's called also means it's better made. The plot involves, from the beginning, a person who sold their soul to the devil (SERIOUS. ""Hello-oh"" lol). Let's face facts: You can't really get more serious/gritty (call it what you will) plot material than that! <br/><br/>So is this movie inferior to a MOVIE such as Monster's Ball. NO. It's SUPERIOR. Why? Because, for one, it's honest about what it is selling you!!!!! <br/><br/>Is it inferior to The Kite Runner? NO. It's SUPERIOR because 1. See the above reason + 2. It's not as an added bonus CASHING IN on horrific tragedy's caused by politics and organized religion, occurring in the world at this present time. So let's get this straight - simply from a marketing point of view alone this FILM has got bigger and hotter flaming brass cohones than either of those examples of ""film"".<br/><br/>Strike 3? It's fun! But the laughs never take over from the story (and there are quite a few laughs). The bottom line is, with ANY film you watch, the first thing you should be able to do is turn your brain off yet still take everything in. If you can't do this, then it's either not a good movie altogether or perhaps just parts of it are flawed. Not the case here. This fiery film flows like Wallow...you'll get that once you watch it ;) <br/><br/>Let's have a 4th strike! Why? Because Mark Steven Johnson is an INFINITELY better Writer, Director and Film Maker than David S. Goyer who gets stupid amounts of unwarranted credit for trying to also make comic book movies.<br/><br/>OK, so flaws? There are a couple of general shots/effects shots that might have worked a little better with a more gradual transition. That's about it.<br/><br/>Ignore the majority of people who moan about this film while displaying their sad resistance to herd instinct. Don't step on Karen. And watch Ghost Rider.

","In all honesty, this movie came out better than I had imagined it would. I thought it would be some cop out that wouldn't amount to much. The storyline did its job. Everything in it made you feel like you were actually reading the comic book itself. The special effects in this movie were far from being bad. And I still don't understand why critics disliked this movie. The final fight could've have been more action-packed but hey, we have all come to except the fact that not many action movies are going to be able to throw us a sweet ass fight scene.<br/><br/>But in all I have I have to give this movie 10 of 10."
"crowrobot","7","3","5","6 July 2007"," ""Ghost Rider"" is goofy and fun, primarily because of Nicolas Cage's performance...
","Nicolas Cage loves comics. Taking the surname ""Cage"" from a black Marvel superhero named Luke Cage, naming his son Kal-El (Superman's Kryptonian name), and he was cast as Superman in the ill-fated mid-90s Tim Burton project ""Superman Lives"". Now, I like Cage; he is a splendid, bizarre actor who takes chances and risks, but I simply don't see him as Superman. Now he has a film where he is more suited to playing the lead: Ghost Rider.<br/><br/>Based on the Marvel comic, Ghost Rider tells the story of Johnny Blaze (Cage), a motorcycle daredevil who sells his soul to Mephistopheles (Peter Fonda) in order to cure his father's cancer. His father then dies in a stunt accident. Bummer. Many years later, Mephisto comes to collect on the deal and turns Blaze into the Ghost Rider, a kind of bounty hunter who throws escaped souls back into Hell. His son Blackheart (Wes Bentley) has escaped from down below, looking for a contract made with 1000 evil souls. Blaze enlists the help of the Caretaker (Sam Elliott) to aid him in his fight, and things proceed in a predictable if enjoyable fashion.<br/><br/>The best parts of the movie are Cage and Elliott. Cage brings a weirdness to Blaze that makes him more human. Rather than being a hard-drinking, chain-smoking mope, Cage dines on jellybean martinis, listens to the Carpenters, and watches monkey shows. And I could frankly watch Elliott be a cowboy all day. While he's saddled with some pretty bad lines, Elliott forms a nice repartee with Cage.<br/><br/>The supporting cast, alas, does not fare as well. Peter Fonda manages to escape embarrassment by going for a quieter type of menace, but Eva Mendes is not given anything to do as the love interest except look great, and Wes Bentley is just horrible. Now, I like over-the-top villains, but Bentley doesn't bring any menace or energy to the role. His henchmen are equally lame, and they are hopelessly unimposing compared to the Ghost Rider.<br/><br/>Speaking of which, the Rider is pretty cool. A flaming skeleton clad in leather and chains is a pretty cool image to begin with, and the effects involving him and his ultra-chrome Hellcycle are neat, if not photo real. I liked when the Rider is played as more a movie monster than a superhero, such as in a scene where Blaze is thrown in prison and things go south quickly.<br/><br/>Director Mark Steven Johnson (the unfairly maligned ""Daredevil"") has a nice visual style, and the western elements he brings to the fray help liven things up a bit, but he simply should not be allowed to write anymore screenplays. The script here is saddled with horrible lines like ""He may have my soul, but he doesn't have my spirit"", ""Hey, Dirtbag!"" and ""Let's clear the air!"".<br/><br/>Despite these problems, ""Ghost Rider"" is entertaining for its running length, and Cage's enthusiasm is infectious. You could do worse."

","I saw Ghost one week ago, and I was very impressed! Nicholas Cage brought pathos and pity to the character of Johnny Blaze, an Evil Knivel-esquire stunt rider who sells his should to Mephistopheles, AKA Satan, in return for saving his father's deadly cancer. Every night, Johnny transforms into Ghost Rider, the demonic servant of the Devil, with a flaming skull for a head, rides a supernatural Chopper bike, and uses a motorcycle chain as a whip/lasso. His job: to hunt down the devil's son, Blackheart, who has gone rogue and has enlisted the aid of three vicious demons to help him find an ancient document hidden by the original Ghost Rider, which will unleash Hell on Earth.<br/><br/>Okay, here's the facts. This movie is a typical Blockbuster with effects, some action, and lots of demonic imagery. It does star Nicholas Cage. It it a comic book film that differs greatly from the books.<br/><br/>Now that we understand that, let me tells you the things about this film that make it a fine pic for watching. The acting is fine, with momentary lapses, but so what? The characters are fairly likable, and I especially like Johnny's good friend, who's name I cannot remember, who is the most sensible person in the film. And if there's one thing every movie needs, It's a great villain(s). And we get that with the super-evil Satan and Blackheart, well-played and extremely menacing. And Ghost Rider himself is VERY cool!!! In the end, Ghost Rider wins! I loved it, and you should too!"

I read Ghost-rider as a kid, and my dad read the western ghost rider when he was young. I absolutely LOVED the the tip-of-the-hat to the original. Some directors might have not even bothered. There was the minor change where they had Fonda playing the devil, and of course, in the comics the devil appeared as the giant, red horned monster with fire everywhere. I didn't mind the alteration. Perhaps the CGI for the devil would have looked less-than-believable. Having Satan walk with a limp was funny, too. I will pick up the DVD!thanks to the film-makers for a great time."

"darkangel1200","8","3","5","10 March 2007"," My Two Cents
","My issues with the movie (and if someone's already covered this - my apologies) were:<br/><br/>1. After the Ghost Rider gets his face rearranged by a cop with a nightstick, all the Rider does in reaction is stick his jaw back in place and wave his finger like Dikembe Mutumbo (sp?)or Hulk Hogan and says ""Ah, ah, ahhh"". Childish. Even for a PG-13 rating. The Rider isn't supposed to be THAT forgiving. <br/><br/>Solution: Zarathos (the Ghost Rider) is a DEMON from HELL. The least he could've done was grabbed the officer by the collar and said or done something more effective (which we might not be able to get into here) to scare the officer into thinking ""not a great idea"" than just wave his finger and say that line. The officer is no longer ""innocent"" in Zarathos' eyes after that and deserved more in my opinion. The guy tried to take his head off. Yes it's a comic book and a fantasy but c'mon. Wish this movie was produced to be rated R. <br/><br/>2. Wes Bentley's face isn't weathered enough to play Blackheart. Nicholas Cage's natural look is more threatening than Wes' - not to mention Sam Elliott's (and Wes is wearing makeup to make him look more sinister...he doesn't). Unfortunately for him he's too much of a babyface to pull this mean of a character off at this point. <br/><br/>Solution: Cast an actor with a harder look or more of an edge. <br/><br/>Side Note: The ""Hidden Elemental"" villains overall were about as threatening as the portrayal of ""The Hand"" in Elektra. These guys were written almost the same way. You didn't feel anything for them. Could've been cooler and should've been darker and given the Rider more of a fight. They were killed just as quickly as you got to know them. Not a ton of screen time for them. Sometimes people say ""the movie could've been (X) minutes shorter"". In this case the fights should've been longer. <br/><br/>3. Some of the delivery from the actors seemed forced or unnecessarily over-the-top. (ie: when Nicholas Cage calls Blackheart an S.O.#, and later when Peter Fonda goes into the Johnny Blaze ""you'll pay for this"" part of the dialogue) <br/><br/>Solution: Another take and/or better directing of your actors. <br/><br/>That said, I still enjoyed the movie enough to recommend seeing it if you're into good popcorn movies related to comic book characters. Special FX were cool especially on the side-by-side desert ride of the 2 riders. The positives outweigh the negatives on this movie. Being a fan of the Ghost Rider character and Marvel comics growing up, I had no expectations of this being as good as the Spiderman or X-Men flicks because it doesn't have the production manpower or budget of those...and the Rider was never an A-list character for Marvel anyway - but I liked it that way. He was cool to me. <br/><br/>I thought Nicholas Cage was OK. Not a huge fan of his work, but this I could deal with. Eva Mendes is beautiful. Kudos to her for going thru with the self-deprecating scene between her and the waiter. Some actresses wouldn't allow their egos to do that. Sam Elliott bleeds cool. <br/><br/>It won't be considered by the academy for best picture (it's not trying to be) but it's fun for anyone that likes Halloween season-type images. I will be getting the DVD and wouldn't mind a sequel produced equally or better."
"helmutty","7","3","5","17 February 2007"," Ghost rider!
","After watching daredevil, I did not have high hopes for ghost rider which was under the same director. Daredevil was not very good, the case it was straight forward. Ghost rider which was slightly different than daredevil, proved that perhaps the director had learnt his lesson. One thing, this is not a kid film like spider-man or superman which means that the director can create violence and scary scenes. There are some suspense but the director made a fool out of it and it turned out not scaring people. The director did a good job on making ghost rider to live. But bad job on finding the actor of ghost rider, he looks to old to be a handsome superhero. The director had learnt his lesson, deciding to make it more thrilling than daredevil. It lacks the violence that was needed. If ghost rider was so capable of killing the bad guy in around five minutes, why not put him into a fight with the devil who caused him so much pain. Ghost rider may not be very good but at least it proved that the director put in more effort than the crap daredevil."

","I just saw this movie last night,and I got to say that it rocked like Shadow the hedgehog. The reason why it is like Shadow the hedgehog is because of the supernatural power of the main guy in the movie and because of the motorcycle. It would of been cooler if he had a military motorcycle like Shadow the hedgehog had with the GUN military label. Johnny Blaze sure showed me that he was willing to badass when it comes to saving people. Ghost Rider reminded me of Shadow the hedgehog because it had weapons and chopers in it. It will win a award for good performances of all of the cast members in it. The reason that it had a Shadowy feeling to it is because it showed that people don't have to be afraid of anything scary that is in front of them. And I am happy that both Johnny Blaze and Roxanne Simpson had both survived in the end of the movie. I like this movie and I hope that I will buy it once it get to be on DVD."

I mean Saturday morning cartoons, in the eighties, starring Mr T, a gymnastics team that fights crime, or a Teenager that turns into a Camaro would still reject this script.<br/><br/>There were so many hilariously awful lines.

","Ghost Rider rocked!!! I sat down just Saturday night and put it in to see it and i was amazed with the special effects and the performance that the movie showed. I was very impressed with it I thought it was an excellent film. I loved the visual effects especially the skull with flames that was very impressive. I have never personally read any of the comics before therefore i can not compare the comics to the movie but i can say this I thought the overall performance of the movie was very impressive. If you are looking for a good movie with some thriller scene's then this is the movie for you. I don't know how many parents would let there kids see it but if there are parents out there wanting to see a good movie i recommend this movie. I give it a 10 and put it on my top 10 list.

"coreguy","5","4","8","24 May 2007"," Original story is exciting but the movie is lackluster
","Friends around the world who love American Comic and their derived movies, after watching this title, you will realize why providing the fact that all the comics are exciting, their movie productions get distinct reputation: Spiderman is ""epic-class"", Fantasy 4 is ""Blockbuster"" , but Ghost Rider is only ""lackluster"" and even not worthy of a piece of movie ticket according to some comments here.<br/><br/>What makes the differences? The Actor and Actress? No. Nick Cage fits the role perfectly. His face keeps telling us the pain in the heart. Eva Mendes is sexy enough for a hero's girl. The Scene? No. I have to admit once ghost rider appears, I wrote some exclamation marks in my head. I have never seen such a cool skull before.<br/><br/>The Answer is : This movie doesn't give the character of figure enough depiction. You will feel that this story is only a ""Marvelous story"". A super-power hero story with a final fight in the end. But where is the figure's character? what drives him to fight? Fight for what? For example, The former ghost rider told JB that love can make a ghost rider invincible and powerful. But the final battle with Blackheart didn't reflect this important ""theory"", not at least a little. The scene is: JB was pulled down by blackheart. Roxanne Simpson picked up the gun and shot blackheart to give JB enough time to recover. Then she threw the gun to JB. JB fire-lized the gun and gave the blackheart a big shot. At last, JB used his ""special skill""(penance stare) to make all the souls in the blackheart burning. Story ended. Where is love? <br/><br/>In the end, Devil would like to retract JB's power. JB refused and swore to use the power for justice. But How did he form this thought? The movie didn't tell....<br/><br/>Still many flaws to find. Totally, this title is not good enough. If there is a successor, hope it will be better."

","DISCLAIMER - For the record I know less than nothing about the Ghost Rider comics, so my opinions (for the little that they are worth) are from a movie fan only I was looking forward to Ghost Rider since I saw the trailer but as it got closer and closer to its release my interest in the film had completely gone, which is unusual for me as I usually enjoy Marvel movies.<br/><br/>Anyway, after the FF2 trailer and the full trailer for the 300 the night began to pick up.... that was until young Johnny Blaze said his first lines. He was just a bad actor all round. There was one scene were he laughed at the devil and it was just embarrassing to watch!! The young Eva Mendes character was cast by the looks of it because she looked exactly like the real Eva Mendes! They just weren't anything special and after the first 10 minutes i was beginning to get really worried.<br/><br/>Before we go on it is important to note that I do not see the attraction with Nic Cage, I have only ever seen Gone in 60 Seconds, Face Off (free with my first DVD player) and National Treasure and he was OK it all three. I know he is an Oscar winner but to be honest that means jack all when you take into account some of the actors that have one the award over the years. There was a scene were he was watching TV and was pointing and laughing at a monkey karate chopping a brick and that was so awful to watch..... The few attempts of the Cage sarcastic humour were few and far between and even then they were poorly written, although the scene were Johnny was following the camera van was amusing. The camera guy survived though - that is unusual. I just didn't like the daytime TV watching Carpenter loving side of the Rider I do not know what age Johnny Blaze is but Nic Cage was just to old. It is tempting to insert a remark about the wig but it pretty much speaks for itself, you can see the wig and its two assistants credited at the end of the movie. He also had teeth so perfect i think that they were CGI and there was one shot (the lets show off my body scene) where i swear to God i thought that a body had been photo shopped in it was so toned and tanned.<br/><br/>Eva Mendes was OK. nothing to say about her really apart from the fact that she had a really fantastic push up bra on throughout the movie..<br/><br/>The chubby sidekick, who was also the side kick in Just Like Heaven was OK. Was surprised that he got killed in the end, then I remembered he was the chubby side kick so he was pretty much screwed from the get go......<br/><br/>The baddies were cool though. I liked the fire, air, water and earth thing that they had going on. I liked how it was an unofficial rule that they all had to wear long coats!! There was a fantastic dramatic pause between No Heart and his ""father"" when they were having their conversation. The fact that the devil was No Hearts father was supposed to be a great revelation but there was a definite giggle amongst the audience There is no denying that the film picked up when the action started. When he became the Rider is when the movie really started and you could feel the movie suffer whenever he changed back into normal mode. The action was good, and I will admit i got quite engrossed during the final battle.<br/><br/>I liked how the line ""I'll fight fire with fire"" was kept for the very end. He meant it in a metaphorical sense and a literal sense. The line had so many meanings on many different levels its writing at its finest. Honourable mention must also go to the ""I haven't got a sole but I've got spirit"" line.<br/><br/>The most memorable scene for me was when Blaze and the old Rider were making there way out to the town for the final battle. I just looked amazing the two of them riding out together. It was honestly spoiled for me when it was revealed that it was the old Riders last ride. He used it up, turned his horse around and rode off home and out of the movie. Clearly he didn't want to help out and die in a blaze of glory in the final battle.<br/><br/>Overall the movie was verging on the so bad is it actually good mark. I would give it a 6/10. Entertaining movie, not great on any level. It is def one for the cinema as it needed the dramatic big screen to help make it watchable. I honestly think if I had waited and rented it I would not have watched it the whole way through. I would have got 5/10 if not for the fantastic remix of Ghostriders in the Sky during the end credits!"
"Chiron1987","8","4","8","20 February 2007"," Great Marvel-Fueled Fun With Just A Little Cheesy Aftertaste
","First off, let me preface this review by saying that I was never huge fan or aficionado of Marvel Comics' Ghost Rider. I liked the character somewhat, but found myself more attuned with Marvel's other heroes, like Spider-Man, the Avengers, and the Hulk. Now, going into the cinematic version of the Spirit of Vengeance, I really had no preconceived notions. I enjoyed the very first theatrical trailer for the film that I saw with last year's disastrous X-Men: The Last Stand, but was sort of wary of the film after seeing the corny, humorous television commercials that were run endlessly before the movie's release on 16 February 2007.<br/><br/>However, after actually seeing Ghost Rider, I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by the end product and had a great time watching it. Yet, the film is not without its problems. The story of a young motorcycle daredevil's bargain with the Devil for the life of his cancer-stricken father, Ghost Rider has a pretty good foundation to stand on. Then, of course, in the Marvel way, the story goes on a completely different, un-Faustian course, as that young daredevil, Johnny Blaze, now a grown up, world famous stunt cyclist, is forced to relive his horrible curse as the Ghost Rider, a flame-skulled demonic entity charged by Mephistopheles (not Mephisto as in the comics) to hunt down wayward demons, including Satan's own son, Blackheart, played with devilish, yet pale and gaunt, glee by Wes Bentley.<br/><br/>The film boasts incredible special effects. Ghost Rider was another one of those fictional characters I thought could never be pulled off on screen without looking cheap or silly, but in this movie, it totally works. Ghost Rider is fully realized and is one scary dude. And that demonic chopper of his is totally indescribable. As for the rest of the characters, including the Rider's own alter ego, this where the film stops short.<br/><br/>Peter Fonda is Mephistopheles, but not the red-skinned demonic creature from the comics. He is a leather-jacketed snake-oil salesman. Fonda is fine in the role, but what bothers me is that they pass this version of Mephisto off as the actual, biblical Satan, which was never the comics' intention. This could be a controversial point for some religious viewers, but I just felt that it betrayed the Marvel version somewhat. Eva Mendes portrays Johnny Blaze's lamented love, Roxanne Simpson, but she is given very little to do, but stand around in skin-tight, cleavage-magnifying outfits. Now, don't get me wrong, in that aspect, Ms. Mendes is incredible. She is incredibly beautiful and a treat to both stare at and watch move around, but her character really does little else, and she has little to no chemistry with Nicolas Cage's Johnny Blaze.<br/><br/>And as for Cage's Johnny Blaze, I think the film ultimately does suffer from the wrong casting here. I don't really believe Cage as the daredevil Blaze or as Ms. Mendes' love interest and his motion-captured movements as Ghost Rider do not really seem heroic or larger than life. It seems that Cage was sort of phoning in this role, even though he is a huge fan of both comic books and Ghost Rider himself. I found myself just wishing someone else were playing this role.<br/><br/>The story of Ghost Rider's hunt for Blackheart and his elemental minions is pedestrian and has be done time and time again, but it is still fun to watch and just cool to see on screen. Sam Elliot is, as always, terrific as the mysterious Caretaker, who guides Johnny on his journey as the latest incarnation of Ghost Rider. The big reveal at the end of Caretaker, as Carter Slade, the 19th Century Ghost Rider, is not all that shocking or surprising but does make for an interesting twist. And the scene of the two Ghost Riders, one astride a skeletal, fiery horse, and one traveling on a demon-fueled chopper, is just really amazing to see.<br/><br/>I think that Ghost Rider could have been a great movie, maybe with another actor in the title role, or perhaps with the original R-rated screenplay of David Goyer, but in the end it was simply a good film that gave me a great ride, and that's really saying and accomplishing a lot.<br/><br/>Recommended."
"The_Defiant1","8","4","8","17 February 2007"," Visually Stunning
","Having been a fan of Ghost Rider since the beginning in the 1970's, I was overjoyed that the movie was made. For me, just seeing the character come to full flaming glory on the screen was worthwhile. Like most movies derived from comics, the story is changed in ways that are both disappointing and interesting. While the changes clearly altered his comic origin, the heart of the story stays true to it. Where this movie lacks the most are the villains and the writing. The plot is fine, but the villains look like rejects from any of a dozen other movies. Wearing trench coats, and copping a bad attitude, they just aren't endearing or wickedly cool in the least. Ghost Rider has a good amount of screen time, but they don't have a lot of things for him to do. When he is in action, it's fun. The story links the old western Ghost Rider from the comics to the biker Ghost Rider. The writing definitely has some stupid elements, but I walked away pleased with the final product. Eva Mendes being in it is enough to rank the movie a 7. With all the other stunning visuals, I'll give it an 8.<br/><br/>See it in the theater. Buy the DVD. Two thumbs up."
"redmage913","1","6","14","1 March 2007"," Pathetically Awful
","I know this comment is one of dozens, and probably will only be scanned by other people who hated the movie, but I must say my peace.<br/><br/>This movie was the most predictable piece of trash I've ever seen. Even half of the clichÃ©d one-liners were muttered under my breath a split second before the movie said the exact same line, and I was surprised every time it happened.<br/><br/>The idea of ""cast a good actor in a terrible role"" simply doesn't work in movies. I enjoy Nicolas Cage and Sam Elliott a lot, but their roles were so poorly written that I wanted to leave immediately. If I had been by myself instead of with friends, I would have left.<br/><br/>It's bad when you find a movie funny because of how terrible it is. What's even worse is when you start laughing at yourself for paying money to see said filth. Sadly, I fit into that category after seeing ""Ghost Rider"". Never again..."
"mkudrick05","1","5","11","25 June 2007"," Unwatchably bad...
","'Ghost Rider' failed as a movie because the acting was terrible (save for Peter Fonda as the Devil), the script was terrible, the characters were poorly developed, the villains were laughable, and worst of all, Ghost Rider looked like some crappy Halloween graphic that my ten year old brother could create using greeting card software. <br/><br/>I am outraged that Marvel would allow us to waste money on such an unfit product. DO NOT see this film, even for the camp value. I am extremely disappointed in Nicolas Cage - I've enjoyed a number of his movies over the years (Lord of War, Con Air, The Rock) and have come to rely on him for quality cinema. His latest efforts (Next, Ghost Rider) are inexcusably bad."

","Johnny Blaze, a young stunt motorcyclist, discovers that his father is dying of lung cancer. Worried with this fact, he meets a man,Mephistopheles (satan), that promises him to rid his father of his disease, but only if Johnny gives him his soul. Thinking that it is a joke, Johnny signs the contract, and in the next day, his father is in perfect health. The problem is that the devil deceived him, since his father is killed in a stunt. Mephistopheles doesn't take long to inform Johnny that his soul belongs to him, and Johnny is forced to abandon his girlfriend and his town. Many years later, Johnny Blaze is a famous motorcyclist, who risks his life in his shows with big frequency, never dying. He then meets Roxanne again, his ex girlfriend that he abandoned, who is now a reporter. Johnny never forgot her, and when they are close to renew their relationship, Mephistopheles, the Satan, will need Johnny as his Ghost Rider.Johnny will need to take the missing San Venganza contract to Satan,and avoid Blackheart, Satan's son, to put his hands on it.<br/><br/>I liked 'Ghost Ryder'. Compared to many 'heroes movies' like ' DareDevil', 'Hulk' among others, I considered it to be better then the most I watched, but not reaching the 'Spider man' series level. There is a relevant fact as well : I don't know the Ghost Rider's HQs and never read them, so, I cannot compare them with the movie, to say if the movie is disappointing or not. One thing I was expecting more: drama with deep moments. When Johnny's friend dies, he simply doesn't care; they should also have expanded his relationship with his father and girlfriend. But okay, I understand that a movie needs to be 'compact'.<br/><br/>By the way: Thanks God Johnny Depp was not in Johnny Blaze's role! I like him very much, but he wouldn't suit the role, at least at this moment, where he is much in our minds as ' Jack Sparrow'."
"simonparker1990","3","5","11","4 March 2007"," Stalls too often to be memorable.
","I was really looking forward to Ghost Rider, not only is the character one of the most interesting out of Marvel, but the actual idea is a lot darker than your average superhero fare. For starters Ghost Rider is actually working for the devil himself, not trying to be good for the sake of it like the X-Men or Spiderman. Ghost Rider did it to save his father, only for that to go horribly wrong for him. When I first saw the trailers for Ghost Rider I thought it looked quite good, the early scenes I saw of the Ghost Rider transformation was equally as impressive. However then the critics sunk their claws into it and refused to let go. What sounded a great movie was massacred by the critics. Now I don't always pay attention to the critics, but in this case I did. I still was looking forward to it as it looked like dumb fun. Unfortunately though Ghost Rider really almost fails to reach that status. The movie is unfortunately a series of letdown only jump started here and there by the all too brief appearances of Ghost Riders itself. What could have been a classic superhero movie becomes a shambles after a while. You see the major problem with it is that simply not a lot happens. It takes forty minutes before we see the first transformation, and after that the actual sequences with the Rider are all too rare. Instead we get a mish-mash of a storyline involving Blackheart and some nonsense to do with ruling the world. It didn't really make a lot of sense so I didn't pay too much attention to it.<br/><br/>So where do I begin with the faults of this movie. Well for starters I'll have to rip into the dialogue and storyline. The dialogue in a superhero movie is not something I always look out for. I like it to be average, so long as the action backs it up then I'm happy enough. Unfortunately the action is all to rare to back it up, so instead we get ridiculously cheesy dialogue and a cast that have nothing to work with. Matters aren't helped by the fact the main storyline just seems bland and unoriginal as hell (no pun intended). The opening with Johnny selling his soul to Mephistopheles (or the devil as we know him), works really well. The trouble is that that storyline soon links into the stupid one involving Blackheart wanting to create hell on earth and rule the world. Anyway his storyline is a mere excuse for the Rider to hunt down Blackheart's minions and for lots of bike sequences. The storyline doesn't even try to be original, when you compare the storyline here to something more complex in X-Men 2 or even in Hulk you realise just how pathetic the storyline here is.<br/><br/>The cast as well unfortunately failed to make me enjoy the movie any more. Nicholas Cage does a half decent job as Johnny Blaze, I didn't think much of him in the trailers but he does quite well here. Unfortunately the script is too weak for him to be brilliant, but had the script been better he might have done a great piece of acting here. Peter Fonda as well is inspired casting as Mephistopheles, he at least makes the dialogue bearable and whenever he comes on screen the movie seems to come back to life for a brief period of time. Alas the other two main cast members, Eva Mendes and Wes Bentley are pretty much diabolical. Eva Mendes has nothing to do and no decent dialogue to work with here. But judging by the way she performs she seems pretty terrible anyway, so not much of a loss here. But Wes Bentley is just awful. His job is basically to look evil and overact. Unfortunately all he comes across as is a spoilt teenager who wants to cause daddy as much hell as possible. His villain is ineffective that anytime he is off screen is a blessing. And that is not what a villain is supposed to be like, you're supposed to want them on screen, not to want to die whenever they walk on.<br/><br/>Thankfully Ghost Rider isn't all bad as this movie obviously gets a few things right. The special effects look brilliant, whenever Johnny transforms into the Rider it looks absolutely amazing. Sequences where he rides up a skyscraper on his bike also look superb. The movies action sequences also make the movie work. Unfortunately there's a certain lack of them for me to really care that much about then. But the movie also has a sense of fun that many comic book movies lack, yes I'm talking about you Spiderman! This movie knows its not going to win Oscars, it never tries to be anything more than a piece of popcorn entertainment. And as popcorn entertainment it does ultimately work, albeit in small doses. Its bound to get all the kids excited and I'm sure that a sequel is already in the works. Its fun at times so that's why I can't completely despise it, but its got too many faults for me to really like it either.<br/><br/>Overall Ghost Rider is one big disappointment that just redeems itself from being a bad movie by being entertaining. Unfortunately though it just scrapes average, bad storyline, bad dialogue and a lack of anything really special makes this movie forgetful. One of the weakest superhero movies to date, unfortunately in terms of quality it sits alongside movies like Elektra and Fantastic Four. The latter being more fun then both being combined however."

","After eating lunch with a friend, we decided to check out what movies were on at the theater. When we got to the ticket booth it was 3:25. I was looking back and fourth from my watch several times just to make sure it was the right time because the only two choices we had were, ""Norbit and Ghost Rider."" We should have just left right then and there; ran for our lives. Being a comic collector, I was at least a bit curious about Ghost Rider.<br/><br/>An hour into the movie I wanted to leave. I checked my watch and it said 4:30. I knew there were some other movies that came on at 4:30 and was tempted to sneak into one of them. Unfortunately, I decided to stick it out so as not to embarrass my friend. Looking back, I should have grabbed her and ran.<br/><br/>The second the movie was done, I instantly started criticizing it to no end. I don't usually do this, most of the time I just point out the good things about a show rating it by the amount of raving I do. Fueled by my latte, I expressed my opinion in full about how offended I was for having had to set through that. In the middle of naming off one of Ghost Rider's numerous flaws, I looked at my watch and stopped in my tracks...<br/><br/>It read 3:30...<br/><br/>No joke. It was ticking away perfectly fine, like nothing had happened. I tapped it a couple of times and was quite confused as to how it had set itself back two hours. Then it struck me. The movie that I had just suffered through, started at 3:30. It was as if my watch was agreeing with me. As if it were saying, ""You deserve the last two hours of you life back."" I've heard the saying before, but this was like putting words in my mouth. I'm sure there's some kind of explanation for it, but that's not the point. The point is...<br/><br/>Even my watch agreed that Ghost Rider was so utterly pathetic, I undoubtedly deserved the two hours I wasted watching it given back to me."
"danohaggard","5","5","11","17 February 2007"," Good Enough Super Hero Movie
","I saw Ghost Rider tonight and it was pretty much what I thought it would be. The special effects were alright, they could have been a lot worse but also could have been a lot better. You don't get to see Ghost Rider until like 40-50 minutes in so in a way it's kind of like the movie the Hulk were you don't get to see the Hulk until almost half the movie is over. And of course there's the stereotypical love story. There wasn't really even chemistry between the characters Johnny Blaze and Roxanne and I think the movie suffered for it. And every time Eva Mendes was on screen, every shirt she just so happened to be wearing showed a lot of cleavage but no complaints from me. The weirdest part about this movie is from the trailer is makes it seem like Nicolas Cage is totally wrong for the part and cheesy and don't forget old but surprisingly enough he does an alright job and did what he could for the role he was given. I think a lot of people are gonna compare this movie to Daredevil and say it's just as bad but for a movie about a B-list superhero that really a lot of people don't even know, it's not that bad. It kept me entertained throughout and I recommend it to anybody who likes a good cheesy superhero movie. And don't take it too serious, Ghost Rider is no Spider-Man movie."

All of the characters from hell are not so strong to make the audience surprised,especially the stupid Blackheart.The only exciting part is a scene can be seen in the Trailer:Two different generation of Ghost Rider ride together in the desert.If you want to see a film with no plot and full of meaningless SFX,this is the one!"

The acting by Wes Bentley was horrid and I believe it's 50/50 director and actor's fault.Bentley obvious wasn't concerned about his performance or watched his dailies to adjust his ""method"" or ""approach"". Even worse is the awful grating of Ghost Rider's ""voice"". Sounds like Ghost Rider has a carton a day habit. Then there's Eva Mendes trying to make the best out of a bad project along with Cage.

","I remember when I first saw the trailer last year for Ghost Rider, I just kept thinking ""Oh, no, what is Nicolas Cage doing to his career?"". But I had a free rental and I have no idea why, I just decided to go ahead and see what I expected to be one of the worst movies of all time, I watched Ghost Rider this morning and really, I'm not that upset with this movie. Granted, it has the ultimate cheesy dialog that I've heard, but it is based off a comic, so I actually let that go. Nicolas Cage, while I still question the casting of him as Ghost Rider, don't get me wrong, he does look good, but he's a little old for the action hero gig, but he does make the film work pretty well. I understand a lot of people not liking this movie, besides the dialog, the effects are a bit much, but I feel like this was an honest comic book film and had all the action and excitement it should have.<br/><br/>Johnny Blaze made a very bad deal, a deal with the devil when he learns about his father having cancer, the devil will cure Johnny's dad, if Johnny agrees to be his bounty hunter, the Ghost Rider. Johnny's soul is now in the hands of the devil, meaning that nothing can come between them: family, friends, or love. But when Johnny's old love returns to his life, he takes this as a sign, and wants to tell her about his curse. But the devil's son, Blackheart, who wants to bring Hell on Earth, must be stopped and Ghost Rider is on the mission.<br/><br/>Ghost Rider really, honestly is not that bad of a movie. I would say that it is average, but it delivered what it promised. I do hate CGI effects, especially the cheesy ones, but the effects were pretty cool in Ghost Rider. I thought the effect of Ghost Rider riding up the side of the sky scraper was so cool to look at. Ghost Rider is definite eye candy, it has good actors, and a cool story; I'm not going to lie, it's flawed, but I feel like people were a little too harsh and just didn't want to give the film a fair chance. I watched it expecting trash and I found myself enjoying Ghost Rider, so just grab the popcorn and watch it with an open mind.<br/><br/>6/10"

","Ghost Rider - I didn't expect anything at all from this Marvel film after reading it's awful reviews. But I really still wanted to check it out - you know, to see what I think.?<br/><br/>The very start of the movie with the narrating & the explaining of the Ghost Rider, is amazing & well-done. Really reassures you that the critics may have been wrong. But what follows for the 15 minutes following the introduction is ridiculous. Badly acted. Rushed. Script completely all over the place. The meet with the devil could've been done much better. But still - not boring.?<br/><br/>When we see a few years into the future though, the movie steadily begins to please, not very much but still MUCH better acting & script. Proof that Nicholas Cage & Eva Mendes are much better actors than the younger actors of the characters.?<br/><br/>The films peak is in the middle - the character actually being the Ghost Rider scenes. Really keeps you on the edge of your seat. Perhaps only because I'm a wimp - but I actually got really scared during some scenes. During the middle of the film you begin to forget the start's flaws & the reviews.?<br/><br/>Just as the film got into it - the end came. An end just as bad as the start. A showdown which bores & is completely predictable. A cheesy & badly scripted couple of scenes which make you leave the cinema feeling 'Blah'. ?<br/><br/>All in all - a good movie, which doesn't have average scenes, but great scenes & awful scenes. Would I see it again? Not for a few years, but possibly eventually. Who do I recommend it to? Fans of movies like Hellboy, Van Helsing & Daredevil - nowhere near as good as those 3 though.?<br/><br/>It was still a fun & thrilling ride, I recommend to anyone looking for a fun action flick."

","I have to admit, I thought a fiery skeleton on a blazing motorcycle was a pretty good idea. I liked the whole Johnny Blaze/ Ghost Rider character. I thought the special effects for the Ghost Rider and his motorcycle were well done. I did think Nick Cage looked weird with that dark hair piece he was wearing. He felt sort of miscast in the role.<br/><br/>And for some reason they had Eva Mendez wearing shirts that were too small and only buttoned half way up. I mean, it looked like she was fixing to explode out of her shirts. But, I guess that was to appeal to the teenage boy audience.<br/><br/>I liked Sam Elliots's role too. His deep voice just sounds so perfect for the movies.<br/><br/>Blackheart looked like a wimpy goth. And the bad guys are defeated very easily by the Ghost Rider. But the Ghost Rider's pentance stare was awesome.<br/><br/>One glaring plot hole: How did the police connect a bunch of frozen bodies to a motorcycle stunt driver and arrest him for their murders?<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: Much better than expected. I thought visually, the movie was great. The script could have been better, but it was interesting enough."
"jiaoniang","7","2","3","12 July 2007"," OK, it is not that bad,
","I gave it 7 our 10 because I can still watch it till the end. On the contrary, I would give 5 or 6 to Transformers because of the extra 30 mins.<br/><br/>It was a little surprise to me how quickly this movie got on the DVD release, which indicates poor theatre sales. However, I found it enjoyable that tells me a story, with routines, hypes, and unexpected endings.<br/><br/>Without the ending twist, I might give it 4. :) This movie tells a legend story that someone sells his soul to devil. While understands devil's plan, this hero grew out of selfish and became a real hero and urban legend. However, why devil finds a non-selfish person to start his deal in the first place is the weak point of the plot."
"nickb1016","8","2","3","20 June 2007"," Was it ridiculous...yes. But very entertaining
","It was a very campy comic book movie, It was silly, implausible even by comic book standards, and had sub par special effects. Even with all that i still really enjoyed the movie. I just wish that the effects were better. That scene with Nicolas Cages computer generated muscles made me laugh a bit, OK more than a bit. Too bad the transformers crew couldn't have done this movie. Cage was OK in the part. Eva Mendes is given a very one note role to work with so she mostly struts around looking hott. Wes Bently is just not scary enough to be a villain. But Sam Elliot and Peter Fonda are great fun. So it was flawed but still fun."
"RCWjr","7","2","3","19 June 2007"," Better upon further viewing
","The first time I watched this film, I thought it was OK. However, after many viewings I have come to embrace the film a lot more.<br/><br/>Everything from the villains, the plot and the sets are over the top, but what should we expect from a film based on a character that has a flaming skull of a head? I mean come on, this is not high art. It is an opportunity to stretch and have some fun. Cage does so in spades and gives us a modern Texas cowboy.<br/><br/>As with Dare Devil, Johnson knows the material but is not so much of a fan boy that he doesn't miss the opportunities to take an already absurd story and treat it too serious. Johnson has tackled two of the more dark comics in the Marvel catalog, but he has a touch I appreciate which is respect but not so much that it becomes blind reverence. I know, I know, comics are the modern day lore and myth. But they are not so steeped in lore and myth that their intent should be missed and that is to take reality and stretch it.<br/><br/>I absolutely love the settings that Johnson uses, at times this feels like a modern day spaghetti western. Were it me, I would have kept the story strictly in the desert. But that would bely the setting of the comics. As is, we get a really cool story told in two worlds.<br/><br/>Sam Elliot is the man plain and simple. His Caretaker is the grounding element of the movie, the anchor. Fonda's take on the devil is both inspired and genius. He gives the ""red one"" a much needed makeover and I love watching Fonda chew up the scenery when he is on. He is over the top and under the table, all in the same scene. I love that.<br/><br/>Eva Mendes comes off as pretty much window dressing, which is what the comics usually do with their female characters. I don't fault Johnson here, but would have liked a little more substance than boobs from Mendes.<br/><br/>All in all, gets better with every viewing."

","I liked this movie cause it was enjoyable and adventurous...The main them is inspired from a comic book by Marvel...I found interesting also those scenes that gave this movie a comedy scent...Also i think the main actors Nicolas Cage,Wes Bentley,Peter Fonda and Eva Mendes performed their roles very good...the main idea behind this movie was great...a young man who makes a pact with the devil and is given power to become a daring rider...and when Mephistopheles needs him, he is obliged to face the group lead by Blackheart in order to get his soul back...I particularly enjoyed the scenes with when Matt Long(the role played by Nicholas Cage) fight with Blackheart, his group, the police...The film none the less had it's part filled with errors, so this ruined it a bit...But overall, it was a pleasant experience."

","Many viewers may hate this movie. many of friends did. Mainly because it didn't live up to their expectations of a long awaited movie. Personally, i didn't really know the history of ghostrider other than the fact that he looked kick ass. and he looked kick ass in the movie. i'll admit it. i liked the movie. i'll be the first to acknowledge a rather boring script, really really corny lines, wooden acting at times and a movie that just didn't live up to the hype. but here's the truth - i didn't really get into the hype. the corny lines were rather spectacularly pulled off with style by nick cage (in that way only he could really do) and even though you KNOW it's really corny - you can't help but smile to yourself. the special effect were awesome. especially the henchmen who took on the aspects of earthly elements. ghostrider himself - i watched him and wanted to be him - what more do you want in a movie? the chick in the movie was a bit of a let down. she really didn't carry out her role and her acting was on the lower end of the spectrum. can't be helped. but here's the bottom line. for a couple hours, you'll cheer the hero, you'll the hate the bad guys, you'll watch in awe the effects and if you stop picking at the holes, you will truly enjoy yourself. Not a keeper and definitely not one of the best comic movies at the moment, but it really was fun."
"MaxBorg89","6","2","3","18 March 2007"," Occasionally dumb, sometimes ridiculous, but most of the time fun as hell (pun not intended)
","This film was never going to be a masterpiece in comic-book adaptation. Where other Marvel-based movies (Spider-Man, X-Men etc.) focused on their protagonists'inner struggles, it was clear from the earliest teaser that Ghost Rider had no such ambitions; it was just going to be a loud, hopefully watchable action movie. And that's exactly what it is.<br/><br/>However, writer/director Mark Steven Johnson (who previously explored comic-book territory in the flawed, but somehow underrated Daredevil) deserves credit for trying to provide us with a believable back-story for this unusual character. Shame it's all stuff we've seen before (an unbearable loss and its life-altering consequences), the only variation being the contract young Johnny Blaze signs with Mephistopheles (Peter Fonda) to save Blaze Sr. 's life. Predictably, the old man dies anyway, leaving Johnny (Nicolas Cage) alone and forced to serve the dark forces: by day, he's an ordinary man who earns his living by impressing people with his motorcycle stunts; by night, on the other hand, he becomes the Ghost Rider, an avenger who punishes evildoers by making them feel the same pain they have inflicted upon their victims. Naturally, his nocturnal persona isn't the kind of guy who walks unnoticed (how could he, his face being a flaming skull?), and so he will also have to deal with the authorities. Oh, and then there's Blackheart (Wes Bentley), a rogue demon who's trying to take over the world. You know, business as usual.<br/><br/>Knowing that any psychological digressions would be a waste of time, Johnson puts all his energy into the action sequences, and that's where the film truly succeeds: whenever the Rider gets on the motorbike and starts causing all kinds of mayhem, it's easy to see why comic-book readers are fascinated by a character who, unlike Spidey and friends, isn't afraid to get his hands dirty, no matter what (including a skyscraper) comes in his way. Ghost Rider is an uncompromising bad-ass, and Cage has a lot of fun playing him, although even he struggles to keep a straight face while delivering the line ""I sold my soul to the Devil"". And speaking of devils, the villains are actually the main reason the film occasionally clunks: while the riotous Fonda is a joy to watch (the Easy Rider in-joke being the stand-out), the same can't be said of Bentley, who swaps the chilling subtlety he mastered in American Beauty for stereotyped overacting (but then again, what else can you do when you've got the most ridiculous lines and sidekicks since Batman & Robin?). Another weak element, though not as dull as Bentley, is the romantic subplot involving Eva Mendes, primarily because even the most inexperienced moviegoer is able to guess the outcome.<br/><br/>Final verdict? Well, romance and bad guys aside, Ghost Rider is fun, especially when the titular character is let loose in the second half of the film. Certainly not among the year's best movies, but worth a look on your average Saturday night.<br/><br/>6,5/10"
"jkarnofsky","7","2","3","16 March 2007"," I'd like to know...
","Who built the bikes they used? Were they built from scratch (custom creations, from the ground up), or were they based loosely on a production bike? The Ghost Rider bike looked like it could have been based on a Honda VTX 1800. I know that the police officer with the radar gun had either an ST1100 or ST1300 police model. I enjoy the fact that they have gone back and done the superhero movies again (spiderman, superman, batman, daredevil, elektra, and although I thought it was cheesy, the incredible hulk). I do think they should to Aquaman with Michael Phelps! It was a pretty good story, but I would like to see it be sustainable over a series of movies, like spiderman, preferably with the same cast. Sam Eliot was a great addition to the cast as the OLD Ghost rider..."
"janx218","7","2","3","6 March 2007"," Great? No. Entertaining? Yes.
","I'll say this right from the start: Ghost Rider is in no way, shape or form a great motion picture. Still, I enjoyed it. I find that sometimes movies call for different approaches. Sometimes you have to take them for what they are, and this can help enhance the viewing experience. Case in point, I was not expecting much from Ghost Rider. I could tell from the trailers that it wasn't exactly going to be a masterpiece, but still I was hoping to find some redeeming qualities and I did.<br/><br/>As others have suggested, the acting is a bit iffy at best. Personally, I quite enjoyed Nicholas Cage as Johnny Blaze. He brings a sense of discovery to the role that works well. I also liked Peter Fonda as Mephistopheles. Yes, he's very understated and people have said that he seems bored, but honestly it worked for me because he comes off as a very cool customer and who's cooler than the devil himself? I'll also give props to Sam Elliott, who by this point is one of those actors who I think can do no wrong. It probably doesn't hurt that he basically plays the same character in every movie, but that's a moot point. On the other end of the spectrum, I was a bit disappointed with the casting of Wes Bentley. He just lacked any real menace. If it weren't for the CGI fangs they randomly added, I don't think there'd be much to fear at all. Likewise, Eva Mendes just seemed out of place. Don't get me wrong, she's a beautiful girl and her wardrobe throughout the film is certainly great (let's just say that her ""girls"" steal almost every scene she's in) but her acting chops aren't nearly as great as her cleavage.<br/><br/>All this aside, I don't think most people go to a comic book movie hoping for Oscar-caliber performances. They go to have a good time, and in this regard I think Ghost Rider delivers. After all, it's a movie that rather prominently features a flaming biker skeleton riding a demon motorcycle. If that's not cool, I don't know what is."

"Night_Wing917","9","2","3","2 March 2007"," Ghost Rider: The Spirit of Vengeance ""Spoilers""
","Tonight I went to see Ghost Rider with two friends one of which is an avid comic book fan as am I. Personally we all enjoyed this movie thoroughly and loved how they did justice to the character. The movie entertained me the entire time and kept me in my seat. Ghost Rider the character was great and in his Rider form was completely awesome. Mephistopheles was perfect in the role he played and I prefer him as he was in the film. Similar to how he was in the comic. Blackheart and the fallen angels were great villains and added a great element to the film. Personally I would have liked to see Blackheart in the demon form but otherwise Bentley did a good job. The action and battle scenes were great and Rider's use of the penance stare is something that I loved and never thought they would add.<br/><br/>To start off we need to realize one thing when watching movies based off of comic books and graphic novels. They are fictional and should not be taken to be things that actually occur in the real world. This movie was awesome and points about Blaze jumping a football field being impossible should be disregarded. It's a movie and is not true and you should not attempt to apply these things to the real world. The movie is supposed to be entertaining as it was, not translatable to things that actually happen.<br/><br/>That said this movie did justice to the character of Ghost Rider and Cage did a great job honoring that character. Eva Mendes, alright she's not Meryl Streep but she still did a decent job with the character. The Caretaker was a great addition in the movie and Blackheart and Mephistopheles were great in the roles they played in this movie. Mephistopheles was played perfectly in this movie and the way his character ends is perfect. Cage is an Academy Award winning actor, why does everyone hate him? He did a great job in this role and in a comic to film adaptation I'd rather see an actor take a leap and actually try and portray the character correctly as Cage did.<br/><br/>Let's add the fact that the writers decided to keep the origin as it was which is something that should be done in every comic to film adaptation. Unlike Fantastic Four and others. Also, anyone catch ""My name is Legion, for we are many"" loved it. This movie did a great job of sticking with the character as he was in the comic for the most part. The character could have been a bit darker however to do a movie it needs to appeal to a mass audience and as the Rider he was dark enough. The penance stare, the chain and the hellfire added a great element and I loved every minute of it. His use of the penance stare added a great element that I never dreamed the writers would use in a million years.<br/><br/>Some of the problems people see with this movie are things that should be left out of the discussion on some aspects. Such as the complaints about Ghost Rider in water not extinguishing the flames. Its hellfire not literal fire and therefore doesn't burn out like regular fire. His stunt show tricks are just those tricks and although they may not translate literally into the real world they shouldn't. They should be heightened to extend the drama and excitement of the film. We don't go in expecting the movie to be about actual things that happen every day. Personally I don't see guys riding around with their skulls on fire or shooting people with webs (Had to reference spidey). This movie did what I wanted it too and more, it kept me in my seat the entire time aching for more and more. It was entertaining, exciting and done awesome and I wish they'd stick close to the characters more often as they did here.<br/><br/>Let me say one thing though. The plot line is not meant to apply to the real world. Not to mention you people claiming you knew what was going the happen, unless you've read a Ghost Rider comic before you don't know. How in God's name did you know he'd use the penance stare to destroy Blackheart before he enveloped all the souls. How did you know that he was going to absorb the souls as he did. I have read the comic and I was still entertained even as I knew what would happen in the end.<br/><br/>Personally it is rare to find a comic to film adaptation that actually hits the character as it was in the comic. My buddy and I could not get enough of how well they did that in this movie. Cage did what he should have done, the character justice. This movie does not contain academy award winning acting but how many films actually do. There are numerous entertaining films that don't have the highest level of acting however they do what they are supposed and keep you entertained and this movie did this for me. Cage and Mendes had good chemistry on screen and Wes Bentley, Sam Elliot and Peter Fonda were great in their roles. Personally Donal Logue is one of my favorite actors and his character went along well with Blaze.<br/><br/>I rank this as one of the greatest comic adaptations they have done and I would rank it up there with Batman Begins and Spider-man. Anyway this movie did the character great justice and I would see this movie two more times in theaters before going out and buying the DVD the day it comes out. Go watch it. It was awesome.<br/><br/>""Your soul has been tainted by the blood of the innocent. Look into my eyes and feel their pain."" The penance stare was awesome!"

","I noticed that a lot of people are hating on this movie so i figured it's time to set things straight:<br/><br/>1.Script: It's an action movie made after a comic book series, so don't watch the movie expecting a script a la ""Pursuit of Hapyness"", ""Little Miss Sunshine"" etc. (you get the picture).Doing that it's just plain stupid.<br/><br/>2.Acting: Nicholas Cage does a great job bringing Johnny Blaze to life.One thing is clear: the man knows how to act and proves that he's one of the best Hollywood has to offer.The ""funny moments"" in the film could of been easily transformed into embarrassing and ""cheesy"" ones but Cage does again a very, very good job (there were moments when the whole cinema was laughing).Eva Mendes does exactly what i was expecting: looking good and displaying ""decent"" acting skills.There is however allot of room for improvement.<br/><br/>3.Visual Effects: Superb.This film has so many awesome CGI scenes that you should watch it two or three times in order to fully appreciate them but....yes there is a but.....in a couple of close-ups the Rider's skull looks kind of awkward.However the movie more than makes up for them. <br/><br/>This is one of the best comic book based movies ever made.It stands right there with X-Men 2,definitely better then The Last Stand and probably a little under Batman Begins.So put your preconceptions aside and go watch the movie for what it is : a Marvel based movie with a good cast and strong visual effects.You will have a blast!"

At least Ghost Rider wasn't stuffed with it in EVERY SCENE like Star wars Ep3 was. Ugh.<br/><br/>Yes the movie had it's flaws. Every single movie does. Always. The major malfunction in my opinion was how quickly Rider took out the three henchmen. The shortness of those battles were pathetic. They seriously should have lasted longer, and extended to different areas than a bog, a rooftop, and a street. There should have been more violence put into the fights. Their deaths and defeats were awesome, but the battles (or lack thereof) were pathetic. The final battle was impressive, the way they made the Legion was great. Very haunting, very cool.<br/><br/>It's funny reading other hateful comments. It's like people don't even watch the movie. Haha."

But think about that. If the main character of a film turning into a flaming skeleton periodically through the picture makes you happy, this film will make you happy.<br/><br/>Really, It's a fun film, the special effects are very well used. The plot is thin, but then I went to see the main character turn into a flaming skeleton. If you're in the mood for a no-brain style of film with some fun scenes and an interesting idea (it could happen to you... OK, probably not...) then this is a film for you.

But i guess i was pleasantly surprised when i saw the movie was fast paced and had light hearted humor thrown in for good measure of laughs from the audience. Nicolas Cage is one of those few actors who can act really goofy when he wants to and in this movie he has a dead pan expression throughout as if to suggest he no control of what the hell is going on in his life. The best scene in the film is when he confesses to Eva Mendez about his ghost rider ""problem"".<br/><br/>Go and have some old fashioned fun at the movies. 7/10.

For a quick, light, good time, this will do just fine. Nic Cage works as Johnny Blaze ( I thought he'd look way too old, but he was believable). Sam Elliot was great as the Caretaker, Eva Mendes was good as Roxie, and everyone else was acceptable or better. The actual Ghost Rider effect was well done. This movie was better than Daredevil, not as good as any of the X-Men movies. Don't listen to the critics who trashed this film- they're allergic to fun.

I guess movies like Spider-Man and X-men spoiled me. I want to see long battles...not just three spirits getting killed with one blow. I mean...come on...they HAVE to be stronger than that? I thought the idea of Blackheart absorbing all of those souls was sweet..though I was hoping that he would have transformed more. It was still a very cool (and creepy) scene. I liked the Biblical reference to Legion.<br/><br/>Other than that, I enjoyed this movie. I laughed at the parts I was supposed to laugh at, and though some were a bit cheesy, I still enjoyed it. When I was asked to explain the movie to a friend, I said ""Nicholas Cage...Pointing...A lot!"" The Special Effects were amazing, especially the transformation scenes. Nick laughing maniacally reminds me of Face Off. ""I like peaces...I like them a lot."" Heh. Riding up the building was impressive and my boyfriend and I couldn't help but be impressed by his destruction of the city streets on his first ride. I jumped at the right places as well.

","May have some spoilers!!! I've seen it...<br/><br/>And it's good... Like really good compared to Daredevil (considering this is the movie everyone's comparing Ghost Rider to).<br/><br/>The first part is a little too fast, I mean, his dad didn't get much screen time even though he plays a pretty big part in the story. But then again, showing his dad too much would have been a little boring.<br/><br/>Eva Mendes was okay, but she showed off a little too much cleavage and seems to walk like a duck (yknow, with her but sticking out waaay too much).<br/><br/>The actions scenes were pretty good, the camera angles were great and the emphasis on the characters' movements were awesome. And i love his whole getup, with all the leather and chains and spikes and whatever else biker boys have.<br/><br/>Nic Cage acted quite well, i must say. but then again, when he's ghost rider, he doesn't have to act all that much. I mean, he's a flaming skeleton with this deep throaty voice... It could have been Britney Spears and we'd have been convinced he works for the Devil.<br/><br/>Oh and the Ghopst Rider himself, man his story is awesome. How often do you see some guy sell his soul and work for the devil and still be a good guy? I mean c'mon, if any of you watch the Collector, most of these people who sell their souls end up pretty frickin' screwed while they're alive.<br/><br/>On the effects, the flames were excellent. I love how the fire just does it's thing. It doesn't take your attention away from Ghost rider, but it doesn't just fade into his character, either. Although the Devil's son's ice power was a little... not cool enough. The way he kills his victims is so The Ring. The other three guys, the sand guy, the water guy and the air guy were alright too.<br/><br/>So overall, this movie is reaaaally nice. Kinda takes us away from all the city boys and gives us a badass Southern biker boy with kickass fire powers."

","Let me start out by saying that Mark Steven Johnson is a terrific writer and director. He did an amazing job with Simon Birch and Daredevil, providing movies with great acting and characters that you truly care about.<br/><br/>Ghost Rider is not so much a superhero movie as a folktale western, which is very cool. The script is great for the most part, though there are many unnecessary lines and speeches, but overall it is very good. The visuals are mind blowing, the locations for all the scenes are perfect, the performances by Cage, Mendes, Elliot, and Logue are terrific, and the cinematography is GORGEOUS.<br/><br/>Then why just a 6 out of ten? I can safely say that is all because of the acting on the part of everyone besides Cage, Mendes, Elliot, and Logue. Matt Long and Raquel Alessi play young Nicolas Cage and Eva Mendes, and they deserve to be beaten. They are, without a doubt, the most horrific actors in the movie. If it were not for them, the opening prologue would have been really good, even if it is a bit rushed.<br/><br/>Young Johnny Blaze (Matt Long) sells his soul to the devil (Peter Fonda), to save someone he loves. It is very cathartic and emotional, and it truly grabs you... at least it would if there were different actors in the scene. Long is a terrible actor, even worse than Daniel Radcliffe in the first Harry Potter film. Luckily, we don't have to deal with him for the whole movie.<br/><br/>Too bad we can't say the same about Fonda. He is truly horrible all the way through.<br/><br/>Soon we meet Blackheart, a truly frightening villain, with a truly pasty complexion. He is constantly killing, and it is never really explained why. Wes Bentley portrays him, and I'm still not sure who is worse, Fonda or Bentley. He truly is horrible in this movie, and it is too bad. Also his little gang of Justice Friends are totally unnecessary, and they bring me back bad memories of the villains in Elektra. And there was nothing good about Elektra.<br/><br/>All in all, the fault is on the casting director. This Christine King character should be locked in a closet for a long, long time. Sam Elliot however, blew me away. His performance was hands down the best in the movie.<br/><br/>The plot is really solid, the performances of the aforementioned four are terrific, the cinematography is gorgeous, the visuals are mind blowing, and the direction is amazing. Mark Steven Johnson did a great job with what he had, but it sadly is no Daredevil.<br/><br/>It really and truly is too bad that it supported such a horrid cast.<br/><br/>6 out of 10."

","I had my reservations about this movie. it was in the works for a long time and i was really surprised when they finally put it together. I had my reservations about Nick Cage playing the lead, but he really pulled it off. The special effects and story were good, and solid, to make a good comic book movie. ( MUCH BETTER than x-men 3 and the HULK )<br/><br/>This is a good movie i would recommend to anyone to go see with some friends, just to have a good time. It has a good flow, the depth of the story is good, and the action is well done.<br/><br/>I would like to see a sequel, which obviously will happen with the great opening it has had. I just hope they spend just a little more time with the villains, and a tighter storyline."

","Eva Mendes to me did not steal the show but in fact it was Sam Elliott because you really did not see it coming. It is nice to see the older actors in movies especially when that part fit him to a tee. He played the part well. Nick Cage was also great, with the two together the movie was outstanding. Special effects was truly up there. I really don't like Nick Cage that well but in this movie he did a really great job at it. I can't wait for the next one to come along because they can't end this movie that way and not make another one. To me a movie doesn't have to have a lot of romance in it to make it interesting and this just had enough in it to probably keep some women interested and with Cage buffed up for the part it didn't detract from the movie either."

","Ghost Rider is about stunt man Johnny Blaze (Nicholas Cage) who's father is dying of cancer. When Johnny finds this out that his father Barton Blaze is dying the devil or Mephistopheles (Peter Fonda) visits Johnny and offers his his father's heath for his soul. In the deal the Mephistopheles will leave Johnny alone until he needs him to do his bidding. Johnny excepts and the next morning his father is cured. But Mephistopheles tricked Johnny and during a stunt the next day Johnny's father dies. When Barton dies Johnny leaves the town and his girlfriend Roxanne Simpson (Eva Mendes) behind. When Johnny gets older he becomes a professional stunt man who travels the country doing dangerous stunts on his motorcycle without ever getting injured. When Roxanne comes back into Johnny's life everything changes. When Johnny is about to leave to meet Roxanne odd things start happening and Mephistopheles shows up. Mephistopheles' son Blackheart (Wes Bentley) shows up and wants to create hell on earth. Now Johnny is turned into Ghost Rider and must defeat Blackheart with the help of a cemetery caretaker (Sam Elliott) in order to win back his freedom from Mephistopheles.<br/><br/>Ghost Rider started out slow but eventually got very exciting. Although Ghost Rider was not as good as I had expected I still enjoyed it very much. Ghost Rider had a good story, a cool hero, cool bad guys and a lot of good action. Ghost Rider is not for little kids. Although it has very little swearing it still is very creepy for little kids mostly because of the bad guys and how Ghost Rider kills the bad guys (Ghost Rider makes his victims look into his eyes and see all of the evil they have ever done and makes them feel the pain). All in all the movie was very enjoyable."
"maestroman","8","2","3","17 February 2007"," I'm not disappointed
","It was a great day to unwind Friday night and seeing Ghost Rider was just the thing I needed. Nicholas Cage playing Johnny Blaze did a great addition to Ghost Rider's character with his eccentric style. The movie doesn't follow the comics very much, but we don't want the whole movie to take place in hell. Now the fact that Johnny has sold his soul to the devil to be a ghost rider now that's accurate and it gives the movie plenty of motivation. Pretty soon Blackheart and his minions want to get in Johnny's position of power and they want a contract of one thousand souls. Eva Mendes had great perkiness and she was also delightful to see. The movie is loads of fun with great action, and plenty of intentional laughs. You'll have a good time."

","As a non-fan of the comic, I went to the preview with no preconceived notions and came out feeling that the movie was fairly well done. The special effects were excellent and they took obvious pains to bring the Ghost Rider character to life with CG. The transformation scenes were quite intense early on and parents might want to consider this could be disturbing for younger children(lots of agonized yelling w/up close face shots of NC).<br/><br/>The back-story of the previous Ghost Rider(s) felt like it needed more fleshing out to give a complete story but did an adequate job (if you aren't late and don't know the story, you won't be confused.) Action wise, the fight sequences felt rushed and there was little tension/apprehension that Ghost Rider might fail in his early encounters.<br/><br/>All in all, a pretty good action flick and not a debacle that some of the comic book conversions have been.<br/><br/>Kraki"

","I admit that when i first saw Ghost Rider on t.v i didn't really like it, i thought it was too cheesy but i recently gave it another try because i love most of the Marvel studios films.
Yes i was a fan of the early 2000's Marvel films, well before the Connected Universe stuff, I'm a big fan of the Excellent 2003 The Punisher, starring Thomas Jane, it's an underrated CLASSIC in my opinion!!! Also the fantastic Ang Lee directed Superhero Drama ""Hulk"" from 2003, starring Eric Bana & then there's the extremely underrated ""Daredevil"" from 2003, starring Ben Affleck, also the Excellent Sam Raimi directed Spiderman Trilogy, Marvel was already making excellent but very underrated movies way back then.
Now, Ghost Rider fits into the very underrated Marvel movies. I recently brought it on dvd & watched it & was totally surprised by how much i enjoyed it, a fantasy western Horror Thriller.
I've always liked Nicolas Cage & here he's perfectly cast as the cocky & crazy bad-ass motorcycle stuntman JOHNNY BLAZE!!! IT'S such a fun character for Cage to sink his teeth into & create an Awesome leather-jacket wearing demon Anti-hero, it's like it was made for Nicolas Cage.<br/><br/>Here a Young Johnny Blaze sells his soul to the Devil, played by Hollywood legend Peter Fonda R.I.P, in order to save his dying dad but in doing that he has become a Warrior from hell that has to carry out kills for the Devil himself.
Johnny Blaze goes against the Devil & becomes a type of Anti-hero but he has the fight against some other powerful demons that want to destroy the world, it's full on Comic-book fantasy stuff.
The cast is rounded out with the always Awesome & rugged, Sam Elliott as a mysterious Caretaker that knows alot about the forces of darkness, also Eva Mendes stars as Roxanne, the love of Johnny Blaze's life. The cast are all great in their roles.
A big great part of this movie is the incredible special effects, especially when Johnny Blaze transforms into the Ghost Rider, with flames pouring out of his face revealing a skull & it's done fantasticly!!! The glowing fire against the dark, gritty & grimy streets is a mesmerising visual treat, the cinematography really is fantastic.
Yes the look of the movie is stunning & the music is Cool & the action is fast & furious!!!
Seeing Ghost Rider riding his moterbike with flames pouring out is just such cool scenes & creates such great imagery.
There's some great bits in here like the police chasing Ghost Rider & he rides up a building, it's so cool & when Ghost Rider gets a mugger & literally scares him to death & lots more great fantasy moments & some Great fight scenes with Ghost Rider using his big flaming chain as a weapon. There's at times a dark atmosphere but it's all in a blockbuster fun kind of way, i see this as an Awesome summer blockbuster movie that was just very misunderstood & underrated in my opinion, put it this way i would rather watch ""Ghost Rider"" than an ""Iron-Man"" movie or a ""Captain America"" movie, nothing against those flicks as i love most of the ""MCU"" but ""Ghost Rider"" is just simply a more entertaining & enjoyable movie, in my opinion.<br/><br/>""GHOST RIDER"" is a pure fun, Action-packed Fantasy Thriller with Horror & western elements mixed into a big budget Summer Popcorn movie that's big on fun & full of Cool moments.
Nicolas Cage is literally on Fire here in his role!!!"

If this movie will malke under r rating then it will be more awesome,like underworld or deadpool"
"georgebcollyer","5","1","1","8 January 2020"," Cheesy Rider
","Ghost Rider is simultaneously fantastic and terrible. Yes, the script is fairly bad, and some of the acting is a little bit rubbish, but can you really argue with a demonic bounty hunter with motorbike leather and a flaming head? Not really. Sadly though, one of the film's major flaws, in my opinion, is there isn't enough actual Ghost Riding! But we do get a cowboy Ghost Rider, which is just glorious, and they were fools not to give him his own spin off. Fools, I tell ya! Anyway, the plot, such as it is,concerns a motorbike stuntman (Nicolas Cage) who makes a deal with the devil Mephistopheles (Peter Fonda, who's clearly relishing the role), and becomes the aforementioned flame-headed demonic bounty hunter, while trying to get back together with his old girlfriend (Eva Mendes, who's trying her best to handle a cheesy romantic subplot).<br/><br/>First off, it all looks terrific;the CGI used to burn Nicolas Cage's flesh off (or maybe that was just his really intense acting) and demon-ify his motorbike is fantastic. Also, it's great that Nicolas Cage is basically playing, erm, Nicolas Cage. This means that the character of Johnny Blaze is imbued with some bizarre characteristics e.g. drinking jelly beans out of a martini glass. Other great acting in the film comes from Peter Fonda as the devil and Sam Elliot, who plays a mysterious old cowboy type, with the greatest 'stache ever seen in any film I've watched.Also, the heavy metal score is awesome, and the cowboy Ghost Rider is the Best Thing Ever.<br/><br/>Now, the bad stuff: The script is clunky and some characters are thinly sketched. Also, though the main villain, Blackheart (Wes Nelson) is admirably unhinged, he kept distractingly reminding me of Edward from Twilight for some reason, and the side villains, for all their apparent deadliness, don't really prove much of a challenge for Ol' Flamehead (though their killings are epic). The plot is also loaded with plot holes you could drive a flaming bike through. All this said though, it's great for some mindless, so-bad-it's-good fun."

"Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187","5","1","1","17 August 2018"," I thought this was AWESOME back when it came out. Now I see it a little differently.
","Ghost Rider is what you call a hot mess of a movie: it's bombastic, over-the-top, testosterone-fueled spectacle that gets you right into the action thanks to its admittedly awesome visuals relating to Ghost Rider himself (though Nick Cage just doesn't fit with the character's 'Clint Eastwood'-like nature); but the story leaves a lot to be desired in spite of some action scenes being well-done.<br/><br/>Ghost Rider is your average Hollywood movie blockbuster fanfare: with a by-the-numbers plot that's done in such a bold yet uniquely stoic way it's got product-placements galore and it's set-piece porn. There's no real story per-say. The events in the movie are all tied due to a phoned in romantic subplot that ties to Ghost Rider's fight against crime itself. And I suppose, for the movie that it is, the film actually succeeds quite well; it's a superficial superhero movie and it knows it. So why not get in on the B-grade fun anyway?<br/><br/>Ghost Rider is a ho-hum affair that you can readily give a skip. There's really not all that much besides the spectacle of Ghost Rider himself (hen he actually is on screen). 2.5/5 stars."
"TheNameBrand","5","1","1","1 June 2018"," Ghost Movie
","Not my favorite Nic Cage movie, or favorite Pre-Iron Man (2008) Marvel film, but it was surprisingly coherent, and had some decent Nic freak-outs. It's overall kinda bland, and not super worth watching, even just to make fun of it."
"eliza_gaskell","8","1","1","31 March 2018"," Great fun with no expectations
","If only Columbia Pictures and it's associated studios could have waited and made this film after Deadpool (2016) and Logan (2017). This movie should of been rated ""R"", with all the blood, gore, violence, sex and filled with every curse word under the sun and blessed with a solid storyline and exceptional director. Nevertheless, whilst it is cheesy, with poor dialogue, a God awful script and the plot is pretty basic, it is actually an enjoyable film.<br/><br/>The Good: 
(1) The Special Effects for the Ghost Rider. Whenever he is on screen, blazing on his motor cycle with his flaming skull, the film picks 10 fold. The part where he jumps of the skyscraper or when Cage morphs to the ghost rider is fantastic. But those parts are far and few between in the film. 
(2) The A-grade actors in a (essentially) B-grade film. What this means is, there are a number of surprisingly good actors ( Nicholas Cage as Johnny Blaze and Eva Mendes as Roxanne, Sam Elliot as the Caretaker) which bring their all to a poor script. Yes the dialogue is laughable when it is delivered, but that is what makes it so enjoyable. Raquel Alessi could easily have been a Eva Mendes younger twin sister.
(3) The Western tones interwoven in the film is great. <br/><br/>The Bad: 
(1) The villains are so weak. Peter Fonda as the Devil gets a pass. Only because it's really good to see him on screen. BUT Wes Bentley, as main nemesis Blackhearts should of walked when he read the script. He has some of the movies worst dialogue. Sadly, unlike Cage and Mendes, he simply does not have the ""knack"" for delivery and his lines are dreadfully executed.
(2) People who put a lot of themselves in film usually indicate they love the source material, so it is very difficult to understand if Mark Steven Johnson was either a writer/director with no balls to stand up to the studios or it was simply a job to him, (3) The plot is a no brainer. Boy loves girl. Boy mets Devil. Boy makes a deal with the Devil. Boy loses Girl. Boy becomes a flaming skull. Boy meets girl again. Thankfully the Ghost Rider, is a marginally better written script, then most Hollywood blockbusters such as Star Wars:The Clone Wars.<br/><br/>The Ugly: 
(1) The biggest problem is Nicholas Cage as Johnny Blaze. In a nutshell....he was cast wrong. Look a the actor Matt Long who played an 18 year old Johnny Blaze to then 42 year old Johnny Blaze played by Nicholas Cage. The film really is asking a lot for the audience to believe they are the same person.<br/><br/>Don't over analyse the film too much, because it create lofty expectations. Films like the Ghost Rider is a guilty pleasure, with great action, a uncomplicated plot and exceptional special effects. Hopefully this franchise gets a robot in the future and upgraded to ""R"" rating.
PS: was going to grade the film at 7 BUT that awesome soundtrack song at the end credits by Spiderbait reworking the song ""Ghost Riders in the Sky"" pushed it to 8"

"BloomingtonAdam","6","1","1","1 August 2015"," One of the best bad movies I've seen
","8 years after the original release, I finally got around to seeing Ghost Rider. It was not much loved by the critics, so it was never on my ""must see"" list. Having procured an inexpensive copy, I thought I'd give it a go.<br/><br/>Let's clear the air first. This is not a good movie for many reasons. The writing is bad. The plot is predictable. The dialogue leaves a lot to be desired, and this movie definitely slows down at one point.<br/><br/>Having said that, it is still a lot of fun. Early on, we meet the main character and his love interest, which is one of the things that plays our predictably for the most part. We find out about his young life and an important life changing decision he makes. We come to the present day Johnny Blaze and witness his evolution into Ghost Rider. He's given a very specific task he has to undertake, which he does begrudgingly. Watching him handle the early transitions from human to Ghost Rider, I kept thinking of a flaming Hulk. Dr. Banner would have been proud.<br/><br/>Johnny continues his mission, and finds out the answers to some mysteries along the way. Now wanted by the police, he must figure out how to handle what his life has become.<br/><br/>The effects in this movie are pretty great, and I found myself admiring touches like the flaming trails left by the motorcycle. There were a few humorous moments, and of course a lot of Nick Cage... well... being Nick Cage. <br/><br/>If you don't mind very imperfect films, this one is a fun way to spend an afternoon.

","Ghost Rider (2007): Dir: Mark Steven Johnson / Cast: Nicolas Cage, Eva Mendes, Peter Fonda, Sam Elliott, Wes Bentley: Blazing adaptation of the popular comic superhero. It seems to suggest struggling with the past. Nicolas Cage plays motorcycle stunt driver Johnny Blaze who sells his soul to the devil in exchange for his father's health. Years later he wishes for a second chance but by night he transforms into an inhuman being with a flamed skull. Third act is mainly action violence but the screenplay wisely centres on Blaze dealing with his powers. Director Mark Steven Johnson is backed with tremendous special effects. This is a vast improvement over the ridiculous Daredevil, which is also about a superhero aiding a power unrequested. Cage brings out regret and anguish as someone who will use his super powers for the good of others. Eva Mendes plays a reporter formerly his childhood friend. She will predictably accept his powered handicap but not without reflections of the past. Peter Fonda plays a Satan like figure who issues the contract to Blaze. The role is fairly standard but finds defeat by the powers he essentially issued. Sam Elliott is flat as a mysterious figure called Caretaker. Wes Bentley is another casting of a demented being of little interest. The comic book theme is highlighted within the film regarding second chances that we all chase after. Score: 7 / 10"
"Wuchakk","7","1","1","24 April 2015"," ""You can't live in fear""
","Mark Steven Johnson's ""Ghost Rider"" (2007) combines Faust and Spider-Man and mixes in elements of all the variations of the Ghost Rider comics up to the present, including the 50's Western hero, but it's main inspiration is the 70s-80s comic featuring Johnny Blaze as the protagonist.<br/><br/>What makes Ghost Rider appealing? Well, the only thing cooler than a guy in black leather and chains driving a Harley is a flaming skeleton in black leather and chains driving a supernatural flaming Harley. That pretty much explains it.<br/><br/>THE PLOT: Johnny Blaze and his father make a living as Evel Knieval-like stunt riders in a carnival. When Johnny's dad is diagnosed with cancer he is misled into making a deal with the devil. His father is healed of the cancer but Satan makes sure he dies in a stunt accident. Because of Johnny's foolish deal he is cursed to become the nigh-invincible Ghost Rider -- a supernatural flaming skeleton.<br/><br/>Some criticize Nicholas Cage as Johnny Blaze because Blaze is supposed to be about 30 years old, while Cage was around 41. Yeah, someone like James Franco would have been better for the role, especially since Franco looks exactly like Mike Ploog's version of Blaze, but Cage does a fine job. Besides, Cage is in great shape and I know guys 25 years old who look older than him. As for Eva Mendes, who plays Johnny's girlfriend, she's ten years younger than Cage and is both voluptuous and adequate in the role.<br/><br/>Some criticize the film as too serious, others as too goofy, but the fact is that ""Ghost Rider"" has the same general tone as all the other superhero flicks released since 2000. It's a serious story for the most part, although completely unbelievable due to the subject matter, with some humor thrown in for good measure. In other words, it's neither deathly serious nor a campy goof-fest; it rides the line between these two extremes.<br/><br/>If all you want out of ""Ghost Rider"" is an entertaining supernatural superhero flick ""Ghost Rider"" delivers and is worth viewing for this purpose. But the film delivers on a deeper level. Here are a smattering of noteworthy elements: <br/><br/><ul><li>Note that Johnny is misled into ""selling his soul"" to the devil and has to face the negative consequences of his decision. Few people will literally ""sell their soul"" to Satan as shown in the story but we can all relate to the struggle with the evil that exists within our own hearts. If we decide to live according to the inclinations of our lower, destructive, selfish nature are we not, in a sense, ""selling our soul"" to the devil? (regardless of whether you view the devil as a literal spiritual being or merely as a symbol of potential human evil). Whenever we choose to live according to this lower nature will we not automatically perform evil and, in that sense, fulfill the devil's will? (ditto).</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Peter Fonda as Satan is perfect and entertaining, as is Sam Elliott as the old Westerner.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Love is an important theme in the story. Johnny ""sells his soul"" for love of his father. He didn't do it for greed or some other carnal purpose. This is agape love, self-sacrificial love, love in it's highest and purest form. This puts Johnny on God's side (as Elliott's character observes in the film) and makes him a serious threat to the devil's purposes on earth.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>We also witness Blaze's great love for Roxanne and vice versa, as well as Mack's love for Johnny, etc.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>This is contrasted by the total absence of love in Satan's kingdom. The devil hates his son and vice versa. This is a fitting depiction because God is described as love in the Bible; and since Satan has chosen to separate from God and be His enemy, he has naturally separated himself from love and become love's enemy. Hate in all its ugly manifestations is therefore the essence of the devil's kingdom and relationships.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>When Blaze first turns into the Ghost Rider and goes for a ride in his flame cycle he causes great havoc wherever he goes. You'll note that this is much toned down in his later excursions as Ghost Rider. The explanation? Johnny simply didn't know how to control the supernatural hellfire and ""spirit of vengeance"" during his initial conversion.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Although it's supposed to be amusing, it makes sense that Johnny would listen to The Carpenters in his down time. Blaze's daredevil lifestyle and his problems with the Ghost Rider curse would understandably cause him a great deal of stress. Listening to Karen's ultra-soothing voice would be a great pacifier.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>There's a great scene of Ghost Rider riding off the top of a skyscrapper, whipping his chain in exulting fury, and then riding full blast down the building smashing into the pavement below as police and onlookers observe in total disbelief.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>In the comics Blackheart was the only comic character that ever sent chills down my spine (in Ann Nocenti's Daredevil). I didn't get this feeling from Wes Bentley's portrayal in the film, although there's a hint of that. Regardless, Bentley does a fine job in the role. And Blackheart's total ugly wickedness is certainly revealed or demonstrated here and there.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>There's a great musical interlude featuring the Ghost Rider and the Caretaker (Elliott) riding through the night desert for hundreds of miles to San Vengaza. Fittingly, the song is a modern hard rock version of ""Ghost Riders in the Sky"" (I love that song! Who doesn't?) </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The picture was filmed in Victoria, Australia, and the city of Melbourne.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The Ghost Rider himself (itself?) is a triumph of special effects. Needless to say, the film is enjoyable just to look at.</li></ul><br/><br/>GRADE: B+"

Cage takes challenge against the demi-Good spirited for taking his fathers life after his promise of making him live after a cure. Both the actor and actress managed high end temperaments. This movie is exact what it want, not putting extra makeovers. Graphic part is well coped up with reality and near natural. Hatsoff to the makers and crew. Many of the popular movies pleased high spirited story lines fell unfruitful to their next sequels, the part two may not managed that of the part one of Ghost rider. Most of the fairy tales, mythological, Historical concepts proved blockbuster for cine- goers. Ghost rider got the good appreciation for its type of entertainment to the audience. Its being horror movie, but by reveling in time seems a romantic and needy character in society in a way of drama. Thanks to the technology for producing movies to masses and by dubbing in various languages around the globe. Movies are inspirations."

","Is this movie memorable? Apart from the flaming scull, no. Is it a great movie? No. Was Underworld a great movie? Not really, no. Was Resident Evil? No. They are not bad movies, but they are no works of art either. They are quick dark superhero B-movies meant to appeal to the emo 13 year-old boys of the new generation, so I do not think it is fair to hold Ghost Rider to a different standard.<br/><br/>The main issues with the movie are: <br/><br/>1. A weak villain. Wes Bentley was not bad but he was more like a villain's henchman rather than the villain himself.<br/><br/>2. Nicolas Cage's acting did not fit the movie. He played it straight. He was acting a poor tormented man, taking his stuff way too seriously. Why would the makers go with that approach? The premise of the movie clearly required goofiness, which Cage could have totally provided. That is what you hire the guy for and yet his potential was not used.<br/><br/>3. The story...I can't remember any of it. The script as a whole was a bit of a mess. Something about the deal with the devil and the flaming scull. That is all.<br/><br/>But the movie also has a few good things in it: <br/><br/>1. The Ghost Rider. The action parts with the Ghost Rider were a lot of fun. He looks great. I never got tired of that flaming skeleton on a bike. Yes, of course it's just CGI, but it still looked awesome. There was a scene where he rides on the side of a building. It was ridiculous and great. I generally just liked the the art in this movie.<br/><br/>2. The sound design. The roaring engine of the bike, the dark music, the metal chain smacking around. I really liked the cling clang sound mood that this movie had.<br/><br/>All in all, I do not know what people expected this would be. It's a B action movie with little to no story in it. Just go with it."
"JamesMitchell451","4","1","1","22 September 2013"," One of the most embarrassing superhero movies of all time
","Okay let me see: You got a b-list Marvel comic book character, you get Nicholas Cage to play him, and you get a questionable director behind the camera: What made any of us think this was gonna be good again? When a motorcycle-riding stuntman offers his soul to Mephistopheles in order to save the life of the one he loves most, he is forced to play host to a powerful supernatural entity whose flaming skull visage strikes fear into the heart of his enemies in this feature-film version of the long-running comic series. By day, Johnny Blaze (actor and comic- book devotee Nicolas Cage) is one of the world's best-known stuntmen, but when the sun goes down and he is in the presence of evil, the death- defying daredevil bursts into flames to become the indestructible, motorcycle-riding antihero known to the world as the Ghost Rider. ( Jason Buchanan, Rovi) So Nicholas Cage can sometimes be good in a movie. And other times he can be awful. In this movie, he falls under the latter. Everyone in this is AWFUL!!!!!! Eva Mendes, well I'll give her a pass because I wasn't paying attention to her acting but everyone else is so dull, flat, and lifeless. You would think goddamn George Lucas directed this movie. The plot doesn't fare any better I might add. The villains are more of a laughing stock than a threat, and the main baddie Blackheart does nothing but act all emo and be all like ""I'm gonna destroy the world cause I got daddy issues"". The action scenes are mundane, and flat out just not interesting as well. Just like the rest of the movie I might add. And you know what is even more surprising: They made a sequel to this! And it is somehow even worse."

","It took me 5 years to watch the extended cut of a flick that no one likes. well almost nobody. most of the comic fans teared it down completely. But comments doesn't mean a thing, they made Ghost Rider 2 a few years later. <br/><br/>Was it all that bad. Well, for the story itself there was indeed not that many action going on to make it look like a Spiderman or Batman. But the Ghost Rider himself isn't one that's after bad persons like in Batman or Spiderman. He's more out to catch the devil's son and other bad spirits. So that means that you will need a lot of effects and it do shows here that a lot of money went to the effects used. I'm not a CGI guy but here you do need it and it all looked ""marvel""lous. <br/><br/>I did like the acting except for Eva Mendes. She wasn't believable and her acting wasn't that great for me. She had two other things that attracted you to the screen and sadly they did in stead of looking at her acting. It was fun to see Sam Elliot again, again as a cowboy and old glory Peter Fonda of Easy Rider (1969) fame. Funny to see him in another bike movie. <br/><br/>Nicolas Cage does what he does best and it shows. It's funny to see that a guy who was in a lot of blockbusters decided to go for the B-flicks. I know that there are a lot of haters out but I still love him. I liked him more in Drive Angry (2011) but still he did well.<br/><br/>Maybe indeed a bit too much of a love story involved but the open ending said enough, Ghost Rider: Spirit Of Vengeance (2011) was made. only for the lovers of Marvel comics.<br/><br/>Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 effects 5/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5"
"gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297","7","1","1","16 July 2012"," Despite it's own problems, I think I really like this film
","A friend of mine showed this to me on DVD at school a few days ago and at first, I wasn't very interested, but since this is one of the few superhero movies I've recently seen, I thought, ""Oh, well. Might as well give this a shot."" and watched it with little expectations. A few minutes later, when I see the Ghost Rider started appearing for the first time, I was left speechless, but in terms of story in narrative forms, I don't think that this is a masterpiece of superhero films, although I do think that this is a very good movie.<br/><br/>I understand all the criticism it had when it first came out in theaters and I'll admit that the dialog is pretty silly along with it's inept script containing it's schmaltzy moments, but in my opinion, I liked this for what it was.<br/><br/>I like the music from Christopher Young. His blend of Gothic and western themes along with some guitar pieces fitted well for the film. The CGI effects, although below par, are at least decent with some neatly detailed look of the Ghost Rider and his awesome bike. The action is also pretty cool too with Ghost Rider killing his enemies, but I think the acting steals the show. Sam Elliot did great with his role, Eva Mendes did very well as the lead role's love interest and Peter Fonda did a decent job as Mephisto. Now, I don't hate Nicolas Cage as much, but I personally think that he was miscasted as the leading role. I think a much better actor (like Jake Gyllenhaal, perhaps?) would have fitted the role. Wes Bentley, however, is uninteresting as the villain due to his lack of emotion.<br/><br/>OK, I know you guys are going to hate me for this, but... I really like the story. Now, I never read the comics this was based on, but I think that it's really faithful to the spirit and tone despite it's disappointing ending (which was the only problem that I do have with the plot) and has some nice visuals; not to mention it has great cinematography. The editing however, is rather choppy at times.<br/><br/>So, is Ghost Rider's a masterpiece? Not exactly. Is it as bad as the critics and others say it is. Not quite. Like I said, I understand the criticism it had in a superhero movie, but that kind of hatred goes to Batman & Robin and Steel (those were terrible superhero movies). So, overall, not great, but I liked it for what it was and it's a faithful adaptation of the comics I never read."
"Matt_Layden","5","1","1","20 July 2009"," Point Here...Point There....
","I can sum up this film with two words. Pointing and Cleavage. That's right...lots of pointing and lots of cleavage. The perfect mix to get teenage boys in their seats. Oh wait, cleavage, action and goofy special effects gets their asses in those seats. Well Ghost Rider has that down pat too.<br/><br/>It's not that I don't like this film, it's just that it's not particularly that good. Nic Cage, whom I have grown to really love as an actor, seem completely out of place here. I don't know if it was his bad hair, bad chemistry or his bad Elvis impersonation, but he did not sell this role for me.<br/><br/>Eva Mendes, great too look at and in the right role can really deliver a good performance. She has nothing to really do here except be what I have already ""pointed"", hehe, get it, out to you. Cleavage. I don't know if 'respected' reporters where those types of shirts, but I was distracted every time she was on screen.<br/><br/>The supporting cast, which includes Peter Fonda, Donal Logue and the weird plastic bag kid from American Beauty (just kidding, Wes Bently) ham it up. The big villain in this film is a kid that I do not find evil or intimidating. Fonda merely walks around the scenes and never does anything of interest and Logue has too few scenes to really even mention. Don't get me started on Sam Elliott. Here's a guy whose big scene had me pumped, then left me with a sour taste in my mouth after he merely walks away during the big climax.<br/><br/>The Ghost Rider effects are neat, but the bad guys were hokey. Earth, wind and water? The way people died was laughable too. We know that the relatively not so popular comic book characters can really be good films, this one missed the boat."

They manage to make you feel the intensity of a full-blown Ghost Rider, so I was happy...<br/><br/>Nicholas Cage is acting like his talents are in a ""cage"", very limited somehow.<br/><br/>People complain a lot about bad acting in this movie, but I feel you must remember that this is converted from a comic book, so I feel like the acting is emphasizing that.<br/><br/>The plot is crap and unoriginal, but who cares, it's Ghost Rider!"

","Of course it would be tough to exceed the level of X-men or Spiderman, or even come close, but regardless, it is nice to have the Marvel comic characters being made into enjoyable and watchable film versions, rather than those lame made-for-TV or animated series. Before the current group was created, the best Marvel film was Punisher with Dolph Lundgren, and that was a little better than mediocre film. This one is rather in the middle as far as being compared to all recent Marvel films, but that still means it's a good one. Nick Cage is a superb Ghostrider, and it's hard to imagine anyone else doing so well with it. The supporting cast is fine, and of course the effects are super. though it may have weak points, it moves along at a pace that lets you pretty much forget about them. Marvel fans won't want to miss this and others will probably like it as well. Don't expect it to be one of the best Marvel films ever done and you'll not be disappointed."
"crackafacesupre","1","5","12","4 March 2007"," horrible, just a straight up disaster
","Wow this movie sucked. Seriously, the makers of this movie had so much to work with and ended up with this? This joins The Hulk(2003),and Superman II(1980) for superhero movies that can end the world, in which a super hero will not be able to save because they will be so depressed from being so badly portrayed. I honestly almost cried from anger that I payed to see a horrible film of such a high caliber.<br/><br/>First off, I would like to break down why this movie was destined for greatness. The story of Ghost Rider I learned was a story that was multi dimensional, and had a dark realism that if executed right could have been made into a movie such as Batman(1989). Obviously, it was not executed properly, and the idea became a cheesy kiddie film. Marvel took an idea full of promise and flushed it down the toilet, demonstrating their lack of understanding for their own comics.<br/><br/>The second reason I truly hated this movie was the waste of casting for the movie. Nicholas Cage if given the right character can be very entertaining. HE WAS NOT. A glimpse of Eva Mendes can make almost any movie worth watching. NOT THIS ONE. I would hate the actors for even agreeing to make this movie, but right now I'm contemplating whether or not to sell my own soul to the devil in exchange for the destruction of MARVEL Studios. Lastly, what the hell was up with Blackheart? He was the lamest and least scariest villain I have or probably will ever see. He struck fear in no one, and his henchmen were less threatening than a hamster. Also, what was with the final showdown? I haven't been more disappointed since watching any scene from the movie Poseidon(2006).<br/><br/>All in all, I feel not holding back on this movie serves true justice to this creation of momentous failures. I remember trying to get into the movie so hard that I fell asleep for 15 minutes from exhaustion. When I woke up, however, I felt better for myself because I know now that in a situation of extreme measures, I can sleep through it. Friday night, Feb. 16th has been stolen from me, and I will never forgive Ghost Rider for it."

A truly sickening waste of money that lumbers between scenes with all the grace of an amputee elephant falling through a series of windows onto a grease covered ice rink. Don't watch it. Just don't.

"Sherazade","8","4","9","24 February 2007"," A Hater's Worst Nightmare...Because it is so GOOD!
","Let me start with this, nobody looks like themselves in this movie, that I was initially stuck doing double takes before I could settle into the storyline. Peter Fonda playing Mephistopheles looked much like Jack Nicholson to me, Wes Bentley playing Blackheart looked very much like Joaquin Phoenix to me, plus it was so obvious that makeup was what was used to achieve the similarities between the young Roxanne Simpson & Johnny Blaze and the older ones but don't even get me started on how much Eva Mendes playing Roxanne Simpson looked and acted very much like an Uber bimbo version Jessica Simpson. Ugh!<br/><br/>Anywho, the films begin with the audience being clued in on the legend of the ghost rider, specifically the one who out ran the devil while unwilling to deliver a contract of tortured souls. Then the storyline fast forwards to the future and we are introduced to the love story between teenagers Johnny Blaze (played by Matt Long) and Roxanne Simpson (Raquel Alessi). Both of their fathers are against the relationship, with the former thinking that his daughter is too good for Johnny and the latter thinking that his son should forget what he terms a fleeting affair. But the teenagers are in love and decide to run away together the following day. That night, while Johnny is tidying up he finds a letter in the dustbin that reveals his father, Barton Blaze (played by Brett Cullen) has cancer. This upsets him and he decides go out and work off his energy on repairing his bike, he is doing this when a man (who turns out to be Mephistopheles) appears out of no where and begins to talk to him about his father's condition. Young Johnny is intrigued and inadvertently winds up signing his soul to the devil in exchange for his father's health. The next day, when he sees his father all hale and hearty, he realises that the night before hadn't been a dream but the reality really hits him when his father dies hours later and he (Johnny) is revisited by Mephistopheles who clues him in on what is to come. In rage, Johnny ditches Roxanne and runs away on his own and this is where Nicolas Cage's character takes over. In present day, Johnny Blaze is a very famous stuntman with a dark secret that hunts him every waking moment. Roxannne Simpson (now played by Eva Mendes doing a very bad spoof of Jessica Simpson) waltzes her way back into his life when he least expects it, as does Mephistopheles to stake his claim. Now Blaze has his hands full battling his feelings for Roxanne, his disgust for Mephistopheles and not the mention the legion of demons that accompany Mephistopheles's son and nemesis Blackheart (played by Wes Bentley). Donal Logue co-stars Blaze's best-friend and manager.<br/><br/>Watch it for the spectacular special effects, funny lines/comic relief, Cage's witty GR and Bentley's show-stopping Blackheart. I, for one doubted how they were going to bring the awesome comic book anti-hero to life but they made good on their promise to wow! us if you asked me. Only two things annoyed me in the entire film, Eve Mendes's Roxanne and the Old Ghost Rider (most of his lines were very lame) and his secret wasn't that much of a secret to me or much of the audience for that matter. That said, it's still pure entertainment, nothing more nothing less, I don't understand why people are acting as if this is the war in Iraq we're talking about here. If this film is not good enough entertainment or adaptation for you, then do us all a favour and make your own adaptation."
"goothva1","8","4","9","23 February 2007"," Extremely interesting
","At first I was skeptical about this movie, as I am a big fan of comic books, Marvel in particular. FX were very appealing, and my favorite was when GR yanked the helicopter towards him and bitched out the pilot (the whole theater was rolling on that one), and the riding on water flipping off the cops made my night! While I did think that bringing in Blackheart as the main villain was premature (would have made for a hell of a sequel), I can't recall very many main bad guys GR had in the comics (70's or 90's), so I really shouldn't say anything about that. Although, if they brought in Hyde for the sequel, that would be awesome.<br/><br/>I would not recommend that the parents take children under the age of 12 to see this movie (or if your kids are emotionally sensitive) due to a few demonic faces, and the overall darkness of the film. PG-13 is an appropriate rating, so please abide by it.<br/><br/>The only thing I didn't like about this movie was how it ended. It was so cheesy, and JB's speech at the end was just (bad acting) predictable. If there is a sequel, I truly hope it is better than this one, because if not, I won't follow the franchise. Hence the reason for the 8 as my vote. That's how bad I feel the ending was. Other than that, enjoy the movie!"

Over 10 years later, a motorcycle riding, skull flaming, soul banishing bounty hunter from hell is still the coolest thing I've ever heard of.<br/><br/>Everyone thinks they're a movie critic, and there have been so many great movies that people have dumped on because they think something, somehow gave them the right to criticize something they couldn't do themselves, or wouldn't like no matter how good it was. If you want to say Ghost Rider was a bad movie, then before your opinion has ANY weight, you have to show me that you could make a better movie, otherwise SHUT UP and let people who love the comic and love the idea go to the movie and have a great time.<br/><br/>People love to harp on this movie because of its premise. I hear a lot of Scooby-Doo references, I don't know about you, but I've never seen a flaming skull use a chain to banish evil souls to hell in Scooby-Doo. IGNORE anyone who negatively criticizes this movie because of the premise, completely ignore them, since no matter how good the movie was, they wouldn't like it anyway, and they shouldn't rate it. Don't listen to them, not just for this movie, for ANY movie.<br/><br/>To all you movie critics out there: Movies are meant to entertain, if you don't find a certain movie entertaining, then ALL THAT MEANS is that it wasn't entertaining TO YOU. Just because you don't like a movie doesn't mean it's a bad movie. Thinking it's a bad movie simply because YOU didn't like it is so incredibly pretentious that I think you need to re-evaluate your place in society. I've lived my entire life never listening to any critics; I've watched every movie I ever wanted to see because that's my decision, not theirs. Make your own decisions, watch the movie if you think you'll like it, and don't listen to the critics... EVER.<br/><br/>This movie does not disappoint. Of course it's not perfect, no movie is perfect, if you go into a movie theater expecting a perfect movie, you'll always be disappointed, but this movie far exceeded my expectations, and was so much fun I can't wait to see it again. Comic book fans should all really enjoy this movie, I can't tell you how great it was to see what I only ever saw on paper come to life. This is easily one of my favorite movies of all time."

He is one of my favorite actors and does a great job here. Keep in mind people, this is a comic book movie, don't take it too seriously. It is funny, and cheesy at parts. Like whenever Nicolas does the point. It is so random, but its like Ghost Riders trademark now, I love it. The movie is very true to the original comic. However they took elements from the 90's comics like the way he looks and his chain. The special effects are great, the acting isn't forced, and the action is spectacular.

The dialogue and stupid clichés just anger you throughout the movie, and Nick Cage's inability to play a superhero is easy to see. They really just fail to explain how he defeats each villain, who are made out to be all powerful. The villains really have no powers whatsoever, and the main one just has a stupid fight scene. A shotgun? So stupid. Eva Mendes is really the only highlight of this film. Her lines aren't as bad as the rest of the cast's, but this movie really makes me hate Nicolas Cage and the newer superhero movies even more. I don't even want to write this anymore.

"I_saw_it_happen","3","3","6","19 June 2007"," A sad testament to the power of mass-marketing
","It was fashionable for a while in artsy communities to say 'Painting is dead', because while many paintings were being produced and sold, all the paintings were supposedly relying on the same clichés, the same themes and flourishes. Ghost Rider suggests to me that while film is not dead---plenty of brilliant stuff is still out there being made--- the 'Hollywood blockbuster' is dead.<br/><br/>Plenty of enjoyable, decent movies have been made from characters and plot-lines developed out of comic books over the last few years. Even some of the weaker ones have at least been interesting stylistically (like Sin City, for instance). What is incredible about Ghost Rider is that it fails despite having everything in it's favor. It's not justifiable by saying 'Well, it was a comic book'---- So? In many ways, this is to the favor of any comic book movie, since the film-makers can select the most interesting elements of an already developed mythology to work with. The Ghost Rider was an interesting comic-book character, certainly more so in the second incarnation (Which would have been a better movie, I'd say), and has long been championed by comic-book aficionados who consider heroes like Superman and Spiderman too 'mainstream' and simplistic. Thus, this movie already had an audience, had a dedicated, eager audience, and had dozens of interesting story lines to work with, and no excuse to suck as bad as it did. The blame for this film's failure cannot be put upon the comic book. It falls squarely on the script-writers and the 'acting'.<br/><br/>Instead of making a movie, the film-makers assembled a montage of 'action movie clichés' and tied them together with a feeble plot which, upon any scrutiny, is recognized as nearly nonexistent. Most of the problems with characters and plot have already been pointed out by other posters here, and so I'll only offer a few tangential bits of observation.<br/><br/>*SPOILERS FOLLOW* Some formulaic elements fall into an almost archetypal grey area of critique. For instance, almost any action movie relies on some 'sidekick' figure, a best friend of the protagonist, who provides comic relief and/or common sense to balance out the seriousness/passion of the protagonist. And it's quite formulaic to have this sidekick or friend get killed (or at least seriously hurt) by a bad guy, thus inciting the rage of the hero and driving him to 'beat the bad guys'. In Ghost Rider, the sidekick is dropped from the movie half-way through like useless baggage, brought back in a scene just to get killed, and is then unemotionally confirmed as dead by our hero. Even the most basic formulaic elements of film were marred by the script-writers.<br/><br/>Here's another bothersome observation: When the police detectives conclude that Blackheart's victims have been killed from sulfur toxicity, Eva Mendes quickly insists it's got to be 'religious' in nature. Since there's mention of brimstone in the Bible. Which is, as we all know, the only religion that exists. This actually really bothers me, not just because it's stupid, but because it bypasses all the other much more likely implications of reality in order to speed up the plot and confirm for the audience that everyone ought to know minor details of the Bible (here's another; brimstone was a divinely ordained punishment only God and his angels could inflict upon sinners and 'the fallen'. Not something that the devil or demons had use of due to proximity. Which is to say, it was their curse, not their power.) SPOILERS ARE SOMEWHAT OVER Then there's the matter of clichéd one liners. If they had been edited out of the film entirely, Ghost Rider would have been a very short movie, basically the credits and Nicholas cage posing in front of a mirror for three minutes.<br/><br/>The special effects are decent enough, but considering the budget, so what? There's more to criticize. So much more. In the end, what is really irksome about this film is it's self-indulgent assurance the audience is still watching it. At several points, for no reason, characters stare at the screen and roar/morph/talk simply to let the viewers see/hear 'how cool' it is. Bread and circuses, folks.<br/><br/>And, apparently, Alzheimer's. In one particular scene, we are given a 'flashback' to remind us of something that happened about fifteen minutes previous, which really doesn't require explanation, since it's so obvious. But then, just in case we forgot in the span of a second, we are immediately told of it again by our hero, relaying it to his apparently expendable and disregarded 'sidekick'. Why? I mean, seriously, why? Is the average American that lacking of an attention span? This movie was a waste of time. It confirms to me that the Hollywood Blockbuster is either dead or dying. With so much in it's favor, this movie fails to even present a glimmer of originality, instead relying on brainless 'cleverness' a step behind 'Mallrats'. At least 'Mallrats' recognized it was a comedy. Ghost Rider can't remember whether it is or not. And thus, in so many ways, is a tragedy. It was a film that was practically guaranteed to be a blockbuster. It was a chance to provide something new, something interesting, something that hadn't been done. But the film-makers and actors decided it was too much effort to give an audience something worthwhile, and instead felt compelled to feed them the same generic 'the self and love must be denied for masochistic sense of duty' crap. Which, by the way, is almost exactly the opposite of what the Ghost Rider comic book series was about."

","I've seen a lot of shitty movies in my life but this is the worst movie ever to hit the movies in my opinion. On the way over to the cinema I thought about the great movies N. Caige has starred in... but I was disappointed. When you see a bad movie you still have some urge in you to see the ending, but there was no urges in my body at all. People actually left the cinema during the movie. The special effects was all rubbish and laughable. If I was to point out one good feature in this movie it would be the ending credits because of two reasons: 1. The movie was over and I could go home. 2. The song 'Ghost Rider'.<br/><br/>In summary: The story is worthless and the special effects is rubbish. If possible, stay away from this movie...."
"ez935","8","3","6","17 March 2007"," Enjoyeable Movie
","I went to see this movie with some friends and found the special effects pretty well done. <br/><br/>Some scenes were a bit surprising, to the point that you jump from your seat. <br/><br/>Some parts are funny as well, and enjoyed the fact that ghost rider is not just sent for vengeance but he also deals with evil individuals in the world. <br/><br/>I enjoyed the Texas Ranger who's also a past ghost rider. It's cool seeing both of them riding side by side. <br/><br/>I'm very happy I got to see it on the last day it was in the theatres in my area. <br/><br/>I'd watch this movies if your big on special effects - there's also a love story in it."

","I knew going into this movie, it would be good. What I didn't expect was for it to be that good. I've always been a Nicolas Cage fan, and this movie has re-enforced himself even more. The acting, visual and direction were all very well done. The movie was dark, like some movies now-a-days yet it wasn't corny either. It has a little humor here and there but just enough to keep you interested. The first time he changes into Ghostrider, you can feel his pain. You can hear the pain in his voice, that is how good an actor Cage is. Once he turns, the visuals for Ghostrider are excellent. Then the way his bike changes when he does, adds to the movie. The ending, as with all good comic book movies, is left open. If you're a Cage fan or not; if you're a Ghostrider fan or not; see this movie for the action and the struggle he goes through. If that doesn't seal it for you, see it for Sam Elliot."

Everything in this movie fits well into the comic books....obviously, a direct adaptation of the comic doesn't work well on the screen. However, like a comic book, a true fan (such as myself) gives the storyline the boot and just has a good time.<br/><br/>I loved this movie. The dialog was god awful and cliché'. The story was cool but had no character development what so ever. Well, not quite true...(spoiler)...the Love Interest (Eva Mendes) couldn't make up her freakin mind whether she loved Blaze (Nic Cage) or not. There is a lot of constant, flipping back and forth. I loved Mark Steven Johnson's ""Daredevil"" but there is a definitely lack of depth to this movie.<br/><br/>But who cares?<br/><br/>There is only one reason anybody really wants to see a ""Ghost Rider"" movie.<br/><br/>To see Ghost Rider.<br/><br/>And you get plenty of him. The story jumps right into Blaze making a deal with the Devil (Peter Fonda, who's having a good time with this role) and before too long he's the riding, bounty hunter from Hell. And he's fighting demons.<br/><br/>Which is all I wanted to see.<br/><br/>My biggest problem involved Caretaker (Same Elliot.) (SPOILER)<br/><br/>I knocked off two stars because of this...<br/><br/>The coolest moment is where the Western Ghost Rider and modern Ghost Rider are tearing up the desert to go defeat Black Heart. I was waiting for this moment forever!!!! A Demon Gunsliner, about to kick some Devil tucus. And guess what happens?<br/><br/>Johnson ruins the moment by having Caretaker take off and let Blaze do all the work. His whole point was just to lead Ghost Rider to the final battle. He just rides off and is never see again....<br/><br/>Such a let down...<br/><br/>But the movie still rules overall.<br/><br/>Just remember...<br/><br/>Ghost Rider, riding from cops and doing a lot of cool, Demon s#@#@t.<br/><br/>That's all that matters."

I expected an evening reminiscent of Chuck E Cheese birthdays parties- you suffer through it for the kid, but if a little creative, you can find ways to enjoy yourself. Its for the kiddo, fine. We pay the fees. We sit. We chat and laugh. Time well spent with my offspring.... and then this turd falls into our lap and something that can only be described as torture began. <br/><br/>We stayed. We persevered. We have overcome. However, this film adds yet another nail into the coffin of our society. The idea that there a significant percentage of people who enjoyed this movie scares me. They ""thought"" it was great. There is a reason why this movie was made. There is a reason why there is a mile of cleavage 4"" per frame. There is a reason Peter Fonda cameoed (which was a most unexpected irony). There is a reason that any depth or substance was removed and replaced with flames, explosions, cheesy graphics/effects, 200 C/D cup extras in tight low cut shirts, and the underlying theme of this stool sample. it was as if the creators intentionally attempt to hypnotize you with the sub-par special effects. Its as if the creators were making a film for a nation of testosterone fueled high school quarterbacks that live in the projects. I can just picture the campus military recruiter taking his prey out to see this on a Friday night. WHOA!! that was Awesome!!.... well that is kinda dumb, Why is th... WHOA!! Did you see those t!ts?!!.... HM...DAMN!!! did you see that Harley? WOW!!!"" The military needs a few good men just like you boys. I got up to leave and as we were walking out, the helicopters were flying into the stadium. It was too much. I stood in awe and found myself to mesmerized. ""Are they f*cking serious??"" It was over the top and like a toothache, I couldn't leave it alone. We stayed just to see how far this would be taken. With the country being at ""war"", you have to expect Hollywood to step up and provide plenty of ""feel good"" movies for family members and even more Gun-ho movies to inspire future recruits. It's become so commonplace that subtle isn't even necessary. Apparently, neither is depth or intelligence. Edward Bernays would be proud. As a matter of fact, this is EXACTLY what Bernays would do. Unjustified and unsupported war that the country cannot back out of.... in fact it requires more support... HM... let's see- people are stupid and they are dangerous in masses. Aha! Solution- use emotion. Use the media. Make retarded films for retarded masses and then stir up their emotions. Irrational and emotional are keys to control. I really wish people would wake up. Watch the ending as the ""hero"" denies his personal life and his love so that he may go fight crime and somehow spite Mephisto for killing his father. The World Trade Center should have been in the background with some firefighters logo fading out with a transparent flag slowing flowing in the wind.... This film IS the dumbing down of our society. This is the catalyst for our retardation. This type of ""entertainment"" along with video games are crucial right now. This is the realization I have come to from reading and learning history. This film appears to be made at the request of the DOD or least partially financed by them. The Nazi's weren't the only ones with propaganda, nor were they the best at it... <br/><br/>It will be a long time before I return to the theater because of this film. If by some remote chance, I am blowing this out of proportion and simply being paranoid- then it will get better. Soon our troops will be home and Hollywood will go back to making decent films. If not, it is only going to get worse as the entropy increases and more aggressive measures are taken. BTW- Frank Miller's ""300"" (a glorious and heroic depiction of Sparta) is coming soon to theater near you... uh oh."

","There's a scene in Ghost Rider where Nicolas Cage/Johnny Blaze transmogrifies from sulking-misunderstood leading man into the sulking-misunderstood spawn of Satan. He shrieks in abject horror, disbelief and sulking-misunderstood terror as his flaming skull erupts through his sulking-misunderstood flesh. This scene feels like it goes on and on for hours, this is how I felt throughout the entire film. <br/><br/>As someone who lives vicariously through film, I go out of my way to find the goodness in all movies. Often going to ridiculous extremes to highlight or salvage even the smallest, minuscule bit of minutia to resurrect a disastrous cinematic experience before the fallen countenance of my movie compadres. However calling Ghost Rider a ""cookie-cutter"" film insults the memory of all drive-in ""B-movie"" cookie-cutter films that have ever been made everywhere, those in the past and even those that haven't been made yet. Virtually every line in every scene of every frame, with the exception of a flaming skeleton on a motorcycle, has already been rehashed, recycled then regurgitated ad nauseum. Predictable lines of dialog seemingly written by challenged parrots still reverberate through my cerebral cortex like Ichabod Crane as he terrorized villagers in ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow"" causing them to combat those other shocked and stunned portions of my brain that still refuses to accept that I had actually sat through this flaming, fingernails-on-the-chalkboard nightmare. If Ghost Rider were hamburger it would be made from out of expiration lips, utters and eyeballs.<br/><br/>I can just imagine the focus group slash marketing ad-men sitting in their executive board room: Jenkins. What do the kids think is hip, cool and happening these days? Well, motorcycles sir. Motorcycles eh? Good. Yes, I like it. Motorcycles, what else have you got? Well sir skeletons. Skeletons have always been ah, ""hip"" sir. Skeletons, yes, yes... Hum, I like it. So far so good Jenkins. I like what I'm hearing. Go on. Well sir we could put a skeleton on a motorcycle, its never been done before. Yes, yes... A skeleton *on* a motorcycle, yes, brilliant. Brilliant! Well done here Jenkins. One more thing sir. What is it Jenkins, ""run it up the flag pole"" as they say. Well our surveys suggest the skeleton needs to be engulfed in flames. WELL DONE! Jenkins. Engulfed in flames, by god you have outdone yourself. Your too kind sir. No, no... I knew hiring my wife's nephew and giving him that corner office was going to pay off, give yourself a bonus. Thank you sir, right away. Right after I'm done stapling and collating all of those copies you asked me to make earlier.<br/><br/>As if this weren't enough, our sulking-misunderstood hero repeats the same, unusual, ""grab the girl, spin her around, and then kiss her while she is still disoriented and unable to run away"" maneuver that he's done before. Thus repeating the same, clumsy, awkward, uncomfortable and painful to watch kissing scene from ""National Treasure"" where he did the same thing. This pre-adolescent attempt at sexuality appears to be becoming Cage's unusual calling card ala Arnold Schwarzenegger's ""I'll Be Back"" phrase that Arnold keeps repeating from film to film. What is Cage trying to say to his audience? That he is challenged by kissing women? <br/><br/>As you are now no doubt aware, I detest this movie with every fiber of my being. It is simply not enough for me to say I hate it. It is simply not possible for me to have more contempt, my contempt level is at ""11"". This is not film, it is the opposite of film, it is anti-film. It is a black hole of cinematic nothingness into which everything good and decent is sucked in and crushed to bejesus and back. Its as if the film-makers were purposely endeavoring to sicken and irritate my bowels with salmonella disguised as celluloid. Forget water-boarding, forget sleep-deprivation, and forget playing Barny's ""I Love You"" or Metallica at top volume.

"jon2005","5","3","7","4 April 2007"," Ghost Rider
","The latest effort from Marvel and Daredevil director Mark Steven Johnson is a loud and messy film that, whilst it has some merit, has too many flaws that weigh it down. Nicholas Cage plays Johnny Storm, a stunt rider who, as a child, makes a deal with the devil (Fonda) to save his father's life. Later on in life he must uphold his end of the deal  he must become the next Ghost Rider, acting as the devil's bounty hunter to rid the world of Blackheart, the devil's son, who has just returned to take over the world.<br/><br/>Cage is clearly enjoying himself as the oddball Storm  laughing at chimpanzee kung-fu and drinking jelly beans from a cocktail glass is his natural way of life  as he should be given he is a life-long fan of the comic book this is based on. However, the other cast members don't quite fit in: Peter Fonda and Sam Elliott (as a graveyard caretaker who acts as a mentor to Storm) both seem to be acting in a far more serious film; Eva Mendes is obligingly cute but does nothing other than pose as background scenery as Storm's childhood girlfriend; Donal Logue provides comical side-kick responsibilities in the same way that Jon Favreau did for Daredevil; and Wes Bentley brings as much menace to the film as an Andrex puppy.<br/><br/>In fact, the villains are all non-threatening and highly non-entertaining. When they are on screen the film stalls, and given that Blackheart is the reason for the Ghost Rider's existence that means the film stalls too often. Blackheart just comes across as camp, whilst his potentially cool and evil henchmen merely provide more imaginative ways to die. The films best bits don't involve the villains  Ghost Rider outrunning the entire Boston police force on his flamed-out motorbike is a highlight  and when Cage gets to be cut loose the film picks up. Also on the plus side, the effect of Ghost Rider, with his flaming skull, looks amazing, and the effects of CGI flames have been pushed to a new level. Sadly though, the rest of the effects are lacking and, come the finale, are reaching into Van Helsing territory  too many effects that are not developed enough to convince. Storm's transformation in the Ghost Rider is meant to emulate the pain from An American Werewolf in London, and the first transformation does, but after that Storm changes instantly and without any effect on him; we are not given the rules that define the Ghost Rider's world, and a lack of consistency is clearly noticeable.<br/><br/>Designed to be simple popcorn entertainment, Ghost Rider simply isn't as much fun as it should be. It has too many elements that quite simply do not work, making it a loud noise of a film that does not belong with other Marvel films of far superior quality.<br/><br/>Rated: 5/10 <br/><br/>More reviews at: http://www.thelazylounge.net"

","Oh man where to begin. How could they screw up a movie with a premise like this. I've not read any of the comics so don't know how faithful this movie is to the comics but I might seek them out since I like the idea behind the characters and the mythology itself....<br/><br/>The acting and the dialogue was awful even with actors like Cage and Peter Fonda delivering them, and the set up was rushed, like most of the rest of the movie. The FX ranged from OK to GOOD with the first transformation scene of Blaze to Ghost Rider being pretty well done but every change from there on in is in cheap and nasty morphovision and the morphing motorcycle looked stupid even if the flaming bike itself looked cool. The bad guys were non-entities and although they were supposed to be really powerful etc they don't do anything threatening through most of the movie and Ghost Rider eventually offs them with ridiculous ease, even the main dude at the end.<br/><br/>Honestly this movie has so many clichés you'll be bored less than half way in and after waiting about 30 minutes for Ghost Rider to appear you just want him to get off the screen straight away since apart from looking cool he comes across as a complete dork and his dialogue consists of really bad corny one liners. Every time he comes on screen you just hope to hell he doesn't say anything and when he does you'll be so embarrassed for the poor bloke...<br/><br/>I guess Batman Begins and Superman Returns have spoilt us as far as comic book flicks being given the serious treatment go but even if those films weren't around then this movie would still be somewhat lacking..<br/><br/>Lastly although I hesitate to say this there were a few scenes that reminded me of the name Uwe Boll, yes parts of it are that bad....<br/><br/>After seeing the trailers (which wisely consisted of mostly FX shots)I really wanted to like this but those B*st*rds at Hollywood shafted us again....<br/><br/>Go get the comics instead....."

And honestly, the trailers didn't really do much to dispel my doubts, but despite all this, I was keen to see the movie anyway. Why? Two words...Nicholas Cage! In the end, the movie was far better than I ever hoped it could be. Sure, the character's motivations were rather silly, and there were many glaring plot holes, but the effects were excellent, Nick made a very cool hero, and Sam Elliott was awesome as ever.<br/><br/>But in the end, the thing that really tipped this movie for me was Eva Mendes.

The Ghost Rider effects were cool, the fights totally lame, the story was also lame while at the same time being inconsistent with the comics and the dialogue was generally dreadful. On the plus side, Eva Mendes must have the most gorgeous rack in modern cinema, this alone should keep the young male fans entertained.<br/><br/>Where was the love story? Where was the witty, cowboyesque banter? Where was the Blaze/GR duality? The struggle between GR and Satan for his soul? Sorry all cut to make the story 'better' *cough* *cough* *hurl* In the end I give this movie 5 stars, 4 stars for finally seeing GR on the big screen, 3 stars for Eva Mendes' boobies and -2 stars for choosing Nicholas Cage as Johnny Blaze/Ghostrider. And if we total all this up that's correct if I wasn't a huge GR fan this would be a 1! They must have hired the guys that made The Phantom to ruin this one."
"a_uzelman","2","3","7","18 February 2007"," The worst superhero movie ever
","So many reasons the movie was bad, but lets just go through some of my top ten. In no real order:<br/><br/>10. Eva Mendes shows us cleavage throughout the movie, except for the last scene. I enjoyed this aspect and had a good laugh about it throughout the film but why have her buttoned up at the end and only at the end, how about some consistency. <br/><br/>9. Fight scenes were god awful. I was hoping the last fight would be something worth sticking around for, but it was only marginally better then the rest. Why was it so bad, cause there was no exchange of punches in battle, each battle lasted only a minute. GR was never in any danger, hell a street thug did more damage than any of the demons. The sun was probably his worst enemy.<br/><br/>8. The demons hiding in different elements, what was with them. They sucked, sure they looked cool, but they couldn't fight their way out of a paper bag. The first scene with them has them all lined up and posing. Hey guys, you have the whole bar, why not spread out, this isn't an ad for jeans. They couldn't fight, and each fight scene only made the movie longer than it should have been.<br/><br/>7. The first time GR transforms it was done really well. I enjoyed it, but after that he turned into GR in a second, no skin melting or anything. <br/><br/>6. The dialog, dear lord why couldn't it have been a silent movie. My favorite line had to be ""A man who believes in love, is a man who can change the world"". Then gave Johnny Blaze the contract for the 1000 souls and possibly the end of the world. I laughed so hard I was crying.<br/><br/>5. Was that the bonanza theme I heard as both the Ghost Riders rode off. <br/><br/>4. Why did Sam Elliot just disappear. He rode with Johnny Blaze to the town, but that was it. He ""had enough for one more transformation"", so why didn't he stay as the GH till after the battle, just come out later. My point is why did he just ride with Cages character and use his last transformation for absolutely NO REASON.<br/><br/>3. Can Cage please stop doing accents. <br/><br/>2. The love story was so bad, so very bad. <br/><br/>1. The director has a good visual feel, but no substance. There is so much to this story, I don't know how he managed to mess up so badly. This movie was way to long, at least it felt way to long.<br/><br/>This movie is made for 10 year olds, and people who know nothing about Ghost Rider. The start of the movie looked really interesting, and they should have stuck to that. Set it in the old west or something. The special effects were decent, the ghosts at the end were done really well, as well as the first transformation. How Blackheart kills his victims was pretty cool. They may have been trying to make a campy movie. If you like campy, and corny (and yes crappy) then this movie may be for you otherwise, beware. This is not only the worst movie I have seen this year, it's the worst movie I have seen in many year."

It felt like the film moved pretty fast, but it didn't lose it's direction. This film isn't a 'knock you out of your shoes' blockbuster, but it can stand on it's own.

","The string of superhero movies goes on and this time, it's Marvel Comics' Ghost Rider's turn to heat up the big screen.<br/><br/>During the day, he's Johnny Blaze (Nicolas Cage) - a stunt motorcyclist who once sold his soul to Mephisto (Peter Fonda) in exchange for a cure to his father's cancer. However, the contract involves Johnny transforming to a blazing skeleton by night in the presence of evil, bound to work for Mephisto in defeating Blackheart (Wes Bentley), the ambitious son of Mephisto who wants to make a hell out of the world - literally.<br/><br/>Written and directed by Mark Steven Johnson, the film has an introductory note for Johnny Blaze which clearly feels a lot like the filmmaker's previous Marvel project ""Daredevil."" The way it's presented does seem formulaic but it manages to decently portray the main character to the viewer. Cage also doesn't seem to be a good idea to play the role but as the film progressed, the more he managed to prove me wrong by doing a good job of combining a sense of grit and humor for his character.<br/><br/>The characterizations of the supporting characters, however, were rather insipid. Eva Mendes as Roxie Simpson, Johnny's love interest, serves more like a perfunctory female touch to the film as her character has been devoted with so little concern. I'm tempted to say that the villains are too one-dimensional but they're demons, which may be the point.<br/><br/>The movie overall is a decent way to spend a Valentine evening, although at times, the plot becomes a little confused. The fight scenes lack a sense of urgency, and the love angle feels too casual. But Cage gives a good performance and there are enough humorous moments to make for a somewhat fun if bumpy ride."

They can only watch in utter grief and dismay from their high-dollar theater seat as a hero they had likely grown up admiring is sliced and diced by over-dependence on CGI, paper-thin character development, wooden performances, and a lukewarm, sometimes confusing plot.<br/><br/>SERVE UP CRAP, THEN FUGEDABOUDIT These movie-makers know it is a sure bet that a comic book character will draw a faithful audience...at least for a first installment. It seems this is often all they're actually shooting for. The all-too-familiar specter of entrepreneurial timidity seems to engulf whatever possibilities for success such projects might have held. Of course, big money, as well as reputation among one's Hollywood peers is on the line, so formulaic plot and CGI razzle-dazzle rule the day, and squashes any chance that this character might once again appear upon the silver screen. Batman, thankfully, is a notable exception. Dast we hope that this same phoenix-like rebirth will save some of the aforementioned characters? I hope so. I still have some hope for Electra. I dig kick-a** women.<br/><br/>WRITERS, DO YOUR $%#@& JOBS!<br/><br/>WHERE'S YOUR ADAPTIVE GENIUS? To be fair, I do acknowledge that when Stan Lee created these characters, he had high hopes only for a successful comic, not a movie. Also, certain aspects of a character might have worked well back in the 60's, 70's, etc., but not necessarily in 2007. But this is a perfect opportunity for writers to let their true genius shine, and for directors and producers to exercise some trust in the vision and commercial adaptability of their writers. It seems the writers of the ""Ghost Rider"" screenplay were heavily dependent upon the years of monthly comic book issues of ""Ghost Rider"" to develop the characters. Uh-uh, guys. Remember, some in your audience may not be comic book fans. Development is YOUR job, and you have 114 minutes to do it...but it can be done. Heck, I could have done it. I wish...<br/><br/>CAGE, WERE YOU HIGH?<br/><br/>EVA MENDEZ: PRETTY, HISPANIC, EXPLOITABLE; ZERO TALENT <br/><br/>Consequently, not all aspects of a character, regardless of any digital magic, will transfer readily into a movie. This requires some tinkering, which carries the risk of alienating a character's fan base. However, TOTAL lack of character development is inexcusable. Wooden performances and characterization on the part of the actor?...off with their heads!(for wood, check out the scene where Cage is pointing and laughing at the television, until Mack changes the channel...).<br/><br/>Eva Mendez is surely a better actor than the one I saw in ""Ghost Rider""...my gosh, has the marketing machine sunk THIS LOW in attempting to rope in the Hispanic movie-going public? Check out the scene where she jumps out of the van when Cage's character blocks their passage with his bike...uhhh. She was just repeating lines and posing (...and posing), that's all...Eva Mendez portraying an actor, and badly, at that. But hey, she's a lovely hispan-magnet, right?<br/><br/>The graying couple sitting next to me in the theater while watching this turkey were surely thinking the same thing I was as they shifted incessantly in their seats-WHEN IS THIS STINKER GOING TO END? I'VE PAID FOR IT...MIGHT AS WELL ENDURE TILL THE END... I almost just walked out.<br/><br/>The writers could have made G.R. much darker...far more mysterious, and therefore far more substantial. All this could have been done without losing the PG rating, and a younger audience. They could have upheld what seemed to have been an effort to downplay, though not eliminate, the Satanic stuff. However, the writers tried to straddle the line between campy, and darkness, exposing (forgive me..)their tiny little creative balls! Sometimes, a character's very nature makes it difficult to write him/her seriously...take werewolves, for example. Think Frankenstein, in the ""Van Helsing"" travesty. Now consider a character with a flaming skull for a head, riding a flaming chopper. He could have been painted as a joke, or as a tormented monster, with a penchant for doing good. In ""Ghost Rider"", he was just painted, ""blah"". Writers, I want your pens on my desk...NOW! YOU'RE THROUGH!<br/><br/>IF THE LIGHTS FLICKER, SATAN'S HERE!<br/><br/>The over-reliance of flicking on and off, and busting all those street lights and carnival displays had to be about the cheapest stunts I've ever seen in building a menacing character. Apparently, Satan has a childish side. For those of you with children, how many times have you had to scold them for playing with the light switch in your home? Had he any crayons in ""Ghost Rider"", might Satan have defaced Roxanne's (Mendez)bedroom walls, as well?<br/><br/>***SPOILER*** There was one, and only one, shining moment in this entire movie. That was where Roxanne attempted to touch G.R.'s ""face"" affectionately. He turned away, saying (echoing, whatever...)""monster"". In response, Roxanne said, ""I'm not afraid."" Then, it seemed that her love for this ""monster"" flowed from her hand and extinguished the flame's of even Hell's wrath from the face of Johnny Blaze. I almost said, ""aw..."", out loud, at that one. <br/><br/>Now I'm exhausted. In writing this, I'm only reliving the agony endured while staring in disbelief at this dud, yet another tumbleweed in the movie-going experience which sadly could have been a fiery rose. I can only hope this review might have saved YOU some agony and distress."

Please watch this movie for a textbook on how to make that idea boring.<br/><br/>I liked most of the other comic book movies that came out: the Spiderman flicks ruled. Blade (the first one at least) ruled. Batman Begins was cool. I don't know what the problem with this movie is. No plot? Crappy dialog? Boring characters? There are some good ideas here, like Johnny not knowing if it is his skill that protects him, or his deal with you-know-who, but these are missed opportunities, far outweighed by boring crap. Actually, the part of the movie BEFORE ghost rider appears is much more interesting than the latter parts. Maybe because they were focusing on the characters and not the demonic effects.<br/><br/>Like corn? You'll get a lot of that here. The speech he gives at the end is terrible. Movies based on comics don't have to be like this. Spiderman has a heroic motivation, but he doesn't make a speech about it at the end of his movies.<br/><br/>Yes, Ghostrider's cg looks cool.

That's the film's only high point come to think of it, how incredibly bad-ass he looks. Mark Steven Johnson, the director of ""DareDevil"", what the @#$% happened man? Were you high? And if so, how high? Now let's get down to the bad points, and trust me there are several of them. First off, where did the director get the idea to give the entire film this western theme? It ruined the whole movie!!! And worse there was still a super natural, horror-side, to the film, creating a very bad mix. Secondly, very little action honestly. The few fights with his enemies are far too short and I was feeling quite bored more than half the time. Thirdly, Eva Mendes and Nicholas Cage do not make a good couple, what-so-ever! It was annoying o watch their on-screen chemistry because there was none going on! Normally I don't look forward to a nude shot of Eva Mendes ( not that I mind them though) in one of her roles but this film needed one just to break my boredom. Unfortunately there was none!! WTF??!! Hope to God there won't be a sequel, I beg you!! But on a serious note this is just another example of crazy possibilities ruined by horrible directing!"

","Although I can't really recommend watching this movie, it was a lot better than I thought. I generally like sci-fi/fantasy/monster movies, but this looked ridiculous. Well, it wasn't ridiculous, but it wasn't that great either.<br/><br/>Basically, this is about a motorcycle stuntman who inadvertently sells his soul to the devil to help his ailing father. When he learns he got a bad deal, it's too late ... but he is then given a mission which could free him.<br/><br/>The movie was much better than it looked in the trailers. However, the result was still not that great. Part of it may be that the idea of a supernatural motorcycle superhero may have been appealing in the 70s, but it doesn't seem very potent today. Other than that, the story is only mildly engaging. It could have been worst, so this is not such a bad result.<br/><br/>This movie is not really worth seeing unless you're a fan of this comic book character."
"Antagonisten","3","2","4","26 September 2007"," Not good
","I'm usually very tolerant when it comes to comic-book movies. For some reason i like them even though i don't particularly like comic books. I guess it's the way that they can bend reality with an alibi to do so, as opposed to when they do it in a regular action movie. In the end though rocking action scenes, or a good solid story, is needed to make it work. There are loads of examples of movies that did work with different approaches. Like comedy (Spider-man), action (X-Men) and emotion/story (Hulk by Ang Lee). This movie however doesn't really have an approach...<br/><br/>I can freely admit to never having heard of the character Ghostrider before this movie. And i'm not surprised, it's not a very interesting character. And it works less well in a live-action movie. Considering the Ghostrider is basically just a special-effect with a flaming skull, there's not much acting to be done. Nicholas Cage is his usual self as the troubled man who turns into Ghostrider at night. Whether Nicholas Cage being himself is a good thing or not is up to you to decide. The rest of the performances range from dignified (Peter Fonda) to downright silly (Wes Bentley).<br/><br/>The real problem here is not the acting though, it's the fact that the movie has precious little to offer. It lacks direction and purpose almost completely. It's too slow and lame to be a good action-movie (although there are a few decent special-effects scenes), it lacks comedy almost completely and the story is too lame and shallow to carry the movie. I guess going for the action-angle would have been the best way, but the Ghostrider doesn't really have any interesting ways to fight. He punches people, strangles them with chains and looks deep into their eyes. The fact that the money seems to have run before they got the flaming-skull effect right doesn't help either.<br/><br/>The thing i was thinking when the movie was over was ""Spawn"" from 1997. This movie reminded me so much about Spawn that it could easily have been a sequel. Both movies are very heavy on special effects (although this one is obviously light-years better in that department, or well, ten regular years...), both have an anti-hero with connections to the devil, both seriously lack weight in the action-scenes. And in the end both of them are thoroughly dull, and while they make a lot of noise, they have precious little to offer in the way of entertainment.<br/><br/>I rate this 3/10."

","I'm really tired to hear and read so many bad reviews about this film with not a single real good reason of someone who shows real knowledge about this comic character. So take note about this points to not waist time ignorants: First: Mark Steven Johnson was right: this movie is for those who really love Ghost Rider and know it well to take every single little thing from any of the comics, by example the poster of the Quentin Carnival in the house Johnny Blaze, it's the only mention to this place but it's fair if you think abut who works the story. Second: Ghost Rider began as a mix of western and supernatural comic, and that's it's the beginning of this movie. Later it became in some kind of horror adventure so the best thing about this movie it's watch how Mark made a good mix of the different styles of (at least) three kind of comics. Third: If you read the third collection of Ghost Rider with Dan Ketch as main alter ego from character, you'll find the same spirit of this movie, the comic was dark but Ghost Rider had a code, had the weapons to avoid a transformation in a pure evil character, even when the villains were bloody monsters. Fourth: As Christian I really found here a movie who shows very well the battle of the good against't evil without contradictions in the use of any book like bible or something else, there is a powerful message about how we live in darkness, how the man pays his own bad choices.<br/><br/>For those who wanna know more read ""Hearts of Darkness"" an one shot of Ghost Rider with Wolverine and Punisher it's the basic story of this movie.<br/><br/>I been waiting for this movie at least 5 years, since I began to read the comics of Ghost Rider Mark Steven Johnson did exactly what I dreamed, took the characters with more respect than Sam Raimi in the last Spider-Man leaving an open door for what could be even better sequel."

I completely loved the basic premise of this story when I first heard it.<br/><br/>I thought the tone of the whole movie was pitch-perfect. Everyone's movements were so precise. Sometimes they were just acting with their eyes. I dug all the camera movements -- this movie had momentum, which was appropriate to the subject matter. Nic Cage is a fantastic (if limited in range) actor and well suited to this kind of comic book *extreme* role. Wes Bentley was great. I really liked the Police Captain and his dark-haired side-kick. (Lots of Aussie actors in this movie as it was shot there.) Eva Mendes was a little disappointing -- I like her a lot but her acting wasn't great (I blame neglectful direction) and she wasn't given enough to do. Plus, her costuming was appallingly poor. There's one time when she's getting back into the car and we see her from behind and her dress is so ill-fitting and wrinkly. Sure, we got to see lots of cleavage (not too much) but dressing a sexy Latina with olive skin in a brown dress that's almost the same colour as her brown hair AND then putting a brown leather jacket on top of that? UGH! Did they WANT her to disappear?! Yeah, I've never read the comics, but I will now."

I'm not a big reader of comic books, I am familiar with most of the characters and basic story lines and enjoy most of the movies made from them.<br/><br/>Cage is a fan of Ghostrider. He even has a tattoo of him and it seemed like he had a genuinely good time making this movie and in my experience that always makes a movie more fun. So what if he had a hairpiece? How many movies have you seen with actors that had hair different from their's in real life? <br/><br/>Eva Mendes is OK, playing you're generic love interest. Wes Bentley looks and acts creepy enough, but i'll admit there are times where you're wanting more from him. This is not his fault, it's the result of an underdeveloped script. Matt Long & Raquel Alessi are wonderfully matched to the older Cage and Mendes as they look almost exactly alike. Peter Fonda as usual turns in a great performance and seemed to really be enjoying himself. Sam Elliott as always is great and Donal Logue does the best he can as ""Mack"" a generic & thankless role of Johnny's friend and manager. <br/><br/>I'll admit the script could've been better and a better story come out of it. It's not that it wasn't an interesting story, it was just a bit sloppy and sometimes weak & corny. (Johnny's mannerisms of listening to the Carpenters, eating candy, etc., this could be the way he was in the comics, but I don't know, never having read them.) It just was never convincing to me as a motorcycle riding tortured soul. <br/><br/>The villains also, came across as too easily defeated. Not that there were a lot of them, but for your main baddie, if you spent most of your movie hyping him up and showing what he's capable of at least give him a matched and worthy fight on the way out. <br/><br/>The special effects are nothing short of amazing and convincing, and are the best part.

","Comic books are a universal novelty with an extreme following, and it's no wonder that so many of these comics have been turned into film franchises. But is it not strange that a Marvel hero is in fact associated with angels and demons? Too bad it sounds better then it actually is.<br/><br/>Johnny Blaze (Nicholas Cage), a motorcycle stunt rider, makes a pact with Mephisto (Peter Fonda) to have his dad cured of his cancer, in return that Johnny gives up his soul and becomes the Ghost Rider. As the Ghost Rider, Johnny acts as a bounty hunter who must collect souls for Mephisto. When called upon, Johnny has to kill Blackheart (Wes Bentley) and thus stop him from collecting a scroll of potent power which would allow Blackheart to create a new hell on earth.<br/><br/>As a Marvel comic book, one doesn't suspect it to contain the likes of demons. It does however, come across as being similar in style to Marvels other hero, Blade. But where Blade's transition to the world of film was one of a violent nature, a good move considering it's basic premise, Ghost Rider instead moves into more commercial territory. Yet Ghost Rider is no Fantastic Four, and definitely no Spider-man, as it's dark atmosphere would dictate, and so inevitably, Ghost Rider comes across as being rather shallow then it ought to be.<br/><br/>The acting is, for the most part, good. There is a distinct evilness in the performances by Fonda and Bentley, and Cage plays his confused character, struggling with the death of his father, loss of his childhood sweetheart and the fact that he becomes a creature during the night, quite well.<br/><br/>Yet it is in the execution of the story where Ghost Rider seems to lose its wheels. The beginning of the film contains some disappointing horror-like sequences, which by the end of the film, seem oddly misplaced. Another avenue of disappointment comes in the form of the lousy romance story. While you can feel sorry for Johnny and Roxanne Simpson (Raquel Alessi/ Eva Mendez), it's a pity that their romance ends up being rather clichéd, and ultimately, lacking in passion.<br/><br/>The language is relatively dim, and the action sequences, while dark in manner, are tiresome to watch, and do not last long. A pity as the Ghost Rider could have had some great battles considering his character.<br/><br/>Ghost Rider comes across as something deserving of more violence, something akin to Blade. The acting is not particularly bad, but an inconsistent beginning arc, pointless romance, and extremely short fight scenes, don't help make a good film out of a cool premise.<br/><br/>--- Also available on Entertainment.Wikia ---"

","We have seen the movie and now it is the time for us to write the review on ""Ghost Rider"" First, i was very excited. I though when i glanced through the preview and observe how they create the skeleton-on-fire effect, that's really cool but..... the story didn't even have any adrenalin to be pumped, just like another action movie,worse, completely dull and empty.<br/><br/>To tell you the truth, what i like or maybe the audience like from this movie was the sequence where Mr Nicolas Cage transformed his head to a skeleton, and that's really neat.<br/><br/>Secondly, the plot is slightly weak and the characters are not up to date. It means that they are not properly introduced by the scriptwriter and we only know the characters from his name. I mean you should be able to let your audience know your characters without mentioning his/her name and that's what i called a ""Story"" Last, people create movie to entertain people. Some audience do not like to think much so you must be able to give what the audience want without involving them to think. ""Ghost Rider"" does not have that.

","I went to go see Ghost Rider a couple of weeks ago and I am pleased to say that I quite enjoyed it. I had been waiting for this movie for years, as I am a long time Ghost Rider fan, and I was glad that they waited until now to make it. The CG was able to do justice to the changes that John Blaze undergoes to become the Ghost Rider, and the changes in the Hellcycle bridge the gap between the original 1970's inspired chopper and today's updated choppers.<br/><br/>I did spoil the movie a bit for myself as I had read a number of reviews and user comments before going into the movie, and so I was thinking of what others had said as I was watching the movie. Nicholas Cage's quirky sense of humour and delivery were a good match for the John Blaze character. Peter Fonda was too restrained as Mephistopheles. Wes Bently was excellent as Blackheart, as he captured the spirit of the character. Eva Mendes was OK as Roxanne, but the character was never a focus in the comics, and so her part in the movie was also minimal.<br/><br/>Ghost Rider, the character, was always a second tier comic in the Marvel Universe, so the movie is not in the blockbuster category of Spider-Man or X-Men. I think there is a good possibility for a sequel, as there are a number of other characters from the Ghost Rider series that could be introduced, especially as the movie took elements from the original John Blaze Ghost Rider, as well as the newer Dan Ketch Ghost Rider.<br/><br/>Overall, I thought this movie was good fun and quite enjoyed it."

Pleasing said fans is always a difficult task. GHOST RIDER, then, succeeds on the level that it is a fun, comicbook adapted film. However, placed against some its more successful contemporaries, the campy nature of GHOST RIDER is its chief detractor.<br/><br/>The Marvel Comics anti-hero Ghost Rider got his start in Marvel Spotlight #5 in 1972 and the film's origin resembles the comicbook tale close enough: motorcyclist Johnny Blaze makes a deal with the devil transforming him, at times, to be an fiery instrument of vengeance. Marvel then revamped and updated the character in 1990 completing the skull-like visage with a flaming chain and spikes. Writer/director Mark Steven Johnson takes elements from the classic story and incorporates it with the stylizations of the more modern version in an attempt to please both worlds.<br/><br/>Opening with an origin that unfortunately lasts the entire first  and lengthy  act, the film finally roars into action as the damned Blaze (Nic Cage) fights against the devil's son, Blackheart (AMERICAN BEAUTY's Wes Bentley) and his demonic horde. Bentley pulls off the rogue with a smile but at times he and his cronies' post-MATRIX get-up have all the posturing of an upstart emo band. Even Cage and Sam Elliott, playing his mentor, camp it up at times playing mere parodies of themselves. Topping off the cast is the ultimate Easy Rider, Peter Fonda, playing a laughably-scary devil with a grin-and-a-wink that seems to channel Jack Nicholson.<br/><br/>Once the action begins, the film pits the flaming Ghost Rider up against elemental demons and, predictably, the police. And like all cliché Westerns or their rock-n-roll, comicbook counterparts, there seems to be nothing his American Chopper-possessed bike cannot do, which even comes to his side when whistled like a loyal steed.<br/><br/>What the film desperately lacks is any sense of a real and natural environment. Story aside, what made the SPIDER-MAN and X-MEN films successful is the fact that these unreal events were happening the world right outside the window. Here, the humor  both intended and ridiculous  prevents that barrier from ever entirely withdrawing. Another impediment is the film's rating. Taking a similar path to the BLADE films and first CROW, Marvel should have pushed for a R rating to truly give the devil his due. More dark horror and less toothy one-liners would have made an electrifying film, something that video game-looking ghosts and goblins cannot properly achieve.<br/><br/>At best, Ghost Rider is a b-grade superhero; his film falls into the same classification. But true fans should already be aware of this. After all, boyhood fantasies of a flaming skull warrior on a tricked out bike can only go so far. This film meets you half the way."

","I'm not into much of the movies made from Comics... but this one was great. Kept me interested the whole time and of course my most favorite actor was in it Nicolas Cage... he has such a great personality for his character in this movie. The way he turns from Johnny Blaze to Ghost Rider was very cool and the bike was awesome! I do believe I have a favorite comic book character now. My husband likes the Punisher but I think I have grown fond of the Ghost Rider, the story behind this movie is really interesting and there are so many action packed scenes that I didn't get bored one bit.

","""Ghost Rider"" was a flick Cage had wanted to make for several years. Too bad he didn't make it earlier in his career. He is too old to play Johnny Blaze, and it hurts the movie. In particular, his wig is atrocious. The kid playing the young Johnny Blaze is fine, but no one would have paid to see GHOST RIDER with an unknown in the lead. Anyhow, Cage plays a motorcycle daredevil who sells his soul to the devil (Peter Fonda, who really needs to retire along with David Carradine). Blaze has to defeat a quartet of supernatural bad guys led by Joaquin Phoenix-lookalike Wes Bentley. Sam Elliott plays a graveyard caretaker who helps Cage from time to time and Eva Mendes is Blaze's love interest. No one exactly gives an Oscar-winning performance in this bit of fluff, but my kid and I agreed we would have liked to see more of the Elliott character, who gives the film a nice Western kick. GR is a rainy day rental. The CGI is passable, and the climax contains a neat surprise, especially if you are old enough to remember the original Ghost Rider. Nuff said."
"kombatfighter","5","2","4","17 February 2007"," Comic book adaption
","First off, here's the tone of my message: ""I didn't like it due to it not sticking with the comic books."" My argument here is to all of the Ghost Rider comic book fans and not to anyone who doesn't know anything about Ghost Rider. If you pick up a Ghost Rider comic book, what did you typically see in it? Ghost Rider inflicting vengeance and hardly any ""good or funny tone"" in the comics. GR and his friends were always in a very serious mood in the comics and hardly did you ever see a smile or happiness in it. You might see a smirk every once in a while whenever they would catch the bad guy or some good came out of something that horrible went wrong. I really was looking forward to and compared this movie to the comics because that's what made the Ghost Rider. Yes it's true that in order to make money and to appeal to all audiences that you need to lighten up the mood. However, let's take a look at a successful movie that didn't change the tone such as Batman Begins. Ghost Rider should have been made into a R rated movie just like Blade! GR was known to inflict horrible pain on his enemies and that's why people feared him. That's why cops were trying to capture him, it wasn't because he just looked evil. Even the so called good cop who turned into Vengeance later realized that was why GR was feared by ALL OF HIS ENEMIES. If Ghost Rider couldn't do the Penance Stare on you then he would break your bones and beat the crap out of you until you would know what emotional/physical pain was. I remember an issue where GR had to face Snowblind and since he couldn't do the Penance Stare on him. GR just decided to almost break all of his bones in his body. This is the reason bad guys feared GR. He was ruthless when it came to his so called Justice. He truly got revenge for the innocent blood that was spilled. Unlike Spidey movies, which should have a ""good or funny tone"" in it. The GR movie should have had a dark tone to it. Take a look at the Crow movie, dark and revengeful movie that was somewhat successful for its time. The GR attitude in the movie was not the same as I received in the comics that really got my attention for making this character stand out from the rest. The only good thing that I can comment about this movie was that of the special effects that made GR seem very real and the actors/actress parts that did their best to make the movie appeal mix to all audiences."

"blott2319-1","5","0","0","12 June 2020"," A lackluster film with a ridiculous hero
","I was never a fan of Ghost Rider in the comic books. The idea of this demonic spirit inhabiting a man, and yet being used for good always puzzled me. This movie tried to give a logical explanation for how the contracts worked, but I never fully understood what made this different from any other deal with the devil (or Mephistopheles, if you prefer.) I also didn't know why the demons were bickering with one another to the point that one created the Ghost Rider in order to hunt down the other. That's not even addressing the fact that, if Mephistopheles had the power to create these Ghost Riders, why did he need them to do his work for him? But let's pretend the nonsense worked. Even forgiving all that, the anti-hero known as Ghost Rider would still bug me because he has a problem that has always annoyed me in superhero movies...no defined weakness. When he's fighting it's hard to tell when or if something is hurting him, and I have no way of knowing if his ""life"" is in danger. The demons have a similar problem, so all around the fighting loses me because I don't know who's dominating and who's losing aside from their physical body language.<br/><br/>As for the human story that plays alongside the supernatural one, well it's a bit weak. I kind of like the craziness that Nicolas Cage brings to the role, because he is the kind of guy you could see taking insane risks with his life. However, his romance with Eva Mendes falls flat since the two have no chemistry. Also, they don't have a full story arc because the Ghost Rider stuff keeps getting in the way, and they end up resolving it without really addressing the underlying problem in their relationship. I did love what Sam Elliott brought to the film. He is an ideal actor to play the mentor in any movie, and he has a swagger that fits with the backstory we learn about his character. The CGI effects weren't always great, but I feel like they embraced their limitations. They allowed Ghost Rider to be this ridiculous thing exactly as he's depicted in the comics, and his penance stare was a delightfully wacky effect. I will say that I found it a bit tedious that they kept introducing pieces of Ghost Rider's costume from the comics one bit at a time. It almost became laughable how the movie would stop so he could put some spikes on his jacket or throw a chain on his chest. But overall, I think Ghost Rider is an average superhero film, that is perhaps a bit more enjoyable if you laugh at some of its ridiculousness rather than take it as a serious story."

","I should've known. No, really. I should've. The same director who helmed that super successful superhero masterpiece known as ""Blind Battfleck"", I mean, 'Daredevil'. Perhaps Johnson learnt from his past mistakes when it comes to dealing with superheroes that mass audiences aren't entirely familiar with. Maybe, just maybe, the irreverent use of the ""Cage Rage"" could spontaneously combust this adaptation into a ghoulish inferno of apocalyptic excellence. Or, just to restore some remnants of faith, produce a film that is mediocre. Alas, not the case.<br/><br/>Ghost Rider is terrible. Woeful. Dreadful. Fully exorcising the ineptitude of amateur comic book adaptations that preceded this monstrosity and somehow tainting them even further, granting this hellish anti-hero no chance of retrieving his soul back. Johnny Blaze, the ""Human Torch"" who ""flames on"" whenever he needs to, sells his soul to the devil in order to spare his father's life. A supposed antagonistic demon makes his debut and thus Blaze must become a Ghost Rider in order to stop him from acquiring the contract of ""I-Don't-Give-A-Toss"".<br/><br/>If there was any ounce of literary creativity within this screenplay, or any other element of the film, I may have paid more attention whilst being perched on the edge of my seat from the sheer velocity that Ghost Rider rides his skeletal metallic motorcycle. Flames etched onto the road. Demonic dubbing that echoed the streets of wherever the heck this film was set. Cage screaming his lungs out as his face melts from the inside. It's fundamentally incoherent. No matter how much lunacy Cage injected into his vicious pointing or how minuscule Mendes' acting capacity may be, if the storytelling is executed with no common sense whatsoever, there's no point. None. And it's abundantly clear in Ghost Rider.<br/><br/>It starts off with an emotional acceleration, between Blaze and his father, which in turn produces some required apathy. After those introductory moments of tenderness were over, tackling an uninspired origin story, Blaze propels himself off a ramp and never lands. Look, he's still gliding over those CGI helicopters now! There were approximately seven minutes of action. Four antagonists, each harnessing a differing elemental power, are defeated in seconds. Don't ask me their names, I haven't got a clue and the film doesn't deserve to be researched prior to this decimation. No build up. Just a vacant stare and we're moving on. The absence of threat was abundantly clear, and as soon as Mr. Monotonous (that's the villain's name now...) reads a piece of paper and obtains glowing red eyes, the film was over.<br/><br/>So with no action or real substance, what the heck was happening for two hours you might ask? Just a road trip back and forth between a romantic sub-plot and Sam ""Exposition"" Elliott, spelling out a plot that had more lore than a frickin' 'Lord of the Rings' compendium. I just...don't care. If Cage didn't care, Mendes didn't care and Ghost Rider himself didn't care, why should I? I had to sit through two hours of complacent visual effects, for nothing to actually happen. The cheesy tone that Johnson outlined didn't suit the darker apocalyptic world that Ghost Rider resided in within the comics. I don't want to hear another ""skull"" pun. I don't!<br/><br/>And if there's only one thing I'm going to take away from this endurance test, it's consuming jelly beans in a martini glass. However that minor positive, which may or may not change my life forever, did not substantiate me sitting through the entirety of this boring adaptation. Quite simply one of the worst Marvel films in their canon, and I've still got the sequel to watch..."

","Is the world ready for a flaming Nicolas Cage? After a long string of financial flops, this idiosyncratic actor is placing his faith in a comic-book character with a combustible body and an addiction to jelly beans. In ""Ghost Rider"" Mr. Cage is Johnny Blaze, a daredevil biker who once made a deal with Mephistopheles (an orange-eyed Peter Fonda) and is now required to hunt down wayward demons while shooting flames from every pore. No wonder he listens to the Carpenters.<br/><br/>But Johnny's emasculating musical tastes are not the only problem with ""Ghost Rider,"" a movie that betrays the promise of its first 30 minutes - when Johnny is played by the charming young actor Matt Long - with an increasingly witless script and a star who simply allows the movie to unfold around him. This dissociation leaves the supporting cast to its own devices, with no one suffering more than the appealing Eva Mendes as Johnny's true love, Roxanne. If Ms. Mendes ever finds a director willing to allow her to perform with her shirts fully buttoned, there will be no stopping her.<br/><br/>With its sequel-ready resolution, ""Ghost Rider"" embodies franchise hopes that may be dashed by a central character who's more funny than frightening. As for Mr. Cage, the only thing he should be firing is his manager."

","I'm gonna get this out of the way now. This is not a great Nic Cage (""Adaptation"") performance of either crazy or quality varieties. It leans more towards crazy than quality but there are way better crazy performances from Cage out there. The main problem is that during most of the scenes where he is being a BAMF, he is also a cgi skeleton. That means no awesome Nic Cage facial expressions or visual acting choices.<br/><br/>During the scenes where is just regular old Nic Cage he does seem to give a pretty weird at moments performance. Unfortunately, it lacks the deep seated feeling that some of his other characters have. He may laugh like a little kid when watching a TV show then switch on a dime when someone turns it off but he doesn't feel totally unhinged. More like he just has strange moments. For the most part the film still wants you to identify with him and see his acts as fantastic to be sure, but also relatable and understandable which to me is something I'm not really looking for in a Nic Cage performance.<br/><br/>The film itself is one long mess. The stakes are said to be high but don't seem to be fully realized. A danger which is supposed to be akin to Hell being established on earth feels about as thought through as a Halloween Horror House that was set up in a few hours. It doesn't seem scary or real at all.<br/><br/>The story structure, scene structure, and general plot just sort of happen. It doesn't feel as if any of the characters really have agency. Everything seems false or to be happening because 'movie.'<br/><br/>A good example of this is the first time we see Nic Cage do a jump stunt. This sequence is a mess. First you have Cage's, sorry, Johnny Blaze's stunt coordinator telling him he thinks the stunt is too big. They have a fight about it. Then, right before the jump, Blaze's childhood sweetheart Roxanne (Eva Mendes, ""Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans"") surprises him with an impromptu interview (she grew up to be a reporter). He basically refuses to answer any of her questions about how he feels before the jump, opting instead to ask her about her life, then inform her that the jump would be taking place over top a bunch of army helicopters, which his stunt coordinator also doesn't know anything about. He then makes the jump then squeals tires off into the arena and onto the highway to catch up with Roxanne on the highway as she heads home, and stop traffic to ask her out.<br/><br/>None of this makes sense.<br/><br/>His stunt coordinator should be pumping him up for the jump. The last thing you need before a daredevil stunt is your best friend and business partner telling you that you can't do it.<br/><br/>What's with the surprise interview? Actual reporters may surprise a ""person-on-the-street"" with an interview question but not the subject of a story. They would have set that up weeks ago and Blaze would never be surprised by it.<br/><br/>How can Blaze catch his coordinator off guard with Helicopters? It's an indoor arena. There is no way that his entire team would not know that there would be running helicopters in his stunt. They would have to be loaded in to the facility. The pilots would all have to be checked out. Insurance companies would chime in. It's plain ridiculous to believe that 5 minutes (literally) before the stunt he could change something so major.<br/><br/>After making the jump he peels out and takes to the highway, presumably by way of the arena. How? Through all the locked doors, stairways, and escalators? That bike isn't street legal. And I guarantee the first person to look at it, after he crashed it and survived to make the jump would be a mechanic. Blaze wouldn't have even got to it. For all he knows it is 15 minutes from exploding.<br/><br/>To top the whole thing off, the reporter left the event and Blaze had to catch up with her. Why would she leave? The event where he either dies or breaks the world record jump length is on the line. She misses the chance for a victory lap interview or postmortem coverage with the team and fans if he comes up short and is pureed by helicopter blades.<br/><br/>The whole film is like this. Stuff just happens. It doesn't make sense. They don't try to make it make sense.<br/><br/>If you think that maybe the movie gets better when he is the Ghost Rider then think again. He just transforms into a flaming headed skeleton dressed in leather, wielding a chain, and riding a blown up version of a hotwheels chopper. Then CGI happens. Flames happen. He says something tough and stares into someone's soul till they collapse.<br/><br/>This is a movie about demons and a demon hunter. Where's the blood, guts, or temptation? The bad guy just makes people's faces change color till they die. Wes Bentley (""The Four Feathers"") has never been accused of being scary and he definitely doesn't bring it to this role. You'd think casting Peter Fonda (""Easy Rider"") as Mephistopholes would lend some gravitas but again, no. Totally miscast. Should have gone with someone like Tom Waits (""The Dead Don't Die"") who could have pulled off the vibe it seemed like they were going for.<br/><br/>The real shame is that there are the bones of a good movie in here. I can easily imagine the movie that actually deserves to have Sam Elliot (""The Big Lebowski"") play the mentor and crazy Nic Cage as a vengeance crazy mad man but I think you'd have to break from the source material and director Mark Steven Johnson (""Daredevil"") to do it."

","I mean, 'Ghost Rider (2007)' is coherent - in the most liberal sense of the word - but it just keeps making choices that are questionable at best. It sticks so incredibly close to the 'early-2000s superhero' formula that you'd swear it was at least five years older than it is. It also thinks it's so darn cool - though, this is probably par for the course with a film about a motorcycle-riding stunt-guy who has a flaming skull for a head. When you think about it, not much of it really makes sense, beat-for-beat, and the story itself just doesn't go anywhere. Don't even get me started on its use of flashbacks. You can't even 'turn your brain off' because the visuals are probably its worst aspect. The only positive about the cinematography is that it's usually in focus, and the editing is so brash that it makes you feel as if your skull really is on fire. The visual effects are somehow so poorly conceived that they usually look like horror-themed Snapchat filters. The acting is hammy but not entertaining - I mean, Nick Cage's intermittent southern drawl just makes him intermittently unintelligible - and most of the main players just seem like they're in it for the pay-check, often clearly reading their lines from just off-screen. The action isn't exciting; it's slow, cumbersome and clumsy. It doesn't help that the eponymous skull-head looks and sounds plain goofy, stumbling about from punk to punk squawking about penance and sometimes making strange pseudo puns (""yee-haw""?). The whole thing occupies this strange space where it simultaneously seems to be trying way too hard and no-where near hard enough. It's not entertaining - like, at all - but it isn't rage-inducing, either. However, it's so poorly made in almost every area that I wouldn't recommend it, even to fans of 'so bad it's good' cinema (because it's not 'so bad it's good', it's 'so bad it's bad'). It doesn't engage on any level, really. Yee-haw? 3/10"

"Screen_Blitz","4","0","0","12 December 2016"," Nicolas Cage has the charisma of the titular hero, but it's not enough make up for its generic script
","Releases of superhero movies based on Marvel comics are more often than not subject to the most attention of their year from the public, while also scoring abundantly high on the box office ladder. Majority of the time, these films are intended for make for some high-octane entertainment; even when centering on the arguably lesser known comic book heroes like Ghost Rider here. Occasionally, the superhero genre from both the DC side and the Marvel Comics side has the tendency of slipping into the crack of some mediocre attempts bring some comic books on the silver screen. Ghost Rider, directed by Mark Steven Johnson, is one of those films. Though it certainly not one of the worst the genre has to offer especially when considering some of the more horrendous entries such as 'Catwoman', this film fails to succeed beyond the level of disposable entertainment. Based on the marvel comics, this film stars Nicolas Cage as Johnny Blaze, a motorcycle stuntman who suffers from emotional trauma after the tragic death of his father (played by Brett Cullen) as a teenager. He learns the death of his father was a result of when he mistakenly sold his soul to the devil known as Mephistopheles (played by Peter Fonda). Not only that, he gains the powers of the devil that turn him into a fiery monster with a skull scorching in flames. When his son known as Blackheart (played by Wes Bentley) threatens to release demons from hell to take over the Earth, Blaze must use his newly gained powers to fight back while protecting his childhood crush Roxanne (played by Eva Mendes).<br/><br/>This superhero action flick isn't a total drab to say at best. Those who go in for some action sequences tapped with fine visual effects will have at least something to hurrah for. The action kicks in our titular hero ramping up in flames as his humanistic body morphs into a skeleton body with his head transforming into a skull bursting into CGI flames. What transpires then is the hero racing at high speed on his devilish-looking motorcycle and facing off the bad guys in some chain-whipping action. Beyond this, the film fails to deliver much palpable excitement. The plot is a bit generic as it deals with the conflict between our titular hero and a hellish villain known as Blackheart also known as Legion. While Nicolas Cage generates a fair amount of charisma to make for a hero for audiences to root for, Wes Bently's performance fails to amount of an interesting or even memorable villain. Though he is not expected to fall on the lines of more highly iconic villains like The Joker or Magneto, his lack of ingenuity is rather hard to overcome. The conflict between the two characters eventually comes down to a final showdown sequences that should have been fun, but criminally lack the adrenaline it needs to be a climatic action farce. Then there is Eva Mendes who is given almost nothing to do beyond playing the corny love interest of Nicolas Cage. Though her performance is at least on the par, the chemistry between her and Cage never quite sizzles.<br/><br/>Ghost Rider is a generic superhero action flick that fails to rise above the typical standards of an average Marvel comics blockbuster. Although this film may demonstrate a glimmer of fun in its tense action sequences and small dosage of humor, the overall entertainment value leads little to be desired even for die hard comic book fanatics."

","Based on the Marvel comic character, Nicholas Cage plays Johnny Blaze, a motorcycle stunt driver who escapes death countless times because he sold his soul to the Devil (Peter Fonda) years earlier in exchange that his father would beat cancer. The Devil doesn't totally keep his end of the bargain so Johnny escapes to fame but soon the Devil shows up wanting him to become the Ghost Rider and destroy his son who is trying to take over his power. I'll admit right up front that I'm not a comic fan and I've certainly never read anything this film is based on so I can't compare it to anything. I went into the movie hoping to at least get a popcorn entertainment and for the most part I think the film delivers, although it's certainly far from perfect and it's not even a good film. I viewed the Extended Cut, which I think was a mistake because there are certain scenes that just dragged on for no reason and sure enough, after watching the movie I looked up the differences in the two versions and these scenes were what was extended. There's way too much build-up and talk leading up to what the film is really about and I'd say that the ending goes on way too long as well. <br/><br/>Directed by Mark Steven Johnson, and based on his own screenplay, the film makes no sense. The main idea revolves around the eternal theme of how a man can sell his own soul to the devil because the asking person wants to gain something he doesn't have, or in this case because Johnny Blaze, who knows about his father's cancer, wants to save the old man. Unfortunately, for the production team, better made movies have been made using this idea."

","I haven't read any Ghost Rider comics. A friend of mine has requested me from a long time to watch Ghost Rider - he says he loves this film, it's one of his favourites. I decided to check it out and unfortunately I didn't enjoyed it that much. Not an awful film, not a great film - in the middle. First of I'm going to list what I like about the film.<br/><br/>1)I know that it is based of a comic book, but the idea of a flaming skeleton riding a motorcycle, which by the way is flaming too.<br/><br/>2)The special effects look great!<br/><br/>3)Ghost Rider's look gets positive points!<br/><br/>4)A BIT OF A SPOILER! Caretaker looks great as a ghost rider, but even better looks like skeleton flaming horse!<br/><br/>5)Mephistopheles had the strongest acting in the film.<br/><br/>6)Blackheart's henchmen look also great!<br/><br/>7)One of the best scenes in the film was when Blackheart killed the people in the bar in the dessert. There was great atmosphere.<br/><br/>8)The action sequences were awesome.<br/><br/>9)Cool bits of the soundtrack.<br/><br/>10)Nostalgia Critic's review of the film made me laugh, so this is also a plus.<br/><br/>Now let's see what I didn't liked about the film.<br/><br/>1)The acting wasn't that good.<br/><br/>2)The romance between Johnny and Roxanne was a weak element. At a moment you feel that Johnny is kinda of an a-hole to her and she doesn't realizes it.<br/><br/>3)The writing wasn't all that good.<br/><br/>4)I thought Blackheart's henchmen were defeated too fast and if felt rushed.<br/><br/>5)Blackheart was a bit weak villain.<br/><br/>6)Watching CinemaSins's video about the film made me don't like it more.<br/><br/>Overall Ghost Rider falls as a mediocre film. The film has it's funny bits, but it has it's bad bits. Still it wasn't Marvel's worst film. I can have fun watching the film. From BAD 1 to EXCELLENT 6 I give Ghost Rider GOOD 3.50, which is not quite MEDIOCRE 3, not GOOD 4. I saw the sequel - Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance and I liked it more - I would give it GOOD 3.75. I hope Marvel make a reboot of Ghost Rider with Disney in the future, maybe in the 20s of XXI century. Great to see lots of people enjoying the film more than me."

","The problem with Ghost Rider is that the film never really catches fire however the climax of the film does have a comic book ending when Johnny Blaze fights the bad guy.<br/><br/>Stunt motorcyclist Johnny Blaze does a deal with the devil when his father has terminal cancer. He signs a contract with Mephistopheles to give his soul for the health of his father. Johnny learns the hard way that the devil has a few tunes up his sleeve. Although his father is cured of cancer he dies in a stunt accident.<br/><br/>Johnny leaves the stunt show and his girlfriend Roxanne. He knows deep down the devil will come calling for him one day to fulfil his contract. Johnny goes on to becomes a famous stunt cyclist who has survived many scrapes, I think Johnny knows why. His ex-girlfriend has become a TV reporter send down to cover his latest daredevil stunt.<br/><br/>However Mephistopheles steps in who wants him to slay his evil son Blackheart and in doing so he will be released from his contract. Johnny Blaze becomes the Ghost Rider and his motorbike goes like a bat out of hell.<br/><br/>The flaming visuals are cool, Cage excels as the Ghost Rider who acts more like a vigilante saving good people from bad. Its just the the plot is humdrum with supporting characters being wasted. Eva Mendes is there to look pretty. Peter Fonda is just there to look cool. Sam Elliot is there for his moustache and that horse ride alongside with Cage before he bizarrely bails out of.<br/><br/>Wes Bentley does not bring much as Blackheart apart from a generic son of a devil act.<br/><br/>Its an adaptation of a Marvel Comic which Marvel Films might have been able to do something more substantial with if they had made the film rather than just be associated with it like The X Men movies. Cage is hampered as Blaze with a distracting wig although he tries to make his character playful but its really an average time-waster."

Improves on the Spawn formula.

Sometimes it's a pale shadow of the comic book."

","Stunt motorcyclist Johnny Blaze gives up his soul to become a hellblazing vigilante. There are fisticuffs back and forth with those who claim to work for justice. The cinematography is stark and bare, with only the soundtrack adding some effect. All the characters struggle against a system that has perpetuated falsehoods. Against this backdrop, our hero must fight. The acting is very effective. I finished this film, thinking, ""There are people out there suffering and I can do something to help them out."" Great performances help to enhance this amazing story of friendship and violence. Again, I finished this film, thinking, ""There are people out there suffering and I can do something to help them out."" A gem."

","Once upon a time, the name 'Nicholas Cage' could be associated with setting the cinema box office alight. Then, after one weirdly-awful choice of film after the next, he's been reduced to this - Ghost Rider. You can probably see what he was thinking... recently the 'Marvel' stamp has been very lucrative, what with Iron Man, Thor, Captain America and, of course, The Avengers. Nicolas Cage probably thought this film would be spoken of in the same breath as them.<br/><br/>He was wrong. Poor old Nick - just his luck to pick the one 'Marvel turkey.' Ghost Rider is an example of a comic book character that should probably stick to the pages of a comic book. Nothing really works here, even though everyone does their best to make it happen.<br/><br/>The acting is average, with the actors doing their best with the lacklustre script. But the script doesn't give any of the characters much depth and Nicolas Cage just looks a bit embarrassed to be wearing a blatant hairpiece throughout.<br/><br/>However, who cares about the acting if there's plenty of fun action to keep us entertained? Well... there isn't much here. When Nick changes into the 'Rider' the flaming skull just looks bad and the set pieces of action don't really shout out to you that they're really that special.<br/><br/>Ghost Rider is one of those films that, if you have nothing else to do and happen to catch it on telly, then you might think it's okay. But that's all it'll ever be - okay. Although, saying that... if you compare it to its sequel - it's actually a masterpiece of film-making!<br/><br/>http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/"

","Title: Ghost Rider <br/><br/>Directed by: Mark Steven Johnson <br/><br/>Storyline: We're also introduced to Johnny Blaze and his father being part of a carnival attraction, but this is turned on it's head when Johnny finds out his father has cancer. So Johnny does what any sensible person would do, he makes a deal with the devil to help his father. But naturally when you make a deal with the devil there will be strings attached and his father dies while performing a stunt. We are then re-introduced to an older Johnny Blaze who is a stuntman who can survive any injury, played by Nick Cage. He even has a martini glass filled with jelly beans, this is Nick Cage's way of making the movie's protagonist turn from badass to laughing stock. Nick Cage may be a massive fan of Ghost Rider, but he does not play him as well as others could have. We are introduced to Blackheart at a biker bar. I have two problems with this, my primary one being that Blackheart is suppose to looks like some creature that spawned from hell not a Twilight vampire. My minor secondary problem with this is that Blackheart was originally a DareDevil villain. He completes the jump and rides off to talk to Roxanne more, he then stops her and does one of those movie kisses. You know, the types which if you did that in real life you would probably get arrested for sexual assault. The devil returns to make Johnny hold up his side of the deal and he has to become the rider to stop Blackheart from getting plot device of the Scroll of 1000 Souls. Johnny finally transforms into the Ghost Rider almost an hour into this 2 hour movie. But the transformation scene is one of the few good scenes in this movie, it is also the only time where Cage does good acting, and that acting is for going insane while you're face is melting. This is accompanied by chilling opera music matching the pace of his transformation. Once the Ghost Rider comes on screen, you can forget the horrible faults of movie for the time being and just admire the awesomeness that is the Ghost Rider. His voice is fitting for how he looks. He meets the Caretaker and they get all of the important backstory exposition out of the way before Johnny goes and apologies about standing up Roxanne, needless to say she doesn't take well to it. He goes up against Blackheart's minions again before the police intervene and it then becomes GTA 4 with a Ghost Rider mod. In other words the next scene is one of those BA scenes in which you forget about all of the bad parts of the movie because of how BA the scene is. He hands over the scroll and goes to fight Blackheart who takes hold of the scroll and absorbs the 1000 souls to make him a god of sorts. He is able to get him where he can use his power and then he is able to burn the 1000 soul to kill Blackheart, looks like Blackheart didn't think that one through.<br/><br/>Acting: Straight away I feel like Nick Cage was a bad pick for Ghost Rider, mainly because he is just so eccentric and different as well as comical. I think Josh Holloway would have been a better casting choice mainly because he looks more like Johnny Blaze does in the comics. Nick Cage looks like Nick Cage in this movie, he even acts mostly like Nick Cage in this movie. But in saying that, Johnny Depp was also interested in this role, so I think we got the lesser of two evils here. Same Elliott plays the caretaker and the other Ghost Rider, this was another poor choice for acting as you can barely understand a single word this guy is saying.<br/><br/>Noticeable Camera work: Honestly I was too busy faulting the movie for its story and casting to notice some of the camera work, but there is a good bird's eye shot for the helicopter landing and something similar for the transformation scene when the camera starts off high before zooming into the hellfire burning in his eyes. <br/><br/>Graphics: The CGI for the transformation scene was really well done with Cage's flesh slowly burning and melting off his face as he becomes the rider. As well as the flames on the riders skull looking quite BA at the same time. The skull for the rider is modeled off Cage's x-rayed skull, so props for that.<br/><br/>Costume: The Ghost Rider costume is a nice mixture between CGI and practical. It is faithfully to how it looks in the comics, even if the actor player Johnny looks nothing like it. Blackheart looks nothing like he does in the comics and look like he belongs in Twilight, enough said and the same could be said for the devil who's 'true form' you never see, but you get a feeling of what he looks like from the stupid childish lightning shadow you see at the start of the movie. <br/><br/>Overall Feel: The director that created this movie also made Elektra and Daredevil, so I wasn't holding too much faith out for this movie mainly because of how poor both of those superhero movies were. IMDb also mentions that Cage added some parts to the script, those parts are easy to notice because they are generally the parts which do not make sense or make the movie lose all credibility or sense of seriousness. But the movie is only worth it for the Ghost Rider scenes, but if you're a fan of Nick Cage you'll enjoy this movie. This could have been the most BA B-list Marvel movie of it's time, but it was mostly wasted potential and trust me, they didn't learn their lesson as the sequel is even worse."

","Ghost Rider - the hero - is very popular in the comic world... I mean, just in the comic world, because the most of the public who don't read comics, have never hear of him!<br/><br/>So when a film was announced, I was intrigued to see what would come out of it. Then when Ridiculous Cage was headlined as the hero himself, my intrigue turned to worry...<br/><br/>Upon initial viewing, I was - honestly - a little disappointed. I find it hard to enjoy Cage (with Kick Ass being his finest hour to me), and felt that some silly moments made by the studios decisions, left this Marvel flick a bit flat.<br/><br/>Then recently I found the extended edition at my local pound store and figured, for a pound, I could add that to my super hero collection (and put up with the extra running time).<br/><br/>And I'm glad I did.<br/><br/>Knowing what to expect now, I actually rally enjoyed it for a second (and third) time. My kids love it, and it is growing on me very quickly. Cage is - well, Cage. You can't change that! But he pulls of the role comfortably and has plenty of humour to work with which suits him best.<br/><br/>Ghost Rider suffered a lot of hatred upon release, but its not as bad as you think.

","After watching this film I have to say I was highly disappointed. I am a big fan of the Ghost Rider comics and it saddens me to see how poorly this film went and how far off it was from the books. I don't think anyone who's not read the books will truly get how awful this film really is. Where to begin?..How about Nick Cage being Johnny Blaze. I've seen some OK films featuring Cage but whose idea was it to cast him as Blaze? Not only does he not look like Johnny but he acts nothing like him in the comics. Blaze sits around in bars drinking his sorrows away..Not sitting around eating jelly beans and making jokes. Ghost Rider was also cheesy with him pointing at people and Cage making him walk around like he was the terminator..Ugh. My next complaint would be about Blackheart. I cringed at the sight of him since he looks like an emo,and not only that but why when has BH ever been human? Anyone who's played Marvel vs Capcom 2 for example knows what Blackheart REALLY looks like.<br/><br/>The acting was pretty corny and the film had hardly any action. I felt like Eva Mendez was there for nothing more than eye candy at best. A PG-13 rating was also uncalled for because Ghost Rider isn't suppose to be a kid friendly hero. Sorry parents but GR isn't meant for your kids..he's suppose to be dark,scary,and makes you mess your pants when he shows up..Not be all jokes and happy go lucky like Spider-man. Ghost Rider is a highly underrated character when it comes to the comics and although this film probably helped his popularity..I doubt it did much for his reputation. I wouldn't recommend watching this film unless you care nothing for the comics and have absolutely nothing better to do"

","Bizarre and cheesy is a combination hard to fashion, but Ghost Rider achieves that and more. It is so far the most absurd film of the year taking an established graphic novel and fashioning a mess of action tropes with a hot head hero who's trying the whole time to shed his curse, which of course is the whole reason for the comic to exist.<br/><br/>Johnny Blaze (Nicolas Cage) fights his nemesis for the soul of his little boy while he hopes to change from a minion of the devil to an angel of good. The chaos is not just from the number of set pieces and abundance of baddies but also from loose narrative where transitions seem random or barely connected.<br/><br/>Saddest of all is to see one-time Oscar winner Cage once more sell his name to a product not worthy of him. His over-the-top delivery signifies an artist too tied to the mess. Or just maybe this is a parody of the graphic novel genre lacking only a sense of humor to pull it off."

The characters makes no sense what so ever and even the villains are not developed and some are just pointless to the plot while not bringing any cool in the action department either. The dialogue is just laughable and not in a good way either and comes of very corny, even the direction is corny. Which is a negative for a Ghost Rider movie. I like Nicholas Cage as and actor and he is basically the only thing that makes this movie semi-watchable. The back and forth plot in this is just irritating to watch and makes you not care for the characters even more.

","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>Comic books would appear to be such a good commercial investment for film makers they're making them left, right and centre nowadays, even these obscure ones that would be simply too violent or scary to make into family adventures. Yes, comic book enthusiasts may suffer at the taunts of the intolerant and ignorant, with cries of 'nerd' and 'loser', but never doubt they're almost unrivalled appeal to the box office consensus. And so we have Ghost Rider, another obscure Marvel Comics adaptation that made it to the big screen. But while The Punisher managed to be a none stop action thrill ride, this effort sadly derails off course fairly early on and never stops from there.<br/><br/>The plot, for what it's worth, has Nicolas Cage as Johnny Blaze, who as a young man was conned by the devil into selling his soul to him, only for his father to die in a freak stunt-gone-wrong at his carnival. Years later, he's still a daredevil only to sell out crowds in Las Vegas rather than country carny folk. But the devil returns (his name's Mephistopheles, by the way, and he's played by Peter Fonda) and calls on a bargain to free his soul. He must use some skills given to him to take care of his son who wants to take over the world. Instead, he uses them to fight evil, seeing into the souls of the wicked and stopping any future crimes. As events build up to a cataclysmic showdown, he tries to rekindle his romance with teenage sweetheart Roxanne (Eva Mendes) who's now a news reporter, and is given advice and guidance by wisely old man The Caretaker (Sam Elliot.) <br/><br/>Real life comic book enthusiast Cage was an obvious choice for the role, but turns in what is becoming a typically dour performance that brings nothing to the role whatsoever. Mendes is okay as a feisty love interest, but is really just eye candy, while gravelly voiced legend Elliot is sadly equally as fruitless in the wise old warrior role. The only one who really makes an impression is Fonda as the devil, giving it that devilish charm the role requires but the script fails to lift anything higher because of it.<br/><br/>The film itself is slick, stylish and polished enough and had it been ten or maybe even twenty minutes shorter it might have passed as harmless hokum. Unfortunately the result is overlong inanity, with a weak, apathetic plot, a slack script and poor performances that make it an instantly forgettable comic book disaster.<br/><br/>Mark Steven Johnson's previous film was the other comic book adventure, called, appropriately enough, Daredevil. This manages to make that seem like, well, The Punisher. *"
"liam-o","3","0","0","11 May 2008"," A roller-coaster ride that doesn't know where it's going.
","This movie offers what can be a typical comic book scenario: (although I never read any comic books in my youth) Good vs evil, vengeance, coming to terms with his past and is interspersed with a love story or something.<br/><br/>Fine, I wasn't expecting an Oscar, and I didn't really expect more than sub par. We get explosions, a little back story, and some romantic interest - but when it all boils down to it, there was no real conflict, tension and you come out of the movie but wasted time and disappointment.<br/><br/>It's the story about how the Marvels comic book character Ghost Rider became the Ghost Rider, selling his soul to the Devil to save his pop, who inadvertently dies. How he challenges his own curse in the name of ""goodness"". <br/><br/>Sounds like something I could stomach, and should have been passable - simply for a fun ride. <br/><br/>I liked Batman, Spiderman to a certain extent and the game to movie adaption of Silent Hill(despite it's ""neccesary"" Hollywood ending) to name a few. But, this one is all dumbed down for the masses, and with some totally out of place romance added so that the movie makers wont risk losing money from your girlfriend refusing to see the movie with you.<br/><br/>It's a classic money making Hollywood style movie. Take a comic book brand, add famous actor, special effects, action and romance and sweet happy ending. Which equals instant money maker but, sadly it bombed out on all counts and in the process lost it's soul.<br/><br/>Nicholas Cage has been sliding downwards for me lately with movies like Wicker Man or national treasure for example. Much like Christian Slater they haven't been getting the nicest cuts of meat Hollywood has given them and their acting has fallen flat to the point where they are just themselves.<br/><br/>Nicholas Cage pretty much plays Nicholas Cage in this film, His wooden acting, blank stares and reading of cheesy lines was sad really. Not to mention he looked he was too old for the part. They kept calling the character he played Johnny Blaze ""kid"" and he is clearly 43 years old. He wears a really bad hair piece cut to above the ears longest in the back with a receding hairline. He also seems way older than his lost love Eva Mendes whose role as journalist as most poor journalist impressions in movies. The love story was alright in the first half hour but when he grows up, it's just a bore.<br/><br/>The special effects, which are the only possible reason I can think of to see the movie, are on par with what you can expect with CGI, although I was surprised to see some very poor budget movie'ish face morphing effects that gave me flashbacks from the early 90s. They wont blow you away, just barely keep you from falling asleep.<br/><br/>Doing random things with the bike didn't impress me: driving up walls, through water, on water and just practically making the bike do whatever the hell they felt like making it do. If love choppers etc, this won't please you at all, these guys probably know as much as the average Joe bloggs. Even with a little ""street cred"" like Peter Fonda who thankfully doesn't do much harm to his career with his small cameo appearances as the devil.<br/><br/>The villains themselves eclipse Cages poor acting. Even rated alongside children's movie villains they come out terrible. Complete with sneers and grimaces. Bold lines like ""I'll destroy you"" and zero character depth.<br/><br/>Tame, cowardly, boring and mostly an insult to the comic strip. Ghost Rider coasts along blindly throughout the film with little resistance or tension from the bad guys and fails to please."

","I came out thinking ""Well, don't expect it to make any sense,"" then I realised that I was talking about a film where the main character's head turns into a burning skull, and he rides a motor cycle up and down the sides of skyscrapers. Expecting it to make sense is possibly a case of unreasonable expectations.<br/><br/>Amiable nonsense. Popcorn movie. It has a sense of fun about it, much of it looks good, and you don't look at your watch wishing it would be over. There are some places where it will make my wife jump when she watches it on TV (she'll be happy to watch it as a quasi-light horror film rather than a super-hero film - it has a kind of Van Helsing vibe to it).<br/><br/>Even from my limited exposure to the comic Ghost Rider, it's clear that Cage is far too old to be playing Johnny Blaze. He's good in the part (albeit I don't think it places huge demands on him), but Johnny's supposed to be a young man, and Cage ain't. Sam Elliott is better than he was in Hulk - still mumbles, still talks through his moustache, still can't understand a word he's saying in the sub-Elvis bass rumblemumble, but at least he doesn't have that lemony squinch plastered all over his face.<br/><br/>The story is idiotic, and I don't know why they even mentioned the hallowed ground thing, it didn't appear to have any plot relevance anywhere.<br/><br/>I went with my son (comic fan) and a friend (civilian). My friend enjoyed it quite a lot, my son and I rated it higher than Daredevil and the first half of Hulk, lower than the second half of Hulk.<br/><br/>I can see why it would annoy someone whose expectations were higher than mine."
"MrGKB","5","0","0","29 April 2008"," A film that makes you smell the sulphur of hell...
","...or is that just the stench of the film itself? Personally, I think the latter, but your mileage may vary. I was told by any number of friends and fellow film geeks that ""Ghost Rider"" was a cut above the ordinary, and not to be judged on the basis of its writer/director's previous failures in the genre. Sorry, but they were wrong, and that's a big disappointment to me since I collected the comic book back when Mike Ploog kept it visually attractive.<br/><br/>Make no mistake; ""Ghost Rider"" is eminently attractive. Production values are as good as one might expect for a $100mil+ film, visuals included. DP Russell ""Picnic at Hanging Rock"" Boyd works wonders with the camera; you'd hardly believe the western vistas and urban jungles he captures are Australian rather than Texan. But, unfortunately, Mark Steven ""Daredevil"" Johnson's script plays out like the comic book story it apparently wants to be; the poor guy has yet to match his maiden effort, ""Grumpy Old Men."" The acting's not at fault, at least not overly so. Nicolas ""I've already got an Oscar"" Cage is obviously too old to be playing a contemporary of Eva ""Hitch"" Mendes, and Ms. Mendes is obviously no Oscar contender herself, but given the genre and Mr. Cage's apparent affection for the character, neither of the two outright embarrass themself, even though their younger selves seem more screenworthy. Likewise the supporting cast, comprised of lesser luminaries, is blameless, though unextraordinary. Sam ""Roadhouse"" Elliott plays his typical grizzled character type that he can do in his sleep, while Peter ""Easy Rider"" Fonda narrowly avoids camping up Cage's adversary, Mephistopheles--yes, ol' Scratch himself. Stan Lee passed on his typical cameo, which may or may not be indicative of his opinion of the film.<br/><br/>Anyway, folks, once again it all comes down to the script, as it does in all films truly worth discussing (or not). Johnny Blaze just doesn't cut it as a superhero (maybe because he's not--he's a minion of hell, good intentions be damned). Worse, his opponents, having no real back story or screen presence, fail to impress; the ""Ghost Rider"" deals with them all too easily. Wham, bam, thank you, ma'am, and that's how I felt about this film. In one eye and out the other. Next."

","I like Nicholas Cage... I really do (let's say The Wickerman never happened) ... but this movie was just junk. I know this movie wasn't made to have amazing Oscar worthy dialogue, but surely they could have written something a little better then this. The action was repetitive and boring, most of the villains were disposed of in similar lame CGI fashion. And who are we kidding with that theme music? At least Sam Elliot sounds cool talking. This movie is quite the disgrace to his awesome mustache though. This comic book adaptation craze needs to stop. The Late 90's into the early 2000's had it right with Blade, X-men, Spiderman, etc... things are getting pushed out too fast and too sloppy now."

","When I first heard about Ghost Rider the movie, I was thrilled. When it came out, I was there opening night to see it. Let me just say that I was utterly disappointed.<br/><br/>The only good performances to speak of were Peter Fonda as Mephistopheles and Sam Elliott as the caretaker. They wasted their talent in this movie. Donal Logue also wasn't bad but was not given much to work with it seems.<br/><br/>Nicholas Cage tried too hard to fit the role of Johnny Blaze but I don't think it turned out the way he had hoped it would. Don't get me wrong, he wasn't terrible he just didn't fit the part.<br/><br/>Blackheart was a terrible character. He wasn't evil, convincing, or even remotely scary. Neither were his 3 henchmen. Particularly the normal one (not the sand or water one). He served no purpose whatsoever.<br/><br/>Eva Mendes was DREADFUL as Roxanne Simpson. Why was she even in this? She contributed nothing to the plot except getting in the way. <br/><br/>The story was full of more holes than an old side road. <br/><br/>The action was decent, and the CGI was great. But given the story and some cast, it wasn't enough to salvage this movie. <br/><br/>I give this a 4/10. If you're looking for a good action movie with a solid plot, this isn't the one you're looking for. If you want a brainless action movie, go with Shoot em Up over this."

","When i mention this movie to my friends, they all say stuff like "" Oh it sucked"" and "" Is was such a bad movie "" Although i must admit, it wasn't the best action movie i've seen. It is still very interesting to watch.<br/><br/>I think people who annoyed by the fact that the movie had the potential of 4 great fights with Blackheart and his 3 ""friends"" from hell, they were finished off very easily and the fights didn't last long enough to engage us. Even at the end, Blackheart was finished off pretty easily with the Ghost Riders stare to burn the souls. This movie had all the factors of a great action movie, the most important factor wasn't touched on enough. Which is why i think people thought this movie was bad.<br/><br/>So overall, a 6/10 but if the fight scenes were prolonged and more interesting, this movie could scored close to a 10.

"JPCaveman13","Null","0","0","13 June 2007"," worth it for the special effects
","Ghost Rider was an OK movie. I haven't read the comics but from the other reviewers who have read them, it sounds like it let the comic down. So I won't really go into that aspect of it then.<br/><br/>There were 2 main things that really drew me to this movie...the special effects and Sam Elliot as a grizzled old roughneck (just like Sergeant Major Plumley in We Were Soldiers) The graphics held my attention when Blaze became Ghost Rider and some aspects of the elementals were good. But the wussiness of the elementals detracted from the overall quality of the graphics. Now Sam Elliot. I really liked his performance in We Were Soldiers as SGM Plumley. It was pretty spot on for a grizzled, war-hardened infantry sergeant major, having been around them while in the military. When he revealed himself to be the Ghost Rider who stood up to the devil and rode off with Blaze, I was pretty excited to see him in another roughneck role where he just annihilates everyone. Sadly, I was let down by it but the graphics more than made up for it in the final sequence.<br/><br/>The acting was not the greatest at all. Nicholas Cage's humor was on sometimes but it was off more than it was on. His one-line remarks didn't live up to some of his previous good and cheesy one-liners in other movies (Con Air for example). Eva Mendes seemed more like eye candy than a viable role. The chemistry between them was off and it helped with the awkwardness in the beginning when they reunite and hurt it towards the end. The elementals were lame. I was more convinced they were just teenagers on an ego trip than they were all-powerful villains. Peter Fonda was flat in this performance. I do give him credit for playing the devil as more of a ""wolf in sheep's clothing"" than as the dark lord. And as stated above, Sam Elliot was by far the best actor in this film and did the best with his character.<br/><br/>Overall, graphics are good. Sam Elliot owns his role. The rest just slides by. So if you're looking to kill 2 hours, this is worth it for the graphics and Sam Elliot alone. Without those two, this isn't worth the plastic the DVD is made on."

","Ghost Rider had something none of the other, recent comic book movies had - the feeling that you were really watching a comic book. When you watch Spiderman, you can forget that this was once stationary drawings and just appreciate the movie. I didn't find that to be the case with Ghost Rider. The lines seemed like they were lifted right off the page, and while the actors all did good jobs with their delivery, there is a factor of just being silly (think R2D2 in Star Wars III: Revenge of the Sith). The action sequences are also a lot like a comic book - in that it's got dialog and specific actions placed with higher importance than good clean action. That having been said, it was fun to watch, it just wasn't breathtaking or spectacular in the slightest. Nicholas Cage was also the perfect person to play Ghost Rider, and he fits the part in both looks and attitude. Six out of ten for being watchable and enjoyable, but no immersion and a lot of mediocre qualities."

","So this movie wasn't disappointing because pretty much my expectations for the movie was for another Fantastic 4 Debacle. Honestly, it wasn't a great movie, and I don't think I could stretch it to be a ""good movie"" but I have to say it wasn't that bad. <br/><br/>The imagery was pretty sweet at times, the plot moved along so I wasn't bored, and the story wasn't horrible. GASP. This isn't the negative post I expected to write. But there was SOMETHING horrible in the movie. Yes... You guessed it Mr. Coppala himself, Nicholas Cage. OK, horrible may be a bit too strong. I think the word for it is annoying. What the heck is up with his mouth! I can't stop looking at it and wondering if his teeth and lips are real. Actually if I didn't know him before this movie I may have thought him to be funny or perhaps have good timing, but nope. Can't do it. I guess this blog falters in equality. He is ripped like a GI Joe in this movie, so he looks the part. But something just doesn't click for me.<br/><br/>The problem I really had with this movie (other than Roxy's shirt popping open in every scene--honestly it was a little much) (and the whole cheese factor) (and the whole Texas factor) was the ending. I have a much better ending which is far more tragic and believable, but would still lend itself to sequels to satisfy the companies behind the Benjamins. <br/><br/>For those of you looking for a grade, I refuse to put a grade on this movie out of principle. But if you went and saw it I wouldn't hate you for it."

Movies based on comic books need to do one thing, and that is STAND ON THEIR OWN! It's great to read all the great reviews that start out ""I was a huge fan of the comic book, and WOW....."". If they were really trying to market this movie just to those die hards, they would have made 12 dollars at the box office. To put this horrible movie out for general consumption is a crime. <br/><br/>But the effects...wow...somebody really did their job there. Way to go effects people!

Even Nicholas Cage could not save this movie. The story line was really lacking. The puns and one-liners were nor really that funny and in most instances extremely cheesy.<br/><br/>This could have been really good. Apart from the CG being a little lacking in parts, a good storyline would have held it together.

"fight_in_the_shade","3","3","8","17 February 2007"," The Rider's out of Gas
","This movie just wasn't given a chance, not by the public, but by the writer/director Mark Steven Johnson. As a fan of Ghost Rider for the past 17 years I full well know that some of the plot lines and back story of the old flame head in all of his incarnations have been pretty darn convoluted and borderline inept. But there is a great deal of quality material there. I'll admit I wanted to see the Rider rip through gangs of heavily armed mobsters and innumerable ninja. This is something he very much did not do.<br/><br/>Alas, comparison to the comic and what my dream movie would have been is not why I found the movie lacking. I understand that things need to be changed. Like I said, all the twisting stories of the Rider needed to be condensed and his whole reason for existence in the comic was quite suspect. The movie's idea that he was the devil's bounty hunter worked for me. I thought it pulled things together. In fact, there were a good number of things that worked for me. The special effects were amazing. They did a good job of bringing the blazing carnage to life. And the Rider looked great and they actually got his powers down quite well. I was impressed and pretty happy about that. Donal Logue and Sam Elliot bring more life to the two side characters of Mack and Caretaker than the script warranted, and that was very pleasing. The script itself.<br/><br/>The dialogue had its moments. When it was poking fun at itself or making a side joke it was great. It only failed when it was trying to be cool, which was most of the movie. It's easy to tell that Johnson is far more comfortable with the light and funny side of things. Most of what he's written have been warm family friendly movies (Grumpy and Grumpier Old Men, Simon Birch). When the action kicks in he just doesn't have what it takes. Of all the enemies that the Rider goes up against, we don't get one real fight. The rider's dialogue is weak at best, and when he's good Ole Johnny Blaze things get much worse. For some reason Cage decided that Blaze needed to be part Elvis. He had the point and even the ""uh-huh"". I was shocked we didn't see a hip gyration. Eva Mendes didn't do much more than look good in V neck shirts. Wes Bently, for being the son of Satan, I'm sorry, Mephistopheles, was made to look about as scary as an angsty teenager. And when he gets super powerful - his skin goes from pale to dark gray and he gets some wicked acne. Now that's intimidation. And Peter Fonda, well I think he just came to get a paycheck. An overall pervading sense through a lot of characters is that that had no range of motion. They will stand, bolt upright, 10-20 feet away from each other and hurl insults, swing a chain, twirl a chain, fights over. Blackheart touches people and they turn to husks.<br/><br/>Honestly, I wasn't expecting Spiderman, Batman Begins, or even the Fantastic Four. I would have been fine if it was just a dumb action flick like Daredevil or Punisher, but to be an action flick you need action, which this was lacking."

","Once, twice or maximum three times per year there comes a movie of which you beforehand know that it won't change your life with its progressive ideas or mesmerize your mind with its poetic dialogs, but nevertheless you simply have to watch it on the big screen, otherwise you risk missing out on something extraordinary cool! ""Ghost Rider"" is such a movie, based on dark comic book characters and featuring a whole lot of spectacular action-stunts. It's definitely not a masterpiece or even very memorable, but thrills and entertainment are guaranteed throughout the entire playtime. It's a rather gruesome comic book adaptation, dealing with contracts with the devil and doomed souls, but the execution is light-headed and enthusiast. In order to save his father from slowly and painfully dying of cancer, young stunt rider Johnny Blaze gives up his soul to the devilish Mephistopheles. Several years later, Johnny Blaze is a successful daredevil stunt-rider who seemingly can't get injured, yet Mephistopheles approaches him to live up to his part of the contract. He'll become Ghost Rider, the devil's bounty hunter assigned to prevent Blackheart  a fallen angel - from unleashing a new hell on earth. There are a whole lot of sub plots, for example Johnny's reunion with his former girlfriend and the mysterious cemetery caretaker who suspiciously knows a lot about Johnny's dreadful situation, but the main focus here is Nicolas Cage's flamboyant outfits and fiery skull as he transforms into the Ghost Rider overnight. The battles between him and Blackheart's associates (representing the primary elements) are pretty exciting and the visual effects are competently presented. The action sequences result in a lot of damage and mayhem, which is always entertaining to behold from a comfortable seat in the theater. Cage is a terrific actor, clever enough to not take his role overly serious and therefore adds quite a lot of comical elements to his character, like dry one-liners and eccentric tics. It was particularly pleasant to see Peter Fonda star again in a big-budgeted production, especially considering the role he plays! Just a couple of days ago, I watched the movie ""Race With The Devil"" in which a much younger Fonda desperately attempts to flee from a bunch of pursuing devil-worshipers, yet in this comic book vehicle, he plays the Devil himself and clearly enjoys it. The filming locations and the majority of set-pieces look effectively sinister, Eva Mendes is hot as ever, skull dude's motorcycle and armory is awesome and there even is a modern update of Johnny Cash' great song ""Ghost Riders in the Sky"" on the soundtrack! I can't possibly talk too negative about a film like this. It's great, mindless entertainment."

","Ghost Rider (2007) <br/><br/>** 1/2 (out of 4) <br/><br/>Based on the Marvel comic character, Nicholas Cage plays Johnny Blaze, a motorcycle stunt driver who escapes death countless times because he sold his soul to the Devil (Peter Fonda) years earlier in exchange that his father would beat cancer. The Devil doesn't totally keep his end of the bargain so Johnny escapes to fame but soon the Devil shows up wanting him to become the Ghost Rider and destroy his son who is trying to take over his power. I'll admit right up front that I'm not a comic fan and I've certainly never read anything this film is based on so I can't compare it to anything. I went into the movie hoping to at least get a popcorn entertainment and for the most part I think the film delivers, although it's certainly far from perfect and it's not even a good film. I viewed the Extended Cut, which I think was a mistake because there are certain scenes that just dragged on for no reason and sure enough, after watching the movie I looked up the differences in the two versions and these scenes were what was extended. There's way too much build-up and talk leading up to what the film is really about and I'd say that the ending goes on way too long as well. With that said, I thought the film was somewhat fun. I found the special effects to be quite good and after it grows on you I found the skull-on-fire character to be fun as well. Cage is such a terrific actor that it's really amazing to see how bad he can be at times but it really does seem like he's turning into the John Carradine of his time. The talent to give amazing performances but he also appears in some rather cheap stuff, goes over the top but at least makes it fun. I'm really not sure what Cage was trying to do here performance wise but it doesn't work in terms of being a ""good performance"" but it is a fun one. The supporting cast includes a fun turn by Fonda playing the Devil and we get Sam Elliott in the renegade role. I've never been a huge fan of Eva Mendes but she's good here as the love interest/sex symbol. GHOST RIDER is certainly far from a masterpiece but I think it works well enough for a rental if you enjoy this type of thing."

","There are reviews that say, ""The plot wasn't gripping and the characters didn't bring a tear to my eye"", and there are those that say, ""If that is what you are after in this kind of film, you are missing the point.""<br/><br/>To me, the point of a movie is to be entertained. To hear a story, if not a good one--at least one well told. To have fun.<br/><br/>There are films that are bad, but still a good time because of the feeling you have when you leave the theater. Then there are bad films which are so incompetent that they make you more cautious about how you really want to spend your time.<br/><br/>This film was bad in every way that matters, unless special effects are your reason for living.<br/><br/>The dialog is so jarringly terrible, a viewer almost expects every line to end with a smile--to be part of some joke before they get on with their real lines. The actors seem bored and uninspired in their roles, and Nicholas Cage seems wooden even for... Well, even for Nicholas Cage.<br/><br/>If it weren't for movies like National Treasure, I would have sworn to never see another Cage film again. I do not know how any actor's agent let them have a part in this movie without a letter of resignation, but this happens sometimes. Look up ""Gigli"" and ""88 Minutes"" for other examples.<br/><br/>Please do not pay money for this movie. Viewing it is like pushing rusty carpenter nails into your abdomen. It is so bad that it is a running joke among everyone I know. When a bad movie is released, we say, ""Well, it isn't Ghost rider, but it was still crap."" Avoid this movie. For the children."

","I went to see this movie because of the fact that first it was free, and second I am partial to the idea behind the comic. I am not here to say that this movie was bad or good because it was or wasn't in tune with the original story or whatever. I am simply here to say that if you are in the same boat as I was, being that you like a decent action flick and am not really that concerned with how well this follows the comic don't see this movie.<br/><br/>I could care less how well it follows the original story. Why? Because the movie itself is so ridiculous that it is not worth it. I am extremely shocked that Nick Cage would even consider a roll or script like this. It was incredibly cheesy with the satanic voice overs and it's suspenseful devilish morphing of each characters face. I always thought that Ghostrider was some bad ass character that could be applied to a a realistic setting. To me that its the beauty of superhero movies. To take a totally impossible story and apply to real life to make it convincing. Now of course this is done in ghostrider, it's just done very badly. The whole movie seemed that it's was a sort of cheesy metal song in video form with bad cgi."

I understand that most comic books are geared towards a slightly younger audience though, so it didn't really bother me too much! <br/><br/>The acting was fantastic, albeit a bit over-dramatic. Nicholas Cage is quite possibly the most laid back, dead-panned man I've ever seen on film...I totally loved him! Eva Longoria was all right; she seemed to just be a pretty face in this movie, and not much else. <br/><br/>I also thought the movie could have been a bit longer, with more action in it, but overall, it was truly a fun movie to watch! Not fantastic, definitely not bad, just very very fun and enjoyable! It makes a good date movie! It was definitely worth the $6.50!"

","I really find it hard to believe how someone can expect more than ordinary, for a movie where the main character is a skeleton on fire, CG has come a long way but even if we ever reach the stage where real actors can be replaced by Animated ones there is no way you can extract more than this much facial expressions from a flaming skull.<br/><br/>For the reasons stated above i went into the movie expecting nothing more than a 5, and this movie didn't for once look like it was going to cross that figure.<br/><br/>From the beginning you know that this movie is going to be as cheesy as it gets, even big fans of extra cheese like me (i like B-movies) will find it hard to digest the corny scenes and stereotypical dialogues that this movie has (hell sometimes you can predict it to last pause), any hope this movie had of rising above the ordinary is thrown away in the scene where Peter Fonda makes his appearance as the devil.<br/><br/>From then on this movie follows with one ordinary scene to the other, it felt like the entire movie was like walking of top of a wall, however it always felt that like the movie would fall on the wrong side not once did it look like this movie would fall on the right side and then breakaway from the ordinary.<br/><br/>The dialogues are corny, the computer graphics are ordinary (IN A TIME WHERE CG RENDERED STUNTS ARE GETTING MORE AND MORE OUTRAGEOUS, showing us stunts that may be yet attempted by Robbie Knievel, using CG don't even extract an ounce of excitement). The rest of the stunts are equally ordinary not a single one is worth a mention, to add to that the CLIMAX IS AS ORDINARY AS IT GETS.<br/><br/>Save for the presence of Nicholas Cage this movie would have made a great B-movie.<br/><br/>Shockingly the acting to is completely ordinary Nicholas plays a spaced out character that would have been better suited in movies like mall-rats, clerks etc. Not a single character rises above B movie standards.<br/><br/>By far the best this about this movie is Eva Mendes she looks sizzling, she brings much needed humour to the film and even though i hate to say it there love angle is by far the best part about this film, and did i mention THAT SHES MORE SIZZLING THAN THE ON FIRE GHOST RIDER.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is disappointing too, and character development is minimum, the entire movie feels like an exercise to make the mandatory 3 sequels (atleast) that we have come to associate with Hollywood in recent times,THANK GOD THIS MOVIE HAS NO POTENTIAL FOR THE EVEN MORE TORTOROUS SPIN-OFFS (think Electra and cat-woman).<br/><br/>What could have made a great B-movie is not only a bad/ordinary A-movie.<br/><br/>The film-makers could have got the hint when the best power that GR gives the people a taste of their own sins,hardly exciting when by Christian standards MORE THAN HALF THE WORLD AND THE WHOLE OF America HAS A PLACE RESERVED IN HELL.<br/><br/>Even though I've hardly written anything good about the movie pulls through on some good one liners, EVA MENDES, LOADS OF ORDINARY SCENES THAT JUST ABOUT HOLD YOUR ATTENTION AND Phenomenally LOW Expectations.<br/><br/>Watch only if really really bored, if you like B-Movies and are willing to see this as one, and love Eva Mendes (shes wearing clothes fit for a nun though), free tickets for the premiere(in my case) or really cheap matinée show is a must.<br/><br/>-s weak on all technical fronts including acting (suprisingly), no excitement whatsoever.<br/><br/>+/-s would have made a good/great B-movie.<br/><br/>+s EVA MENDES, good one liners and humour, lots of ordinary scenes that hold your attention.<br/><br/>total 5/10 (facoring in expectations (lets not talk about PG-13) if you watch it like an A-list movie with Nicholas Cage then the rating will be much lower)"

","As I realize Ghost Rider is based on comic books and I have no detailed familiarity with the comic book I cannot judge the movie according to the comic book details. I can tell you this movie meets the expectations of the Marvel comics and provides entertainment under those aspects. While it may not have been the blockbuster we saw with Spiderman, that may only lie in the fact that Spiderman was more well known. The special effects are very good.<br/><br/>Realize you are being introduced to a character with this movie. It is not like seeing the first Batman where most people were very familiar with the expected storyline. Ghost Rider starts from the beginning giving the character purpose. You will not need a future movie to build the character's beginnings. Even if the numbers do not exceed expectations I fully expect a sequel from this feature.<br/><br/>Some people may have expected more dramatization or more side stories. I think you will see that in future sequels. Sony and Marvel have installed a foundation and now we see if they build on it.<br/><br/>The movie is fairly decent for all ages except the extremely young who may have a slight problem reconciling some of the ghostly images. It does touch to the edge of fright without delving into a straight out horror flick, which is not its goal.<br/><br/>Go see it. It is worth the initial viewing and fans will probably buy the DVD."
"mysticowl","5","2","5","18 February 2007"," Very disappointing
","I saw this tonight and I was very disappointed. I wish I walked in with lower expectations, but I didn't expect to dislike a Nicolas Cage movie so much.<br/><br/>I thought that the movie took way too much time setting up the back story and showing us the actual Ghost Rider. Of course Johnny Blaze's story is necessary, but there were too many extra scenes in it that could have been taken out and we still would've gotten all the motivation and background needed.<br/><br/>Secondly, too much romance, not enough action. I didn't go in there to watch Eva Mendes's breasts get more screen time than Carter Slade as GR. Maybe some people did, but personally I would liked to see more of Ghost Rider kicking ass and less of Nicolas Cage pining.<br/><br/>And speaking of the casting of Eva Mendes. Johnny and Roxy look the same age when they're young, and suddenly X number of years later he's ten years her senior? I mean come on! Either cast a 6-year-old as young Roxy or cast a woman Nicolas Cage's age as grown up Roxy. Hopefully a better actress than Mendes.<br/><br/>And what was with the absolutely throw-away death of the water Nephilim? ""Oooh, we're running out of time and got an extra villain left over, we have to kill him in under two minutes."" Was that the thinking that went into that ""scene""? It wasn't very good thinking and it's reflective of the whole movie.<br/><br/>Bottom line: could have been much better."
"gross_fangirl_sobbing","Null","2","5","18 February 2007"," So much potential...
","The main problem is that it had so much potential. It had enough potential to be one of the better comic adaptations - Right up there with X2 and Spider Man, but there were things that pulled it down, I'm sad to say, to a level of mediocrity.<br/><br/>Let's start with the potential. Nic Cage as Blaze wasn't bad in my opinion - just a bit uninspired. If they wanted a huge name, there were about a hundred other fish in the sea. Something tells me John Travolta would've been a good choice. As you see, with a pretty nondescript hero role, many actors could've pulled it off. Now, the biggest waste of potential was Blackheart and the Nephilims. Blackheart sure was beautiful, and you could tell he was an interesting character, and Bentley did his best with the tacky lines, but the director turned him into Damian Thorn all grown up instead of more true to his character, a ruthless demon with blood lust. Blackheart is not just a creepy kid trying to emulate Daddy. They missed that mark completely. The Nephilims, well, they were cool, but were not used as much as they could've been to benefit the story.<br/><br/>The bad? All the scenes with bonding between Blaze and Roxanne are laughable. I'm sorry to say the two have no chemistry. The back story of the dying father and abandoned girlfriend are mighty depressing, but the way it is presented, the main punch of Blaze's life being a literal hell on Earth is just not felt as strongly. I understand we cannot spend that much time in the exposition, but we can at least be given more time to feel sorry for our young, hopeless hero.<br/><br/>The good? The action is good, keeps you interested, and the special effects are decent too. The transformation from man to Ghost Rider was done very well, and I applaud them on that. The one character that was got almost completely right was Mephistopheles. (I would rate Fonda up there with Pacino and Stromare as far as my favorite portrayals of Satan). But that is a smaller part. Not too hard to screw up. I do look forward to seeing more of that character should there be a Ghost Rider 2 (which I do not doubt there will be).<br/><br/>As a movie, it is a good popcorn flick. I would say see it once, give it a chance. I liked it, despite it's flaws and apparent lack of ambition. While not the most amazing comic adaptation, it is not the worst either, and I give it a solid score of 6."

The entire movie overall was very pleasing, and I was really drawn into it for some reason.<br/><br/>If I could of changed anything, I would of developed the character of his dad a bit more. I think that could of used just a TAD bit more attention to make the story feel more real. The ending, although it was pretty sweet and left it open for a sequel, could of been a tid bit longer.<br/><br/>Overall. Great movie. I was impressed.

","I know, I know. 4 out of 10!? How can any Marvel movie possibly get a score that low? Especially one with Nicholas Cage.<br/><br/>First, I would like you all to know just how much of a fan I am of the Marvel movies, and that of Mark Steven Johnson. His work on Elektra and Daredevil, although not extraordinary, was certainly worthy of watching. Not to mention his movies haven't really been all that bad...<br/><br/>I really hate to say this (Ghostrider is a movie I've been looking forward to for a very long time), but this movie was just... horrible. The acting was incredibly cheesy (yes... even Cage). There were times when I couldn't help but laugh out loud during certain dialogue points, such as when Mephistopheles and Blackheart were ""facing off"" in the park. The lines were so one-dimensional that it felt like I was watching a parody of an action-movie... like Kung Pow. Every moment of the film felt fake... the emotions (if there were any) seemed paper-thin. Every line can be predicted. It was all too cliché. Eva Meade, the actress who plays Cage's secret love, Roxanne Simpson, didn't make any sense. One second she was walking away from Cage's character, the next she was jumping back into his arms (not to mention her face was nearly expressionless the entire movie).<br/><br/>The plot, although good in theory, lacked conflict. Every single showdown that Ghostrider had with the elemental lackeys lasted, at the most, two minutes... literally. There was no challenge... no excitement. Ghostrider did more damage while riding his bike to the fights than he did during them.<br/><br/>I would suggest either avoiding this movie completely or at least waiting until it hits the 2-dollar theater. I would have given Ghostrider a lower score if not for the extraordinary graphics (although the cool scenes are mainly of Cage riding his bike, not the fights)."

","I just finished seeing Ghost Rider, and I have to say,this movie is an awesome, awesome, flick. I recommend everyone within walking, running, even driving distance of the theater to see this movie. Nicholas Cage does an excellent job as portraying Johnny Blaze. The dialogue, while not very witty, was funny. There are several funny moments actually, and no they all were not shown in the trailer. I have one question though. Why is it in every scene, Eva Mendes's cleavage is showing? I mean I am a guy, but it doesn't seem very practical to have your boobs about to pop out when your fighting Beelzebub's son. I mean come on. Honestly. OK, back to the film. As I said before, this movie was very good. It has the perfect mix. Action for the guys, romance for the ladies, and a horse."

","I watched it tonight since I am in Taiwan and it showed couple days earlier than the states. I must say I am a bit disappointed as it reminded me of the movie ""Daredevil"" few years ago and upon some research, surprise, it's from the same director. For people who watched Daredevil, than you know what I am talking about, famous casts, good CGs, but a very average plot and directing. The fights with the villains are lackluster especially with the minor villains. The acting from Nicolas Cage, Peter Fonda and Eva Mendes all seemed very routine. All Eva Mendes does in the movie is consistently showing off her cleavage, while it's great to look at, the chemistry between her and Nicolas Cage seemed non-existence. Give this movie the same expectation as ""Daredevil"" as they are very the same product, different package."
"oneloveall","5","3","10","16 February 2007"," Only effect that was special was the special effects
","Serviceable comic book translation gets by on unique, well implemented computer animation, but cannot rise above it's underwhelming plot line, mechanical pacing, and wooden performances despite a reasonable enough attempt to make this superhero action film more fun and accessible then most of it's ilk. The Marvel-based, skull-burning character finds his script adaptation feeling methodically predictable even to non-fans, despite the special Gothic and Texan flavor that tries, unsuccessfully, to pull the movie further away from it's generic trappings. <br/><br/>Playing out a little too unintentionally comical at times, Ghost Rider's action sequences nonetheless provide the only distraction from the not-so-great acting, of course fronted by Nicolas Cage's overdone, ego-driven theatrics. While a few of these blazingly violent and vibrant physical scenes seemingly indulge the opposite in essence of our freakishly looking, damned soul of an antihero to a silly degree, on the whole this movie is saved from an irredeemable pit of tedium by the always reliable and ever increasing detailed effects design, which stands out from many standard comic book approaches, often implemented with thoughtful, sharp focus. <br/><br/>The visceral heart of these effect sequences may not be enough to justify a viewing from anyone who is not already a fan of this stuff, but it will be enough to pump up a general audience with it's hell-on-wheels aesthetics. Ignore the climax's dull relaying of a theme and enjoy this for what it is, a mildly fun little airheaded motorcycle ride through the desert with some inventive eye candy."

","I saw this movie (as with ""The Benchwarmers"") at the behest of my best friend who usually has pretty good cinematic tastes. These tastes have gone downhill in recent years and this concerns me. We may have to have a movie intervention for him, but that's another story.<br/><br/>I suppose if you're into movies where the dialog consists of ""I'm gonna kick your butt"" / ""I don't think so"" for about two hours, you won't be disappointed in ""Ghost Rider."" The script, which sounds like a fanfic written by a seventh grader, is simplistic enough to hold the attentions of even the most ADD-riddled viewer. So much so, that it seems implausible that Cage's Johnny Blaze (a well thought out name if ever there was one) would have the knowledge necessary to understand the theology books that are central to the plot. Maybe he just saw the bitchin' pictures and pieced it together in his head.<br/><br/>While the script is the movie's biggest problem, there are several others that make a bad situation even worse. Such as the terribly long pacing, the XBox-worthy CGI effects and the wooden performances of all actors involved. Particularly those of the comely love interest Roxanne Simpson, a roving reporter who seemingly got through Journalism School by her cleavage alone. Sam Elliot makes a cameo in an attempt to bring a bit of dignity to the film, but all he does is spout some faux-religious bunk about the Ghost Rider being the Devil's gofer. You'd think by now, somebody would have just challenged him to a fiddle contest by now. It would have been more interesting to watch.<br/><br/>Also of note is the movie's anti-smoking message, which is more heavy-handed than anything truth.com could have come up with. Young Johnny's father smokes Marlboros and is dead five minutes later. However, in a later scene, many of Blaze's friends are seen playing poker and smoking Lucky Strikes. The moral of the story: smoking Marlboros will kill you. So will this movie. Especially if you payed to see it. Wait for it to come out on DVD and play ""Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Home Game"" with it."

","Okay, here's a basic summary of my experience of this movie. At the resort me and my friend were at for vacation, they had a free theater, and we decided to see ghost rider. We left forty five minutes after the start. The beginning sequence was cheesy and it did not have the thrill the director wanted. When Johhny's father died and he was screaming NOOOOOO!!! I wanted to join him. But not for the same reasons. And how it suddenly switched to Cage, I was so confused, my friend had to explain what happened to me. It gave no summary of how he got there or who he was. And then the thing with the element people. The whole standoff between the devil and his son, even six years would be able to see through that whole father ""shock"". The elements are so sad, one punch and earth is screaming mercy. He did have powers, but he used a truck. Sad. And the ghost rider himself, his entire dialog consisted of cheesy one liners, which i guess was supposed to have an effect. And the grave keeper, who knew so much about the ghost rider. Gee, wonder who he was? I left after that, but that was pretty easy to figure . I was completely disgusted with the movie."

Thankfully, I didn't pay when I saw this in theaters, because if I had I would most definitely demanded it back. After I saw 'The Wicker Man' I didn't think that Nicholas Cage's performances could get any worse, but this movie proved me wrong.

You would think these big Hollywood script writers could have come up with a better fight scene between the Devils Bounty Hunter that has a flaming skull for a head, an fallen angels that are hiding in the elements. But all that seemed to happen was he walked up to them did the penance stare and that was it. 20-30 seconds tops per fight scene. Also the fight scene between GR and the helicopter that took so long to make, was useless. There was no fight. He wrapped his chain around the helicopter pulled it in then let it go. How that was so long in the making is ridiculous.<br/><br/>And at the end when the Devil said he would take back the curse an Johnny Blaze said no I'm going to use it against you.

There is nothing good here and I can only implore you not to waste your money going to see this film.<br/><br/>Besides everything else, the Ghost Rider himself is surely one of the dullest characters ever created. There is no way to empathise with this character and trying to turn this into a film was surely a mistake.

","Everything about this movie was so clichéd. Just to mention a few,<br/><br/>1. Hero's good friend, innocent ol' Mack (Donal Loque, the only saving grace from the movie), would get the obligatory ""shock"" value treatment (see the sheriff from ""Misery""), <br/><br/>2. The ""I am Legion...."" (as per this summary title) cry at the convergence of spirits was so campy, and i thought it could have done with a more sinister / scarier / demonic punchline, seriously, did Blackheart have to explain what Legion meant? It's like ""I'm Ghost Rider, because I'm A Ghost that Rides!!!!"" <br/><br/>3. Villains get killed too easily, no-brainer task for the hero, <br/><br/>4. The original Ghost Rider (Sam Elliot's Slade) was not fully expounded upon, it was like they ran out of cash halfway or something,<br/><br/>5. No ground-breaking CGI's here folks (unrelated to the topic, i know). Some scenes really look cheap. <br/><br/>6. The bad guy in this case, Mephistopheles (excellently portrayed by Peter Fonda, if i may add) obligatory end scene that runs along the line of ""oh, so you're not doing your part of the deal huh? See in you in the sequel then"" <br/><br/>7. The end, where the obligatory, hero / transformation scene, paving the way for sequels, here Johnny Blaze winks to show that he can...before........(I won't reveal the spoilers out of respect), but see how tastefully Batman Begins left it open to sequel(s).<br/><br/>Here's to Chris Nolan's re-imagining of ""Ghost Rider Begins""! :) Awful, i wanted to blow my brains out (just kidding).

"jp_011205","3","2","6","17 February 2007"," Never Catches Fire
","The trailers have finished and the lights are dimming completely now. That familiar torch lady in the Columbia Pictures logo has appeared and quickly vanishes into the Marvel Comics flipping logo which transforms into a Ghost Rider inspired font. Finally the Crystal Sky logo is shown, then it comes; a somewhat interesting, but not quite exciting narration by Sam Elliott, who here plays the Caretaker. After we are told the ""backstory"" the high energy, fire decorated opening credits begin. It's here I think to myself, come on Johnson, impress me. About an hour and fifty minutes later I accept the fact that I asked for too much. Don't get me wrong, there's lot of sparks, most being the visuals, but the fire never really gets going in 'Ghost Rider'.<br/><br/>The storyline here really isn't all that complex. When Johnny Blaze, first played Matthew Long, was a teen he made a deal with the Devil, better known here as Mephistopheles, played by Peter Fonda. This deal was to save his ""father"" from the cancer that was slowly killing him. Mephisto keeps to the deal, but Johnny's ""father"" dies later that same day during a motorcycle stunt. In exchange for his ""father's"" health, even though short-lived, Johnny will one day be called upon to become the Ghost Rider and do Mephisto's bidding. Years later, Johnny, now played by Nicolas Cage, is a famous stunt driver and is haunted by the deal he made every day of his life. The time comes and he is revisited by Mephiso and told to seek out and destroy Blackheart, played by Wes Bently, who has his own team of thugs known as the Nephilim. Once he does, Johnny is promised his soul will be returned, thus ridding him of the curse he currently bears.<br/><br/>So there you have it, the basic outline for 'Ghost Rider'. That is where the film first starts to fall apart. The real story of Johnny Blaze's life and how he becomes Ghost Rider is slightly different. Crash is not Johnny's actual father as we are led to believe. (That's why I put quotations around father in the above description.) His wife Mona isn't even in the film and Mephisto is never driven away by Roxanne's purity either here. These among other things are some of the ways Mark Steven Johnson's take on 'Ghost Rider' isn't true to the comic. I myself aren't a Ghost Rider fanatic or anything close, but I'm sure those that are will find these alterations unnecessary and questionable. For the rest of the public that are unaware though, they'll just take it as is as they're force fed Johnson's $120 million adaptation.<br/><br/>Oh, but that's not all that's bad folks. Acting skill was apparently not a priority. If it were, I believe someone else would have been cast in the role of Roxanne, played by Eva Mendes. I'm. Not. Going. Anywhere. Digging deep, that's how Mendes' lines come out. It. Was. Almost. Robotic. The. Way. She. Spoke. Bently is not very good either. He's just doesn't come off villainous enough. He's got the look I guess, but that's about it. It's not entirely the actor's fault's though. The combined effort of Johnson, Shane Salerno, David S. Goyer, & Jonathan Hensleigh that's called a screenplay is far from good writing. A couple weeks back and again this week I was warned that the comics weren't written too well either. Let me just say to that person now, Nick, if they're anything like the dialogue in the film, you were dead on. Too much comedy was added in as well. Continuously jokes are spread throughout, which takes away from the sense of seriousness and drama that I believe was crucial for everything to work.<br/><br/>The visuals are what in the end strive to be the focal point of the film. The fire doesn't always appear to be real, but everything is just plain cool looking. The most memorable moment for me was when the water element member of the Nemphilim's eye drips down his face and he wipes it off while instantaneously another eye appears. That was pretty awesome. I can't forget about the bike though, it's beautiful. As a whole though, the pricey CGI isn't enough to compensate for all the mistakes. 'Ghost Rider' makes it clear that Johnson should leave comic characters alone. He obviously can't do it right, so why even attempt?"

However, at times the movie became too ambitious and it really made things look corny and fake.<br/><br/>The idea behind the story was good, but the story that made it to the screen was too rushed and not thought through enough. Considering ""Ghost Rider"" is what I can only imagine as the first of more movies to come, the story should have been primarily about the build-up and the introduction to Ghost rider - who Ghost rider is, more of his background, and not just tell a story which could only be described as a script on speed.<br/><br/>I recommend you watch it, but primarily to check out the cool special effects."

I understand that Nicolas Cage is a big Ghost Rider fan but I have always thought his acting is too limited to be able to grasp particular characters well and unfortunately this is one of those times. I think with a stronger actor this could have been one of the best marvel movies. Also if you want an actress who can act forget about Eva Mendes (only good in Once upon a time in Mexico) but if you want some eye candy then by all means cast her.

","Delayed by almost a year and coming from the director of Daredevil, Ghost Rider was given the death knell by many before even having seen it. Into the equation is that it stars Nicolas Cage, a man whose star has dimmed so badly it's as if Leaving Las Vegas had never been made, Ghost Rider it seems......... had to stink? Stunt motor cycle rider Johnny Blaze sells his soul to Mesphistopheles in exchange for his Fathers good health. Some time later the demon Blackheart comes to Earth wreaking havoc and Blaze is summoned by Mephistopheles to stop him, only Blaze is transformed into the Ghost Rider, a bike riding, chain slinging spirit of vengeance.<br/><br/>Ghost Rider is a fun film that sadly is not without flaws, but the comic touches and all round sense of fun, however, should not be understated, so much so that if people go into it with the expectation of a light and breezy comic book picture, then there is enjoyment to be had. The character of Blaze/Ghost Rider is wonderful in the extreme, Blaze doesn't drink alcohol, he instead drinks jellybeans out of a glass. He listens to The Carpenters and gets much amusement from watching chimps doing karate, this is a man who on his motorbike leaps the length of a football field over rotor whirling helicopters! Then Blaze becomes Ghost Rider, a maniacal mass of flame and one liners, an odd character when one thinks he works for the devil and makes his mantra one of striking down evildoers! And it's with that cheeky daftness that one needs to view this movie.<br/><br/>Nicolas Cage actively sought out the role of Blaze due to his immense love of the source, and there is no denying that he puts guts and kudos into the portrayal. He perfectly camps the comic book nature of Blaze, whilst revelling in the devil may care side of the Ghost Rider persona. However, Cage is the only one who can come out of the picture with any credit, female love interest falls in the hands of Eva Mendes, perhaps her Roxanne Simpson character is a little underwritten, but her screen presence is more annoying than memorable. Peter Fonda is very poor as Mephistopheles, about as scary as someone making Easy Rider 2, yet compared to Wes Bentley, Fonda looks like Oscar gold. Bentley is Blackheart, and he struggles with delivery and any sort of nasty aura in which to breath life into a potential bad guy to savour, and as for his cohort minions? The less said the better I think.<br/><br/>It's a shame the villains are so poor because there is a lot of care and attention here from Cage and director Mark Steven Johnson, both men whom are clearly in love with the source material. Ghost Rider is certainly a fun experience, and it scrubs up well on Blu-ray, but you may want to repeatedly punch the casting director in the face come the end of the picture. 6.5/10"

I personally feel the Directer should be ashamed for doing that to such a great song.

Everything about Ghost Rider is AWESOME, and with that in mind how could this movie be anything but AWESOME? Well...they have found a way.<br/><br/>Now I like Nick Cage, CON AIR, THE ROCK, FACE/OFF, RAISING ARIZONA...all classics. So Mr. Cage I ask you... WHAT THE F*CK! OK OK maybe that is a bit TOO harsh since the movie is not THAT bad... but it is a GHOST RIDER movie that is NOT AWESOME...and that is just unacceptable. What we have here is a 2 hour movie that feels like it's 3 hours of bad acting, bad writing, and a very uneventful story that never really goes anywhere. Now this was written and directed by the same guy who made DAREDEVIL which, while flawed, I enjoyed...but he also made ELEKTRA, which makes me vomit just thinking about...my keyboard is now covered in vomit due to me having to type about it...oh my god I am still thinking about it and still vomiting, oh man I need to think about something else...pie...yeah pie is good...I like apple...whew...OK back to this POS.

","Johnny Blaze began a career as a stunt motorcyclist while still in his teens, taking after his father, Barton Blaze, who has become a legendary stunt cyclist. In one of those bizarre quirks of irony that life tends to display, his father achieves fame by cheating death, only to be diagnosed with terminal cancer and given a short time to live. Johnny makes a deal with Mephistopheles, selling his soul to the devil in exchange for the return of his father's health. Sadly, the devil tends to be a bit of a sneaky bastard, so Barton's health returns wonderfully, and hours later he's killed in a motorcycle stunt. Ouch.<br/><br/>So now Johnny has no soul, but he doesn't quit cycling. In fact, being an instrument of Satan has a wonderful effect on his career, since Johnny is literally unable to be killed. He performs the most spectacular stunts imaginable and with a level of calm that suggests insanity. He's almost bored as he's leaping over things that other stuntmen wouldn't even imagine trying. Unfortunately, because of his pact with the devil, he also has to transform into the Ghost Rider, the devil's bounty hunter.<br/><br/>Sounds like it could be an interesting life, although I can't imagine how many new shirts he has to buy after they get all singed by his flaming head. Besides, he gets to ride through the night on this cool flaming chrome chopper finding evil souls and bringing them back to hell. I wouldn't mind that so much. Hear that, Mephistopheles?<br/><br/>There is one scene where a mugging victim is being attacked, and the Ghost Rider approaches, stops the mugging and dispatches some flaming justice. It's a satisfying scene, but then later there is a television news crew interviewing the victim, who doesn't appear to be firing on all cylinders. When asked for a description of the man who stopped the attack, she says, ""he was all thin and bony and had a rad chopper with flames and stuff.""<br/><br/>Anything else?<br/><br/>""Oh, and his face was a skull and it was on fire. It was an edge look but he totally pulled it off.""<br/><br/>There you have sort of the tone of the whole movie. It's about a guy who sells his soul to Satan and becomes a tool of the devil by night, but it's certainly not afraid to laugh at itself, which is important in a movie like this. Besides, when the girl was given that interesting description, the look on the cameraman's face was classic.<br/><br/>There is also a totally ineffective love story between Johnny and Roxanne (played by Eva Mendez, who seems far too beautiful and sophisticated to fall in love with a stuntman like Johnny). Johnny flees his life after his father's death, leaving Roxanne for years without a word from him, but when a strange twist of fate brings them back together he is faced with the challenge of winning back his true love while also doing something about this pesky devil's slave thing.<br/><br/>You see, he does that foolish thing that people in half-witted movies like this tend to do - he tries to tell her the truth. He explains earnestly that he sold his soul and now has to work for the devil at night, and he's somehow surprised when she doesn't believe him. I love how he lets her get angry and storm away from him without ever thinking to just show her. I'll tell you this right now, if I'm ever in a position where I have to convince someone that I can fly or travel through time or turn my head into a flaming skull or anything else like that, you better believe I'm not going to do much talking beyond ""Okay, watch this...""<br/><br/>Enter Blackheart, the devil's son, who is embarking on an ambitious plan to possess a thousand souls and thus release hell on earth. I would have thought it would take more souls than that, but no matter. Johnny is offered the opportunity to anull his contract with the devil if he can defeat Blackheart and send his soul back to hell.<br/><br/>All this taking and sending of souls gets so tiresome for me, and it may be one of the movie's biggest weaknesses. Buying and selling a soul tends to be something that most people have little experience with, so they offer this explanation:<br/><br/>""The host can gain control of the possessing spirit through concentration on and manipulation of the fire element that exists within man.""<br/><br/>Hence the flaming head, I suppose. I'm reminded of that classic scene in O Brother, Where Art Thou? where they pick up that kid Tommy on the side of the road with the guitar. He explains casually that he sold his soul to the devil to learn to play the guitar real good, and Delmar asks incredulously, ""For that you sold your everlasting soul?"" Surprised, Tommy replies, ""Well, I wasn't usin' it...""<br/><br/>I have a feeling that a substantial portion of Ghost Rider's target audience feels somewhat similar about their souls, which may be part of the reason that the movie has gotten such terrible reviews. Yeah, it's goofy, but it's not that bad. Most of the confrontations between Johnny and Blackheart and his gang are fantastically stupid (""My name is Legion, for we are maaaaaaaaanyyy!!!!""), but the movie is fun in its own way. Columbia Pictures, at least, certainly wasn't too disappointed with it, because they have now officially green-lit a sequel.<br/><br/>For some reason this makes me think of the relevance of one of the more interesting lines in the movie:<br/><br/>""Raise no more devils than you can lay down."""

And the Devil is using a motorcycle because we are in the 20th century comics universe, however the rider is Nicholas Cage acting as the Devil's head-hunter.<br/><br/>'Ghost Rider' is a combination of Faust, cheap popular culture, computer effects and comics-deep characters that works to a certain extent but also shows deeply the limitations of the genre, or of the mix of genres I should say. It is the choice of a fine actor like Nicholas Cage with good supporting roles from Finda and Eva Mendes that makes the combination even more obviously look like badly mixed. Cage's melancholy is disturbing in every scene he is in, but is not convincing and not in tune with the quantity of muscles on his body and the spectacular action around. The ending is badly written, non-convincing, and if it was meant to signal the start of the series it did not ignite at all for me the wish to see the follow-up installments.

","I kinda have to agree with some of the negativity of some of the comments, with regard to the anomalies of the script. However, I think the basic story was interesting, and the FX were great, especially the ghost rider. Now that he story has been told to explain where the ghost rider came from, I would like to see a sequel with a whole lot more action in it. One might compare it to the original Alien movie versus the Aliens movie(#2), in that the second version got right into the action and never let up. Ghost rider two could be a top notch action flick. You would not even need Eva Mendes to come back for the sequel, but the eye candy she provides would be welcome as far as this viewer is concerned!"
"dbborroughs","7","1","2","3 September 2007"," Once Ghost rider shows up this is a great deal of fun
","Clunky comic adaptation is some where toward the middle of the pack of big screen comic stories. After the set up of young Johnnie Blaze selling his soul to save his dad, the story jumps ahead to Johnnie as supreme motorcycle daredevil. He reunites with his childhood sweetheart (left because of guilt over what happened to his dad) just as Mephistopheles returns to have Johnnie fulfill his end of the bargain. Blaze must stop Blackheart from getting a contract for 1000 souls which will result in hell on earth. Mephistopheles sweetens the pot by promising Johnnie his freedom if he completes the task. And with that Ghost Rider is reborn.<br/><br/>After a slow set up the movie kicks into high gear with the first appearance of Ghost Rider. Here we have the comic come to life and its fun on a purely comic level. This is not the deep musing of Spiderman, the solid novel like quality of Batman Begins, nor the the misdirected but interesting occult Constantine, this is the sort of thing that regularly graced the 22 pages of the comic book in four colors, its pure mindless cheese that hooks you on the ""oh thats so cool"" level of the visuals and ideas, even though it makes no logical sense. It hasn't been pumped up for real movie life, rather its the comic come to life, with its lack of complexity intact. Sue me I liked the film-or at least I did once Ghost Rider shows up. Its just those neat panels I used to read up there on the big screen. Classic? I think not. Mindless popcorn flick? most definitely. If you take it on its terms I think you'll enjoy it, especially once it gets going. Hell, it even has Sam Elliot, what more could you want? Worth a look, though 10 bucks in theaters maybe asking too much."

","I will admit I watched this movie purely because I love Nick Cage. I didn't go in expecting much of the movie because, with very few exceptions, movies that are made from comic books just can't do them justice.<br/><br/>This has to be the case here. The acting is fairly good (Wes Bentley is GREAT as Blackheart!) and the special effects were decent (they must have been awesome on a large screen!) It was even a decent story-line.<br/><br/>What it lacked was answers. (here is where the spoilers come in, people...fair warning!!!) If the contract was so powerful, why did Mephistopheles not hunt The Caretaker down earlier? Was it because he was on Hallowed ground? I also didn't like how they ended things with the Caretaker - what happens to him? Does he find redemption? Then there is Blackheart's gang...we know NOTHING about them.

","So I finally get to see Ghost Rider, and unfortunately, the disk I got was damaged, so I missed a few minutes prior to the final battle.<br/><br/>Strangely, I don't think I missed much.<br/><br/>Let's face it - this is going to be the age of the Superhero Flick. The return of iconic movie greats such as Batman and Superman, the incredible emergence of comic classics like X-Men and Spiderman, and even the creation of new and interesting hero tales such as The Incredibles and Unbreakable are all testament to the Age of the Super Hero Film.<br/><br/>And in any such age you're going to get great movies, lousy movies, and OK movies.<br/><br/>This one joins the ranks of the Hulk and Fantastic Four as an OK movie. It's not bad - it has fine graphics, interesting general plot, and some moments of surprise and humor that make it a good film to have on-hand for rainy Saturday afternoons, when the charm of Power Ranger reruns and new, pathetic Scooby Doo cartoons runs out. But the acting is, at times, pretty bad - aren't we glad Cage didn't end up playing Superman after all! - and the plot is clearly as forced as the average '80s comic - which is what this film was based on.<br/><br/>The worst part of this film has got to be the villains. Without giving away details, I think I'd have rather seen this movie done in the old style of TV serials, where the superhero faces a number of conventional criminals and realistic situations, rather than facing a group of contrived demons that barely come across as threatening.<br/><br/>The best part was, undoubtedly, the visual effects. I sincerely had my doubts that they could successfully pull off a flaming skull and a flaming motorcycle, but they did.<br/><br/>In the end, though, you just have to turn off the gray matter and enjoy the film for what it is - a fun Saturday afternoon flick.<br/><br/>Then, when the kids are in bed, pop in any of the Blade trilogy, to remind yourself of what a really scary supernatural villain could be like."

Nicolas Cage was a real shock for me, i could NOT imagine him as any kind of Comic- book hero, let alone a burning skeleton on a bike. However, he was good and somehow believable as the dare- devil. I enjoyed this film, not because the acting was brilliant or the story line grabbed me, but because it was fun, the special effects were excellent, and it is a good action/fantasy movie to cheer you up. I found myself grinning and laughing at some of the 'camp' moments and music choices. The script sounds like a comic which works well with the comic- like atmosphere this film creates. I don't know how true to the original Marvel it is, however as a stand alone movie it is great fun and easy to watch- no puzzling out difficult story lines- or thinking at all actually.<br/><br/>Silly and enjoyable for a rainy day."

","Johnny Blaze (Nicolas Cage) has been a motorcycle stunt rider since childhood, having been trained by his stuntman father. However, when Johnny's father gets cancer, the devil himself (Peter Fonda) comes to make a deal with 18 year old Johnny. He'll cure dad of his cancer if Johnny will sign his soul over to him. Almost before he realizes what he has done, Johnny agrees. However, although Johnny's father is cured, he dies shortly after in a motorcycle accident. Johnny is heartbroken and leaves town, running away from his lovely girlfriend, Roxanne (Eva Mendes). But, the devil tells Johnny he will come for him when he is needed. Flash forward several years. Johnny Blaze is the greatest motorcycle stunt rider in the world, thrilling audiences everywhere, by jumping over helicopters, among other things. Roxanne, now a reporter, arrives to interview him and Johnny realizes he still loves her. Bad timing. The devil comes back to demand Johnny's services as a ""ghost rider"", a person who tracks down the bad guys and gives them a push toward their final destination, hell. Mestophiles also wants Johnny to battle his evil son Blackheart (Wes Bentley) and his gang. If Johnny can defeat Blackheart, the devil will give him back his soul. Whew, what a deal! Can Johnny summon the courage to take back his life? This is an exciting movie, based on a Marvel comic book hero. Cage, a very fine actor as evidenced by Adaptation and Matchstick Men, gives a nice turn as the troubled hero and he looks, well, very hot. Mendes, too, charms the audience with her stunning beauty and sweet demeanor. As the devil, Fonda strikes the right note while Bentley, who always looks creepy, poor guy, was made to order for his role as the devil's son. The look of the film is adequate, with mostly well-chosen costumes, interesting sets, and some nice visuals. However, one does get the feeling that some corners were cut in the special effects department, making the film look cheap when compared to a movie such as the original Batman. There are a few disturbing images, too, rendering the film unsuitable for those under 10. Yet, all in all, this is an exciting ride, especially for folks who love comic books and their superheroes. As an evening's entertainment, Ghost Rider delivers a big dose of thrills and chills."
"lemon_magic","7","1","2","5 May 2007"," A bit lightweight for a film about ""Hell's Bounty Hunter""...but enjoyable
","I saw ""Ghost Rider"" for $1.50 in a 2nd run movie theater matinée on a weekend afternoon, and found it a pleasant escape and diversion. Your mileage may vary.<br/><br/>My feelings about ""Ghost Rider"" may be somewhat influenced by the fact that I remember the original comic from the 70's. It featured a cool character design, a moving (if vaguely ridiculous) origin story...and a monthly series that ranged somewhere between awful and mediocre. (Nothing against the series writers and artists who had to work against that era's soul killing production deadlines and editorial constraints). Later revivals of the title and the character improved greatly in production quality and the ambition of the stories, but GR was always really nothing more than a 3rd tier character who only real asset was his striking design. (Seriously - a guy with a flaming skull, leather jacket and chains and a motorcycle made of fire - you can't get much cooler than that.) <br/><br/>So I feel that, unlike ""Catwoman"", ""FF"", or ""Daredevil"", the movie adaptation of ""Ghost Rider"" was actually better in its conception and execution than the character enjoyed in the comics. It makes good use about what's most interesting and exciting about the character and tosses aside most of the dross that accumulated over 3 decades of well intentioned efforts to fill up pages and make money off the concept. The result is 90+ minutes of lightweight summer entertainment that works as long as you aren't feeling too harsh or critical. (Obviously, some of the reviewers here WERE feeling harsh and critical). <br/><br/>No, it's not a great movie. Nicolas Cage is pretty much operating on autopilot here and there are plot holes and inconsistencies you could drive a flaming motorcycle through. But the movie is fairly funny where it means to be funny - the audience I saw it with laughed at the one-liners and so did I. Best of all, the special effects are appropriate to the storyline; they are exciting and dynamic and provide most of the entertainment value. Especially good (and the real reason to see the movie) is the live depiction of GR himself, which is 100% more convincing and better integrated into the film than was the depiction of the Hulk several years back. For me, watching GR ride a flaming motorcycle down the side of a skyscraper was just plain fun. <br/><br/>I also thought that some of the supporting actors added a lot to the watch-ability of the film with spot on performances that suited the material perfectly. Especially good was the agent/friend ""Mack""; this actor was so good and so natural most people won't realize how good he really was. Also great was the actor who played Roxanne's driver; he handled several of the movie's lighter moments in a deft, pleasant way that significantly enhanced the scenes in which he appeared. Both these actors will probably go far in the next decade. Plus: Sam Elliot played Sam Elliot, as always, but I haven't ever tired of his macho cowboy schtick, and I probably won't.<br/><br/>For uncritical superhero devotees, people looking for brainless diversion and fans of Cage and /or Eva Mendes. (I personally can't see a reason for all the fuss about this actress, but she isn't bad at all.)"
"ArArArchStanton","6","1","2","5 May 2007"," Not perfect, but it wasn't supposed to be
","It's exactly what it needed to be. Marvel pumps out 3 movies a year. 2 big ones, and a third movie just to be there. Ghost rider was that 3rd film and in that respect it was good. Spidey and Fantastic 4 will presumably be movies you could rank at 8 or 9, which makes ghost riders score of 6 very appropriate. It' better than average but not spectacular. Check it out at the dollar theater. Buy it if you're collect comic films.<br/><br/>As for the movie itself, I felt the impersonation of Mephisto was good. He was demonic enough without being over the top. The 3 goons who are pawns of Blackheart wind up as lame challenges. None of them present much of a challenge to Ghost Rider."

Nic Cage had some small moments where his acting reminded me of the wickerman, but all in all he did a good job.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the movie, it was pretty fast paced, which kept me interested throughout, not really any boring moments. I saw what could have been a plot hole or two but honestly, it's just a comic book movie, I didn't expect it to be a masterpiece or anything. I enjoyed it and I think most of your average movie-goers liked it also for what it is.<br/><br/>This movie is more on par with Fantastic 4 and Blade:Trinity (the first 2 were fantastic though) than some of the other comic book based films, such as Batman begins, a great movie with dark elements I had expected to be in Ghost rider, which seemed a little bit toned down to me, one of my only complaints was the lack of ""disturbing"" elements.<br/><br/>So, if you have some free time on your hands and you want to be entertained for 2 hours, enjoy Ghost Rider if you haven't all ready seen it."
"chrichtonsworld","6","1","2","30 March 2007"," Average production for otherwise great comic book character
","""Ghost Rider"" has his moments but ultimately it lets down. It takes too long for Nicolas Cage to become Ghost Rider. It is when Ghost Rider appears the fun really begins. The action and special effects are quite average though if you compare it to other marvel based movies like ""Spiderman"" and ""X-men"". I did like the story but somehow wasn't dramatic enough! I mean the young Jonny Blaze makes a deal with the devil out of love for his father. But his father only is on screen for three minutes or so. They should have expanded on this relationship so that the audience would care more about them. The same goes for the love of Johnny Blaze for Eva Mendez's character. It just isn't deep enough. And what about his reaction to the death of his best friend, Mac. He calls out his name and that's it. No moment of grief whatsoever. I am suspecting that a lot of scenes were cut and that I will have to check out the extended cut to see if that will improve things. The ""Ghost Rider"" has always been an impressive and mysteriouscomic book character. In the movie this mystery is completely gone. I think that some comics should stay untouched because most of them don't translate that well to the movie screen. Since the sequel also has failed to bring us a good Ghost Rider film."

","Another in the long line of comic book superhero adaptations as this time motorcycle daredevil Nicolas Cage is recruited by Satan himself (Peter Fonda) to be a vigilante for the dark side. Irony plays a big part early on and then later Cage must fight to destroy Lucifer's power-hungry son (Wes Bentley). Sam Elliott is under-used as a mysterious grave-digger and Eva Mendes is also seen as Cage's love interest. Would-be remarkable special effects are no match for the film's lack of tone and flow. Cage seems like he is just going through the motions and the screenplay is pretty weak, even if the inspiration was a comic book series. Too long and too pointless to really do much more than make the most minute cinematic impression on its audience. 2.5 out of 5 stars."

So, I would recommend it for those who like fantasy and wish to pass some time in a somewhat enjoyable movie that is simply entertainment.<br/><br/>As far as the movie being great, however, that is quite another question. The script writing seems one dimensional and contains too many past clichés to have any real depth. Therefore, do not look for any true depth in character portrayal or in the plot itself. It just isn't there.<br/><br/>Movies that also dealt with fantasy but which had a much better script and therefore depth of plot and character I would say include Spiderman and Hell Boy.

So is it the studio who actually sacrifices the story for more special effects? <br/><br/>***Spoilers are contained from here on...***<br/><br/>This movie of Ghost Rider remains relatively true to the Original 1970's horror/hero comic story with some 1990's touches. From the moment the movie opened in the Old West with Sam Elliot's narration I knew it was going to follow the classic story; ""hammy dialogue"" included. Nearly all the classic images from the comic were found somewhere in the film. The best imagery (in my opinion) however, was Ghost Rider (Blaze) and Ghost Rider (Slade) A.K.A. Night Rider riding side by side with a thunderous instrumental rendition of ""Ghost Riders in the Sky"". The only *major* disappointment were the elementals... Hey, didn't we see these guys already in another film?

"frankwhat","7","1","2","24 February 2007"," ""Ghost Rider""  Blazes, But Not Nearly As Expected
","""Ghost Rider"" was never my favorite comic book series as a kid but I did enjoy it a lot and overall it was probably one of the better ones. However while the movie adaptation was decent it wasn't nearly as good. The biggest difference I noticed is they took a lot of the darker edge away from the story, which seemed to now cater to a much younger audience in obvious anticipation of boosting ticket sales. This'll undoubtedly work monetary wise but as far as quality is concerned it definitely took a hard blow.<br/><br/>The film itself is entertaining enough and is kind of cool considering how it blends a mix of genres such as fantasy and western. The acting was okay but some people were completely miscast and not just by how they appeared in the comics but also how they behaved. A grand lesson the filmmakers hopefully learned afterward is that dialog which works in print does not necessarily translate well to the big screen. Some of the one-liners were absolutely heinous and literally made me cringe each time I heard an utterance of either, ""youinnocent,"" or, ""youguilty."" Some raw nacho cheese quotes to say the least. The special effects are great, however somewhat overdone. It seems CGI was thrown into just about anything the editors could get their eager hands on and this added to the corny factor as well.<br/><br/>Nevertheless I still think Johnny Blaze is a neat character and contains a very alluring back-story. Not to sound trite myself but I really like how the allegory is based on solid morals and life lessons. The main plot is what sets this apart from a run-of-the-mill movie for me. That being how long should an individual have to pay for a stupid mistake? Surely it's not fair to have to suffer for the whole duration of one's life and that's what Mr. Blaze here discovers, that he can't be scared anymore and he must move onto learn from the past and fight the good fight.<br/><br/>I also can't help but complain about the soundtrack, as that was procured for the teenyboppers too. The one huge exception was when ""Crazy Train"" was blasting during a well-suited stunt that synchronized perfectly. That whole warm up and death defying leap will forever be ingrained in my unforgettable moments of cinema. On the other hand ghost rider's nemeses were wholly unimpressive. The biggest of all disappointments had to be the final fight since it led the viewer to believe there'd be this giant showdown between two titanswell let me just say this idea fizzled fast into one immense letdown instead.<br/><br/>The irony is that although this film is flawed beyond belief, it's enjoyable and worth watching as questionable as that sounds. My best prediction is that this'll be one of those installments where there'll be a much better sequel as the first in the series usually serves as the establishing point and has to contain the more obligatory conception sequences. True fans of the comic might be a little disappointed but it's by no means a complete catastrophe and any teenager will love it. It appears that ""Ghost Rider"" will be setting down the path of justice after all with this debut, but it might not be the right one just yet."

"DonFishies","7","1","2","22 February 2007"," Alright, but has many problems, especially with its humour
","Despite knowing very little other than the basic mythos, I was still rather hyped to see Ghost Rider. I was disappointed at first at the fact that its release date was pushed back from last summer until now, but figured there was a good reason for it. Unfortunately after seeing it, I think they should have held it off even longer.<br/><br/>As a child, Johnny Blaze does death-defying stunts on a motorbike alongside his father. When he receives word of his father having cancer, he makes a deal with the devil, Mephistopheles (Peter Fonda), to save his father's life. In exchange, he signs over his soul to him to do a job that will not be required until much later in life. Zap forward at least fifteen years, and Blaze (Nicolas Cage) is doing positively insane bike stunts and thrilling crowds all over the United States. At the same time, Blackheart (Wes Bentley) has arrived back on earth, looking for a long lost contract of souls. Only then is Johnny contacted by the devil again to stop him, and becomes the title character.<br/><br/>The movie itself is not all that bad. The storyline is pretty good, and stays consistent throughout despite the addition of a few subplots. Everything just practically flies by.<br/><br/>But that is what hurts the film a lot too.<br/><br/>The origin of Johnny Blaze is done very well, and quite speedily. He is introduced, signs the deal, and is an adult faster than you can say the devil's name. But after that, when it should begin to meander and slow down a bit, it just keeps up the pace and does not stop. Characters introduced part way through and should get more of a chance to do things are just held back, and random moments go on for longer than they should. It feels imbalanced in some sections, and feels undercooked in others. Battle scenes are especially hit, as they last varyingly between a few seconds and a few minutes. If you blink during some of them, you may miss them.<br/><br/>Which leads us to the next issue: it is too damn cheesy. I understand that comics are very tongue-in-cheek and heavily ironic/predictable. But the movie versions usually have some form of seriousness to them. Here, it is almost all laughable moments, and no sheer moments of seriousness. Just listening to Ghost Rider is like listening to a cheap comedian. A cheap comedian who looks bad ass of course. Lines like ""You're pissing me off,"" and ""Guilty,"" are just too funny for words. But they should not be. This comic book story is dark and morbid in its content, so why is that not reflected in the film? A lot less cheese and a lot more seriousness would have gone a long way.<br/><br/>The special effects are another iffy area. Ghost Rider himself looks great the majority of the time. His flaming skull head looks natural, and never looks pasted on in any instant. When he jumps on his bike and starts riding is when he looks particularly good, as it is evident that the filmmakers spent extra attention on getting these two details down pat, even during moments of fighting or driving. Clumsily however, when Blaze first transforms into the vigilante superhero, the effects look really terrible and really cheaply done. They still look decent, but in comparison to the easy transformations later on, they stand out as fairly bad.<br/><br/>The scene involving Ghost Rider and the helicopter has some of the worst effects I have seen in a recent film (although nowhere near as horrendous as the shoddily produced The Brothers Grimm). The deaths that Blackheart is responsible for look okay, but looks the last one he does looks rather obnoxiously edited in. When he and his cronies show off their powers, it looks a hell of a lot better, but nowhere near as powerfully and majestically created as Ghost Rider's.<br/><br/>Cage is alright as Blaze. He is very laid back, and acts up at the appropriate times. I think he tried a little too hard to be seen as being younger though, but he does manage to pull it off. His lack of melodramatics (like in the recent World Trade Center) also helps, as he stays grounded in the role, and does not make it out to be a complete joke. When he is Ghost Rider though, as said, it just does not totally work. Fonda and Sam Elliot who shows up off and on, are both on about the same page of being alright. They do an admirable job, but they just do not make the roles anything more than they already are. Bentley on the other hand, really does a good job as Blackheart. He plays him up and is great in this villainous role. If he was handed better dialogue, and had a few more scenes, he would have really become a force to be reckoned with.<br/><br/>Eva Mendes however, is very haphazard as Blaze's love interest Roxanne. She does nothing for the movie except for bringing an added hotness to it. Her dialogue exchanges with Cage are alright, but their chemistry is not all that great. She does not seem like she is all in it like the rest of the cast, and just feels like the weakest link (albeit a hell of a lot stronger than Ms. Katie ""Useless"" Holmes in Batman Begins). And despite how gorgeous she is, it really is awkward seeing every shirt (and dress) she wears undone right down to the exact same button, revealing the same amount of cleavage in every single scene.<br/><br/>On the whole, the film is just alright and nothing else. It could have used a lot more work than it got in that short period between last summer and now. As it stands, it just does not hold a candle to some of the better comic book films.<br/><br/>7/10."

I hope, all that said, when watching this, expect to be placed at the start of the ghost rider story, I know some have said that the film lacks with action, and is slow running, I wouldn't quite say that, there is a fair balance of story, and some great action to crank on the stereo. The storyline is only to properly introduce the origin of the ghost rider, not to bore, so lets hope I'm right and in the long run this is an important introduction piece to a trilogy or something, that would be awesome.

","I'd really just like to point out something from a prior User Comment. dee.reid referred to Spiderman as a mutant in the first sentence of his comment. A mutant is someone who is *born* with special abilities that are beyond that of any normal human. Spidey received his powers in an accident during a science demonstration, after being bit by a spider that was irradiated. He was not born with them.<br/><br/>As for Ghost Rider, the concensus holds true. Its not a film that should be taken for more than it is. Cool special fx, a good score, and genuinely funny moments (I loved what Ghost Rider did to the cops when he emerged from the water after jumping from the bridge. Never expected it!) left me satisfied. Im a superhero fan through and through, and I understand that studios have to please both die-hard fans and casual moviegoers. This film hits that mark. The only real sore point for me was Blackheart's dialogue, but I'll live. <br/><br/>Also, watch the ""GARAGE"" sign after he busts out of jail. Everyone I know that saw the film missed a little subliminal message thrown in."
"wfgwilliams","Null","1","2","19 February 2007"," Enjoyable, but it could have been better.
","I liked Ghost Rider. This was a competently made by the numbers action movie. It could have been much better, but what was on the screen was enjoyable.<br/><br/>For me, the antagonists, Mephistopheles, Blackheart and Blackheart's minions, did not come off as being as evil, menacing or scary as they could have been. This was probably because more reliance was put on the costumes, make up and CG for these characters than their acting skills.<br/><br/>The creative people on this certainly got the look and feel of the Ghost Rider and his flaming mount. Of all the menacing minions of Hell in this movie, the Ghost Rider, to me, was actually the scariest one. Nicolas Cage came very close to putting across the personal dilemma and conflict within this character. To me, he was a very inspired choice for this role.<br/><br/>Probably the most memorable part of the film came from one of the lesser characters. Rebel Wilson, the 'Girl in the Ally,' delivered an extremely comic news interview. A few more little touches like this one could have helped this film.<br/><br/>When I first saw the trailer for this film and saw Peter Fonda in it I thought that this was an appropriate choice using him because of Easy Rider and the other biker films he was in as well as films like Dirty Mary Crazy Larry and Race with the Devil.<br/><br/>So I thought cool, this film will also be an homage to many of the B biker movies. Alas this was not the case. I half expected to see Dennis Hopper in a cameo, and possible even a cameo from the American Chopper cast. Don't look for those people in the film because they aren't there.<br/><br/>Another disappointment was the introduction of the 'bad guys' in the biker bar. This was certainly creepy enough, but I found it to be on the static and flat side. It would have had more action if the 'bad guys' had hijacked a motorcycle club ride in progress on the road.<br/><br/>One other little detail that could have been used in this film was Nicolas Cage's Ghost Rider tattoo, which was covered up with makeup for this film. As tattoos are an integral part of biker culture I think it would have been appropriate for the devil to mark Johnny Blaze with the tattoo as a symbol of his ownership of him. That way the tattoo could have become a nice touch in the film. The tattoo could have also shown up as a scrimshaw etching on the bones of the Ghost Rider.<br/><br/>The movie was enjoyable, but I think that I won't be adding it to my DVD collection for some time after that gets issued."

","I'm a big Nicholas Cage fan, but i must say that at first i was a little bit bored.That's why i only gave the movie a 7. I must admit that The Rider is really cool.So if not for anything else go to the movie just to see what his powers and attitude are... Like said, the beginning is kinda slow but it really picks up towards the end.A little far-fetched, but i guess it has to be since it's not ""based on a true story"". If you're a Marvel fan and always wanted to be a super hero yourself, it's my opinion you won't be sorry you chose this movie.

"jiri_pro14","7","1","2","18 February 2007"," Ghost Rider; Nothing I'd see twice but definitely worth watching Once
","Let's just get one thing clear: Ghost Rider wasn't great but it wasn't terrible either. In the very least it was entertaining. Yes it doesn't compare to Spiderman or X-Men (The Punisher is the best one of them all) but its better than the likes of Daredevil, Hulk, etc. I think people were let down because like myself the trailer had them sold from day one and this release had been marked on my calender for months. As a result of being let down a lot of people are being pretty harsh. I'd recommend seeing this picture if you'd like to, just, be entertained for a few hours. If your looking to see the best action/comic picture ever made then your going to leave pretty unhappy. Nic Cage is one of the best, there's no denying that, I think he pulls off the Ghost Rider character well. For the males out there Eva Mendes is absolutely gorgeous and there's no denying that either. Her character was undeveloped but being just ""eye candy"" in this picture is a quite a stretch. A movie like this disappoints me in a lot of ways but in the end I didn't leave the theater like I did after watching Alexander a few years back. I was irate because the trailer made that one look like something great but it was the biggest waste of time and money that I've ever experienced in my life. Ghost Rider was nothing like that. Disappointed sure, irate no. Ultimately what needs to be said is that this film, at its worst, is an average picture. It's not some atrocity that some people are saying it is. Go see it and you'll most likely respond to it the way I did. Just give it a chance. You may love it, like it or hate it. Everybody's critique is unique. This was a vague representation of mine. <br/><br/>Oh yeah, I just wanted to say that Nicolas Cage had his finest performance in his finest film; The Family Man. I don't care what you guys say its the truth. Matchstick Men, Leaving Las Vegas and Family Man, all great movies."

I'm only a kid but i like the comics I've already beaten the game and i agree with Nicolas cage enough with the tights and capes. Ghost Rider looks awesome, a skull on fire, a leather jacket with spikes on it, a crazy insanely cool looking motorcycle, a shotgun and a chain thats on fire!

","Coming from a Ghost Rider fan (since the age of like 8-9) I was hoping this film would do it justice and that it would be great... But I was wrong while the majority of it was decent at best there were some really cool scenes as well.<br/><br/><ul><li>When he changed into the Rider for the first time. - Pretty much every scene when he's on the motorcycle as the Rider. - Blackheart's scenes</li></ul><br/><br/>But that's really about it, There were ton's of unnecessary comedic scenes, it was way to cheesy to be a G-Rider film, and the fact that Blackheart didn't show his true form really got me angry but I did love the actor that portrayed Blacheart himself.<br/><br/>When I think of Ghost Rider I think of dark, mysterious, and horrific and that's what It should have been (there were some horrific parts but nothing compared to what It should have been) and it should have been a lot more serious/adult like in my opinion as well.<br/><br/>My gut feeling tell's me that Mark Steven Johnson got screwed over again! (same thing happened with Daredevil) All I can do is hope that G-Rider get's a Director's Cut DVD release in the same form as DD which made that film my top superhero film ever after seeing the DC version, here's to hoping the same thing happens with G-Rider.<br/><br/>Overall 6.5/10"
"gregsrants","5","1","2","17 February 2007"," Average Comic Book Adaptation
","Fantastic Four. X-Men. Spider-Man. Superman. Daredevil. Batman. Hellboy. The Hulk.<br/><br/>The past few years Hollywood has dipped their money grabbing hands into the comic book hero cookie jar and have pulled out pure chocolate chip glory. From the more popular and well known characters such as Spider-Man to the obscure independent titles like Constantine and Spawn, it seems like every month a new title is being released to the masses. And due to the built-in audience these characters bring with them like traveling luggage, it almost guarantees the studio a strong opening week-end no matter how good or inferior the product.<br/><br/>This month's release is Marvel Comic's Ghost Rider which stars Academy Award winner Nicolas Cage as the Johnny Blaze by day  Ghost Rider by night crime fighter.<br/><br/>Ghost Rider might be a little more obscure for the casual comic book character fan so let me get you caught up to speed on the skeletal hot-head.<br/><br/>Johnny Blaze was a young hot shot motorcycle stunt man with his father when he makes a deal to sell his soul to the devil, Mephistopheles (played in the film by Peter Fonda) in an effort to save his fathers life. Johnny later finds that the deal has more side effects than prescription medicine for hair loss. For ""in the darkness, in the presence of evil, the Rider takes over"", transforming Blaze into a skeletal beast with bones and skull afire that rides a hell bent pimped out motorcycle that would give the guys on American Chopper an erection.<br/><br/>The evil villain in the film is none other than Blackheart (Wes Bentley), son of Mephistopheles, who looks to overpower his father and turn our world into a hell on earth. Think of it as if someone from Hell was a designer on Trading Spaces.<br/><br/>In an effort to bring his bleak and death sucking vision to us unassuming humans, Blackheart solicits the aide of three interesting but otherwise useless supernatural beings representing the elements of earth, wind and fire (Great! Now I can't get Let's Groove outta me head!).<br/><br/>Of course, complicating matters is Blaze's old flame Roxanne Simpson (Eva Mendes). Simpson is now a local reporter and she and her cleavage (which I might add should have their own listing in the credits as they transfixed my eyes more than any of the characters that graced the films running time) just happen to be executing a bit on Johnny Blaze when things start to go the way of Hades. As this is a comic book movie, there is no doubt that Roxanne will be used against our flaming skull hero in some manner before the story comes to a close and director Mark Steven Johnson who went from Simon Birch to Daredevil and now Ghost Rider, does nothing to deviate from this formulaic plan.<br/><br/>When the sum of all its parts are calculated and reviewed, Ghost Rider barely gets by with a recommendation. Maybe if the film was pre-Spider-man and X-Men, the film might have been more interesting and inventive, but with such a paved path already laid, Ghost Rider feels like you are walking barefoot on cobblestone.<br/><br/>One of the main successes of any superhero fantasy comes in the form of the villains and it is with these characters that Ghost Rider falls short. Don't get me wrong, the villains are all fascinating and some might even argue terrifying, but they are beat so easily by the Ghost Rider that you don't get a chance to even recognize their powers before they are sent back to wherever it is these beings go after being defeated. I don't think they collectively had a page of lined script before each one is individually eliminated.<br/><br/>That leaves the Blackheart character that is the least interesting and terrifying of the bunch. Wes Bentely looked more like some kind of character from a Dawn of the Dead Saturday Night Live sketch than he did a menacing Lord of the Underworld.<br/><br/>Ghost Rider did have its good points though. Some of the special effects were well done (I do mean 'some' as others seemed too cheesy to be enjoyed) and the camp is played out like Snakes on a Plane from last year where the dialogue and situations are so-bad-its-good.<br/><br/>Nicolas Cage  who was such a huge fan of the comic that he got a Ghost Rider tattoo years before even being considered for the role  looks as if he is having as much fun as a root canal recipient in the lead role. Maybe he should have taken a lesson from Halle Berry who is another Oscar winning actor that looked embarrassed when donning the leather tights for the Superhero film Catwoman.<br/><br/>This leaves Ghost Rider in the middle of the pack when it comes to overall product from a comic book character film production. It is certainly higher than The Punisher and Elektra, but a far cry from the superior X-Men and Spider-Man franchises.<br/><br/>www.robertsreviews.com"

","I was surprised that my favourite comic book hero would be put out on the big screen as it is not one of the main comic icons like Superman, Batman, X-men, Spiderman, Hulk, Captain America, Fantastic 4, The Punisher, The Avengers, Iron Man... so I was excited. I enjoyed Daredevil but just couldn't bare Elektra so there would be a 50% chance Ghost Rider could be good or bad. I went in expecting the a sub-par comic-to-film movie but I was really entertained at how the writers put together the elements of the 2 Ghost Riders from the comic series (though I still would prefer they focus only the newer Rider :). The comics had 2 heroes Johnny Blaze (in 70's & 80's) & Dan Ketch (90's) btw, fyi Johnny Blaze is supposed to have reddish blonde hair. <br/><br/>Anyhow the script did extremely well introducing the characters, their backgrounds & the concept of 'the rider'. Sam Elliot & Nic Cage did really well in carrying the flow of the movie as well immersing us into the films perception of the earth & hell realms. I can't say that much for Eva. Nic Cage has a great talent to really bring out the 'tormented good guy' hero characters like in his previous movies Matchstick Men, Weather Man, 8mm, Face Off, Con-Air, The Rock & It Could Happen to U.<br/><br/>As a fan of the 90's comics, I wasn't all to happy about the films customizing of Ghost Rider elements but I guess it would be more appealing that way. The film, from the new millennium point of view, is an overall good 'comic-to-big screen' package . They really thought it out well laid a good foundation for the 'world of the Ghost Rider' in comparison to like say 'the world of Constantine'. Who is the Rider? What is the Rider? What does the Rider do? Who is Blackheart? Who is the Devil? Whats their relationship? I couldn't accept the movie version of the 'hell-cycle'though. Its too H.R. Geiger for my taste & that throws the concept off a little.<br/><br/>For an additional treat for those of u who enjoyed the movie, try getting your hands on the Ghost Rider comics of the 90's like issues #1 - #50... u'll find many classic elements there like favourite phrases (when innocent blood is spilt.., in the presence of evil, I'm the Spirit of Vengeance), characters (like Johnny Blaze, Vengeance, The Punisher, Black Heart), famous moves (Chain fling, penance stare). I find these comic elements portrayed very well in the movie, true to the intensity of the comics... but with a small except for the level of violence. PG 13 rite? :) I can already smell the sequel in the making<br/><br/>Thanks for reading"

The reason is that I shelled out money to watch a really bad episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. From start to end, the movie is plagued with cheesy makeup which is briefly interrupted by some cheesy dialogs. The acting in the movie is nothing above C grade, with everyone putting in their bit of constipated script reading and cliché muttering. The only promising thing about this movie is that it ends.... eventually! Avoid this 'Direct to video' title that accidentally landed up on the big screen."

Throughout the whole film he never gave me a reason to think he was Johnny Blaze, the ghost rider. Even Matt Long who is the young version of Johnny Blaze did an academy worth performance compared to Cage. Eva Mendes is horrible as well, delivering the same crap Nicholas Cage does. Now other than bad acting, this movie was completely predictable, you can tell what is going to happen each moment that it makes Miss Cleo seem psychic again.

","GHOST RIDER is an adaptation of the Marvel comics series of the same title. Since I grew up with comic books, I am a big fan of comic book movies. And of course, I was excited to see the GHOST RIDER movie adaptation. Sure, I lowered down my expectations because the storyline of ""Ghost Rider"" has been used and overused in numerous films with vaguely similar story lines. I expected for it to be a movie loved with the highest tolerance to criticism. But a disappointing film is a disappointing film. And if it has too little redeeming factors, then there's no reason not to talk about it.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, GHOST RIDER would not necessarily make you feel like you're throwing away your money on crap. GHOST RIDER has its moments of utter coolness. The fiery transformations with Gothic angelic chorals on the background, the bits of humor, that hellishly radical bike he rides. I would not have even cared if the storyline would be considered over-used & cliché, because I already did expect that. But just the overall delivery of the movie itself was purely bland. The movie was fun but disappointing.<br/><br/>It's no surprise, this film was directed by Mark Steven Johnson, the same guy who directed the Daredevil movie, which also could be considered a failure. well, I guess that's STRIKE TWO! & I don't want to see him directing a superhero/comicbook adaptation movie again. I can appreciate Daredevil with the highest tolerance, and would admit to liking it a little. But it still goes out the same that it was crap, & badly needed to fall on a new director.<br/><br/>There was no question of the choices for Nicholas Cage to be Johnny Blaze, Peter Fonda to be Mephistopheles, and Eva Mendes to be Roxanne Simpson. They are all superior performers, and very fitting for their roles at that. But the script never seemed to work well with the direction of the film. Many of the lines looked cheesy, mostly due to the editing which had bad timing and monotony of angles, so much so that Nicholas Cage's supposedly memorable lines end up looking like scenes from a bad B-movie. Same with Peter Fonda, who by the scarcity of film projects made him look like a struggling has-been in this movie. There were moments when Eva Mendes was comedically adorable. But her charm (that usually leaves me lovesick) could not save her from ending up looking like a cheap ""face"" in a sad project. At least Wes Bentley was spunky for the role. But his entire look for the film did not carry on a sense of overwhelmingly cool villain. His costume looked like he was spoofing each and every cliché from each and every badly-made superhero and vampire movie. His hair & make-up looked more metrosexual than demon, he could not intimidate me and I swear I could easily ward him off with smelly feet and a bad fashion sense.<br/><br/>The fight scenes were pathetic. Sure, the ""minion"" villains known as The Hidden were cool. But the fighting scenes with them did not excite me. In action movies, nothing's new these days when it comes to fight scenes. But one should at least make it either interesting or at least sensible for the audiences to get a sense of response. Many of the fight scenes in this movie makes you end up mumbling ""Huh?"" or ""What?!"" It's as if some characters were too dumb to stand and wait for a punch to hit them. Giving it credit, the film does make the effort to breakthrough with some kind of originality (with scenes like how he beat his enemy made out of the wind), the problem is, they don't really convince me, as far as I'm concerned anyway.<br/><br/>CGI or Computer animation is this movie's main Ace card. The thing which it heavily relies to. But one should not really be strict in CGI judgment because in the long run, this technology will get old. It is actually how a film uses its technology to create a good movie. Ghost Rider may have fabulous CGI, but there isn't too much innovative and impressive scenes for it to be a step ahead of the usual eye candy.<br/><br/>I cannot deny that there were moments when this movie made me laugh and cheer. But overall, it was a failure, that will stand aside other disappointing classics such as Blade Trinity, Daredevil, and a bit better than that awful Spawn movie adaptation. Oh well, I hope a sequel with a new director could redeem it."

","Wow. I wanted so desperately to like this film. I thought 'Daredevil' was a fun, action-filled movie and given that Mark Steven Johnson also directed this I had faith that all of the negative buzz was not true. I was wrong.<br/><br/>I'm not exaggerating when I say that 99% of everything in this movie was absolutely terrible. Completely awful. The acting is so tremendously bad that it is a wonder how the auditions for this movie went, if they ever happened at all. Eva Mendes, while nice eye candy, is not an actress in any sense of the word. There is no life behind ANYTHING that she says. The kid who plays Blackheart is so unbelievably over the top that every time he appears on screen gives the audience a reason to laugh. Nicholas Cage is, well...Nicholas Cage. 'Nuff said.<br/><br/>The ONLY redeeming part of this movie is the performance of Sam Elliot who is wonderful in everything that he does. He must have gotten a different script than everyone else. Speaking of which, the dialogue in this movie is the most drab, lifeless, second-rate fare that most youth theatre performances could put it to shame.<br/><br/>I'm sorry, but did anyone put forth some semblance of soul into Ghost Rider? The special effects were passable. But even if they were awesome, it would not have mattered. This is a blot on the history of comic book movies. I've never read the comics, but I'm certain that anyone who has would find this film to be about as faithful as Brad Pitt was to Jennifer Aniston.<br/><br/>I can only think of one really good word to sum up 'Ghost Rider' : WASTE."

This is just another one of those really cool Special Effects movies with a fickle plot, was poorly directed and weak had a screenplay. It seems like that's all we get now a days. Hollywood if you're listening We're more intelligent than this, at least some of us.<br/><br/>I will say that this movie may appeal to teens and some who live on the edge of society due to it's evil spiritual content but, since it's all so surface, to the enlightened it is downright silly and bordering on offensive."

","Ghost Rider has split reception amongst fans. Some like it and some hate it. As you may already know, I don't like this film. First of all, Nicholas Cage. Why? Nicholas Cage can be a good actor (The Rock) but also a bad actor (The Wicker Man). For this film, he tends to be not an entirely bad actor. He gives an over the top performance but for this film, I do not think that Nicholas Cage was a good choice. The acting in general is mediocre to bad. The dialogue is boring and dull and just awful. The story of this film follows Johnny Blaze who sold his soul to the devil and is forced to bring souls to hell. Simple enough, but the execution is awful because of the bad acting and dialogue. Granted, Ghost Rider himself is super badass. The best parts of the film is where Ghost Rider is kicking butt. But, the CG is bad. But don't worry, the CG in my opinion is better in the second film. With all that being said, Ghost Rider is a bad film based on a badass character. You will find yourself skipping through most of the film to see only the action scenes."

","Here is the deal. Johnny Blaze was possessed by an evil and dangerous entity called Zarathos who was a fundamentally evil being. What good he did was due to the constant inner struggle with Johnny Blaze, who was a very good man.<br/><br/>Dan Ketch was a kid from Brooklyn what was possessed by the Spirit of Vengeance, who was fundamentally a good spirit. And though they both struggled for control, the entity and its host trusted one another and worked together.<br/><br/>What this movie does is tries to mesh Blaze and Ketch and the spirits that possess them together...and it doesn't work.<br/><br/>The amalgamation robs the story of the intense inner turmoil and the fight between Blaze and the evil entity possessing him...that was a very good, very fun, very intense story that this film NEVER tells.<br/><br/>And Dan Ketch, the story wasn't as interesting, but it was still good focused more on the community, the town, the family life and the stress that the entity caused in the hosts personal life...it was still a very good story, it was still very fun, and it was, again, NEVER told here.<br/><br/>By trying to push the two of them together--including the supporting cast--the movie loses the stories from BOTH of them. What you get instead is. vapidity, and all the CGI in the world can't save a movie with no story.<br/><br/>There was no direction. There was no grand scheme. There were no real characters. It tried to be two different things at the exact same time and, because of that, didn't tell a story.<br/><br/>It ended up being special effects without a story and nothing more.<br/><br/>Had it chosen a direction, either direction, even an entirely new direction, the movie could have told a story.

Too earnest, he over acts a little too much, he tries to make the tortured Johnny Blaze a little too light and likable, but that could just be because they couldn't decide which Ghost Rider they were depicting.<br/><br/>Sure, it was fun watching his fiery alter-ego ride around dispensing vengeance, but in the end, at the final stand-off, we got something rushed and under-cooked.<br/><br/>You sit down for a movie, and even on a mindless popcorn crunching level, you leave disappointed.<br/><br/>They just can't force an audience to care at all about this Ghost Rider or his human host."

So where is the point in saying ""this is a great movie, because i didn't expect much, and i didn't get much so its perfect!"" thats nonsense.<br/><br/>Okay. Cut to the chase. The plot itself 5/10. Not as good as spiderman or x-men. The acting 7/10 When the actors get a chance to act, they do a reasonable job. characters 3/10 very very poor character work on this movie. Action scenes 5/10 (and this 5 is compared to ALL MOVIES. It is not compared to ACTION MOVIES, then it would be 2/10) And that is the bigges flaw of the movie. The Action or fight sequences are just boring. Spiderman doesn't really have a great plot, but the fight scenes are pretty awesome.<br/><br/>One last thing i would like to add. some people say its based on a comic book so we cant expect more. What do you think is Batman? The Dark Knight? Ghost Rider seems like an amateur movie compared to the Dark Knight.<br/><br/>If you can see the movie for free, like on television. Why not.

","Not having a clue as to what this picture was about, and having caught it a few moments after the opening, we thought immediately about a comic book story, something which eventually is revealed in the closing credits. ""Ghost Rider"" is about one of the least involving sagas in which Nicolas Cage has been cast as the hero.<br/><br/>Directed by Mark Steven Johnson, and based on his own screenplay, the film makes no sense. The main idea revolves around the eternal theme of how a man can sell his own soul to the devil because the asking person wants to gain something he doesn't have, or in this case because Johnny Blaze, who knows about his father's cancer, wants to save the old man. Unfortunately, for the production team, better made movies have been made using this idea.<br/><br/>In order to sell it to a wide audience, Mr. Johnson and his collaborators haver resorted to special effects big time. Otherwise they had no movie at all. One wonders how much went into the making of this epic that shows little in the way of a plausible story to fill its almost two hours running time. This picture will be championed by those fans that rely on the visuals in order to anything to be deemed good.<br/><br/>Nicolas Cage, who plays Johnny Blaze, is shown with a strange makeup and is always surrounded by fire. Eva Mendez has nothing to do as the love interest of Johnny. Matt Long is good in the earlier scenes. Veterans Sam Elliott and Peter Fonda are also on hand, but they are bogged down by the screenplay that make their characters pointless."

","Not only was this a terrible adaptation of a powerful comic series, it was most definitely one of the worst films I have ever seen. PERIOD. Now I'm not a big Nick Cage fan as is... he is one of the most monotonous, untalented actors in the business (and for the life of me, I have no idea how he's being approached for movies such as Knowing and Bangkok Dangerous... how he mangles my eyes and ears again and again...).<br/><br/>Aside from his putrid acting, the whole script, design and direction was completely shameful, not just to the original story, but to everybody who actually paid for such entertain-less torture. First of all, the massive lack of creativity and choreography was apparent in every single second I forced myself to continue, bleeding out hope like an oil spill in the ocean. Even the elementals in the film were nothing more than distractions, and although Ghost Rider has more than enough ability to handle them (even if easily), they used repetitive actions and the simplest of solutions that a teenager could have thought above and beyond. Some of the imagery was decent... they did a good job with the bike and outfit of the Ghost Rider (even if their ""johnny blaze"" was a complete oaf), but I'm sick of Hollywood feeling like they need to put a more 'human' approach to the villains. I mean... Blackheart? Are you F-ing kidding me? Anybody who's read the series or played Marvel vs. Capcom would know Blackheart was a shadow-like creature standing well over 7 feet or so. Seriously, their version of his devil-form was just another average and overused attempt to show evil through poorly made horror tactics (flashing lights, appearance flickering between human and evil, etc.). Those type of demons that they portrayed in him should have been all over the place! As much as I enjoy seeing a sexy woman such as Eva Mendes, its just a terrible ploy to attract meat-heads that will waste money just to see a pretty face. Even Spider-Man (which I despise as well... wont go there) carried a more true portrayal of the difficulty of desires versus responsibility.<br/><br/>I wish beyond belief that I could give everybody who made that movie and thought it decent in ANY way a piece of my mind... if not the whole thing. For Cage to remark it could use original characters..?! F*** YOU CAGE! You had great characters and mutilated them viciously! They became original at that moment, and that failed terribly. I cant even fathom my rage and disgust that a sequel is even possible... and that the same doofus' are running things. Actually makes Disney taking over look half-way decent. Being a devote fan, I try to do my best to honor the attempts that failed to reach adapted beauty (Fantastic 4, Elektra, X-3) but I would rather injest poison than watch such a crude slap in the face that this movie is."

","Of course my expectations for this movie weren't too high but I figured that there would be no way the movie would be as bad as the critics made it sound it was. Well let me tell you that ""Ghost Rider"" is just as bad as everyone makes it out to be.<br/><br/>The main story had me confused at first and it was hard to figure out who all these characters were. At first I seriously thought that the Blackheart character was a young Johnny Blaze and the scenes involving him were flashbacks of what happened when Johnny had just sold his soul to the devil. Yeah, call me stupid but it wasn't until when Blackheart and Johnny Blaze were for the first time in a sequence together that I realized they were completely different characters. But also when things were 'clear' to me the story remained bad. The story is totally not engaging and it lacked some fundamental things such as a strong good and interesting superhero villain and other characters. Some of the characters that get introduced in the movie suddenly disappear out of the movie, despite showing some potential. Nevertheless ""Ghost Rider"" manages to still put in all of the other clichés you could expect from a 'superhero' movie, based on a comic book character. It's really a shallow movie to watch, that offers nothing new to the genre and on top of that is made with less quality and style than other recent and more successful attempts.<br/><br/>The special effects weren't much good. Well, perhaps the special effects are not that bad but they just got overused so much in so many different sequences, often leaving nothing more but a pointless impression, plus the fact that the CGI look for the Ghost Rider was just rather fake looking at times. It at least didn't met up with the usual 2007 standards.<br/><br/>It's not that I'm a Nicolas Cage hater but he just wasn't good for the role. Also the entire love story between him and the Eva Mendes character is hardly convincing and really doesn't work out also due to the lack of chemistry. The movie further more also features movie veterans Peter Fonda and Sam Elliott. Most of the other actors don't really know to impress in the movie though.<br/><br/>Despite that the movie featured lots of pace and action, the movie still feels like a real lackluster. It lacks one big good fight and instead features little action bits all the time, which are only leaving you hungry for more instead.<br/><br/>With a different director and certainly a better script, the Ghost Rider character and franchise still show potential. Let's hope that those involved shall realize this as well and ""Ghost Rider 2"", which is currently in its early production stages, will be a more interesting and better movie to watch, or at least more entertaining.<br/><br/>4/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

The fire, the action, the violence, the spirits, everything. The effects and cgi were good in ""Iron Man"", but effects and cgi don't make a movie. I know that's my third mention of ""Iron Man"", but I just can't stand how everyone thinks that is such an awesome movie. It was mediocre and overrated and nothing more.<br/><br/>3) It was consistently funny and good-humored. Let's face it, every superhero movie has to have at least a little bit of humor in it.<br/><br/>4) It had a good storyline, too.

","How could a film starring Nicholas Cage, Sam Elliot and Peter Fonda be bad? Lets ask Mark Steve Johnson, the director of this lacklustre cheeseball of a movie. Okay, hes a newcomer to the directing game, but that doesn't excuse how this movie turned out.<br/><br/>I'm not familiar with the ""Ghost Rider"" comic, but this film has done nothing to spur me into getting my hands on a copy. If you were to cross the average episode of Angel or Buffy, with Torque, then the result would be something like this. So if your no fan of those sources than I would not recommend watching this. The lines are so painfully tired and stale your left wondering whether its meant to be an all out spoof. It just seems to move from one embarrassing example of dialogue gone wrong to the next, interlaced with flashy, slow-mo action scenes, which maybe the only thing that stopped me from turning it off.<br/><br/>As for the performances; it would be fair to say that this movie would come very near the bottom of the resume for most of the main cast. Cage at least puts a little effort in, but is really pushing it for a man of his age to star in a film like this, I mean ""The Rock"" was over 10 years ago! His fancy wig and semi naked flexing in the mirror fail to impress. Peter Fonda puts on a grim face as the Devil, but...isn't the Devil supposed to be scary? As for Wes Bentley, the strange kid from 'American Beauty', couldn't they have found someone more sinister looking to play Blackheart? A little make-up and dark clothing doesn't really suffice.<br/><br/>If your a special effects hound, then you may get a buzz out of this. If your a fan of cinema, then I recommend you prepare for a disappointment (if you feel the need to watch it). The director seems to think that by throwing fancy special effects, rip offs of better movies and cleavage into a stirring pot, the audience will fail to notice how lazy the film-making is."

I like Nic Cage, he has the ""melancoly"" of Johnny Blaze, he just couldn't fully pull it off --- and some of that is not his fault, but the fault of the script. The Roxanne storyline, fell flat for me as well as Blackheart's did. Every time Blackheart and his minions were on screen, I thought of the TV series ""Buffy..."" and they did it better.<br/><br/>It's sad that this version of Ghost Rider came out the way it did, the story has such potential but I gave it a middle of the road score for the nice graphics of the Ghost Rider and the potential of something better up the road."

","The recent spurt of comic-book adaptations about superheroes have been extremely variable: some – like the “Spider-Man” and “X-Men” films – were pretty good but, then, HULK (2003) proved a major disappointment; others still, like DAREDEVIL (2003) and the “Fantastic Four” series (just yesterday I checked out the second instalment!), were enjoyable but essentially bland. About the worst of them has been THE PUNISHER (2004) – but now I can add GHOST RIDER to that unenviable list; this is one lame movie (made by the director of DAREDEVIL) which, for all its CGI effects and name actors, really comes off like a cheap 80s ‘indie’ horror flick! The would-be Faustian plot is ludicrous to begin with, but the vacuous presence of the perennially grimacing Nicolas Cage (an actor I can’t stand) renders it even less interesting (bungling even the potentially cool “Ghost Rider” persona); ditto, the motorcycle stunts (it doesn’t help that I’m the antithesis of a sports enthusiast!). Besides, the hesitant love story doesn’t have the effect that it ought to – while the obnoxious gang of ‘hellish’ villains provide the final death-knell to the film! At least, Peter Fonda (teetering on the brink of camp) and Sam Elliott – both of whom, appropriately but perhaps unintentionally, seem to have strayed in from another era! – have fun with their roles of Mephistopheles and Cage’s predecessor as “Ghost Rider” respectively..."

","I watched this with some hopes of it being a great movie... my mistake. The movie starts out with some history of how the rider becomes a ghost rider. That's all well and good, but there was too much history. In my opinion much of it could have been cut out. On top of that I felt absolutely no connection between the actors. I was hoping for Cage to show up asap. He didn't - not his fault.<br/><br/>Nicholas Cage saved the movie. It would have been a B rated flick at best without the monumental ability for Cage to fill the entire big screen and carry the entire script. NOTE: I didn't say ""carry the entire cast"" b/c Peter Fonda, Sam Elliott, Brett Cullen and Donal Logue all did fantastic jobs in their respective roles. They just weren't melded together well.<br/><br/>Wes Bentley, as Blackheart, seemed at home in this role. But I was glad that he wore a scarf to cover his chest - if the chest was open then the entire movie would have seemed cheap. Matt Long only has talent for soap operas. (Then again Jack Nicholson was the worst actor ever when he started out, so ...)<br/><br/>Eva Mendes totally belongs on a romantic comedy set. The little snippets where she gets to perform a bit of comedy made me ""fall in love with her."" She pwns romantic comedy. NOTE: Raquel Alessi is not related to her in any way - other than she looks like Eva's sister! I thought she loved Johnny more than her older character played by Eva.<br/><br/>The cgi of the skull on Cage's shoulders was well done when he spoke, but it looked awkward in place. However, the flames were awesome.<br/><br/>Overall I only give the movie a 7 out of 10.<br/><br/>-LD<br/><br/>____________________________________________<br/><br/>my faith: http://ww.angelfire.com/ny5/jbc33/<br/><br/>PS: I rented the DVD from NETFLIX and got to listen to the producer's (Gary Foster) commentary.

","Overall, I like the movie. It appears very tough to make a great comic book superhero action movie. It was 22 plus years between Superman 2 and Spiderman, so you know it isn't easy. Tim Burton's Batman and Batman Returns were really, really close to being great. X-Men was just below those. I would ranked this one just above Daredevil and Elektra, although it is hard to resist Jennifer Garner in red.<br/><br/>It was OK. Not the best, but I like Nick Cage and Eva Mendes, although maybe not together. Their chemistry lacked. I blame writers, directors, Cage or story lines, because Eva has a smile that melts steel. The other actors were very good. Peter Fonda as the Devil and Brett Cullen as Johnny Blaze's father were excellent. The other bads were effectively bad and creepy. Sam Elliot was excellent as always, but the part they wrote for him could have been better. Donal Logue and the crew should have been used to help us care a little more for Cage's character.<br/><br/>My kids got me the extended video. It was much creepier than I thought it would be, which is good, unless young kids are watching. I think they did the whole skull on fire thing as best as they could. You can't give a straight skull much expression without animating the eyes, brows and cheeks. And because of that, the body with the skull attached to it seemed a lot like a Scooby Doo villain, which became more acceptable as time went one or I imagine you hated the movie.<br/><br/>Overall, I liked it. The action was cheesy fun, acting was fine, the bad guys sufficiently creepy and it appeared to follow the Ghost Rider legend."
"powerfull_jedi","6","1","3","8 April 2007"," Ghost Rider looks cool and menacing, but when he starts talking...
","First off I'll make this clear: This superhero movie is better then Catwoman, Elektra, Fantastic Four and Blade 3, but it's nowhere near the same quality of an X-men or a Spiderman movie. But don't take this as a great compliment. Nicolas Cage, here, finally get to play a superhero, years after he was in talks for the role of Superman, one could only wonder why did he decided to pick Marvel's B-list Superhero(Ghost Rider could be considered the equivalent as Blue Beetle, Animal Man or Booster Gold) over the main DC Comics superhero, but after seeing this movie I don't know if he has what it takes to be a superhero at all. Anyway, here's the story, young Johnny Blaze signs a deal with a demon who saves his father from dying from cancer, but as a price he become the demon's right hand man turning him into a Ghost Rider. Now as an adult and as a champion daredevil he is given the task of stopping the demon's son and his elemental henchmen from obtaining a scroll with the souls of a small town who hold great power for anyone who chooses to collect them, Blaze not only has to deal with them but he also has to deal with an old girlfriend from his past. Ghost Rider seems to also focus on some aspects of Texan culture, such as country music, stunt shows and bikers(heck even one of the former Ghost Riders sounds just like Johnny Cash). Ghost Rider's a fun movie, the special effects are nice to look(save some parts where it's obviously CG) and has an OK soundtrack, but the real problem is, sadly the plot, the characters and the dialog which turn the whole movie into a cartoon. They did a great job in making the Ghost Rider menacing and cool at the same time, but when he opens his mouth and starts talking, yikes. Nicolas Cage feels out of place in this movie, but at least he does a better job of playing a Texan then an Ukrainian gun smuggler from Lord of War, his dialog is cringe-worthy, but the Ghost Rider's comments sound like bad puns(think Tennage Mutant Ninja Turtles 3: Turtles in Time, watch Angry Movie Nerd's review of it on Youtube, if you don't remember),then it suddenly feels like you're watching a G-rated cartoon despite the fact that this movie does contain some frightening images. Eva Mende's character plays the most understanding(and tolerant) girlfriend I've ever seen and you'll probably forget the villains as soon as the movie's over. Also, don't think too much of the plot, because some things will be immediately obvious to the viewers(the other Ghost Rider) and it's good enough for 100 minutes or so. Bottom line is: If you have some time to kill or a fan of Ghost Rider, but in all you want some fun and easy-going superhero action, check it out. But if you're looking for a superhero movie in the same league as Batman Begins, Spiderman 2, X-men 2 or Richard Donner's Superman, wait for the DVD or go see it in a discount theater."

It goes from bad to worse a lot more often than it rises to anything like good, so don't envision riding on a roller-coaster that has any real high points.<br/><br/>When Walt Disney's animators were just learning their trade, working out the kinks 60 or 70 years ago and more, they were doing a better job than the people who superimposed those demonic faces on the faces of the actors in this movie. Where was the director, or any decision maker, to say, ""That looks amateurish, if you can't do it better we'll get somebody who can.""? So once you've been subjected to that clownishness, the fire effects just don't dazzle. They probably would, they're pretty good, in a better made film, but here they're dragged down to ordinariness by the rest of the production.<br/><br/>The story was so laughable, and a lot of the acting, too, that I finally started to realize this was supposed to be high camp (or low camp) like the old Get Smart TV show or the Naked Gun movies. But then, no, it turned out they were really trying to make a movie. It was just bad. And then they inserted scenes that dragged along agonizingly, at which point our roller-coaster descended to lows that were actually below ground and rolled up out of them so slowly you thought it'd never, ever make it, ever.<br/><br/>There were some lovely turns by Peter Fonda, Sam Elliott and Donal Logue, although the director suppressed their performances like a novice throwing his weight around. If he'd let these fine actors put a little something into their scenes it would have been an enormous improvement.<br/><br/>It seemed like nobody who had to scream in agony (there's plenty of that) knew how and there were no acting coaches available. The screams and the faces the actors made were laughable and were part of the reason I thought the whole thing was a put-on for a while.<br/><br/>It's just a comic book adaptation. I know. But Aeon Flux and even Elektra were done with so much style and imagination. Couldn't these people have tapped into at least a little of that? Didn't they watch Sin City and see how CGI should really be used?<br/><br/>I'm not saying don't go see this movie. If you're a Ghost Rider fan you'll look beyond most of the lame stuff as much as you can. And no matter who you are, please go ahead and get your free popcorn and drink refills at just about any point in the movie. When you get back you can find out what you missed from the guy in the next seat. If he's not asleep."

Why the producers felt that Nick Gage was the best choice for Johnny Blaze will be a mystery much debated over the years. I am not sure why Johnny became more country as he grew up but I guess Nick is real proud of his over the top Southern/hick accent and he hasn't got to use it since ""Conair"". The producers would have been better served by letting Matt Long play Johnny for the entire film.

","When Mark Steven Johnston was announced as the Ghost Rider director, it wasn't exactly ushered in with a parade. For fan boys, Daredevil is a terrible film, the black spot in an otherwise flawless resurrected Marvel CV. Oh and he wrote Elektra. The main problem with Daredevil though was the character. He wasn't as established as the X-men or Spiderman. So why do follow is up with a character that can be only described as obscure? Well because he wants to. MSJ is a huge Ghost Rider fan, and it shows. When Johnny Blaze finds out his father has terminal lung cancer, a deal with Mephistopheles (Peter Fonda) appears to be the only way to save him. However, being a devil, Mephisto saves Barton Blaze only to kill him in a motorcycle accident. Tormented, and awaiting the inevitable return of Mephisto to call in a favour, Johnny Blaze (Nicholas Cage) lives a life of virtual solitude. Not easy for the a famous stunt rider I'm guessing. When Mephisto's offspring Blackheart (an underrated Wes Bentley) challenges the throne, Mephisto turns Blaze into his Ghost Rider, his own personal bounty hunter, to take care of his wayward son. GR may lack the realism and psychological musings of Spidey and X-Men, but it's a hellavu lot of fun. Cage plays the part as if he's been practising all his life, with MSJ going so over the top with the script it borders in ludicrous. But why's that a bad thing? GR doesn't try to pretend to be anything it's not, it's a fantasy horror that revels in borderline B movie. The dialogue may seem a little cheesy in places however when some of those lines are lifted straight from the comic, how can anyone crucify MSJ for being anything than faithful? The film has an acquired taste, much like the comic. There's a reason why the comic wasn't as big as Spiderman and there's a reason the film wont be either. Not because it's no good, but because it's not the same. They may exist in the same universe however they are worlds apart. It's been a long hard road out of hell for MSJ and GR. Already making a tidy profit, the question is where to go next?"

","The second popcorn movie I saw yesterday with a friend (""300"" was the first), ""Ghost Rider"" is another good time at the movies. Not too demanding and with nothing to leave any kind of an impression when its all said and done, you just have fun with it. I wish some of the actors were onto that sentiment, especially Peter Fonda as Mephistopheles. He's too deadly serious (pun intended) for what amounts to a comic book movie. At least Wes Bentley as Blackheart figured out the best way to play a larger than life character and has a huge amount of fun as the son of the main bad guy.<br/><br/>Motorcycler Johnny Blaze sells his should to Fonda after he discovers his father has been diagnosed with cancer. He did not figure that although his father would be cured, he would die anyway, following a motorcycle jump. His entire life is naturally clouded by and altered by this act. Blackheart shows up, starts killing people, then Johnny discovers his alter ego, Ghost Rider, who makes Blackheart look like Bambi.<br/><br/>Eva is along for the ride and she's lovely to look at but its just the 'girlfriend' role and she doesn't have much to do.<br/><br/>A couple more laughs might have been nice, but like I said, its forgettable but not unpleasant. 7/10."

"ThirtySevenSquared","2","1","3","7 March 2007"," Mark Steven Johnson, a new genre awaits...
","Comedy!! Ditch all this superhero adaptation stuff, and give us a Todd Phillips-style no-brainer giggle-fest! Seriously, this movie is often hilarious, in ways that make you unsure if he considered the darkness and tone of the source material. Actually, no, allow me to restate that point: it seems like he has read the source material, and only the first, oh, ten or so years of the title. I've read a lot of GR, and one thing that jumped out at me was that this film was almost exactly like an old seventies issue, crappy dialogue, over-melodramatics and all. Case in point: in the book, when Johnny becomes the Rider for the second time, he speaks in thought: ""OH NO... I CAN FEEL IT TAKING OVER... CANNOT STOP... NOW, I AM THE RIDER AGAIN!!"". People who've seen this film will understand what I mean. It appears as though there's been no attempt to seriously adapt the book; it's more of a straight-up transition, and a terrible one at that. The fact that Nicolas Cage wrote portions of the script makes a LOT of sense, as the man's never tried harder at playing the ""tortured hero"" role.<br/><br/>Basically, this had potential to be something awesome: one-part Blade, mixed with a little bit of Constantine, would've rocked. What we get is one-part Van Helsing, one-part LXG, and a whole lot of stupidity. The Rider is fun to watch in action, and is hands-down probably one of the coolest-looking characters to come out of the Marvel stable, yet the brief scenes when he does hold screen are handled too flashily and quickly. Wes Bentley is terrible (for a menacing, powerful demon, he's neither very menacing nor very powerful), and one can almost see Eva Mendes trying to get through her scenes, and to her paycheck, as fast as possible. And Sam Elliot... he's easily the best actor in the film (close second is Peter Fonda, who wisely chose the role with the least screen time), and it doesn't say much for the rest of the cast that he gets to waste his talent delivering such gems as ""Any man who sells his soul for love has the power to change the world"". Even Donal Logue, usually a guilty pleasure to watch in crap films, is risible.<br/><br/>So, on the whole: great potential, hopeless execution. And the fact that audiences have jumped on it like a dog on a bone will almost certainly ensure that we'll have to endure a sequel.<br/><br/>It's almost enough to make you yearn for another Daredevil. Almost."

This movie is just pure fun and I felt like a kid watching it, it was ""COOL"". I plan on seeing it again.<br/><br/>The special effects were amazing, I couldn't get enough of the ""burning skull"" or the super cool motorcycle. I've loved Nicholas Cage since ""Face Off"" and although this is completely different, his nonchalant laid back attitude shows through. Peter Fonda was chilling, in an unpredictable kind of way. I thought the entire cast was good. Again, if you go into this movie with no expectations, except to be entertained you'll love it.

","When I saw the trailer for this film last summer, I was convinced that it was going to be another Marvel blockbuster, little did I know that the scenes in the trailer were the best scenes and the only scenes worth watching.<br/><br/>This film is an embarrassment to the other Marvel entries. This movie makes Daredevil and even Elektra look good.<br/><br/>Nicolas Cage tries to be witty and sincere in his performance as Johnny Blaze the Ghost Rider, but comes off looking like something between a cheap Evel Kenievel and Elvis imitator. <br/><br/>Eva Mendes is awful in her role. She's neither convincing as a long lost flame (no pun intended) or a reporter. The young lady who played the younger Roxanne character fared much better. The scene where Blaze chases down Roxanne while she's driving away in the TV van is funny, but when she finally stops jumps out and snaps at him and eventually re-kindles their love life, she only looks like a sassy teenager, I've seen better acting in a high school play. Mendes' best attributes are the pair she wears on her chest, which the director obviously goes to every length to emphasize throughout all her scenes. When was the last time you saw a TV reporter on camera with half her blouse un-buttoned. Nice rack Eva, but you could use some acting lessons.<br/><br/>Sam Elliott puts in a good performance, seems he's making yet another appearance in a Marvel film (as Ross in the Hulk) where he's the only human character worth watching.<br/><br/>By the time Blaze hunts down Mephisto's brat son gone postal, I couldn't wait for this movie to be over.<br/><br/>The scene where Ghost Rider is riding down the side of a skyscraper is the best scene and the only scene worth seeing. Don't waste your money on the DVD when it comes out, just watch the trailer and you'll get the only good scenes of the whole movie."
"woohoomusic","3","1","3","5 March 2007"," A perfect example how good marketing is the soul of Hollywood
","Okay, the movie was not bad because it did not follow the comic.<br/><br/>It was bad, because of the writing, directing, acting and even the special effects...So everything.<br/><br/>First off, Eva Mendes. Besides being terrible in the film, she completely misunderstood her role as a T.V. reporter. The few scenes where she is supposed to be doing a news spot remind me of something I saw in high school auditions from a very nervous freshman. Nothing she did was like a T.V. reporter, and she killed every scene she was in.<br/><br/>The script is a type of cheesy rivaled only by ""Evil Dead"". Except that you can have a fun time watching ""Evil Dead"", while Ghostrider was just painful. It was as if the lines were pulled randomly out of a hat and the actors were forced to say them with straight faces. I am a fan of Nicholas Cage, but it hurt me to have to see those words fall out of his mouth.<br/><br/>Even the special effects, which were the big marketing tool for this movie,seemed sub par. Particularly when Nicholas Cage transforms. The skeleton is comparative to a cell shaded video game or a claymation T.V. show. And we are expected to take it seriously? The beginning had the intentions of an old romance film and instead pulled off the quality of a modern romance novel. It was clear that the young couple were inexperienced on the camera, but once again, it is not like their lines were worth saying. I work at a movie theater and the reactions afterwords were the same as the ""Harry Potter"" movies. ""Well I had to see it, but man did it suck"""

Not so good when you have to sit through movies like Ghost Rider.<br/><br/>The script: Fair storyline, lots of incongruencies, but just don't think about them too hard. Don't let your brain dwell on the dialogue either. It felt like something out of an 80's action cartoon. I swear I heard Peter Fonda use the phrase ""I want you to destroy him!"" The acting: I love drawly Nicholas Cage as much as the next person, but every time he was on screen, I found myself wishing his skull would catch on fire again. Wes Bently gave the best performance, and had the least amount of dialogue -- That may not be a coincidence. Stunning performance by Eva Mendez's chest. The action: Loaded up with special effects, but horribly unimaginative.I thought one would be able to CG some really creative action sequences with a flaming chain weapon-thingy, but no, he just kind of swung it around a bit. It was pretty disappointing.<br/><br/>If you could sit through Daredevil or Fantastic Four, you can get through this one. I wouldn't recommend anyone watching it otherwise."

","Yes, there were a few goofs throughout (including the 360' jump billed as 300', a couple of minor continuity errors, etc) but Marvel has come shining through brilliantly yet again! Some of Ghost Rider's early lines were a bit cheesy (almost sub-neandertal), yes, but acceptable when you consider the context; early on, it was primal force of the The Ghost Rider in control rather than Johnny Blaze.<br/><br/>Peter Fonda was another excellent choice, even if for no other reason than his numerous lead roles in biker films. In retrospect, Ghost Rider would have been a disappointment without the original 'Easy Rider'.<br/><br/>I had one very demanding and slightly unusual expectation going into this movie: As a fan of both the Golden-Age and Silver-Age incarnations of The Ghost Rider, I was extremely critical of their handling of them both. Sam Elliot was nothing short of spectacular in his portrayal of the original (Golden-Age) Ghost Rider and the 'passing of the torch' scene (no pun intended) brought tears to my eyes.<br/><br/>One minor disappointment was the absence of Stan Lee, who has habitually made cameo appearances in most of the recent Marvel movies. It's possible he was there and I missed him, but still..."
"sillyhed2000","3","1","3","24 February 2007"," An action movie without the action and twice the lead-up
","I went into this movie with zero expectations, having not read the comic books and seeing the preview only once. However, coming out the other end, I wish I had not bothered.<br/><br/>Flaming skulls are cool, no-one is denying that; but this movie is not. Although the first point has been beaten to death, Cage sucks. He's got some good movies, granted, but this isn't one of them. This movie is just lame; the lines are cheesy, the characters are cookie-cut from the dough of Hollywood, and whatever cool fight scenes might have saved this movie are null. I can appreciate not having explosions at every turn in a movie, but this was one where I was consciously bored, waiting for the characters to stop being try-hard and cool and start blowing stuff up to entertain me. The flaming chain whip seemed like it had potential.<br/><br/>But no. Despite the lead-up to the dispatch of each of the four main baddies, each one is destroyed within a few minutes each. There are no cool drawn-out fight scenes which destroy half the city in the process, but rather the Ghost Rider is given powers so that he can end any fight before it gets good. I described it to my friends as, ""an action movie without the action and twice the lead-up"". Granted, the motorbike scenes are kind of cool, but the fact that the Ghost Rider is seemingly invincible takes any suspense out of it and just leaves you wondering how long until it's over.<br/><br/>You may think that at least the final fight scene would be cool. You would be wrong.<br/><br/>I could stand this movie if it had action in it - you know, like an action movie should - but it has extremely little. It is minute after minute of lame characters, uninteresting love interests, and boring dialog. The final scene made me cringe more than the entire movie thus far; it was just that predictable. <br/><br/>Just _don't_ waste your time."

The story and concept is great, but the overall execution of the movie was subpar. I've seen other movies that Nicholas Cage and Eva Mendes have acted in, so I can fairly say that the Ghostrider screenplay is totally at fault here. Can anyone say ""Velveeta""? Some parts were totally cheesy. The editing was poor in some areas. The pace was lackluster and dull--this is my biggest pet peeve about Ghostrider. There were odd, long pauses in the movie. It was like waiting for a punch-line that never came.<br/><br/>I had such high hopes for this movie. I would strongly recommend a remake! Find a better script and a better director...and I'll be there for the next version."
"adudewhoiscool","6","1","3","21 February 2007"," Leave your inner movie critic, and your brain, at the door
","""Ghost Rider"" was a fun entertaining film in all the wrong reasons. If a filmmaker like Bryan Singer, Christopher Nolan or Sam Raimi made this film, it would have been more serious and a better quality film. Keep this in mind that this reviewer had not read the comic but is familiar with the character. The comic book could have been as campy as the movie. Nonetheless, this film is amusing in a cheesy 80's action film type way.<br/><br/>In order to save his dying father, young stunt cyclist Johnny Blaze sells his soul to Mephistopheles and sadly parts from the pure-hearted Roxanne Simpson, the love of his life. Years later, Johnny's path crosses again with Roxanne, now a reporter, and with Mephistopheles, who offers to release Johnny's soul if Johnny becomes the fabled, fiery Ghost Rider, a supernatural agent of vengeance and justice. Mephistopheles charges Johnny with defeating the despicable Blackheart, Mephistopheles's nemesis and son, who plans to displace his father and create a new hell even more terrible than the old one.<br/><br/>Is this a great film? No, but most Arnold Schwarzenegger action films are not quality film-making either. Luckily, you forgive because that is not what you watch a Governator movie for anyway. This was exactly what ""Ghost Rider"" felt like, an 80's action film. There were many cheesy one-liners. Some lame puns were also thrown in there as well. The best parts of the film were the visuals. Ghost Rider was one of the coolest looking comic book characters around, and was someone you could not help but root for. Occasionally it is neat to watch a movie that does not take itself seriously and ""Ghost Rider"" was that film.<br/><br/>The acting was fifty-fifty, but it is acceptable because it is not the focal point of the movie. Nicolas Cage was wonderful as the main character, Johnny Blaze. Thank God, he did not play Superman because Ghost Rider is more his thing. The highlight was Sam Eliot, who turns everything into gold simply because of his insanely deep voice, as the caretaker. Peter Fonda was convincing as the devil, Mephistopheles. Donald Logue was also very humorous as Johnny's best friend, Mack.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, there were some poor performances too. Eva Mendez was one of them as Roxanne. Her romance with Johnny was not believable at all. Eva Mendez's character was essentially reduced to her cleavage that was shown in every scene she is in. Another disappointment was Wes Bentley as Blackheart. Wes had only one facial expression, just like Eva Mendez, the whole time, and it was somewhat annoying. Nonetheless, with the way modern technology is, Blackheart still looked like a good villain.<br/><br/>In conclusion, you could do a heck of a lot worse then seeing ""Ghost Rider."" The only real bad thing about this movie is that it was the opposite of what you would have expected from a ""Ghost Rider"" movie. ""Ghost Rider"" is not trying to win any academy awards; it is just one to sit back and relax with a bowl of popcorn. Do yourself a favor; leave your brain at the door. In addition, leave your inner movie critic at the door as well. You are not going to need either of them. ""Ghost Rider"" is a recommended viewing!"

","I did want to see this picture but even from the trailers, I'm not sure I saw the potential of this character. I don't think I understand why a superhero with a flaming head is an interesting concept.<br/><br/>There was a lot happening in this movie but it seemed like they couldn't decide on a direction to go so they just decided to go everywhere (and ultimately ending up nowhere). There were too many conflicts, everyone was fighting everyone and no one was on the same team.<br/><br/>Nick seemed to be channeling Elvis in his voice; I know he's a fan of Elvis but it's been 30 years and I think we should all say goodbye. I thought Peter Fonda was okay as the devil but he didn't do anything that stood out. Devil Jr. and his three friends seemed like a shoe-horned element. They existed for the sole purpose of being eliminated but there was no need for their existence (I didn't care about the old contract for the souls of the townsfolk, I just didn't). Sam Elliott's crusty old guy was straight out of the Crusty Old Guy manual. The ""surprise"" that he was an older Ghost Rider, I guess, was a surprise but I didn't care. He was a plot point to ""help"" Nicholas Cage but he doesn't really ""help"" him, he just stops being unhelpful when the time comes.<br/><br/>Eva Mendes was really the only thing in the movie that I enjoyed watching. She took my breath away in every scene she was in; she was just stunning.<br/><br/>I think this movie would have been better if there was more inner conflict with Nick's character (he seemed to accept his lot in life pretty easily, again, the Elvis voice made him seem detached and disinterested), a few less villains and less blowin' stuff up. But blowin' stuff up is what passes for action these days."

The only reason I put Daredevil at the top of that pile is because the other 2 were just completely awful. Back to Ghostrider. This movie starts off very slow. It takes a long time to tell the story, show us some past, etc. And actually, it takes longer than it should to tell the history, and tells it incorrectly vs. the comic books. So far, most of the comic book movies have strayed from the comics themselves, and I let it slide. Afterall, I'm here to be entertained, and watch a movie, not read a comic book. They are 2 separate things, and I don't mind them being different. The special effects in Ghost rider are awesome. I saw it on a DLP projector, and it was perfect. This is what it would look like in real life if you encountered the Ghost rider. Peter Fonda, whose films I generally enjoy, brought nothing to his character. They could have had anyone play his role. I'm not sure if it was Peter, or the direction he was given. The history lesson was slow and too long, and several times cage was playing Elvis playing the ghost rider. when it was all over, the effects were great, and there was enough decent parts of the story that i walked away from the experience satisfied. I didn't expect this to be the next star wars or anything, but I did feel it could have been much better.

","First off, I must say, casting David Hasselhoff as Ghost Rider was an excellent, though unorthodox decision. Combining his fiery badassness with his on screen love interest Jennifer Coolidge (best known for her role as ""Stifler's Mom"" in the American Pie quasi-trilogy), Ghost Rider is on a mission to regain a contract for Mephistopheles (Christopher Walken), and consequently must fight Blackheart, the son of Mephistopheles, as portrayed by Ben Stiller. This movie is a fiery thrill-ride adventure for all, and features an almost cameo appearance by Chuck Norris as a Texas Ranger, and former Ghost Rider named Carter Slade. Though out of his element as an ex- Texas Ranger, Norris definitely played the part well. I give this movie a ten only because IMDb won't let me give it an eleven, the only thing this movie was lacking was more cowbell."

","Two things I said about this movie before it came out:<br/><br/>1. I don't care if it's good, I still want to see it. 2. I've been waiting for this movie since I was ten years old.<br/><br/>Ghost Rider is the latest of the Marvel Comic movies and happens to be one of the comic books I read when I was a kid. So it appeals very well to the ten year old in me. I'm not sure if it's among the best Marvel Comic movies -- like the Spider Man films, which are strong in plot and character -- but it's certainly among the coolest. The defining moment in the film for me was Johnny Blaze's (perf. Nicholas Cage) first sight of the chopper given to him by Mephistopheles. First thought: wow, that's a really cool chopper. Shortly afterwards we watched it transform into the Ghost Rider chopper. Second thought: woah, that's a totally cool chopper. <br/><br/>If you're not an adolescent boy or at least have some adolescent boy in you, you're just not going to appreciate this film.<br/><br/>Once you get past the basic I-sold-my-soul-to-the-devil-and-now-regret-it plot, the film is mostly a sequence of cool scene after cool scene. I'd describe some of them, but many are dependent upon surprises that make the coolness possible. As an adolescent boy film, it shares the same adolescent view of sexuality present in all Marvel films: the male hero's love interest primarily exists to quell the rage of the angry young man, who had a strained relationship with his father (or father figure) and none with his mother, who is usually dead. This is the case with the Hulk, the Punisher (dead wife), Spider Man, and now the Ghost Rider, at least -- maybe the Daredevil too, but I don't recall offhand. Seeking a replacement for an absent mother is the driving force behind the male hero's emotional life. In Marvel films this device pushes many of the films to the point of emotional cliché. Significantly, the first two Spider Man movies seem to downplay this element (though I suspect it will exist in full force in the next one) and the male hero is more interesting as a result.<br/><br/>But forget all that. If you're entertained by cool films, cool action, and cool choppers, don't miss this one. I do have to give the filmmakers credit, though: this latest cool chopper film brought back an actor from the first really big cool chopper film: Peter Fonda in Easy Rider. I just wish they'd let the Devil ride a Harley; maybe have a showdown with the Ghost Rider on his chopper in the end. That would have been the ultimate in cool. <br/><br/>Maybe it'll be in the next Ghost Rider movie."

","for what it was, Ghost Rider was great! i would describe it as what Hulk should have been. normally, i'm a relatively intellectual person but every once in awhile we all demand a movie that just beats the crap out of the bad guy. it's what i wanted from Hulk and got from Ghost Rider. i don't really care to see bruce banner whine about his girlfriend and his dad... it needed to be there but in the end it's about the huge, relatively agitated (wow, i didn't think they'd get irritated at that little word... i think you know what i wanted to say) green guy going head to head with tanks. we know who ghost rider is and at least for the movie, there was one bad mammajamma with a flaming skull that knocked the teeth out of of evil, flipped cops the bird, and didn't take any crap (or guff as i normally like to say). they even used a different take of the one line in trailers that made me worried that it would be another Hulk (you know which line i'm talking about). so if you were worried about cage's acting, DON'T. as far as i'm concerned, cage is GHOST RIDER."
"Hellrazr360","6","1","3","16 February 2007"," A Bittersweet Piece of Hell
","Given the early drought of 2007's first wave of movies, it's easy to pick out Ghost Rider as a film you'll indefinitely want to see. And why not? If you've got the main character being a flaming skeleton with a blazing motorcycle, it's hard to resist the eagerness of seeing what action scene they'll take place in. Mark Steven Johnson's latest movie is a lot like his recent Daredevil adaptation in how you might leave the theater. You may walk into the theater expecting something good and fun without much brains, but walk out getting the impression the story was taken serious and that little was utilized in the film.<br/><br/>Stunt motorcyclist Johnny Blaze takes on the main role of the film when he signs a contract to save his father in exchange for his soul. But poor Johnny becomes the victim of his own choice when the devil decides to turn the results of the contract around. Fast-forward a few years and Blackheart-the son of the devil-wants to obtain the ultimate form of power; is there ever a villain that isn't greedy? Thus, Johnny is turned into the Ghost Rider at night as the devil's bounty hunter to do his work; in this case, finding Blackheart and stop him from gaining his desired power.<br/><br/>The plot isn't terribly deep and it's easy enough to follow even with the fair number of plot twists tossed in the film. Like Daredevil before it, Ghost Rider likes to utilize the light-hearted humor and plot with a serious tone. And just like Daredevil, this really becomes one of the film's major weaknesses in how it leads to some very unnecessary scenes and details. Some of the comedy in the film does work, but most of the time you feel like you missed the point or that there was too little or too much effort put into that joke. As for the more serious parts, Ghost Rider tries to make these parts stand out, but they wind up feeling rushed so that the film can get to the next bit of details.<br/><br/>Then there's the characters, who go back and forth between being likable and totally unconvincing. This is especially noticeable in the chemistry between Johnny and the attractive love of his life: Roxanne. While they're both likable characters, the believability between the two goes back and forth between strong and nonexistent. And it's tough to establish just how a character feels when they shift from a comical tone to a serious tone and back to comical faster than I can snap my fingers.<br/><br/>Not to say that Ghost Rider is automatically a bad film due to these flaws, there's still some redeeming qualities. Nicolas Cage, while probably not the best choice for Blaze, usually makes for a character that you'll admire for his tragic flaws as individual. Supporting actress Eva Mendes also makes for some solid scenes with her character, and actually tends to be more believable than Cage himself. Blackheart and Mephistopheles (the devil) typically do well to be charming villains, but they do get rather annoying with their almost sadistic tone after a while.<br/><br/>There are also a few nice action scenes to experience in the film, particularly in the last hour or so. When the Ghost Rider is doing what he does best it makes for an entertaining and usually exciting experience. Also, the Ghost Rider himself has a few moments that, while containing corny dialog, manages to make them sound cool enough to help make his character all the more likable. And you've got to give it up for a guy with a flaming skull, chain and wicked motorcycle for those more memorable sequences.<br/><br/>These aspects are nice and do help Ghost Rider to avoid being a complete failure, but most of these moments take place within the second half of the film only. For the first half you feel like your being treated to a bunch of scenes that add little to nothing other than setting up the premise and helping you get used to the characters. Thus you get a bit of that Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest in which the start of the film does little but after the half of the film is gone, the potential is finally being realized.<br/><br/>Ghost Rider is by no means a bad film, there's plenty to like in the film, if most of it is because of the film and characters' style. But once the end finally comes, you get the impression that it was a missed opportunity. It may not have as much charm as Fantastic Four or even Spiderman for that matter, but at least you're treated to something of better quality than The Hulk. Proceed with caution, for this is one of those films that you may love for its action and style, but might be disappointed by due to the almost completely obvious flaws."

","Ghost Rider, despite receiving many negative reviews and a great deal of cruel criticism grossed a total of 228,738,393 dollars. Ghost rider imitates the everlasting battle between good and evil through a past and present legend for legends are a way to understand things beyond our knowledge as said by the movie narrator. It has action sequences, suspense, and a love story that leads to nowhere –but still fun to watch. Being a super hero (apparently a fact neglected by reviewers) it's all it's supposed to be –FUN.<br/><br/>The film is based on a comic character of the same name appeared in Marvel comics, the story starts with Barton and Johnny Blaze, a father and his son performing death defying motorcycle stunts, Johnny being in love with Roxanne (Eva Mendes) decides to leave town to be with Roxanne who is sent by her father to live away with her mother but Johnny accidentally finds out about his father's medical condition and the fact that he was diagnosed with cancer, trapped in anxiety Johnny becomes an easy prey for Mephistopheles ( Peter Fonda ) who offers to cure Barton Blaze's cancer and have Johnny's soul in return and tricks Johnny into signing this contract. Years later Johnny becomes the most famous stunt rider known for cheating death and surviving killer stunts and that's where the action kicks in. Johnny Blaze is summoned by Mephistopheles to retrieve the contract of San Venganza , a thousand souls worth contract and prevent it from falling in the hands of Blackheart (Wes Bentley) his own son ,despite Johnny's disapproval he is turned into a ghost rider by night with furious powers and no mercy at all. Returning to himself in the morning Johnny meets a man called the caretaker (Sam Elliot) who lives alone in a cemetery chapel reveals important information and answers Johnny's unspoken questions of the mission awaits him.<br/><br/>The Characters are well cast; Gothic Makeup and dark outfits were used by actors to resemble the evil looks needed for their roles. True no one will get an Oscar here for their performance but Johnny Blaze the ghost rider who tries to defeat his fear, the cold pure evil son Blackheart (Wes Bentley) and Roxanne (Eva Mendes) reporter still in love with her childhood sweetheart, all seemed believable to me.<br/><br/>Cinematographer Russell Boyd relied on black foggy scenery creating the perfect mood and feeling of the old American west. As for effects, amazing computer generated visual effects were designed on a shot by shot basis to create Johnny Blaze's skull flames which turns smaller and blue to display any emotion other than rage. As for the ghost rider's voice manipulated by academy award winner sound designer Dane Davis, it was described by director Mark Steven Johnson as ""deep, demonic, mechanical lion's roar"" a precise description I thought.<br/><br/>For all superhero movie fans, this one is worth watching."

"bob the moo","Null","1","4","13 August 2007"," Roundly mediocre film that never really engaged me
","As a teenager , Johnny Blaze naively makes a deal with the devil in order to cure his father's cancer. When his father is cured but dies in a motorcycle stunt, Johnny lashes out at the Devil but ultimately accepts his fate. As an adult he has forged a great career for himself as a motorcycle stuntman thanks to his strange inability to be killed in any of his outrageous stunts. However when the Devil's son Blackheart comes to conquer the world, the Devil chooses his moment to summon Blaze as his ""Ghost Rider""  his demonic messenger  to stop him.<br/><br/>At no point did I really expect this film to be any good but I did hope that at least it would be quite entertaining and thus I hired it on DVD. I wasn't prepared for quite how mediocre it would be though and I found myself losing interest more and more as it went on. The plot is the source of the problem as it does seem to plod along without any real sense of event or spectacle. At times it has its moments which are quite impressive (and were used heavily for promo and trailers) but it is the rest of the film that doesn't offer a great deal. The story doesn't grip or engage and it is quite dull at times; it doesn't help that there are no characters (good or evil) to really care about or root for and what I found myself left with was just a lot of special effects that play like cut scenes from a video game.<br/><br/>The effects are technically impressive but they do lack heart and I felt almost no ""wow"" factor on any level. At first it seemed cool but it got old quickly. It night have avoided this by making Blaze more of a person before he became an effect, but this doesn't happen. This leaves all the action quite cold in the delivery and I wasn't actually that bothered by it since I had never been bought into the story. Cage isn't able to find a character and just ends up delivery a rather obvious performance. He also fails to make his Rider have much in the way of character  it was never going to be easy but it didn't help to be stiff and unconvincing even before your head turns into an effect. Fonda is a reasonably nice bit of casting but has limited impact. Bentley lacks presence and threat as the Devil's son, which again undermines the action and story. Mendes suffers from a lack of material and we learnt here that she can only get so far with her playful brand of sexiness; true she is the most fun part of the film and she is a great presence but she has little to do and no real character to speak of.<br/><br/>Overall then, a pretty mediocre and lacklustre film. It does the basics and has solid effects but where is the heart? Where are the characters or indeed any strong emotion of any sort whether it be love, hate, desire, vengeance or anything? Without any of these I'm afraid that the film pretty much fails to spark at any point."
"Robert_duder","3","1","4","25 February 2007"," Ghost Rider better vanish into thin air!!
","I'm starting to think I better steer clear of Marvel films. The Hulk? Daredevil? Electra? Who keeps giving clearance for these films just because they made Spiderman? Ghost Rider is at very best a big special effects film and outside of that it is utter garbage. The story makes so little sense, and they completely toss their rules and legends for Ghost Rider out the window when they need to and the whole experience is just brutally bad!! The only thing that might make it tolerable is the unintentionally humorous scenes, Nicholas Cage (who actually turns in a pretty decent performance) and the special effects. The CGI is spot on, barely noticeable, and Ghost Rider himself is very cool, very faithful to the comic and a great character but it pretty much ends there full force. Let's ask some questions? How is it that the devil's Bounty Hunter is charged with hunting evil and saving innocents? Doesn't sound much like the devil to me? How is it that despite Johnny Blaze turning into Ghost Rider at night in the presence of evil that he gets jumped in his apartment, at night, by an evil guy, and then beat senseless but never turns? How is it that nothing kills the element demons except Ghost Rider's chain that he picked up in the train yard? And when Johnny Blaze meets the Caretaker who can tell him everything about being the Ghost Rider and Johnny never once asks him how he knows? Seem like little details? It's not...it kills the entire film. It's complete utter nonsense that makes no sense.<br/><br/>Now I thought the one thing that might get me in the film would be Nicholas Cage. It's not that I don't like Cage per se, I just find his ego a little big on screen and it carries into his performances so imagine my shock when I came out thinking he wasn't the issue at all and in fact made the film watchable. His Johnny Blaze was perfect, spot on, it was turbulent and torn and traumatized and he attempts to romance his teenage sweetheart and Cage is almost adorable as Blaze. He does a great job. Peter Fonda puts in a very monotoned and almost boring performance as the devil. He never comes across as much of an adversary or evil...he's just there. The special effects try and make him evil but even that doesn't work. Eva Mendes is Johnny's sweetheart and reporter Roxanne. Mendes is stunning, hot even and she does alright in the role but if I have ever seen anyone completely used in a film Mendes is that. Her breasts are hanging out of every shirt she wears and the camera almost zooms on them unapologetically. Teenage boys probably made up 40 million of the 43 million this movie made coming to see it more than once. Now Gibson Nolte makes a decent adversary as the son of the devil wanting to bring about hell on earth by possessing himself with a thousand of the evil-est spirits ever. Unfortunately they wrote his part as campy and corny and he never really gets to be evil and then he gets shot a bunch of times with a shotgun (probably a magical one) and then Ghost Rider uses his death stare to kill him...yawwwwwwwn...oh excuse me...Two performances I thought were really stand out were that of young Johnny Blaze and young Roxanne. I think I might have rather seen them in the lead roles than Cage and Mendes just for the sake of having no-names which can leave ego's in check. Matt Long has the right edge and emotion and maturity to play the role and he makes the first 20 minutes of the film watchable. Raquel Alessi is beautiful as young Roxanne and the two of them have a spark that Cage and Mendes just don't have.<br/><br/>So there you have it...anything worth seeing in Ghost Rider you can rent the DVD and watch on fast forward so you don't waste too much time with this tank. Despite how much money it's made I cannot believe it will take top spot again this week because unless you're an enormous Ghost Rider fan and perhaps a die hard know it all about his legend...and even then you'll likely be offended...this one is off the charts bad, bad, bad. I only score it a 3 because it was tolerable to watch thanks to those few points I mentioned...and my Popcorn was good...mmmm popcorn. 3/10"

Unfortunately, I had to pay for the Director's hall at Showcase (for those of you who don't have a Showcase, or they do not offer the Director's Hall, just imagine paying 2 dollars more for Slightly more comfortable leather chairs.) I should have immediately known that this was a bad idea when I saw Norbit playing in the Director's hall next to Ghost Rider.<br/><br/>I stuck with it, and managed to sit through the nearly 2 hours of film, and I have to say, I have seen worse movies. I must also say, that I saw much better movies.<br/><br/>One of the big problems (besides the script, and the lack of vocal range on Mr. Cage) is trying to cram too many villains into an origin story. Origin stories, by necessity need to start slow. To jump into the action right away would destroy the tone a good origin sets. This movie sets up a Great origin story. And did fairly well, until Mr. Cage rolled into the scene. From there, it becomes a garbled mess, as not one, not two, not even three, but 5 villains are put into the mix. Entirely too many villains to be introduced, established, and then dispatched, especially considering a good portion of the first half of the movie is Origin material. The result, is more akin to a severe beating, then to an exhilarating ride.<br/><br/>It was a joy to see the flaming skull on the big screen, and I hope, that if a sequel does get made, that they learn from their mistakes. Tighten up the script, and fix the pacing issues. Oh yeah, and teach Mr. Cage to add some new Vocal inflections, make him seem a little less robotic."

","I really think Nicholas Cage should start talking like a normal person rather than a junkie on shrooms with a raspy voice. I have only read about one comic book about this classic legend and so know very little about the comic book hero itself (provided that I read the comic at a much later date hence mentality and emotional stimulation has evolved or devolved since the time period it was created.) Once again my ""friends"" have recommended a movie thats not worth almost anything. The acting was typical Nick Cage movie style so I wasn't shocked by it but I was shocked by the alarming rate his status as a movie star is going down. I am not ashamed to admit that I had gotten a pirated copy of the movie (because I could not bare to bring out seven dollars for a movie worth even less than three dollars). The copy was indeed horrible and people keep telling me that the movie was very good. I decided that perhaps the quality of the movie print somehow took away from the movie itself and so I decided to rent the DVD. I should have left that fact unsolved so I did have a much higher opinion of Nick Cage but now that I saw it twice and it was still the same level of sewage material (my apologies to all G-rider movie lovers and Cage fans) that almost made me blind. The acting is passable, the villain was hollow and the love story was as pale as legions face (cant remember the villains actual name before the transformation and don't care to). The, hero when transformed into the flaming skull, had as much personality as a..a.. corpse (and not much better as Nick Cage either)and the action sequences were lamer than usual. This movie should be displayed in Cage's funeral to show the struggles he had in his Hollywood career. Simply put: this movie sucks as hard on any video print (quality) and no nostalgia (if I ever get into reading the comic) will ever make me buy this movie again. NEVAR!!!! I mean wtf?

I am not saying Nicolas Cage is a bad actor---far from it. However, he should not have been chosen for this part. Whoever chose him should be fired. Remember, Michael Keaton was chosen to play Batman and he was a good actor but as Batman, he sucked. It was not until Christian Bale was chosen to play Batman that you could really see what Batman was about.

(Note to self, never doubt IMDb's ratings ever again!) However, when leaving the theater I was amazed that it had gotten the 5.9 rating that it did. That's basically why I gave this movie a 1, to counter act the 31% that gave this movie a 10. (I'm glad I'm not one of those deprived souls;>) This movie actually deserves about a 3 or 4. Yes, it really is that bad. I just hope this little spill will save someone a couple hours of their life, much less the $15 you'll spend at the theater. If I can do that, my time spent writing this thing up will have been well spent."

","I put to this movie a 4. I throw my money to the trash, it is one of the worst comic book to movie adaptation. Nicolas Cage was a worst ghost rider, the bad guys are really jerks (the actors and the characters )Eva Mendez character didn't have anything to do in the movie, just to show a sweet body in tight dress. the movie is full of bad jokes, they try to make a comedy about ghost rider? that was the real purpose? I'm very disappointed I waited more about this movie and let me down. I don't have words for the director of ghost rider.....well..BAD JOB""! we need to do something, Hollywood is doing crap with the comic book adaptations, we need to demand more quality not to accept the crap that those (wanna be) directors do."

It at least seemed to have some connection with reality somewhere. This film: everything looked fake. There was hardly an original, organic moment...which makes sense, when your lead character is completely CG. Nick Cage, oddly, looked fake even when he wasn't the Ghost Rider. Eva Mendes provided great (and possibly organic) distractions, but even she wasn't enough to take one's mind off the tedium, the illogic, and the general stupidity. The waste of talent was shocking. The always dependable Sam Elliot existed only to provide exposition, and Donal Logue's character, which should have been some emotional grounding to the story, popped in and out of the story with very little reason to do so. I wanted to like this film, but I just can't."

It was basically a silly excuse for another comic book movie. Just because it was a comic book doesn't mean it should be made into a movie. How long will it take for the game to come out(Not that it would be even remotely worth playing)???? Save yourself the trouble, don't see this movie.

"jussoc","1","1","6","19 February 2007"," Ghost Rider, Worst Marvel Film Yet?
","A word to Marvel Studios: YOU DON'T NEED TO SHOVE 20 YEARS WORTH OF STORY INTO ONE FILM!!! Do me a favor Marvel Studios, stop trying to give me what I want. Sure, in X-3 I wanted to see Colossus hurl Wolverine into the air and see Iceman ""ice-up"". Of course in Fantastic Four you want to see Dr. Doom battle the ""fave-four"" in each of their own elements. And okay, in Hulk the battle at the end of the film between Banner and his father is pretty sweet. Even in Ghost Rider getting a chance to meet the Spirit of Vengenace was worth while. But if all these things come with the sacrifice of a clear story, strong characters, and empowering cinematic awe, then STOP! I want to see a good movie before I see a movie filled with all the things you THINK I want to see. The problems with Ghost Rider is that there was too much. The heart of the film should have been Blaze's struggle to control ""the demon within"". That's all. Cut out Blackheart, cut out Donal Logue, and most definitely cut out Eva Mendes. There is too much going on, plan and simple. Is the movie about the turmoil between Blaze and Roxanne? Is it about Blaze and Ghost Rider? Blaze and the Devil? Ghost Rider and Blackheart? The Devil and Blackheart? Blaze and the Caretaker? Blaze and his own Guilt? Blaze and his Father? MAKE UP YOUR MIND!!! The story sucks! One minute two characters are down one another's throat, the next the one is confessing his darkest secret. Characters are Inconsistent! One minute Blaze is a laid back fun loving guy, the next he's ominously pushing everyone away. This is okay, but show me some character development. A little bit of drama would be appreciated. Acting? What's Acting? One word: Mendes! I don't know why you keep getting movie roles but STOP...please. You are the worst actress to ever grace the Silver Screen. Please, for the love of GOD, stop making movies. More importantly, Stop making movies that I would go and see. The sock puppets on Lamb-Chop could act better! WHY WHY WHY!!! This movie sucked and I don't know why anyone liked it. If you are one of those people, please stop going to the movies. Stop encouraging the world that films like this are worth while. To top it all off this came out on my birthday! Happy Birthday to me! Here's the worst comic book movie ever! Yeah!!!"
"circle-1","1","1","6","19 February 2007"," Wow! That was awful!
","This movie isn't really a 1, it's more like a -5. I think this is one of the worst films I've ever seen.<br/><br/>Just to set the record straight, I _LIKE_ super hero films. I _LIKE_ bad films. I even like Ed Wood films.<br/><br/>I went into this movie knowing it was going to be bad but at least some cheesy camp might be fun. Even though they were terrible films, I found some entertainment in Chronicles of Riddick, Water World, Battlefield Earth. Heck, I even liked the 70's Spider Man movies, but this wasn't even enjoyably campy bad. It was just _really_ bad. Worse than the Spawn movie. Worse than the Ultraman movies. Bad bad bad bad bad.<br/><br/>The plot was terrible, the research was pathetic. Most 3rd graders probably know more about the names of various demons and what they do than the writers for this film.<br/><br/>The acting was .... It was like Nicholas Cage was Bela Lugosi, acting for Ed Wood. Except Cage isn't half the actor Lugosi was and whoever directed this, was far worse than Ed Wood on three hundred times the budget.<br/><br/>And as for story, let me just take one little snippet to explain the whole film.. Okay... So there's this scene where the old guy reveals that he's a ghost rider too (big surprise, we didn't see that coming from the first second he was introduced, no, not at all)... So they transform and ride 500 miles across the desert to have a big battle with Blackheart. The old guy says, ""I can only transform one more time. Let's stick to the shadows and see if we can't get the drop on him."" (or something to that effect) and then he rides off in another direction and disappears, AND WE NEVER SEE HIM AGAIN.<br/><br/>Okay, I admit, it was a surprise ending. Formula dictates he should jump out at the last second and save the young ghost rider, probably getting 'finished' in the process and having a tedious death scene but no. He just VANISHES from the plot. The hero and his girlfriend never mention him again. Not even a 'I wonder where that old guy went.' He's just dropped out of the story.<br/><br/>This is the WHOLE movie. It's filled with all these surprises like that! And by surprises, I mean things that just don't make sense, are poorly represented, or just plain stupid. Seriously. How bad a director do you have to be to lose an entire major character? The only good (and by good, I mean enjoyably bad) moment in the film is when his already silly-looking motorcycle (a blatant rip of one of the bikes in Easy Rider) transforms into the totally over the top demon bike. It's hysterical. OOOOOH! It has chains and horns and SKULLS! It SCREAMS 'I drew this in maf klass.' Okay. That one part had me howling with laughter, Maybe it was worth one star, but the rest of the film is so utterly horrible (and not in a good way) that this is really a waste of time unless you happen to be an eight year old NASCAR fan who's been repeatedly hit in the head with a brick."
"ryanpeckinpaugh","3","1","6","18 February 2007"," Ghost Rider was disappointing to say the least but Cage was still awesome
","It's funny because it seems that no one really likes reading a good review of a movie. Good reviews add too much hype to a movie and there's not enough interesting material to make it a good read. A bad review on the other hand can add so much to a movie that it can make even the worst movie good. A bad review is chock full of the author's loathsome feelings towards the movie. It is full of obscure and strange, yet hilarious metaphors about what the author was experience during the time of viewing. They're just... better So, having said that I got the privilege of sitting through a, I'm going to use the word, magnificent film: Ghost Rider. The film begins and we see young Johnny Blaze... yes, Blaze... I know, but it is in fact just a coincidence that his last name is Blaze and has NOTHING to do with the fact that his head turns into a blazing skull. Nothing at all. Now, Johnny has just learned that his dad has cancer. But, don't worry... help is on the way in the form of none other than: Mephistopheles. Help has taken its form in none other than Satan himself. He offers to cure Blaze's dad in return for his soul. Sure, it couldn't hurt right? WRONG! Satan starts to be a real bitch when the next day he kills Blaze's dad in a ""motorcycle accident'... Now, he can be a real dick, but do not call him a contract breaker or a liar... for he did neither. So, he tells Blaze that sometime in his life he will call upon him to be his slave, or ""the rider"", and do chores for him like vacuum hell, fix the drapes, and collect escaped souls... you know the usual.<br/><br/>Flash forward into the future... Blaze is now a famous motorcycle rider who jumps cars and stuff. This is actually the part of the movie that is interesting. He meets his long lost love and they chat and reminisce and just when Blaze thinks he's getting some hot, sweet, Latino loving... the devil calls on him to ""ride""! Man... how inconvenient! The devil sticks Blaze on a chopper  an evil chopper  and he will be called Ghost Rider. The reason he needs to ride is Satan's son Blackheart... ha ha not a coincidental name also... has escaped from hell and is threatening to destroy the earth and blah blah blah... boring plot stuff that I'm sure you're not interested in. Now, here's where the movie turns... as does Blaze... into Ghost Rider. He has to go out and defeat Blackheart and his other cronies and send them back to hell in exchange for his soul back. I don't know about you guys but this storyline sounds very familiar doesn't it... can somebody say Schindler's List? The four cronies end up at a train station... the conductor walks out of the control room holding none other than a lantern. A lantern? We can figure out how to bring souls back from hell, but no one has invented a flashlight yet? Then a tumbleweed rolls by. I'm sorry is this 1812 with motorcycles? And don't even get me started on the whole exaggerated finger-pointing fetish he has (for those who have seen it... they know what I'm talking about). So Ghost Rider shows up with computer generated graphics that look so real I find I keep looking at my hands to see if a Playstation controller isn't resting safely in them. All the while Ghost Rider is aided in his quest by a local cemetery caretaker, who pretty conveniently knows everything there is about Ghost Riders, and gives him clues to help him. Thank goodness, right? This is where I black out and dream of happier things like snakebites and stepping on nails, and being in a room with Fran Dresher for 48 hours. I did, however, catch a part where Ghost Rider gets to speak. I'm not sure when Johnny Blaze, cool, literate, clear speaking motorcycle rider got to turn into Ghost Rider the animated, illiterate, half-retarded, skull face with down syndrome! I got the privilege of hearing him say such wonderful phrases like ""You... Guilty"" and ""Go...To... Hell"" in a real ""Me Tarzan You Jane"" sort of manner. The type of lines that you could find only in the funniest of Shakespeare. Haha... oh that guy. When I wake up from my blackout I get to see Ghost Rider pull his""badass"" on-fire motorcycle out of a lake with him still riding on it... real Tokyo Drift Style. Bow Wow would be proud. The rest of the movie is just a blur of loud noises and the color orange. By the end of the movie... and I hope I'm not spoiling it for anyone... Ghost Rider has stopped Blackheart and is offered his soul back by the devil. Unfortunately for the devil, Blaze isn't ready to give up that easily. He decides to stay the Ghost Rider to fight the devil forever, kill him and metaphorically make him his bitch. The devil gives the best line of the movie with a long, extended ""Noooooooooo"". When really I could tell he was thinking ""Damn it! I gave him the power... why didn't I make it so I could take it back! Son of a bitch... I can't believe I'm that fickle! Oh bother!"" Now, don't get me wrong, Nicolas Cage is one of my favorite actors of all time. And the movie was actually pretty decent when Ghost Rider was not involved, but other than that I've had a better time being sodomized in Mexico by a bandit who was only trying to rob me but unfortunately the night before I lost my wallet while tying up a Mexican stripper and beating her to death with a rock. So, I guess see it... if you want... but maybe just do something more exciting like stealing from the blind."

","Right off the bat, I have never read the comics, so I have no idea how close this was to anything that's actually canon.<br/><br/>Taken by itself, this movie hurts; I don't know if reading the comic would make it better or worse. It's certainly not the worst I've seen, and it did have some very funny moments.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the melodrama was laid on disgustingly thick, the acting was terrible (Cage was decent, but the rest of the cast was either completely inept or having a bad year), the special effects were sub-par considering the quality most CG-based movies are attaining now, and the plot was just generally uninteresting.<br/><br/>The worst thing about this movie, the one that really drags it down and keeps the entertainment value low, is the complete predictability of every character and situation. Stock characters abound, and you never see anyone doing or saying anything inspired, interesting or even remotely insightful. Basically, the plot as well as the characters lack depth.<br/><br/>A prime example is the beginning of the climactic fight (which, by the way, you'll see coming a mile and a half away). It's painfully scripted and (even in context) pathetically unrealistic.<br/><br/>This is a popcorn flick -- not a good one, but a popcorn flick. Watch it for the no-talent eye candy and the amusing lines and deliveries by Cage, but do yourself a favor: Wait until it hits the dollar theatre."

","Ghost Rider seems to be just the pilot episode of a series. The whole movie (nearly 2 hours!) is spent in detailing how Johny blaze became the character portrayed in the comics, which leads to a very slow movie with no character development at all (in spite of seeing 20 years of their lives during the film) and no suspense at all.<br/><br/>The CGI effects are good, and used carefully except in the case of the bad guys. With this ones there's just ""hey, we're the bad, hate us"". But they're so plain and powerless that in they become pitiful opponents.<br/><br/>Finally, in spite of Cage's and Mendes' efforts the movie doesn't convey any emotion at all, it's the same if they're teens in love, or haven't seen each other for years, or whatever. No blazing sentences, no humor, no chemistry between the characters. A disaster of a script.<br/><br/>Well, I believe that's all. If they finally make a real movie instead of this pilot episode maybe I'll watch it on TV. I won't give more money to this character on theaters. It's a pity, because I liked X-Men movies, Hellboy and even Daredevil, but this Ghost Rider sets the standard in comic-adapted movies really low."

The devil- who, of course if evil- is one of the most one-dimensional villains I've ever had the misfortune to come across. He has no motivation, so how do we know he's evil? Because guys who wear black and carry canes are always evil! Gee, that makes sense. And if that isn't bad enough, his son's name is Blackheart. You know, just in case we couldn't tell he was evil by his black clothes and general Goth look. Ooh! Scary! Did I mention there's also a girl? Who the main character has no chemistry with and ends up leaving at the end of the movie? Which is exactly how the first Spiderman movie goes?

","This movie was horrible, its only redeeming value is the special effects and when ""The Caretaker,"" Sam Elliot, is in the scene. This movie had so much potential and fell extremely short. I was expecting a VERY DARK movie that I waited quite awhile for and instead I get ""Ghost Rider"" - a light-hearted tale with a cheesy love story. <br/><br/>I saw the movie and was shocked, I wanted to leave halfway though but I paid $9.50 so I had to stay. To tell you the truth I kept hoping it was going to get better but it didn't. The movie has great foundational ideas about coming to grips with the ""darkness inside of you"" and if ""executed correctly"" could have been better than Batman Begins - but they took a very adult storyline and tailored it to seventh-graders. <br/><br/>By ""seventh-graders"" I mean this: the dialogue had no ""big words"" and no intellectual depth; the characters act as if ""a flaming skull-demon-man"" isn't the scariest damn thing they have ever seen (i.e. there is even a joke about the flaming-skull during the movie); the ""demons"" in the film look ""scary"" at different points for no reason, it doesn't fit the tone of the movie, I can only guess it provides a ""quick trill"" to the little kids watching; Eva Mendes bouncing breasts were particularly annoying in the movie and undoubtedly fueled the fantasies of countless hormone imbalanced teenagers, Mendes' breasts are LITERALLY at the center of the screen in EVERY SCENE and her shirt is frequently unbuttoned at least one or two buttons too far which I guess helps provide a distraction to her melodramatic-soap-opera acting style during the film; Matt Long (Young Blaze) is also a horrible actor and ruins the first part of the movie, which sets up the rest of the film to be as equally hard to watch. <br/><br/>I will not go into depth about about the different parts of the film I thought were horrible since this is not a ""spoiler"" review. I will tell you that if you are expecting a good movie that ""Ghost Rider"" hits very far from the mark. If you can stand the cheesy jokes and melodramatic love story then this film is probably for you; but if you are looking for X-Men, Batman Begins, or Spiderman type quality then this is not your movie."

I am also a Nicholas Cage fan but was very surprised not only to see how his acting has deteriorated over the past films, but the fact had he accepted this role with such a poorly written script and previous flops in the box office. The acting was horrendous from almost every actor especially Eva Mendes. There was no connection between the characters to make the audience feel the acting was natural. The film ran way too long and I watched several people leave the theater half way through it. The first half was slow with no substance and didn't start to pickup until half past. I remember thinking the whole time that I would benefit more from this movie by closing my eyes and taking a nap. I've never been so upset at a Marvel movie much less Nicholas Cage (for taking this role) and how this movie seemed to get pushed through without anyone screening it to realize its crap. I even bought the Hulk when it came out on DVD just because it was a Marvel movie but this is certainly one that will not go on my shelf. IF ANYTHING, wait until this comes out on DVD.

","How could you do this?<br/><br/>Contrary to what people will say, Daredevil was not a bad or even mediocre film. Your gritty and inspired direction was outstanding even by today's standards and your script was ambitious and even thought provoking (even if the studio cut most of the bits that made sense)<br/><br/>Your Elektra film wasn't ""good"", but it wasn't unwatchable either. The script was absolutely awful, but the performances, direction and fight choreography wasn't half bad. I can watch clips of it and enjoy myself and I respect the film even if I don't like it. Honestly, as far as second entries in cinematic universes go, it could have been a lot worse (see The Incredible Hulk '08...Actually, don't see it. Ever)<br/><br/>So color me disappointed when your adaptation of Ghost Rider, one of my favorite comic book characters of all time, starring one of my favorite actors of all time, isn't just bad, but boring, soulless and a disservice to the genre.<br/><br/>Cage's performance was shockingly bad. Which is weird, Mr. Steven Johnson, when you've had a strong habit of getting great lead performances even in films that don't work. He looks more tired and disinterested than ever. We hardly even get much in the way of Cage freak outs (though I'll give you this; making him laugh at a chimp doing karate on TV was a stroke of genius) This is the man so passionate he sold his soul to save his family? I'm not buying it.<br/><br/>The love story feels perfunctory and incredibly sloppy, which is a major weakness given that you lean so heavily on it here. Again, how did this happen? Roxanne and Johnny are childhood sweethearts growing up in the South, these 2 should have a romance as fiery as Johnny's flaming skull. Instead, they hardly come off as even friends for most of the film.<br/><br/>Most shocking of all is how the film is never fun. There's no eye candy to be found with the horrendous effects and lifeless cinematography. You're the man who gave us that wonderful shot of Daredevil hanging from a Church cross, pulled straight from Guardian Devil. Why are you on such autopilot with a character with arguably more visual potential? Speaking of, the film's action sequences are also far less impressive or elaborate than Daredevil. The most Ghost Rider does in this film is throw a helicopter and shoot Blackheart with shotgun pellets that bounce like BB pellets. His fearsome Penance Stare done off-screen? Come on!<br/><br/>Wes Bentley's performance as Blackheart is...Good, but it doesn't fit the character. It's the same problem as Topher Grace as Venom. If he were playing a more seductive villain like Morlun or Loki, he might fit, but Blackheart is an otherworldly monster. It's a waste of a good actor's talents playing a character that doesn't fit.<br/><br/>To conclude, you get way more hate than you deserve Mr. Steven Johnson. Hell, I'd put you above most MCU directors and all but one DCEU director (the amazing Patty Jenkins) This is a film, unfortunately, that I can't forgive, even if I do find it unfair that it was the last blockbuster you directed. I hope your career can bounce back from it, but I also hope you've learned from its shortcomings.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Your fan,<br/><br/>Will Walker"

How could anyone miscast the devil?! Make budget cuts elsewhere (on an already expensive movie) but the devil?!!!<br/><br/>The writing of course could have been much better.

","I watch a lot of B-movies and have seen a lot of bad films. The two go hand in hand and I'm pretty used to the latter; bad films can usually be entertaining as long as they don't ever become boring – the cardinal sin of movie-making in my book. Unfortunately, this latest comic book extravaganza is exactly that, one long, bloated and boring mess that has virtually no redeeming features whatsoever to recommend it. I'm getting pretty tired with the new spate of comic book adaptations; sure the likes of SPIDER-MAN and even DAREDEVIL were fun to begin with, and I'll always enjoy Frank Miller's work, but even the 'good' new ones still feel bloated and soulless. GHOST RIDER must be the very nadir, a film that ties with FANTASTIC FOUR for sheer godawful-ness, and the only interest that can come from watching it is seeing Nicolas Cage's career in free-fall after his once promising days as a Hollywood hero.<br/><br/>The plot is some ineffectual bit of fluff about Cage acting as the devil's hired hand, taking care of bad guys and sending up their souls to hell. Inevitably he ends up going against the devil's son, played here by Wes Bentley, who has to deal with his character's face keep breaking out into bad CGI effects. Peter Fonda, with absolutely awful hair, makes zero impression as the devil – Gabriel Byrne in END OF DAYS did it better – but the worst actor by far is Cage. His awful mannerisms I used to laugh at – until now I realise that they're his gimmick, his only acting ability. The silly faces he pulls, the rubbery expressions, all of it is diabolical – he's just completely laughable and I now have zero respect for him. Even worse, Cage is regularly doubled by a stunt guy, and most of his motorbike scenes are obviously done with that dated effect of having the vehicle stationary while the background moves behind him.<br/><br/>So what else is there to say about GHOST RIDER? Sure, some of the special effects are good – what with the flaming skull and flaking skin – nice 3D work even if it does look a bit cartoonish in places. Eva Mendes also seems to be another special effect, a long line of actresses chosen for their 'beauty' rather than any discernible acting ability. The plot drags out for two hours but boils down to simply 'defeat the bad guy' stuff yet again and the silly baddies reminded me of the equally bad VAN HELSING. GHOST RIDER sure is pretty, but it's also pretty awful."

","(40%) One of those movies in which the makers spent ten times more time and effort in one single effect sequence than the entire script, as this has some of the very worst lines of dialogue in any film outside of the Star wars prequels. Nic Cage really earned his pay cheque here not through his performance but through his epic level of fitness, there's hardly an ounce of lard on him, which again doesn't really add anything to this hollow, somewhat silly film. It's best to think of this more as a big budget B- movie than the mass of other stronger Marvel movies. This isn't anything to really shout about, though I largely found it to be harmless fun and as such I highly doubt this is anywhere near to being the worst comic book effort."

He is one of my favorite actors. Look at the movies he has done. The Rock, 8mm and so many others and then what? He makes this movie? What the hell is happening. Maybe for a Ghost rider Fan point of view this movie is good but for me it was not. It was cheesy all the way through , no suspense, not a real cool action sequence. I mean look at the movie BLADE, that is an action movie based on a great hero. How the hell did they spend 110.000.000 dollars budget on GHOST RIDER? I rate it 5 and not 3 only because I love Nicolas Cage too much AS AN ACTOR and he still did a decent job in this movie but...rather than this the movie for me it is not OK."

","Well, the fiercer the storm, the calmer its eye, unless it is a storm in a tea-cup made by the Ghost Rider. Take a thick yet light rope, of a fair length, in your hand, if not a heavy chain, and try creating a vortex overhead, and once that is done, now try doing the same thing without having the wind knocked out of your lungs.Then you can graduate to doing it by just twirling your wrist, instead of your whole arm; this later feat should be easy since you are using a thick rope, not a thin strip of ribbon, not to mention, you are not a lady dancer.Finally, if you are not using a heavy chain already, migrate to it now.You will have to start all over, but think of it as perks of the job. Admitted, doing all this would be a lot easier, if you were just a dead skeleton, instead of also live flesh and blood. Although, I certainly would not mind burning the road instead of the rubber. Is this a comic-al marvel or a scientific one ? Are these blatant mis-takes and are they cool and are they hot , or are they what-not ? Going by today's trends and taste, I'd say this movie grossed quite a bit, not considering the hearts all over the world it would have set on fire, and the adorable central character no one would mind impersonating.<br/><br/>You might say I am making too much of it, movies are pure escapism, not meant for portraying reality and depicting the truth, but I say the thin veil separating fact from fantasy can never be parted, and like it or not , even in the fantasy world, one is bound to fortuitously take sides even if they be the same, and eventually determine to stand one's ground even if it be shaky. Would you rather not do the exact opposite in the factual world ? It is certainly a lot easier, and you will definitely be better off.<br/><br/>When retaining ones own sanity is a far cry in a world that prefers insanity, it certainly is too much to ask on my part, perhaps even my own insanity, to expect some semblance of sanity from it."
"lutubert","10","0","1","13 April 2014"," Mistakes Were Made
","I would firstly like to re-elaborate on the summary; mistakes were indeed made.<br/><br/>There is no denying it - this is not a movie without its faults. Yes, the CGI could have been crafted with more finesse. Yes, the plot could have been slicker; lither; less predictable. But beneath the battered exterior lies a supremely affirming message not only about Nicolas Cage, but about the entirety of human existence. <br/><br/>Saying this, it does have its positive attributes. Nicolas Cage. That is all. If I were able to reproduce this film I would replace every other character and extra in the this film with Nicolas Cage from his various past films thus multiplying the ratio of Nick Cage:Everyone else.<br/><br/>The scene between Liam Neeson and Russell Crowe, fleeting as it is, delivers everything that the film promises. The morose undercurrent is masterfully conveyed; the acting riveting. Liam Nee-... whoops, wrong film. Sorry. Yeah, Ghost Rider. Well, it... it sucked. Yep, it's out there now. Plain and simple. Any sense of irony in this review just disappeared in a puff of smoke, and presumably one emanating from a fire soon to be extinguished by Nicolas Cage, because that is how he do.<br/><br/>In watching this film I believe I found the origin of 'eating face'. In the scene in which Nick Cage and Eva Mendas kiss, I was unsure as to whether this was demonstrating love or if Johnny Blaze intended on protecting Roxanne by eating her and keeping her safe within his defined abdominal pouch.<br/><br/>I would like to take this opportunity to recommend a film with far better production values, plot and character development: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2wViKSh_M<br/><br/>Since I do not relish the idea of expending unnecessary energy writing a lengthy conclusion to the effect of ""It sucked ass"", here is a caricature of Mr Bean instead: http://lh5.ggpht.com/- kqgvfpjWgEo/T7Lr9RXr7uI/AAAAAAAAGAw/TGbKNO1H- 2g/s9000/mr%2Bbean%2Bcaricatura.jpg<br/><br/>2/10 would not bang again."
"keving4241","1","0","1","3 April 2014"," I'm ashamed to call myself a Ghost Rider fan...
","The fear I have whenever I say ""I'm a fan of Ghost Rider"" stems from the thought that people who do not know the comics will think I'm a fan of these movies. This is one of the worst comic book movies of all time. Captain America with Reb Brown? No, bad but fun to watch. The Captain America movie from 1990? Close but... not the worst. The original Avengers movie from 1998? Easily 2nd place. No this Ghost Rider movie takes that title. Because we didn't expect those other movies to be any good. Ghost Rider on the other hand had every chance to be a good a movie. It's not hard to make a good Ghost Rider movie, your character is a flaming skull... that should be instant awesome but no this movie goes out of it's way to spit on the fans.<br/><br/>Before I tear this movie a new ***hole let me say what I like about it. The visuals were about the greatest part of the movie. They did capture Ghost Rider comics very well, because the concept art, props, characters and settings all came from the only department with people who actually work on comic books. Everyone else were a bunch of Hollywood snobs. So the Rider's bike, the Ghost Rider himself, the Phantom Rider (the original Ghost Rider that looked like a cowboy) and his demonic horse were all visually amazing.<br/><br/>That's it, even when they have something awesome they make sure to destroy it as fast as possible. I'll sum up the entire movie in one scene: The Ghost Rider and the Phantom Rider are about to head off to the final confrontation. The Phantom Rider says he's coming with Johnny Blaze and they take off together making one of the most visually awesome build ups to an ending. The Phantom Rider... A flaming skull under a cowboy hat riding atop a flaming demonic horse riding next to The Ghost Rider on his flaming demonic motorcycle. The level of awesome this is cannot be described... and what happens? Right before the battle they stop and the Phantom Rider says he can't go any further then just leaves?! That was his last transformation really? He couldn't wait till they got there then transform so he could actually help in the fight. They tease you into thinking a demonic cowboy with his signature flaming whip and hellfire revolver is going to team up with a demonic biker with his flaming chain... but no that scene would be too good for this movie. It would actually make the movie awesome, so they didn't want to do that. He just rides there and ****s off.<br/><br/>There's Ghost Rider in a nutshell. Visually building you up and then completely ruining it with stupidity. A massive disappointment, and I didn't even go into the fact that they completely destroyed the comic book lore and re-writing everything to fit their stupidity. If you say ""Well the Phantom Rider only had a little more juice and he just wanted to ride there, they travel faster when they're transformed so if he didn't it would take forever"" No no... no. Ghost Rider doesn't have juice, he's a demonic being under the control of the devil who breaks his control and thus serves under the body he is in, Johnny Blaze. There is no juice, power level, it's not a super power the Ghost Rider is a being. So the Ghost Rider can't be in two bodies at once, but I was willing to let that major screw up slide had they joined the two together in combat to team up. They did nothing, it was a trailer shot. You got tricked, they already had your money... screw you leave the movie early if you want we already got paid. And that is EXACTLY what they did, the proof is in the trailer for Ghost Rider Spirit of Vengeance. They trick you into thinking it's going to be a good movie leave you with nothing but pretty visuals.<br/><br/>Ghost Rider 2 Spirit of Vengeance turns out to be worse. The Ghost Rider with blue fire is a COMPLETELY different person, Johnny Blaze isn't the Ghost Rider with blue fire. He's the next Ghost Rider after Johnny Blaze and his name is Daniel. And they had a character named Danny to trick you even more. Spirit of Vengeance isn't the Ghost Rider either he's a villain in the comics. But according to the movie's story Johnny Blaze is still the Ghost Rider only now the Ghost Rider has blue fire cause he's the Spirit of Vengeance? That's like saying Superman is Lex Luthor, that's like taking The Joker and revealing it's been Batman all along! It's BULL**** They knew they were tricking you into thinking it was going to be a good movie, they knew we all thought Nicholas Cage was being replaced with a new Ghost Rider. I'm going to do the Rider justice and burn this decrepit movie and pee on it's ashes. Oh my god that reminded me Ghost Rider pees fire in the sequel.... AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH I HATE THESE MOVIES!"

Meanwhile Mephistopheles is threatened by his son Blackheart (Wes Bentley) who wants to take over. So Mephistopheles proposes to release Johnny from the contract if he defeats his son.<br/><br/>There is a lot of background to go through. The first act is a mess of different actors and many characters. I think a lot of it is unnecessary. Also the powers these characters have are pretty random.

","With the sequel, 5-years late and quite obviously just another paycheck-grab for broke Nicolas Cage, heading to theatres in a few weeks, I thought I would see the original 'Ghost Rider' (2/10 Stars) for the very first time. I never wanted to before, based solely on my distaste of Cage and the movie looked downright silly. I was right: the flaming head of Hellboy on Wheels was outrageously cornybut let's look beyond that, shall we? Incredibly misconstrued and too complex script, laughable acting – especially the fake looking Cage (namely, when he wasn't CGI'd to death and still human), terrible dialogue, bad guys that look so hilarious when demonized that you want to develop a drinking game bases solely on them and awful and uninspired camera shots. I never thought many super-hero movies would come close to the travesty 'Daredevil' was, but this one seemed to ride all over it. Did I mention it was just shy of two hours, a full half-hour longer than it needed to be? I'll admit, I was confused throughout with about six characters and their separate motivations, but it was the writer's job in what's supposed to be a simple comic-book character to make it accessible by the end. I guess you can say no to the Devil per YOUR OWN CONTRACT with him and then use the same powers he gave you to ""fight"" the wrong-doers? Or why would he want to? Or why does the ""curse"" come out only at night, but then shadows work too? And when did certain people become ""innocent"" – everyone's guilty of some sin – if we're supposed to go with the Bible like this is preaching? When the credits rolled I had multiple questions unanswered but the biggest was: why didn't I listen to my initial gut reaction and never see this?"

","The story of a flaming (hehehehe) motorcycle rider, this tale was typical of comic book movies - pass the crackers, cause we got cheese! Now in searching IMDb, I uncovered some facts about the movie that explain pretty much everything I'm going to say about it:<br/><br/>-Nicolas Cage had to have his Ghost Rider tattoo covered with make-up in order to play Johnny Blaze (Ghost Rider).<br/><br/>-Nicolas Cage wrote sections of the script.<br/><br/>-Nicolas Cage's hairpiece required three hours to apply every day.<br/><br/>I'll go ahead and explain the first one: If Nick Cage has a tattoo of it, it's not cool. If he had a tattoo of a woman somewhere on his body, I'd probably be celibate for the rest of my life (or until Cage dies). If he had a car tattoo, I'd be walking. Okay, it's not funny any more. Moving on.<br/><br/>This movie had issues from the beginning. It's based on a pretty cheesy concept and comics aren't really known for their amazing dialog (see: Nick Cage wrote parts of the script), unless it's rewritten by MightyGodKing. Also, the CG required to create a skeleton on fire is just massive and they really didn't put the budget into CG (see: Nick Cage's daily hairpiece sessions. And if you've seen this hair, it's nothing that couldn't have been done with gel and a quick hand-mussing job - seriously, click on the poster to see it bigger.). The movie also had the same problem as Blade 3, Italian Job, etc in that it had a weak ending. There was no suspense, and the ending only served to set up a sequel (I'll be back and we'll fight then!).<br/><br/>There were some good things.<br/><br/>Oh, you want me to discuss? Okay. Eva Mendes and Raquel Alessi were both quite cute in their roles. Eva Mendes even was a bit humorous, which I didn't expect since I'm not really a fan of her acting or face (maybe it's the man-jaw). The scene where Ghost Rider scales the building was pretty awesome. Nick Cage's abs with his shirt off were... yanno, I'd say good looking, but they weren't. His 6 pack was all different sizes and shapes, like an squished pack of hot dog buns, which is proof that old people should give up the muscular look when everything gets weird and flabby.<br/><br/>Nothing much else to say about this movie, except to write to your congress people and ask that a sequel be outlawed. We haven't had a new amendment in a while, and I think we can all get behind this one."
"emarriott72","Null","0","1","24 August 2011"," not bad...but really good either
","Out of all the genres of movies out there, superheroes, is a tough one. Every superhero, most likely has a large fan base. Marvel comics is now probably the most famous superhero publishing companies. Most of their most well known heroes, like Iron Man, have been made, and most of them were really good. But a select few strike out.<br/><br/>Ghost Rider is one of those movies. Now you'd think a guy with a flaming skull with a chain whip riding on motorcycle would be cool, right? Nope, not really. it's just about Johnny Blaze whose dad has terminal cancer. Johnny makes a deal with the devil to save his father, which is always a bad move. SPOILER Years later Johnny discovers he is now the Ghost Rider(kind of like the grim reaper on wheels) and now works for the devil. Johnny retaliates and causes more mayhem. Nicholis Cage plays Johhny, and he's all right I guess. I never really pictured him as the Ghost Rider. He seems just to have a monotone expression and voice all throughout, but thats common in his movies. Also Ghost riders kind of sucks...He spends like the whole movie just saying lame one liners,growling and doing a lot unnecessary things. Lastly, the special effects. They're good sometimes but bad most of the time. The flame effects were pretty good, but the skull looks awful! It has now texture at all! All the other effects are okay.<br/><br/>IMDb recently posted a new trailer for the second one, with the same cast. Will I see it in theaters? Probably not, but I'm open to seeing a movie in theaters any time, so, maybe. Who knows? Maybe it'll be a hit, maybe not."

","Let's face it, Ghost Rider was never a popular character. He was always rather obscure and known mostly known only to comic book geeks. And whatever popularity he had was mostly due to the awesome visual of a flaming skull on a motorcycle. He had two cameos on animated series in the 90s and an appearance in Marvel Ultimate Alliance. So adapting this obscure character could have either been awesome like Blade or completely forgettable like Man-Thing. The end result is disappointing and forgettable but does look cool.<br/><br/>The movie, like far too many others, is an origin story. Like every other origin story, it follows the exact same formula. That's the same problem Fantastic Four had, and these producers didn't learn. I don't know why more first movies don't follow the Tim Burton's Batman and Blade format of showing a hero already with his powers and explaining the origin later on. At this point even the most basic of movie audiences can predict the story beats.<br/><br/>Unfortunately it takes on a campy tone. Cheesy dialogue is said with the utmost sincerity. Silly scenes are played seriously. Many of the actors chew through the scenery. I understand that there's a certain silly factor to comic book superheroes, but this movie embraces that idea far too much. This is supposed to be a movie about demons, sins, Hell, and the fate of the world. Yet I can't help but laugh at moments that were never meant to be funny. Then moments that are supposed to be funny just come off as awkward.<br/><br/>I will say this, the opening act is quite good. The scenes of Johnny with his father, selling his soul, and the father's accident are pretty dramatic. It's the point where Nic Cage shows up that I started losing interest. These scenes have enough darkness to convey the proper tone but enough lightheartedness to keep them interesting. If the rest of the movie had only followed suit this would have been quite good.<br/><br/>The cast is hit or miss. Nic just doesn't have it in him to convey being a serious superhero. He's trying too hard to be his usual goofy self that he is in all his other movies. (Brief aside, I'm absolutely glad he never got to play Superman as was once planned.) Peter Fonda is the bright spot in this movie. He's dark and manipulative with just enough creepy playfulness, perfect for someone supposed to be the devil. Eva Mendes looks pretty, but doesn't do much else. Wes Bentley is tolerable as the villain but never memorable. Donal Logue does a good job, if only he had something to do. Sam Elliott is great, but again he needed something to do other than simply offer exposition. Honestly, Matt Long and Raquel Alessi have the best scenes and do some of the best work. Those two should have been the stars of the movie.<br/><br/>If there are two things consistently good. One is the CGI. The bike, the demon spirits, and especially Ghost Rider look great. The visuals are what people remember about the comics and the movie nails it. I wouldn't expect anything less in this day and age. The other is Christopher Young's score. It's effective and has some memorable themes throughout the movie. I also love the version of ""Ghost Riders in the Sky"" by Spiderbait in the movie. There's also an instrumental version in the film that works quite well.<br/><br/>Overall the film is disappointing. It isn't quite awful but it's certainly not good. There are little moments here in there to keep you interested through the otherwise lousy movie. As I write this, they're making a reboot/sequel. I certainly like the idea, but I wish they had gone with someone else for the role besides Nic Cage again. I believe that each and every movie has the potential to be good. But somewhere along the way, someone forgot that the most important thing is having a good story."

","Let's do justice to this movie.<br/><br/>Good things:<br/><br/>1) The story is kind of interesting, not so conventional for a superhero movie; being like creative mix of Faust, Jekyll and Hyde, with elements of the comics' superheroes, and the western's bounty hunters.<br/><br/>2) Some aesthetic shots that try to affect emotionally, and pay a good homage to the classic scope cinema of the 1950s, being - as well - a rare victory for the crazily hyped up CGI in the American movies lately.<br/><br/>3) The jump over the helicopters; greatly wild.<br/><br/>4) The song of The Carpenters; why these old sob songs in specific are so despised in the mainstream soundtracks, and overall considered bad news as if no one likes them?!<br/><br/>5) The scene of the lead explaining, honestly and simply, for his girl why he didn't come to their date; highly comic.<br/><br/>6) Peter Fonda as The Devil, despite how low the material that was given to him.<br/><br/>7) Eva Mendes cute moments.<br/><br/>8) Sam Elliot as Caretaker; OH MY GOD, he's the best of this movie; his deep voice, sane performance, and wily humor are what will live long from it.<br/><br/>Now, to the bad things:<br/><br/>I was about to say everything else the above, but.. I promised of Justice. So count with me:<br/><br/>1) Cage's supposedly funny performance is mostly pathetic. His antics, like making faces to a mirror, oozed silliness. And the rest is sinfully predictable.<br/><br/>2) His hairpiece; like the ones he wears in 90 % of his last movies, did turn me off. I began to believe it's intentional choice from his side to assure that he hates what he's doing! This time, it aspired after decreasing his age, but ended up deforming him utterly.<br/><br/>3) Cage was 43, and it's intelligible that the role was 20 years younger than that! So I loved when he sneered at the difference between his actor, as 17 year old, and his sudden 43 year old appearance by telling Mendes: ""It has been 56,000 year since the last time we've met!"". He actually was sneering at himself! He didn't have the ghost of a chance to look THAT young, I don't know why they didn't modify the script?!<br/><br/>4) Mendes can't act. Sorry dear Eva, it's the truth!<br/><br/>5) Mendes, as the superhero's girlfriend, is a reporter; well, HOW SHODDY! So was Superman's girl, Batman's girl (in the first movie), even the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' girl!!<br/><br/>6) Wes Bentley can't be Satan junior; whoever selected him was so wrong, I hated the guy not because he was evil, but because he failed as one!<br/><br/>7) Bentley's weird custom seemed like Neo's custom from The Matrix!<br/><br/>8) The confusing matter of; did the lead, as a teen, sign the devilish contract willingly?, or he was just injured in the honed top of it?<br/><br/>9) I couldn't understand if the devil wants the loyalty of the lead, why he killed his father?!<br/><br/>10) How come the son of the devil became mortal after swallowing the souls of all the ancient village's dead habitants?? As the devil's son, he must have been at least smart to know that that would make him beatable. And if he knows from the start, WHY DID HE DO IT??!! (My cousin's comment was: this is the dumbest devil I have ever seen!).<br/><br/>11) So, Sam Elliot as the old ghost rider doesn't age, or does he age slowly?<br/><br/>12) A truly irritating point; if Elliot can, after 150 years, use his superpower for one time only, THEN WHY HE USED IT TO BEAT THE LEAD'S MOTORCYCLE BY HIS FIREY HORSE??? I think he should have been wiser, as he sounds, and use that one last time in something more important like helping out fighting the evil, keeping it from taking over the world, NOT SHOWING OFF!!<br/><br/>13) While his shoulder's torn skin was being sewing, Cage displayed no pain whatsoever; was that for assuring that his character turned into insensitive?, or plainly Cage forgot to act there?!<br/><br/>14) The character of the lead's friend was useless, he was there for what?, and was killed for what either?! Clearly his existence, or nonexistence, sums up the tense of this movie between being a light likable blockbuster and the dark nature of the story it chose.<br/><br/>15) Originally the character of the Ghost Rider isn't that catchy; I wasn't impressed by his looks or powers, and I couldn't sympathize with him, since he was a murderer anyway.<br/><br/>16) Can anybody tell me how the lead defeated the devil in this movie? OK, he finished the sinner souls and that oaf little Satan, but I longed for a serious battle with the devil as the main source of evilness, and all what I have got was the lead doing everything that the devil asked him for, however with anger and nervousness!<br/><br/>17) The lead's idiot speech at the end: ""I'll fight you.. in the sequel.. and in the next sequel.. and maybe in a TV show too!"". After watching a movie by all of these problems, I refused such a provocatively ambitious move!<br/><br/>The score, or the aftermath, is 8 to 17. It wanted to be entertaining, but many reasons, topped by Cage's make-up as younger version of himself, pushed it to be between average and campy. This movie, unlike its lead, couldn't defeat its devil; the one which makes the B-movies so badly B!<br/><br/>P.S: In the movie's last shot, Cage looks to us with a completely jesting look, winking to us: ""Don't take it seriously, I didn't for that matter!""."

","I am normally quite optimistic when it comes to popcorn movies, and will generally defend cheesy action films as long as they deliver some level of entertainment, however mindless. I don't expect high art or Oscar- winning performances, just something I can switch my brain off to and enjoy. <br/><br/>Ghost Rider, however, was one of the most inadequate pieces of filmmaking I have ever had the misfortune to sit through. The dialogue and actions scenes felt like they were written by a twelve-year old; in that there is no indication of maturity, experience, or even effort put into it.<br/><br/>Firstly, plot: Whilst the main plot of the film is interesting in its entirety, the events that support it are poor at best. Many occurrences within the movie are utterly senseless; police officers reach conclusions based on one of the most half-assed attempts at ""evidence"" I have ever seen in filmmaking, and the hero is shown hurling lumps of flaming DIRT at the antagonist. Yep. All the powers of hell at his disposal, and he chooses to throw dirt at him. And worse still, it kind of WORKS.<br/><br/>As for dialogue...I will not list every awful verbal cliché, suffice to say the protagonist utters the line ""sorry...all out of mercy"". That alone should indicate the quality of the script. I assure you, it doesn't get much better than that.<br/><br/>The acting is generally mediocre. Cage is no better than any of his other past performances...though he is also no worse. He's about what you'd expect from him nowadays, so that's no huge disappointment. Sam Elliot provides some much-needed gravitas to some portions of the film, although his impact is significantly lessened by the awful lines he has to deliver (though that is no fault of his). Wes Bently is the only one that dips below the threshold of ""average"" into ""poor"". The character of Blackheart, for all of his scary faces, was unintimidating and weak, largely due to Bently's performance...most notably by his pathetic screams and whimpers whenever he was so much as touched by Ghost Rider (remember the flaming dirt? Yeah, he screamed at that too). And when the antagonist isn't threatening, you have a serious problem.<br/><br/>Many people claim that the campness of the film was intentional, and it is SUPPOSED to look bad or humorous. The problem is, whatever the intention, it LOOKS like it is trying to be a serious movie, which makes the inadequate script even more cringe-worthy. Whatever it was going for, IT DID NOT WORK!<br/><br/>On the plus side, there are some good special effects concerning Ghost Rider himself, and a few jumps that keep you on your toes. But that is really not enough to carry the dead weight provided by every other aspect of the film.<br/><br/>I won't finish my review with the usual ""avoid this movie like the plague!"" or ""do not watch!"" all I will say is that if you DO wish to see it, make sure it is a very cheap rental. Trust me, by the time the credits roll you will regret having parted with money to see this film, unless you are in a group of friends and found some enjoyment in simply laughing at this awful, half-assed piece of cinema."

","In at least a better world (asking for a perfect one would be foolish), my 200th review would be for a movie that is both a very good one *and* a favorite of mine. However, ours is a world where too many ""reviewers"" don't seem to grasp the concept of objectivity and also a world, where, for a good while now, a certain broadcaster here has deemed it a great idea to offer to us on Sundays movies that, at best, are mediocre: moving backwards, I've had to endure Four Brothers, Iron Man (the one exception to the rule), The Sentinel, Spider-Man 3, Wild Hogs, Sex and the City, Twilight, Pretty Woman, Reign Over Me, Righteous Kill, Fun with Dick and Jane. Well, at least they help to remember what good movies are like... <br/><br/>There is a fundamental flaw in Ghost Rider the Movie that makes it a significant movie, especially as the flaw has become an alarmingly recurring one among movies released since - but to a lesser extent already existed before - 2007: The misjudged Must Be PG-13 Clause. Like Die Hard 4: We Can't Decide on the Subtitle. Movies about subject matter, that, by definition, *demands* to be made into an R-rated movie. Remember how *good* the R-rated Blade was in 1998? (A 7/10 *is* good, 8/10 is great.) Now imagine if it had been PG-13 and you're close to what Ghost Rider the Movie is like. For example, the transformation into Ghost Rider is supposed to be horrific and messy. Here all the R-rated stuff like flesh *really* burning and peeling off has been left out. The Penance Stare is supposed to be hellishly torturous: here we see only its aftereffects.<br/><br/>One could list all the common flaws that would limit this movie to a maximum of 7/10 even if this were R-rated, but it'd be pointless because of that fundamental core flaw. In this sorry 4/10 mess there are moments of brilliance that hint at a movie that could have been: The very good CGI, the use of *that* song at just the right moment (NOT the crap version during end credits), the skyscraper scenes, and naturally, Peter Fonda and Sam Elliott. Well, on some parallel Earth maybe.<br/><br/>At the time of writing, there were 644 pre-existing reviews of this movie. It would be at least ironic were the total number to rise to 666 *and* stop there..."

","Ghost Rider starts as the teenage daredevil motorbike stunt rider Johnny Blaze (Matt Long) discovers that his father Barton Blaze (Brett Cullen) is suffering from incurable cancer, a complete stranger named Mephistopheles (Peter Fonda) offers Johnny a deal that will cure his father of cancer. In return for his father's health Mephistopheles who is in fact the devil wants Johnny's soul, Johnny agrees & signs a contract. The very next day & Johnny's father is cured but dies in a motorbike accident later that morning, devastated Johnny dumps his girlfriend Roxanne (Raquel Alessi) & goes it alone. Years later & the adult Johnny Blaze (Nicolas Cage) is now a motorbike daredevil superstar & travels the country risking life & limb in ever increasingly dangerous stunts. Meanwhile Mephistopheles son Blackheart (Wes Bentley) wants to rule the world & goes in search of the Contract of San Venganza which contains the soul's of the hundred most evil people that ever lived which will give him the power to do so but Mephistopheles calls in on the deal he made with Jonny & turns him into the Ghost Rider, a powerful supernatural bounty hunter with flaming skull...<br/><br/>This American & Australian co-production was written & directed by Mark Steven Johnson who previously made the lacklustre Marvel comic book superhero film Daredevil (2003), here Johnson turns in a much more enjoyable comic book film that has quite a bit going for it. Available in both it's original theatrical version & an extended cut which adds about fifteen minutes of character development (notably Johnny Blaze's father & Sam Elliott's character) which probably fleshes things out a bit more, while I saw the theatrical cut when it was originally released many years ago I will be basing my comments on the extended version which I saw last night. While there is nothing outstanding about Ghost Rider as far as silly comic book films go I did actually quite enjoy it, there's just enough story to keep you interested & there are plenty of cool moments that are fun. Johnny Blaze's first transformation in the Ghost Rider takes nearly forty minutes but it's worth it as the Ghost Rider is a cool character, maybe a little silly looking at times but cool none the less. I loved the shots of him speeding along on his motorbike with it's front & back wheels on fire leaving a huge trail of flame in it's wake for instance. The plot is alright, the script seems to try & incorporate parts of the Ghost Rider mythology & I am sure fans will be fairly happy with the continuity here. The character's are OK, the supernatural plot about demons from hell taking over the world is standard stuff & not that original but it's a decent enough excuse to have Ghost Rider ride around looking cool. OK, so I enjoyed Ghost Rider more of a visual spectacle than as a coherent engaging film with a deep story but sometimes it's good to just sit back, relax & have a bit of fun watching a silly film such as Ghost Rider.<br/><br/>Although many may not agree I actually enjoyed Ghost Rider as much as any of the other recent spate of big budget comic book films such as X-Men (2000), Spider-Man (2002), Hulk (2003), Elektra (2005), Fantastic Four (2005) & Iron Man (2008) as well as numerous associated sequels. I think Ghost Rider with his exposed flaming skull looks cool & the scenes as he rides his bike are very cool, from riding on water to sitting on top of a bridge to the spectacular scene as he rides up on side of a skyscraper & down the other while finding time to stop & fight a helicopter & kill a fallen angel between! The CGI computer effects are quite good here, some of the morph effects look a bit cheap & trying to make a man with a burning skull for a head look realistic was always going to be difficult but generally there are no really bad effects here.<br/><br/>With a supposed budget of about $110,000,000 no expense was spared, Ghost Rider is a great looking film & has the glossy Hollywood production values you would expect. Filmed in Australia with some re-shoots in Canada. The acting is alright, Nicolas Cage is alright but he's not the greatest actor while Eva Mendes looks nice but does little else. Veterans Peter Fonda & Sam Elliott provide good support.<br/><br/>Ghost Rider is a comic book superhero film that I liked more than I thought I would (& remember the theatrical version being), sure it's not high art or going to change the world but as a daft superhero who has a flaming skull for a head this is maybe about as enjoyable as it could have been. There's just enough plot, there's just enough action & plenty of cool visuals to make Ghsot Rider far less painful to watch than it could have been & what I was expecting it to be. A sequel, Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance (2012) is currently in production."

","Ghost Rider is one of those movies that is just paint by number bullshit. All of the essential elements are here, but its the lack luster way they are put together that just makes this movie tank.<br/><br/>The acting is well just plain bad. The stand out is Black Heart, he has virtually no character and his delivery often times doesn't even make sense due to all of his unnecessary pauses. Cage does his best with the dry and overly stupid dialogue.<br/><br/>The action isn't even very exciting. Excluding one cool sequence where Ghost Rider rides down the side of a building, the fights are lack luster. Its pretty much there's a bad guy, do some thing with the chain and its over. Boring is not a word you want to use to describe and action scene, but there you go.<br/><br/>This movie isn't the worst super hero movie ever (Fantastic Four: Rise of The Silver Surfer i'm looking in your direction), but it does come awfully close."

","Practically everything about this film was a waste of time. The whole thing just felt so dingy- but not in a good way, in a way that made it boring. I kept thinking- come on! Get a move on! I normally quite like Nicolas Cage, but he really does disappoint in this. He is miscast, you just can't help but see Nicolas Cage and not the character. The plot is so stupid, and stupidly slow. To top it all off there are so many clichés and the bits that seem original are just silly, which all adds up to one pointless film capitalising on the success of other comic book adaptations. Watch Hellboy or Constantine instead. Boys of about 9-13 might enjoy it."

","I saw a trailer and one or two small clips for this film, based on the Marvel comic, I thought it looked entertaining enough, and the critics giving it two stars wasn't going to put me off, directed by Mark Steven Johnson (Daredevil). Basically young motorcyclist Johnny Blaze (Matt Long) finds out his father has terminal cancer, and he makes a deal with the Devil, Mephistopheles (Peter Fonda), to take his soul to save his father's life. Not long after, his father is killed in a motorcycle accident, and Johnny rides away from his carnival life, and his girlfriend Roxanne Simpson (Raquel Alessi). Years later, Johnny (Razzie nominated Nicolas Cage) has become a famous motorcycle stuntman, risking his life in many shows, and he meets Roxanne (Eva Mendes) again, she is now a TV reporter. Not long after meeting her again, Johnny finds that he has demonic powers, and can transform to become a bounty hunter known as the ""Ghost Rider"". Mephistopheles makes a deal with Johnny to give him his soul back if he becomes Ghost Rider and defeats his evil son Blackheart (American Beauty's Wes Bentley), who plans to possess a thousand evil souls and create Hell on Earth. Also starring The Big Lebowski's Sam Elliott as Caretaker, Donal Logue as Mack, Arthur Angel as Officer Edwards and Daniel Frederiksen as Wallow. Cage is an alright anti- hero, but the flames and skull effects are a little unconvincing, the rest of the CGI effects are fairly good, there are some scenes that keep you on the edge of your seat enough as well, but overall it is not the most thrilling action fantasy horror. Okay!"

","I had a few problems with Ghost Rider. Ghost Rider has a good cast, cool special effects, a good plot, but I have a couple of problems with it. I think some of the performances are bad. Wes Bently as Blackheart is really bad. Not even bad in a good way... I think that he really cheesed his character out a bit. Nicholas Cage is somewhat corny at times. The only really perfect performances are by Eva Mendes(Who I love)and Peter Fonda. I don't think Nicholas Cage was right for the role as Ghost Rider anyways. I like Nicholas Cage, but he shouldn't have been Ghost Rider. John Stamos should have forgotten about Full House and should've been in it. Some of the casting is odd also. Donal Louge from Grounded for life was in it and I even think I saw someone from The Red hot chili peppers in there. Ghost Rider was a good film. But needed improvement and could've been better. Ghost Rider wasn't quite as bad as Batman & Robin, but it wasn't the best comic book film."

","I haven't read any of the comics, or particularly any that feature him... or ""it""... at all. I certainly wouldn't mind doing so. Now... I like Mark. I think he did a very nice job on Daredevil(most of the less-than-great in the theatrical version was fixed in the Director's Cut). Realistically, I don't fully understand why he was given another chance, as that didn't do all that well, and it's very unfortunate that his next effort wasn't any better than this is... frankly, in a lot of ways, this is inferior to DD. Let's get the good said. Cage isn't half bad. Neither is Mendes, though their chemistry is questionable. Those playing the young versions of the two leads are reasonable. Humor in this is decent enough, in amount and fun factor alike. Pacing is fairly even, and I definitely wasn't bored during this. The music is almost invariably cool and fitting. The Penance Stare is quite nicely done. From there, it all goes downhill, at a speed the Rider would envy. The acting is, at times, lacking, including for the names who have proved themselves elsewhere. Dialog, as with other areas of the writing, holds clichés. There are holes in the script and plot. Any movie has the right to make up its own logic, but it is then under an obligation to remain true to it, unless there is a point to it not doing so. The CGI is OK, and some of the visuals are attractive, although this has next to nothing memorable to it(that refers to this as a whole, sadly). Honestly, while this is an origin story, there could have been more action, and what there is, varies. The villains were interesting, however, they were defeated in dull and unimpressive ways. I was also not sure what the limits to the powers were, and I didn't always ""get"" the intentions of characters... including the hero, and that probably has to do with his lack of eyes. The similarities to the Spawn flick in no way help this. There is little, if any, language in this, the horror, disturbing material and violence are relatively mild(I agree with the PG-13 rating for this), and there is no sex(beyond a tad of eye-candy). I recommend this to those who watch every graphic novel film, and/or fans of the subject of this, who want to see him depicted on the silver screen, whether or not it's the best portrayal. Oh, and motorcycle enthusiasts, they may get a kick out of it. 6/10"

","That is it. I say it. This movie is just terrible. I have never read the original comic books but if they are as bad as the movie I don't think I have missed too much. I even don't want to comment it but I think I must warn you. Now I have to write ten lines of text...<br/><br/>First I will tell you something about the story. There is no such thing here. We have some pathetic excuse of a story which does not make any sense. Believe me, that is the truth. I knew it was not going to be some ""Oscar"" winning screenplay but... Even 'Batman and Robin' had much better story and screenplay. <br/><br/>Now I will tell you something about the characters and the acting. It is quite obvious that the makers of the movie didn't know what is character development. They tried to make me care about Johnny Blaze but they failed miserably. And there are just no more characters. About the actors... Cage looks drunk all the time. How could an actor as talented as him act so bad is beyond my imagination. Eva Mendes acts terrible and even looks terrible in the movie. I seriously doubt she is that ugly. Well... At least Sam Eliot looks cool but his character is completely useless. <br/><br/>About the action and the effects? The action sequences are just pathetic. I guess you have seen at least one of the new Steven Seagal movies. Well, the action in them is better than the action is 'Ghost Rider'. Much better. As for the effects... Have you seen the trailer? If you have you saw 90% of the visual effects. And the rest 10% are not worth seeing. And the effects in most of the sci-fi or fantasy movies in the past ten years are much better. Ghost Rider looks like he came out from an animated movie, not from a live action one. His bike is just ridiculous also. And demons... They are not even funny.<br/><br/>So what do we have. No story, no acting, no action, no visual effects. Nothing. 1/10."

","Now I have been a huge fan of superhero movies ever since I was a small boy, when I first saw Superman, but I am also more a movie fan than I am a superhero fan. Now this movie is not only the worst superhero movie ever, it is, in my opinion, one of the most lazy, sloppily filmed movies in the history of Hollywood.<br/><br/>This movie is so poorly directed, so tasteless and carelessly stitched together it is absolutely dreadful to lay human eyes upon. Complete with numerous plot holes, a cheesy, uninspired script full of overly clichéd dialog and lazy, slow paced action scenes with lackluster special effects.<br/><br/>The storyline is so poorly conceived it makes me wonder what Mark Steven Johnson was thinking when he wrote this movie, how someone could have such a lack of common sense. For example, after the Johnny Blaze's first transformation into the Ghost Rider, he goes on a fiery rampage through the city, leaving a path of massive destruction as well as Johnny's license plate (which for some reason remained normal when the rest of the bike transformed)and later on when investigating, a cop finds Johnny's plate lying in the debris, and somehow is able to pinpoint blame on Johnny despite all the other wreckage in the street. Wow, this guy must be some super-cop to come up with such a precise conclusion with very circumstantial evidence, they ought to make a movie bout him! <br/><br/>I must of course acknowledge the rather lame performances of Nicolas Cage, who doesn't give his cheesy lines any justice, Eva Mendes who I feel was only cast not for acting talent but as a pair of publicity breast to appeal to male audiences, and Wes Bentley who in no way is menacing enough to play a convincing evil entity. But then again I can't really blame them, actors just do what the director tells them. <br/><br/>After the lousy job Mark Steven Johnson did with Dare Devil, I must acknowledge Marvel's stupidity in re-hiring him, for this guy is the Uwe Boll of superhero movies. Every passing second of this abomination makes me believe that Mark Steven Johnson spent the majority of his time in film school chugging beer and smoking weed at frat parties."

","I rented this movie knowing that the plot was a bit weak, however; I was looking forward to the visual appeal... Though the effects were neat, the story and plot just failed. I was so let down with this movie. There were many non-logical sets of events. First, the first date between Roxanne Simpson and Blaze. It shows her showing up at the restaurant waiting and waiting, checking her text messages... then cuts to Blaze still getting ready? I think the director was trying to convey that Blaze was late because this is the first time he turns into the Ghost Rider... but no, he was still getting ready (not turning into GR ) while she was waiting??? He just didn't meet her on time. Also Why did the Blaze and the Older Ghost Rider go together to the town? I'll ride with you but once I get there Im just going to turn around and leave NO point to that scene. <br/><br/>Bad acting, terrible scene play, and OK special effects = Such a Disappointment!<br/><br/>To top it all off, They didn't even have Rollins Band ""Ghost Rider"" in the movie.

","Entertaining if you have nothing better to do on a wet Sunday afternoon. Special effects are excellent, plot is thin (meta/physical/phorical cowboys and indians in action) and is really a vehicle for the effects and some visually stunning stunts. Acting doesn't have to be much; a load of planks could walk their way through the emotional spectrum required. Although it has to take a special kind of gal to stroke the transforming bony face of a chameleon This has the feel of v.1 so maybe the cast is looking forward to pension rights by the time they all get finished.<br/><br/>Parental guidance is 15 years old.

"christopherfail1987","4","0","1","4 June 2008"," Entertaining, but could've been way better if someone else directed it
","Overall, this movie was entertaining, but one of those only worth seeing once. The casting and the plot were good, and the special effects for the Riders themselves were excellent. I'd say the biggest problem was in the directing and especially the editing. Like everyone, I was skeptical after hearing Nicolas Cage would be in the title role, but when you stop and analyze the character of Ghost Rider--a flaming skull, which cannot have many facial expressions--it becomes more acceptable. Nick Cage doesn't really have any expression in his long face, plus he's tall and built, and does have a somewhat ghostly voice. So I figured maybe it wasn't a bad decision after all. But after seeing his performance, truth to tell, his character Johnny Blaze is not much more than a nuisance and a bit of a prick. I love Eva Mendes and was looking forward to seeing her in a Marvel Comics movie as the love interest, but her character Roxanne is depicted so two-dimensionally that you almost feel sorry for her, both the character as well as the actress. Peter Fonda's presence would've been intriguing if it weren't for his bad acting, and on top of the bad directing, it made him almost insignificant. The best-depicted character is Sam Elliot's. He is well-acted and depicted OK compared to the rest, though still not 100% great. What made this movie cheesy was that the comic relief is what predominates most, making this movie almost into a comedy. Even the serious parts are easy to laugh at, I'm afraid. I would've thought that after the flop of ""Daredevil"", the studio would've known better than to select an amateur like Mark Steven Johnson for what could've been a masterpiece. The problem lies in that all the characters were depicted in a way that was much too comedic. The best scene in this film is the one where the two Riders are riding across the desert side by side, Cage on his motorcycle and Elliot on his fiery horse. I'd still recommend making a remake/indirect sequel, as they are doing with the Hulk."

","Director Mark Steven Johnson (of ""Daredevil"" and ""Electra"" movies) and his screen-writers made this homage to a cult-70's Marvel book a real mess. If I could I'd ask the people involved : ""If you don't like a subject or a specific comic book (like our case) why go and make a movie about it?"" Yeah, it's the money, stupid. Except that,in the end, your lack of interest is going to be very obvious. With comic adaptations stealing the spotlight they could surely do better ...<br/><br/>This movie fails miserably even in the visual level were similar films usually excel, which is kind of surprising since even old Mark Steven Johnson hacks like ""Daredevil"" packed some eye-candy. It seems like instead of progressing with his career and evolving his techniques MSJ goes one step backwards at a time.""Daredevil"" had some good moments (namely the first 15 minutes) ""Electra"" was worse and this hits rock bottom...<br/><br/>You could easily blame the original comic but that's not the case. Movies like the ""Blade"" trilogy (the first two parts actually) or even Sin City are based on similar books but are actually a lot better. I think that's mostly because directors like Guillermo del Torro (Blade II, Hellboy ) observing the weak and schematic scenarios, cover it all up with nice visuals and set a steady pace in their films, while MSJ works mechanically using as little imagination as possible.<br/><br/>Nickolas Cage, who seems to be picking his roles without any thought or care, also fails miserably here. He tries to fit in the role of the undead Avenger but lacks the charm and the guts of a powerful performance. He sports a melancholic expression that is out of place and can even provoke laughter and not compassion.Peter Fonda's participation as Mephistophelis could bring a lot of charm but in the end ridicules a man best remembered from the epic ""Easy Rider"".Eva Mendez is simply as wooden as it gets.<br/><br/>Small budget, bad effects and mediocre acting, make this movie hard to watch even for the die-hard marvel fan."

I'm not going to do any spoilers because there really isn't any major plot element to spoil. It's just your basic good vs evil, love story, action movie. I really thought that Raquel Alessi was quite fetching in this!! Might I say this again, I thought Raquel Alessi was really quite fetching in this!!. They had pretty good special effects and it was fun to watch overall, but not what I would call memorable. I don't know how much mr.

","i bought this movie mainly for the action and story that it presented, my son went to go see this at the theater on opening day. Anyway i thought that Nicolas Cage did a wonderful job as the Ghostrider. Second Sam Elliot was a great lift for the film excellent choice there, but why i ask why does these movies have this stupid love interest in them,, Eva Mendez please.. how about J. Lopez. anyway; the whole story plot seemed very interesting, here you have a man making a deal with the devil. aka. the devil and Daniel Webster. The devil of course will break the deal, so he can sucker the young man in for the rest of his life. now the young man has to somehow defeat the devil in the end. What i liked about the movie is that you had Peter Fonda as Mephistopholes.. then they introduce his son. Blackheart who him and the angels got kicked out of heaven , supposedly by Micheal. Somewhere though the movie got disjointed, and my daughter whose opinion i highly value said the same thing. For instance the whole deal about the caretaker.....towards the end.. black-heart's fight near the end with ghost rider.. it seemed like the movie's storyline jumped at tad to much and felt out of place. also i didn't really care for the ending.The graphics were great, the action, and i love Nicolas Cage, i guess the only reason i am NOT giving this film high marks is that it was so HYPED by the media. that expectations are so high. at least mine was, and i feel that if a movie is hyped to death it needs to be better,, not a bad film, at all, i just expected more."

","GHOST RIDER is another of the comic-book-to-film ideas that cinema audiences have been inundated with as of late. BATMAN, SPIDERMAN, SUPERMAN, THE HULK, have all made it from the graphic childhood page to celluloid, and some of them have done it well. But Ghost Rider sputters and dies.<br/><br/>The most ""inflaming"" issue for me was Nicholas Cage (THE WICKER MAN). He's, what, 43 years old? And he's playing an Evel Knievel-esquire, motocyclying hotshot who jumps everything from cars to spinning helicopter blades? Puhleease! He's getting too old for these roles and it's showing. Someone younger and with a cockier attitude could've pulled of a much more believable Johnny Blaze (perhaps Heath Ledger?) The love interest of Roxanne Simpson played by the exotically pretty Eva Mendes was nice to look at, but stood out as a mere cardboard character delivering unbelievably clichéd lines. Other than showing off her constant cleavage, she didn't hold any acting power.<br/><br/>Peter Fonda as Satan (aka Mephistopheles) was okay but he's seen so little that we don't really give a ""damn"" about him.<br/><br/>The over-the-top evilness of Satan's son Blackheart (Wes Bentley) was weak and his motives never fully explained (other than he wanted to have a ""Hell on Earth"" via a forbidden city that is likewise never explained at all).<br/><br/>My only soft spots for the film were the wickedly awesome bikes, the laughable (and appropriately so) Ghost Rider CGI moments, and Sam Elliott's intoxicating narrative. I've always enjoyed listening to Elliott's voice  it's syrupy smooth and deep baritone was a great dichotomy against an ancient tale turned modern.<br/><br/>But the film as a whole is exceptionally weak. The love story feels and looks forced (again, Cage is just too old for someone the likes  and looks  of Mendes), the character's interactions are whisked aside in favor of action that isn't explained, and those characters that are interesting are given so little screen time that we just don't care about the story at all.<br/><br/>Aside from the cool motorcycles and Sam Elliott's voice, this one should have you burning rubber back to your local video store in order to return it as soon as possible!"

","I'm soooooooooo glad I didn't pay to go see this at a cinema, it's just a terrible movie in every sense.<br/><br/>I'm a comic book fan, but I've never really read the Ghost Rider comics, so didn't know much about the character and his story from the comics. Luckily, it doesn't matter, because I don't think the screenwriter/director does either because there is lame character development in this movie.<br/><br/>The first 30 minutes or so promise much, seeing a young Johnny Blaze and how he came to sell his soul to the devil is intriguing, but when it fast forwards to his adult life, and Nicholas Cage comes on screen, all sense of interest quickly drops. Cage's acting is terrible, there's no soul to it (pun intended), which is surprising considering that supposedly he is a massive Ghost Rider fan. the actual moment when he finally become Ghost Rider for the first time is also hilarious, I mean you are literally laughing at it, it's so badly acted and directed.<br/><br/>Eva Mendes character is pointless, it's plain to see she is only in the movie to show off her ample chest in low cut tops, and not much else. As a love interest for Johnny Blaze she's unconvincing, as a news reporter she's unconvincing, which means her time on screen is met with a host of laughs, mainly because her dialog is lame and her reactions to the demons etc is a joke.<br/><br/>Speaking of the demons, the antagonists in this movie, talk about them being a walkover. There are no epic battles in this movie, Ghost Rider seems able to dispatch them within 30 seconds of any fight starting, so by the time it comes to the end of the movie and the final boss, you're not anticipating a great end fight sequence, and nor do you get one, meaning the whole movie ending is an anticlimax. The last thing any movie director or producer wants is for people walking away from the end of the movie feeling unfulfilled, but that's precisely what you get here. <br/><br/>It's fair to say that Mark Steven Johnson was given his big break with DareDevil, which failed miserably, was given a second shot with this, and failed again. Sorry Mark, but your time is up. <br/><br/>All in all, another example of a cult character being commercialized and failing badly. I'm sure Ghost Rider fans who saw this must be in shock of what's happened to their beloved character. I'm not a Ghost Rider follower, but I'm shocked for them too."

","Ghost Rider(2007) <br/><br/>Review: After seeing this a few more times, my perspective has grown. Here's my official take: <br/><br/>Ghost Rider has good and bad all over it. This is a rather screwed up movie at times. Let me sum it all up.<br/><br/>The Good: The special Fx are stunning. Ghost Rider looks quite amazing. The effects enough do justice for the Rider. There is quite a good level of character development too. We learn about the sorted past of Johnny Blaze and how he became cursed. There is also a some good action here. It's enjoyable at times. The Rider's voice is demonic. He sounds cool. ""Look into my eyes!"" <br/><br/>The Bad: The dialog of the Rider is small, reduced to such corny lines like, ""Back to hell"" or ""You're going down"". The Rider does not have much dialog and most of it isn't that good. Nic Cage is good as Blaze, but at times over-acts. I do agree that he isn't the best choice, but beggars can't be choosers. The are some very noticeable continuity errors. The scene at the jail rubbed me the wrong way and felt flawed. The Rider's penance stare scenes are way too long. Should have ended after 10 seconds, not over a minute. The villain looked like a Emo god, and his subordinates are merely nothing more than that. One fight ended too quickly.<br/><br/>Overall, Ghost Rider suffers from lots of flaws, but I was entertained enough. This is by no means terrible, not at all. Just above average and rather cheesy.<br/><br/>The Last Word: Enjoyable, yet corny. This could have been far better, but could have been much worse. Not bad, just not good either."

","When I first saw the cast of the Ghost Rider, I felt relief. The Academy Awards winner Nicholas Cage and Peter Fonda. Hmm...I thought: ""If they play in this film, it must be good""... Well, I guess I was wrong. This film is in lack of acting, humor and entertainment. So almost everything that makes a kind of this film watchable and good. There is a little action in it, if I can call it that, but with those awful computer animation solutions it is rather funny than entertaining. By the way ""fun"". If anyone can find a scene that contains some elements of this word, please notify me because I couldn't. The only thing that I could notice was the strained jokes.

"pyrocitor","4","0","2","5 August 2007"," Ill conceived and patronizing disservice to the comic
","Any fan of the comic book source material, or anyone having briefly heard of the character could easily recognize the cinematic potential for the Ghost Rider myth. How could the tale of a stunt motorcyclist, tricked into selling his soul to save the life of his estranged father and unwillingly becoming the devil's bounty hunter ever translate as something less than a dark epic thriller? Well, fairly easily, it would seem, if all parties involved seem determined to ignore the biting intensity of the subject matter and bring the story to screen as a watered down, painfully predictable tale devoid of any redeeming factors or cinematic merit whatsoever, as is unquestionably the case here. Fans of the comic Ghost Rider, be prepared - this is not the Johnny Blaze you knew and loved, this is nothing more than an inexcusable Hollywood massacre.<br/><br/>Writer/director Mark Steven Johnson, who seemed to have such a firm grasp on all of the defining assets of his source material in Daredevil's dark tale of redemption seems to have thrown any sense he once possessed off the proverbial rooftop, as his abysmally weak screenplay is at best a confused, imbalanced muddle riddled with more clichés than would seem humanly possible. The plot holes and flaws in logic are large enough to drive Ghost Rider's chopper through, and the protagonist's demonic abilities are never explained, to the point where new abilities seem to be invented on the spot, simply for the purpose of furthering the plot. (how to defeat the wind demon? By using his flame tornado ability of course! What do you mean he's never shown evidence of such a power before, he's had it all along... really!) The fact that Johnson's script could have been considered passable is really a testament to Hollywood's recent trend of tossing anything into theaters, no matter how weak or inconsistent, to make a quick buck. <br/><br/>And while the film, being a comic book action movie, may not have required a Pulitzer prize winning script to be a success, even in the action sequences the film seems rushed, ill conceived, and frankly just plain lazy, generating no tension or excitement whatsoever. The CGI is absurdly bad, to say the least - Ghost Rider himself boasts worse animation than most 1990s video games, and Blaze's transformation into the rider, which in the comics was a haunting and painful spectacle to behold, in the film is excruciatingly poorly done and mildly humorous. It goes without saying that the characters' abilities make for some fairly brief and uneventful battle sequences - Blackheart pokes people with his finger, and they die, whereas Ghost Rider simply stares them in the face, and they collapse, (the anticlimax is astounding...) whereas Blackheart's elemental sidekicks have such terrifying powers as being able to blow hard and drag Ghost Rider into a puddle of water... oh dear. How this could have been interpreted as even potentially enthralling is more frightening than any of the characters could ever hope to become in such a hackneyed mess. <br/><br/>Despite star Nicolas Cage's fervent admiration for the character, he is all wrong for the role right from the start - his performance, at times strangely goofy and otherwise painfully melodramatic, never comes close to capturing the dark intensity appropriate for Johnny Blaze. The normally talented Eva Mendes fumbles through her lines without a trace of emotion, her purpose in the film sadly reduced to cheap eye candy. An absurdly miscast Peter Fonda makes for a laughable devil figure, complete with a ridiculous beehive hairdo and far too many knowing references to Easy Rider to ever be taken seriously or come across as even slightly intimidating. Character actor Wes Bently at least appears to be trying as malevolent demon Blackheart, but he is saddled with most of the worst lines in the film (which is saying a lot) and the freedom to seemingly either overact or underact whimsically, making for yet another disappointingly ineffective antagonistic figure. Only Sam Elliot escapes with a trace of dignity as the mysterious Caretaker, but his oh so stereotypical ""wise, grizzled mentor"" role has frustratingly little purpose in the film, making his presence seem almost unnecessary. It is nothing less than a colossal disappointment to see such a talented cast reduced to a level of such frustrating mediocrity. <br/><br/>It is really quite as mystery as to how Ghost Rider could have misfired so severely in almost every possible front. As the film wavers uncertainly between being patronizingly predictable and absurdly nonsensical, butchering the comic book source material in the process, it still has the gall to take itself too seriously to even embrace the potential of being enjoyable in the ""so bad it's good"" sense. There is little good whatsoever in Ghost Rider, and apart from genuinely die-hard enthusiasts prepared to see the original character warped inexcusably or those in search of a thoroughly mindnumbing and unenthralling action romp, it would seem prudent to avoid the film at all costs, or succumb to a disappointment of (dare I say it?) hellish proportions. <br/><br/>-3/10"

","You know how you can watch a super hero flick and be disappointed over how cheesy the hero's powers looked? At least with ""Ghost Rider"", you get the real deal. The CGI effects could not have been better to capture one's imagination of how the Marvel comic character should appear on the big screen. That goes for both the 'modern' motorcycle riding Ghost Rider and the original Western hero created by writer Dick Ayers. As for the story, it's a somewhat clichéd premise that fortunately doesn't put the entire world at risk, only a small town known as San Venganza whose souls are held captive by the devil's contract and are fervently sought by the son of Mephistopheles. Through it all, you'll get some mileage out of a device known as the Penance Stare, and one liners that would do a comic book proud, like the Caretaker (Sam Elliott) to Johnny Blaze (Nicolas Cage) - ""Congratulations, your chances just went from none to slim"".<br/><br/>Apparently, Cage may have gotten in just under the wire as a super hero, as his age is starting to show. He actually takes his name from a Marvel second stringer called Luke Cage, but don't hold your breath for a movie about that character. His is an imposing task as the devil's bounty hunter, and he comes out on top using the old blood of the innocents trick to defeat his nemesis Blackheart (Wes Bentley). But geez, didn't it seem like it was just a bit too easy?<br/><br/>For my money, Sam Elliott steals the show as Carter Slade, the first incarnation of the Ghost Rider, though it's never reconciled how he and Johnny co-exist together, but that's not too important. Watch this one with no more investment than a couple of hours to kill and an escapist mentality. With Eva Mendes on hand as the Rider's romantic interest, I kept humming one of Johnny Cash's trademark songs to myself as the story progressed - 'Love is a burning thing...'"

"ElmStreetsLastBrat","6","0","1","5 July 2007"," Not a bad movie...but could've been better
","I had high hopes for Ghost Rider. I wanted to see it when it was first released in theaters. Every time I'd go to the movie theater to see a film they would show the previews for Ghost Rider and that made me want to see it even more. I couldn't wait for it to come out on DVD. I was so excited about seeing it when I rented it last week. Well, to my surprise, I was a little disappointed. The story basically involves a stunt-racer named Johnny Blaze, who at 17 years old, sold his soul to the Devil to save his father from dying of cancer, only to have his father die in a terrible accident a couple of weeks later. Then when Johnny becomes an adult, played by Nicolas Cage, his mission is to defeat Blackheart, the Devil's son. And when Johnny is in the presence of evil he turns into the Ghost Rider, a leather-clad skeleton with a flaming head and flaming bike. He is the Devil's bounty hunter.<br/><br/>I basically enjoyed this film. The flaming skull was cool and I got excited every time Nicolas Cage turned into the Ghost Rider. But I was disappointed in how little we saw the Ghost Rider. He became the Rider, what, three times? And the way he done away with Blackheart's posse were so uninteresting and unimaginative. I was disappointed in the Ghost Rider's voice. What was that? Was it supposed to be Linda Blair in the Exorcist? Because that's sure what it sounded like! It was so cheesy! I was disappointed in the character of Blackheart. Yes, he was creepy. He gave me chills. But Wes Bentley's acting was dull and lifeless. He delivered his lines with no finesse. And the way he killed somebody! It was so uncool. All he did was put his finger in someone and they turned to stone. And the victims didn't shake or anything! It was a major letdown. Especially when the Ghost Rider saved the woman from being attacked and he told the guy to ""look into my eyes"" and his eyes turned hollow and he passed out. Every time that happened it had to be some of the worst scenes in the movie. But what I was really disappointed in was Nicolas Cage's acting. He's a fine actor. I'm a fan of his. But he was not a good choice for the Ghost Rider. He was wooden and put no life into his character. He was dull and he mumbled his lines way too much. He is not superhero material. Eva Mendes was okay in what little she had to work with. And as I said before, Wes Bentley wasn't a good choice either for Blackheart. He didn't put much depth into his character. Plus, the CGI they used for this film made it look a little shabby and cheaply made. I know it wasn't' at all a cheap film, but I felt it looked that way.<br/><br/>But the things I did like about the film were the motorcycles stunts at the beginning when Johnny Blaze would jump over helicopters and semi trucks. I liked seeing the Ghost Rider ride on his motorcycle. I loved seeing Nicolas Cage turn into Ghost Rider. I loved the scene where the Ghost Rider grabbed the helicopter and said ""you're pissing me off!"" Yes, that was a little cheesy but it made me laugh. I loved the scene where the Ghost Rider touched his bike and then it changed. That was cool. And the fight sequence at the end between Blackheart and the Rider had some cool moments too; like when the Rider threw fireballs at Blackheart and the Rider's gun changed. But it was still a little disappointing.<br/><br/>Ghost Rider is not a bad film. But it had so many things wrong with it like I have mentioned above. For the most part, though, it is not a children's movie. Children who are younger than 12 or 13 should not see it. There are some extremely creepy parts that would probably give young children nightmares. And the Rider's voice alone might make them scared. Especially the final scene where all the souls are pouring into Blackheart and his face is demonic is definitely one of the creepiest parts. It even creeped me out and I'm 22! So please don't let your young children see this. It is very aimed at teenagers and adults. Anyway, I liked this film. I would own it. Not the best superhero movie ever made but it's still pretty fun to watch if you have nothing else to do. But if you're looking for a GOOD superhero movie, then pass this one up. You will be sorely disappointed. But it was still pretty good. Thanks for reading my review!"

One thing that really bugged me was the fact that when we saw the teenage lovers Johnny looked about three or four years older than Roxie, and when they were grown up he was suddenly at least ten years older.

And the whole movie revolves around that plot. Throw in a lover as a hostage and teacher who was a Ghost Rider before him, and the whole movie is laid out. There are no plot twists and the fight scenes are horrible. The script was also badly written. The evil henchmen fight him one by one and get owned.

","this movie is below average. just because there are well known actors and lots of effects does not excuse the fact that this movie sucks. the story jumps around too much. the villains are killed before we even know who they are. i think they tried putting too much into and hour and half. im a comic fan as well as a movie fan and i must say that the ""story plots"" are already written for you; in the comics. how do screenwriters and directors mess it up. there seems to be a trend forming with all of these different movies that have made the leap from the comic book to the screen. ie: elektra, daredevil, punisher, the hulk just to name a few. don't get me wrong there are some good comic movies out there. there's just so much material already available from the comic how do they go wrong?"

","I had never heard of Ghost Rider prior to the movie. Since there are so many comic book films coming out these days I figured it couldn't be all that bad. The first half of this movie was rather engaging until Blackheart shows up and points to the rest being a special effects fest. That's usually a sign that the story is going to get weak and it did. Nicolas Cage (Johnny) was reasonably cast for the role of Ghost Rider. That's a guy who makes a deal with Mephistopheles (the Devil's right hand in some myths) to save his dad but the deal turns out to be sour. Now he's forced to work for Mephy and his main task is to kill Blackheart, who happens to be Mephy's son. Eva Mendes - usually playing the role of a tough girl - is oddly cast as Johnny's love interest whose only role in the film seems to be to kiss him and show us her ample bosom at every (yes, every) opportunity.<br/><br/>Donal Logue (of Grounded for Life fame) plays Johnny's buddy but his character is poorly developed, like most in the film with the exception of Johnny's, of course. In Ghost Rider mode, ""bonehead"" Johnny looks a little bit too CG. So do some of the other evil spirits who have sharp teeth appearing on the face every now and then for some reason. Like Venom in Spider-man 3, are repeated showings of teeth (coupled with a high-pitched, fast, shrieking sound) supposed to scare us? It would seem the movie was simply not aiming for a slightly mature audience. Overall, it's generally entertaining but has little depth and falls short of full movie-going satisfaction."

","Cage just sucks. Whoever was in charge of this one was bored, and the CGI is lackluster. It really looks just thrown together. The story is terrible, and the villains are terrible. I guess most of the comic book movies have sucked these days. Gay superman sucked, Spiderman was decent, Hulk was sad, XMen was pretty decent. What the hell is this 10 lines of text requirement all about. The movie sucks.. I don't need 10 lines to say that, or pass along my opinion to other would-be viewers. Ghostrider is worth a download on P2P, but it's not worth even 5.99 in the bargain bin, which is where it will end up. For those who liked it I really have to question what gets you going. The comics are cool, but this movie is lame. Thumbs Down 4/10."

","Johnny Blaze (Cage) sells his soul to the devil (Fonda) to help his father and his girl friend (Mendez)<br/><br/>The Ghost Rider is based upon a Marvel Comic character. I never read that one.<br/><br/>This production was very good as far as the CGI went and some auto stunts as well. Nicolas Cage is one of the actors I really enjoy watching, the others being Jack Palance, Patrick McGoohan, and sometimes Jack Nicholson. But, on the whole, there was a big letdown for me.<br/><br/>The movie started too slow with too much time spent on Johnny Blaze's youth before he became the Ghost Rider. The dialogue here suffered too between Johnny and his father (Bret Cullen) and Johnny and Roxanne (Mendez) and Johhny and the Devil (Fonda). Hope they didn't use the dialogue from the comics. In comics the dialogue works, but to actually say the lines in a movie..well, they don't always translate well. OK, forget the Batman comic, TV dialogue.<br/><br/>There was too much watching Ghost Rider with head, arms, legs and bike all aflame. That was okay, but I came to see Nicolas Cage one of the actors I really enjoy watching. When Cage did appear without flames he didn't disappoint. He is always good. <br/><br/>The rest of the cast were fine, stilted dialogue and all. Can't blame them, but the director should have upgraded conversations to present-day give and take. The best dialogue was between adult Johnny Blaze (Cage) and Sam Elliott, the caretaker (of the cemetery). Someone forgot to tell Peter Fonda that this wasn't a play and a little too much soliloquy crept into his lines, but I am being picky here. He was fine. Not often that we see him.<br/><br/>The cops treated the Ghost Rider as Public Enemy Number One and we really didn't see an acknowledgement that the cops realized Ghost Rider was one of the good guys. Maybe Ghost Rider II, eh? And, I do hope Nicolas Cage plays the part again because, as noted, he is one of the actors I really enjoy watching. <br/><br/>Violence: Yes, Sex: No, Nudity: No, Language:No"

","It would have been a better movie if the director really did read the comic book and knew the history. In the interviews he said why would the devil give him all that power and fight against him, that doesn't make since to me. Well, because the devil never gave him any powers. He infused different souls into Blaze. And after Roxy save Blaze, one soul was trapped inside. That's where the power comes from. The soul was Zarothos, he was weaken and Blaze was able to tap into his power. Later in the comic, the demon was able to take control and use Blaze for his own purposes. Blaze then struggles to rid himself of the demon and protect the ones he cared about. Seriously, read the comic first. A little research could have made this a far better movie."

","Ghost Rider comes from the man who brought us Ben Affleck's Daredevil, but where Daredevil was made under the pretense of making a good superhero movie, Ghost Rider goes full throttle into the realm of awful for awful's sake. Howard the Duck comes to mind when I think of it, now.

You can't blame him - he's making the most out of it.<br/><br/>But what is it? It's a mix of a romantic comedy, supernatural thriller, comic book superhero movie, action and horror, and and fails at every one.

But it's so half-baked, I dare you not to laugh when Sam Elliot makes his exit. <br/><br/>Trades say there's work on a sequel, which, in all honesty, I would watch in a minute."
"lagriff05","2","0","1","16 June 2007"," Horribly generic and clichéd
","(written March 2007)<br/><br/>I'm starting to hate these comic book movies. The Spiderman movies were a burst of fun and had great actors, although they were pretty mediocre in the grand scheme of things. Fantastic Four played it safe and was pretty dull and unremarkable, but kinda fun all the same. And this one is just...cheesy as all get out, honestly. This is also the most cliché and deriative movie I've seen...ever, maybe, stealing just about every action cliché imaginable. But more on that in a little bit.<br/><br/>So teenage motorcyclist Johnny Blaze made a deal with the devil to cure his father's cancer. The next day, his father is killed in a bizarre motorcycle accident, and the devil, Mephistophales, warns Johnny that he'll be back for him someday. Fastforward 15 years or so, and Johnny is on top of the world, a star motorcyclist who does the most dangerous stunts imaginable. By night, he studies religious texts alone in his living room, with books piled upon books, preparing for his ""sign."" One night, Mephistophales appears to Johnny again, telling him to go after Blackheart, his son, who is aiming to steal a scroll that contains the thousands of souls of the citizens of an old western town. When Johnny's high school sweetheart shows up again, things complicate...<br/><br/>While this movie has some entertaining moments, such as Johnny's stunts on the freeway, it's mostly just dull and clichéd. It's also very cheap and even feels like some stupid 80s B flick at times, although it's supposed to be a world class Hollywood blockbuster. The CGI sucks, but then again, we can't really expect much else. This movie feels really shallow and modernized, too, very clichéd. The romance between Johnny and Roxanne is pretty stereotypical of these kinds of movies, and it feels like the directors just read Die Hard's script and the ones for a couple of 90s superhero cartoons and mashed the romance elements from those into this movie. The acting is nondescript at best, and the directing is pretty standard for these 'superhero' movies, but it seems to lack the epic, cinematic punch that Fantastic Four and Spiderman 2 had. I wish that was all that was wrong with this...<br/><br/>...but this is also the cheesiest chunk of lameness I've ever seen! Seriously, what is this? Just read some of the dialogue for this, especially from our villains, who are reduced to mere cartoon clichés due to their awful, awful lines. Ghost Rider's appearance and that flaming motorcycle are an example of cheese that works, because it's pretty cool sometimes, and in fact, most of what Ghost Rider says was acceptable to me, because I don't mind some cheese, and it's pretty cool. ""Your soul is stained with the blood of innocents...look into my eyes!"" I can't help but find that cool. The villains are abysmal, though, especially Blackheart, who is meant to be scary and intimidating, but instead makes me snicker at how lame he really is. I didn't feel threatened by him at all through the movie, nor any of his henchmen. And Mephistophales has really bad lines too, not really appearing as evil or foreboding in the least.<br/><br/>I mentioned before that this movie is extremely deriative and cliché of almost every other action/superhero movie out there, and it is. In the first 5 minutes of the movie, Johnny's father is killed, and he swears revenge, and then we see him as this take-no-prisoners, motorcycle-toting adult, who is apparently everyone's big hero now. His high school sweetheart shows up, and she's absolutely gorgeous now, with breasts the size of her head. And we have Johnny's best friend and sidekick, who serves no purpose except to be used as a scapegoat in the end of the film. We have the wise old mentor character, and an evil villain with an evil laugh and dark clothing. Couldn't this be a number of other movies? Can't they do better than this?! I can't really recommend this to anyone, unless you enjoy this much cheese. I have no problem with cheesiness, but this movie crosses the line into the boundaries of absolute lameness, and that's what I have a problem with. I also have a problem with how this movie has no original ideas at all, none. Zip. Nada. Nein. Zero. There are pros to this one, and it's not that terrible, but it's certainly a waste of time. If you want cheesy superhero movies, go rent Spiderman or it's sequel. If you want a good action movie, rent Die Hard. If you want something dark and vengeful, The Crow is a good pick. This one just fails."
"zardoz-13","3","0","1","16 June 2007"," Supernatural Skullduggery of a Superficial Sort
","You know a $120 million plus movie is in big trouble when the most entertaining character appears in only one scene. Moreover, she defies the status quo ideal of the Hollywood babe. Rebel Wilson plays an overweight Goth chick that ""Ghost Rider"" saves from a vicious mugger. During a TV news interview, she describes her rescuer and flutters her fingers around her head to illustrate the flames that engulfed Ghost Rider's bone-white skull. Clever, off-beat and hilarious as this memorable scene is, ""Daredevil"" writer-director Mark Steven Johnson fails to deliver anything as comparatively fresh and spontaneous in his big-screen adaptation of ""Ghost Rider,"" essentially supernatural skullduggery of a superficial sort. No, I haven't read the Marvel Comic, but what I have seen in them surpasses anything in the 110-minute, PG-13 rated Columbia Pictures' release. Altogether, ""Ghost Rider"" suffers chiefly from hackneyed writing, lackluster villains, and pointless action scenes. ""Ghost Rider"" lacks the epic scale of ""Superman,"" ""Batman,"" ""Blade,"" ""X-Men,"" and ""The Punisher."" Nevertheless, despite all these shortcomings, ""Ghost Rider"" does boast a first-rate, hypnotic cast and impressive digital special effects. Neither compensate in the long run for the unimaginative screenplay so unless you are a hardcore ""Ghost Rider"" disciple you can stand the wait until this opus hits DVD and save yourself a fistful of bucks. <br/><br/>""Ghost Rider"" unfolds in chronological order. We see Johnny Blaze, portrayed early on by handsome young newcomer Matt Long, at age seventeen. Mind you, the resemblance between Long and Cage is negligible. Johnny discovers to his horror that his madcap motorcyclist father, Barton Blaze (seasoned TV star Brett Cullen), has been diagnosed with terminal cancer and his chances of survival are remote. In saunters an elegantly-clad, perfectly coiffed Mephistopheles (Peter Fonda of ""Easy Rider"") with a cane. Meph offers to save Barton's life if Johnny will sell him his soul. Johnny bows to the devil's demands. Miraculously, Barton's doctor gives him a clean bill of health. Nevertheless, Barton dies tragically in the next scene when he crashes on the jump ramp and is burned to death. Predictably, Johnny explodes with rage, but he decides to live up to his end of the bargain, so dumps his pretty girlfriend Roxanne Simpson (Raquel Alessi) and goes off to become a legendary motorcyclist stunt master in the tradition of Evel Knievel. Nicolas Cage takes over as a grown-up, laid-back Johnny Blaze and he drives his manager Mack (Donal Logue of ""Blade"") around the bend with one impossible stunt after another. At one point, Johnny makes a clearly impossible jump over four Black Hawk army helicopters in a football stadium without getting a scratch. Nothing in Mark Steven Johnson's script approaches realism and anybody who takes ""Ghost Rider"" literally should be buckled into a straitjacket and bundled off to the nearest insane asylum for psychiatric evaluation. This Faustian fable about a motorcycle daredevil who is transformed after the sun goes down into a sinister skull-headed bounty hunter for Satan features the most anemic Satan since Elizabeth Hurley essayed the role in ""Bedazzled."" Traditionally, Mephistopheles is the toughest, most treacherous villain on the books, but this Meph falls back on Ghost Rider to fend off competition from his upstart son Blackheart (""American Beauty's"" Wes Bentley in cadaverous pale white-face make-up), who wants to usurp his father. At this point, Johnson's script becomes convoluted as all get-out and introduces a cemetery caretaker (Sam Elliot of ""Rush"") who keeps our hero abreast of all major plot revelations, including his own that he was once a Ghost Rider on horseback. Basically, aside from his flaming skull, Ghost Rider uses his penetrating glare, called a Penance Stare, to make his victims experience the anxiety of those that they have tormented. Naturally, this doesn't have much of an effect on Blackheart and they engage in a running fight. Teaming up with Blackheart are three cool-looking reprobates, Earth, Wind, and Fire. Like Blackheart, our hero takes his time dispatching these ruffians in looks only, otherwise ""Ghost Rider"" would have been twenty minutes shorter (and probably better). <br/><br/>Nicolas Cage takes none of this half-baked hocus pocus seriously and plays Johnny Blaze with a bad hair-cut for laughs, gobbling jelly beans out of a martini glass rather than drinking while he relaxes to Karen Carpenter 'sTop-40 songs, until the surprise ending that leaves the movie open for a sequel. Peter Fonda does as little as possible and plays Satan as if he were a mannequin, but at least he is stylish in his restraint. Sexy Eva Mendes plays Roxanne as a grown-up who has become a Lois Lane-type TV news reporter than keeps track of Johnny's exploits. Inevitably, to get to Ghost Rider, Blackheart kidnaps Roxanne and the two guys clash in the desert at a western town. The former Ghost Rider (Sam Elliot) saddles up and rides out into sand with Ghost Rider for the showdown. Once they arrive, the old grizzled Ghost Rider pitches our protagonist his shotgun and then hightails it. Talk about a waste of Sam Elliot. Blackheart never poses a genuine threat to Ghost Rider and our hero decks his unsavory henchmen as easily as if they were ten-pins in a bowling alley. The CGI of Ghost Rider riding a gravity-defying motorcycle vertically up a skyscraper and then wielding a blazing chain whip to attack an airborne helicopter looks terrific (with an obvious nod to ""King Kong"") but means little in the overall scheme of things. As ominous as the hero looks after his transformation into a skeletal emissary of Satan, ""Ghost Rider"" emerges as more kooky than spooky."
"proteusphi","4","0","1","15 June 2007"," A flashy, hollow popcorn flick.
","Oh lets do the good, the bad, and the ugly with this one. <br/><br/>The GOOD: I really don't know too much about the character in the comic book (though I've heard of him), but I would say this is as good a treatment of Ghost Rider that you're going to get. The graphics in this movie and the awesome visuals are truly good looking. They spared no expense on the special effects, making Ghost Rider's flaming head look pretty realistic (if not somewhat silly, because it was a tad small for his torso.) <br/><br/>The story is entertaining, despite its rough spots. The whole imagery and idea of Johnny Blaze is captured really well. We see Nicolas Cage as this thrill seeking loner who's almost trying to put himself out of his misery, by doing the only thing that makes him feel alive. I felt that the bad guys' characters could have been fleshed out more, and the scene just before the end was a little weak, but otherwise it was good entertainment value.<br/><br/>The BAD: Acting wise....it was joke. I'm sorry, but I was laughing to myself in the theater. It really was awful. This was NOT a role for Nicolas Cage--he was wrong for it. His accent is so fake that it was hilarious to hear him talk like that for so long. They should have gotten a handsome unknown actor, who actually HAS that kind of accent. It wouldn't have detracted from the role in the LEAST--Cage offers nothing to it, other than the box office draw of his name. The female lead, likewise had acting problems. I kept getting the impression that she was given just too many bad takes and finally the director said 'screw it!', and went with the ""best one"" she could do. Don't get me wrong, she's a pretty face, but that's about all she has to offer this picture.<br/><br/>The story has some really questionable writing as well. Some events in the movie make no sense at all. <br/><br/>*SPOILER* Like the part where the police show up at Blaze's house--all 20 of them--toting shotguns and swat gear. How they managed to link a stunt man to the wanton carnage in the streets AND the murders from earlier in the movie where people were FROZEN to death...is a complete mystery. Also the fight scene with the wind demon was.....I'm sorry again, laughable. They way Ghost Rider dispatches his floating foe is just silly. One also wonders what Blaze would have done if his opponent had actually made adequate use of his flight powers, rather than just floating around in one place. The scene right before final fight seems tacked on and pointless--kudos to the visual effects though. *SPOILER*<br/><br/>The UGLY: The roles of the demons in the seem tacked on as well. I would have rather scene Ghost Rider fighting urban street crime that was influenced by the main demon guy. That would have made sense. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, the main villain's motivations are a bit shaky, like the rest of the movie--think about how he is defeated in the end of the movie. Also, Ghost Rider's Penence Stare seems about as threatening and useful as Wonder Woman's magic lasso of truth. And I couldn't get over Ghost Rider's laugh! It was intolerable during the transformation sequences, half-way destroying the tone of the scene; and after awhile it just got corny. He's Ghost Rider, not the Headless Horseman...<br/><br/>All in all, Ghost Rider is a very flashy and entertaining film. It is also poorly acted, juvenile, and badly written. Normally I would give it a 5, but they hyped this film so much last year that my friends and I were expecting SO much more than this. So it earns a 4 out of 10 from me."
"TheLotusRevolution","2","0","1","14 June 2007"," Another horrible adaptation from the man behind Daredevil
","After watching Daredevil, I became a little weary of these comic book adaptations, as they seemed to swarm out one after the other onto the big screen. With Ghost Rider, a trés-cool anti-hero in the realm of Marvel comics, I admittedly had certain preconceived notions about how the movie would harmonize with its comic counterpart. However, this movie took no longer than 10 minutes to disappoint.<br/><br/>As a movie, Ghost Rider fails to impress. What may have been lost in translation could have accelerated this blockbuster mess into a somewhat enjoyable movie. Many have warned not to expect Oscar-caliber performances from Cage, Mendes, and the other actors. However, the shallow characters cannot be overlooked. The acting overall was deplorable, and the actors themselves were too old. Nicolas Cage fails to make the connection between himself and his younger counterpart. The anger and passion with which the younger Johnny Blaze confronts his problems seems to fade away with age. Cage becomes a robot at best while Mendes shows off her breasts like they are the third and fourth actors on screen. Not to mention the ""romance"" between Cage and Mendes....well, it does not work in any way, remaining completely unbelievable after the first 5 minutes of the movie. The dialogue of the cowboy graveyard caretaker is unintelligible. His Southern growl forbids the viewer from understanding a damn word he's saying.<br/><br/>...and that's only the ""good"" guys. The ""bad"" guys are no better. Three of them serve absolutely no purpose. Since I am not an intimate fan of the comics, I am unaware of their purpose. However, in the movie, they are neither intimidating nor powerful in any noticeable way. Who will stop the Ghost Rider?? Generic henchman-man who plows a semi into a train to phase the Ghost Rider? A puddle monster whose powers of grabbing feet in the form of a puddle and making scary faces surely could have stopped the Ghost Rider? The furious wind demon who has the undeniably superb ability to fly around and be bad-as-hell? I was more worried that Blaze would die from his motorcycle wheel bashing his helmet in on his face. All the enemies were easily expendable except for ""Blackheart"" around who the movie is based. Yet, his performance remained so lackluster throughout the movie even his role in the movie is questionable. Even Peter Fonda as the devil cannot imbue the dirt of this movie. The struggle for hell never materializes due to Blackheart's wimpy demeanor versus Peter Fonda's obvious experience. Unfortunately, the director wanes from the Ghost Rider storyline of this movie involving Blackheart too often to give Eva Mendes' boobs another close up. Lastly, the facial expression of the random mugger as the Ghost Rider confronts him was priceless; check it out if you do in fact rent this movie.<br/><br/>The technicalities of this movie mostly fizzle along with the acting. The special effects were decent if not at times good. However, the writing. That script must have been written by a five year old fan of the comics with ADHD. Continuity that would have tied all of the loose ends together does not exist. The movie jumps from one scene to the other seamlessly...literally. The movie fell apart, quickly. Some of the details regarding stab wounds and gunshots do not pan out either. Someone with the powers of the devil, vulnerable to knives, but not bullets, and performing death-defying jumps across football fields over helicopters without any Satanic input? I think not.<br/><br/>Do not suspend disbelief to fall captive to the world forged by this horrible script. This movie would make a good replacement for sleeping pills. I found myself simultaneously falling asleep and laughing my ass off over the whole debacle. It's not worth the time or the effort to get off your butt and rent this horrible film. However, I HIGHLY suggest this film if you are about to have a party where everybody laughs at sorry excuses for movies in a Mystery Science Theater 3000 fashion. Lord have mercy."

","I feel a bit guilty writing a negative review of this movie. As another reviewer wisely reminded, it's not like i didn't know it was about a flaming skeleton on a bike!! So I was willing to have some fun with it, and Eva Mendes is only in so many movies, so you HAVE to watch the ones she does.<br/><br/>So, ""Ghost Rider"", the movie. The plot revolves around the dreaded ""sell your soul to the devil"". However it takes years for the devil to get his end of the deal, so Johnny Blaze (Ghost Rider's Clark Kent) has become a world famous motorcycle stunt rider. Who am I kidding..... the plot developments and character motivations are so goofy, I can't go thru with it.<br/><br/>The screenplay is so bad that even a sincere effort by Nick Cage and the breathtaking outfits of Eva Mendes can't save things. For example, in his 1st night as a ""Ghost Rider"" (there have been others?????) he causes about $100M in damages and the total superhero activity for the night is that he saves someone from a mugger. The special effects are impressive enough, but I never got a feel for what they were after. Were they suppose to be spooky or comical or dazzling? They wind up much more video game graphics than real. The net result is a 'by the numbers' sequence of battle scenes (he takes out the Big Bad guy's sidekicks - one by one), a rescue of the lovely Eva and a finale that leaves room for an sequel. Please don't! <br/><br/>All in all, the reported $110 million budget is up there on the screen, its just nothing I'd want to endure again."

First Johnny Blaze's wife killed by muggers becomes his father who dies of a motorcycle accident. Then he spends as much time trying to woo an old flame as he does avenging his fathers death.

","Picture this, A father and son in a carnival doing daredevil stunts and one day his father is diagnosed with cancer. The devil turns up on the sons doorstep and offers him help in offer for his soul. This sets the scene for the comic which to be honest isn't the best of story lines for a hero story but it seems to work on paper. In Cinema its a different story altogether. <br/><br/>The cast for this film were poorly chosen as Nick seems to be a very powerful actor and has a great screen presence for many other genres but not this one. As the film progresses this comes more and more evident. The story line loses its way somewhere in the film and for some reason we have a hero and no real bad guy. This is kind of a fundamental to be honest and makes the whole film rather pointless.<br/><br/>There was not one redeeming feature in this film. This has to be some of the most terrible acting and story I have ever seen. Original comic was not done any justice and Nick Cage was horrific in this. The dialog was positively comical, I mean sometimes you could almost see the actors smirking as they say their lines. This has to be the worst of the worst for 2007 films by far. I was gutted I paid money to see it in the cinema..."

","I didn't really know who Ghost Rider was. I knew he was from Marvel, but I just didn't recognize him, so after researching him on Wikipedia, I grew to like the story and I wanted my dad and me to go and see it.<br/><br/>After the awesome opening movie with the story of the Ghost Rider, you are introduced to Johnny Blaze, who starts out as a teenager who signs away his soul to save his father from cancer. Unfortunately, the Devil decides to play dirty and makes his father die in a 'freak' motorcycle accident. After breaking the heart of his girlfriend and leaving his dreams behind, we find Johnny several years later, all grown up and is a professional motorcycle stunts man. After spending more than 20 minutes of the movie showing Johnny going after his old girlfriend, Roxanne, you are finally given the point to the movie.<br/><br/>Mephisto's (the Devil) son has broken free from Hell and now wants his own kingdom. Unfortunately, it's on Earth. The Devil then calls upon his bounty hunter, Ghost Rider (aka. Johnny) and in one of my favorite introductions, you are given Mr. Flamey Skull! Yay! Fight fight fight! Awesome special effects! Annnnnd . . . Johnny turns back to normal.<br/><br/>This is the biggest flaw in the movie: the fact that the scenes when Johnny is human become SO boring! I was sitting there, ready to shout ""Shut the heck up and get back to Ghost Rider!"" It's like mixing a soap opera with a Spawn movie. The reason why the human scenes are so lousy is because there is hardly anything going on during these times that add to the plot. Only the fight scenes and parts with Ghost Rider actually drive (no pun intended) the story forward.<br/><br/>There is no possible way, in Hell or Earth, that ""Ghost Rider"" will live up to becoming as famous as ""Spider Man"", ""Spider Man 2"", and the obvious block buster hit ""Spider Man 3"". It is a tad better than ""Daredevil"" in forms of special effects and action scenes, but is also down near ""Hulk"" territory because of the boring human script. Only when Ghost Rider is out on the field that you will begin to eat your popcorn in excitement and then, you get to take a nice nap afterwards and wake back up to see more cool special effects. People would just eat up CG effects will go nuts for this movie, but are probably looking forward to having that gourmet meal that is ""Spider Man 3"".

","16-year-old boys of all ages will have a grand time with ""Ghost Rider,"" the upteenth movie adaptation of a beloved Marvel Comics series. The rest of us who don't fall into that particular demographic, however, will be left scratching our heads wondering what all the fuss is about.<br/><br/>Johnny Blaze is a death-defying motorcycle stuntman with a passion for The Carpenters who, as a youth, sells his soul to the devil in a desperate bid to prevent his father from dying of cancer. However, as is the Old Boy's wont to do, Satan tricks the hapless youngster by killing the father anyway, leaving Johnny to spend the rest of his life wandering the earth alone and loveless (despite adoration from legions of loyal fans) until he is finally called upon to assume his role as a ""ghost rider,"" a bounty hunter for the devil who turns into a flaming skeletal figure that rides around at night collecting all the bad souls and dragging them kicking and screaming to their destiny in the hellish underworld.<br/><br/>""Ghost Rider"" boasts a simplistic good-versus-evil plot line, a stylized, otherworldly look, and a passel of pretty damn cool special effects to keep the fan-boys happy. It also, however, suffers from uneven acting, faulty logic (why, for instance, would a minion of Satan go around battling evildoers and rescuing the innocent?), and a romantic subplot that is bland and tedious enough to serve as a signal for restroom and concession stand breaks for the die-hard action aficionado.<br/><br/>Nicholas Cage may be a trifle long in the tooth at this point to be playing a comic book super hero type, and Eva Mendes is little more than a pallid Lois Lane wannabe as his TV reporter girlfriend, Roxanne Simpson. Luckily, there's some fun to be had at the hands of a couple of old pros who basically walk off with the film: Peter Fonda (looking more and more like his famous dad in his later years) as a suave, glinty-eyed Mephistopheles; and Sam Elliott as an old, enigmatic cemetery caretaker who may be able to help Johnny in his efforts to eradicate evil and free himself from the curse he's under (unfortunately, nothing much is done with Elliott's character except to ride him off into the sunset at the end. A pity). Their performances, along with the high-flying CG graphics, keep the movie from becoming a total loss."

","This is simply the best windshield movie to come out in years. For those of us lucky enough to live near one of the last drive-ins, this movie presents the best opportunity to incorporate your vehicle into the view experience. There are more than enough point-of-view shots from the bike, creating the illusion of movement as your car tears across the movie screen. Try going straight up the mirror windowed building with your tires leaving snakes of flame, it's fun! All this is enhanced by setting green sticky nugs alight. In fact, play a game where you smoke a bowl every time Nick Cage's skull catches fire (those without drive-in access will have to wait for DVD, poor shmoos.) This movie has many appeals for the Herbal-American viewer, such as the first superhero who sits around watching a lot of TV. Lines like ""I'm watching TV"", ""I watch a lot of TV"" and ""What's wrong, don't you people ever watch TV?"" will resonate in any stoners' resin smeared heart. Peter Fonda is the devil, so bring that Easy Rider (also seven leaves) soundtrack in the car with you. The plastic bag kid who sells pot in American Beauty (five leaves) is back from oblivion as the villain, Hell yeah! The visuals are primo; we have computer animation used very sparingly, creating the Mickey Effect, so named after the CGI that was used on Woody Harrelson after he vomited the shrooms in Natural Born Killers (eight leaves.) The Mickey Effect allows the basic composition to be rooted in reality while adding wild embellishments in places you wouldn't expect. Lots of weird things going on in the eyes. The filmmakers also understand the aura of cool around the 70s-ish source comic and are able to get it into the big screen devil's bounty hunter. That's what keeps this from being a Spawn (four leaves) or a Phantom (Seeds and Stems). Back you fattest bag and get to Ghost Rider, or a least smog out in the parking lot so that you can take you inner windshield into the multiplex with you. Seven Leaves: High Glow. One of the best, has lots of wonder to make your head spin."

Important facts are presented by-the-way and no one is wondering where the information comes from or why it is important. The same with important figures. And the overall told ""story"" is so flat that it slips through a closed door.<br/><br/>And also who thinks ""Hey, it's an action movie, so don't worry about the story too much"" will be badly disappointed. The ""action"" in this movie is badly done. The fights are not exciting after all. Especially the three minor Fallen Angels are really a joke - sent back to hell in seconds. The final fight astonished me at exactly one point (the solution of the ""I have no soul""-problem), but this was only for me being so bored all the time, that I stopped thinking about that really early in the movie.<br/><br/>At last: There are so many logical errors and story-holes in this movie - you can't count them. Also there are continuity errors. The production is just badly done, from the first scrapbook to cutting. Yes, cutting. This is some part for itself. It's juts horrible. In some scenes, important in-betweens seemed to be cut out - at least that is, why I am thinking the movie is told in a jump-by-jump manner.<br/><br/>Finally: The movie is really bad. Don't watch it, if you don't have to. I think fans of the comics will be disappointed. And also fans of Nicolas Cage. I really liked him in ""Lord of War"". But in ""Ghost Rider"" his acting is poor. Not to speak of Eva Mendez, which was definitely only integrated for the male audience. That can be proved by any scene she is appearing in."

","Ghost Rider has never really been a big title for Marvel comics. Originating in the 70s, the first incarnation was a bit of a mess really, with cheesy stories, and dialogue akin to a medieval monk's writings (all ""Thy powers art foulest!"" and the like). Over the past couple of decades attempts were made to make the comic more serious, to quite a good degree  but the popularity of the character didn't really increase. There were hopes that this film would be akin to Blade, being a more mature comic book vigilante tale.<br/><br/>Unfortunately it is even more of a mess than the original comics were! The film tells the tale of Johnny Blaze (Nic Cage), a stunt rider who makes a deal with the devil (well, with Mephistopholes anyway) and finds himself transformed into Ghost Rider. His task is to reap all the evil souls and send them back to hell, and in particular he must get the soul of Blackheart, a rogue agent of Hell. Along the way he gets advice from a mysterious (in a 'oh complete lack of surprise when his past is revealed' kind of way) grave-keeper (Sam Elliot). Can he complete his task and save his own soul at the same time? So, where does it all go wrong? Well, for a start the delayed release date ""to touch up the effects"" didn't do much, and we have yet another badly CGI filled film. Ghost Rider's skull is impressive on its own, but sits (wobbly) on top of a very stiff body which makes him look like he has arthritis! Then there is Cage's complete excitement at finally playing a comic book role, which meant he forgot how to act! Throw in some of the most humdrum action scenes  only a skilled director can make a chase scene which involves cop cars, a flaming bike, and a helicopter really boring  and some totally pointless scenes (""I still have one ride left in me!"" for one....what was the point?) and the result is a film that puts comic-book movies back decades! As for the 'penance stare'  it makes the victim see a swirly mess of images that reminded me of watching Mummy Returns and Van Helsing...so I guess that explains why it kills your mind! This is a huge, kiddified disappointment of a film, and it is no wonder that Stan Lee doesn't cameo in it (he always pops up in the first film in a Marvel franchise). He must have seen some rough cuts and refused to put his name to it."

The details, which makes a film more interesting, went straight to oblivion, because ""who cares about them if the special effects are cool""? ""And let's add some action, too, so they'll be happy"".

Wheres the battle? there was no real fighting. All ghost rider did was walk around.... make stuff burn... and then do his soul burning thing. i figured him controlling his power would be a plot'ish point when he read it in the book, and hed fail at controlling it. buttttttt no. he goes 'i want to control you' and poof! fire hand. wow... suspense there! i actually caught myself staring out my window at one point. also what bothered me was he didn't get his soul back.... hes going to burn in hell... all for what appeared to me IMMEDIATELY was a cheap shot at a possible sequel.

","People say that if you've seen one film of a certain genre then you've seen them all. A war film is another war film etc. Now I've always disagreed with this statement until I saw Ghost Rider. If you have ever seen a film about a superhero, especially recently, then you have definitely seen this one already. Directed by the guy who brought us the equally bad 'Daredevil' this film is so formulaic it goes something like this: Ordinary person gets special powers. Doesn't like or understand them and their life starts to unravel. Bad guys turn up and the hero is only one that can stop them. Ordinary person now with powers starts to like them. Bad guys find hero's weakness to exploit. Looks like hero is done for. Hero wins the day and love of life. Little extra bit at end to set up for a sequel? It just goes from one boring set piece to another and the Ghost Rider isn't a particularly good superhero either, his two powers from what I can tell, is a flaming chain and a death stare. So if your good at jump rope and can close your eyes I think you'll be alright. Nicholas Cage isn't bad as Johnny Blaze/Ghost Rider but his one liners lie somewhere between the Terminator and Elvis, 'I like your jacket', 'don't mess with the monkeys or Karen' (said in a deep voice). It borders on cheese on too many occasions. The effects aren't that bad as Nicks face melts off to reveal the flaming skulled collector of souls and there is even a few laugh out loud comedy bits, look out for the television interview with the Goth girl for example, but it's just not enough to save this film from being just another churned out Marvel flick. Anyone thinking of coming out with another superhero film needs to really experiment with the genre to its full potential and not just copy the rule/comic book. It may work on paper and even be a fan boy's wet dream but to the casual film-goer this is just another disappointing blockbuster."

"moinsyyed","7","0","2","12 March 2007"," Not As Bad A Film As Critics Think
","let me just begin by saying that despite what critics say & the people who think they know about ghost rider based on no knowledge at all, this film isn't as bad a film as we've been led to believe. Having heard a few moans about fight scenes, dialogue & such i went into the movie with zero expectations (even though i've been a fan of the comics post-1994 during the Danny Ketch era). To my surprise i found that the film went far to make johnny blaze one of the most likable super heroes in film i have ever seen which i think is a great development as he wasn't one of the more widely popular heroes in marvel comics unlike spider man. Lets be honest,for a comic book film it is outstanding and did a great job with the 12a/pg13 rating it was given to work with & also made the underrated anti-hero more accessible to a new audience, (i mean why wait till your older to understand the comics/concept of GR when you can watch the film?). I realise people had a bone to pick with the humour on the film but to my surprise i found it quite refreshing as it off-set the darker moments quite well,showing what the burden of being the devils bounty hunter had done to his picturesque life. To address the point of the fight scenes being too short can i add the the 'devils bounty hunter' does exactly what it says on the label. I hardly think Ghost Rider would struggle against some lowly spirits. As weak a defence (but valid) as that is, i do still hope that the DVD release extends the water spirit scene & the awfully short fight between blackheart at the end (which was done very well visually & i realise now we were only meant to see undertones of blackhearts true form). Mark Steven Johnson and Nicholas Cage (to his credit) have done us Ghost Rider fans a great 'fan service' with this film & it should be merited for that at least. Yes, the dialogue was cheesy (specially on the part of Blackheart's dialogue & the pointing thing with Johnny Blaze/GR) & there were bits that i thought should not have been there but the film was very dark for a 12a/pg13 specially since they worked loosely from David Goyer's (Blade) script. The film isn't the worst marvel comic film as i can name a few that have been much worse such as 2 out of the 3 X-Men films, Punisher, Blade:Trinity,F4,Daredevil (The Theatrical Cut NOT The Dir.Cut DVD),Catwoman,3 to 4 out of 5 Batman's,Generation X etc...Ghost Rider's is a comic character worthy of development in film and i believe done right in future (crossed fingers for the sequel :D) it could be one of the darkest,coolest & (touch wood) 'best' comic movie made to that point.My only major qualm with the film was the inclusion on Roxanne (Eva Mendez) as eye candy. The film TOTALLY didn't need her there for most parts of the film and as Mac roughly put it ""everything was fine till she came along""!.I think the film was trying to cover the 'romantic' base a little too fondly, some of the dialogue between her & Johnny Blaze just reminded me of 'Hitch' :s. Overall great film, perfect for the big screen so lets hope the sequel corrects the mistakes from the first. Give it a chance, i mean Batman Begins came along and showed us that they could get him right & dark so ghost rider should be given the same chance :s"
"Bungle-9","6","0","1","11 March 2007"," Entertaining but lacks soul, ironically...
","I walked into a showing of Ghost Rider with the baggage of the bad reviews and other comments weighing on my subconscious, so I tried to leave my brain at the door and just enjoy it for what it was. I'm glad I did. There were plot holes, dodgy acting, lacks of character...but at the end of the day I was there for the action, the effects and the fun.<br/><br/>Nic Cage for me didn't seem to really believe in his role - he sort of spoke his lines and...well that's about it, he spoke his lines. Eva Mendes was better, with more conviction, as well as a considerable cleavage which I wasn't going to complain about. Were the huge dollops of silly outweighed by the entertainment of the show? I'm not so sure.<br/><br/>All in all I was entertained but not particularly stimulated by the movie. It's a Saturday night out (or in with a beer) kind of flick - unoffensive fun with great effects. Ultimately it just depends what you're looking for."
"al8587","3","0","2","11 March 2007"," Looks like Johnny Blaze didn't quite make leap to the big screen
","The concepts are relatively sound for a comic book film, however ghost rider still has much to be desired. Ghost rider follows the typical trend of comic book films containing an underpinning love story fused with action. The action initially starts at quite a fast paced rate, leaving the audiences anticipating a lavish battle of rider Vs daemon, however the action scenes sadly fall short as they do not deliver much of a fight, but more of an instant KO each and every time! Making the action element seriously lacking and leaving the audiences demanding more. The action is sidelined by the much more predominate love story between Blaze and his childhood sweetheart Roxanne, who spontaneously appears back in the fray before another of Blazes jumps, shot with painfully cheesy camera work, making you wonder how this film ever got such vast funding, moving the audience from one corny moment to the next, enveloping the storyline to its entirety, showing a server lack of script writing talent.<br/><br/>Although Nicolas Cage is a harden movie veteran by nowadays standards being in such classic films as Con air, gone in sixty seconds, face off, 8MM and even holding a place in Tarantino's upcoming film Grid house, we see him in this film struggling to pull off a reasonable role, and showing an overall dreadful piece of acting, resulting in many cheesy lines uttered throughout, making his role actually laughable. And the co-star is not much better with her very embarrassing moments within the script. The worst of which you see her produce a magic eight ball whilst waiting on Blaze! Although the actors are far from blameless i believe the real root of the problem stems from the writers and producers. Sidelining a potentially interesting action film from a much more old fashioned style love story, which lacks substances and originality.<br/><br/>Although not the worst film you will see this year it is hardly worth paying good money to watch, instead you could invest your money seeing this film on perhaps another super hero/ comic book film such as the Punisher or even X-men, or why not wait for Spiderman 3 later this year, or even watch another film instead like Hot fuzz if your after just an action film in the cinema. With all these alternatives there is no need to waste £7.20 or equivalent on a ticket to this 2 hour monstrosity."

","Who would have thought the Australian outback would one day become the One True West, where undead horsemen roam the plains in pursuit of the lost souls of greedy gauchos? This is one cool customer of a movie. It's hard to place in terms of genre. Mostly action, some suspense, minor chills, a little romance thrown in for good measure. Maybe that's a weakness, trying to cram in something for everyone, but ""Ghost Rider"" never tries to be more than the fairground attraction that it is. Small town bike-riding daredevil Johnny Blaze sells his soul to the devil (Peter Fonda) in return for his father's health. Much to his surprise, Johnny finds himself double-dealt by the prince of darkness. Ah, the moviegoer saw it coming. Johnny is now a middle aged has-been by day and the skull-faced Ghost Rider by night, throwing flames and wreaking havoc on the guilty. Nicholas Cage is in the shape of his life and obviously enjoying himself. Sam Elliott reprises his role of the Stranger from ""The Big Lebowski"". Recommended as a dating movie. Fun for the boys, sufficiently creepy for cuddling, but not rough enough to scare the ladies too much. My personal favorite is the way Roxy Simpson (Eva Mendes), stood up by the Rider at a fancy restaurant, clutches her sizable wine glass like a mug of hot chocolate. Thumbs down though for the tit-squeezing outfits she keeps wearing. I didn't like them in ""Hitch"", and I don't like them here."
"teh_mode","4","0","2","11 March 2007"," Bland, stupid and thoroughly rubbish
","I personally have no problem with vacuous throwaway entertainment, particularly movies that exist for no other reason than to allow your brain to disengage itself for at least 90 minutes of rip-roaring stupidity. Whether it is the joy of seeing Ace Ventura talk out of his ass or Sylvester Claude-Van Schwatzenegger shoot the hell out of anything that moves, as long as the movie delivers a maintainable level of perfunctory nothingness, my tolerance of its glaring lack of merit can be incredibly high. Comic-book adaptations are an interesting case however. Films like Sam Raimi's Spider-Man, or Brian Singer's X-Men series do genuinely have souls, not least emotional depth and resonance. I have not read the comic books of Ghost Rider, so I cannot tell you whether there was any sense of depth intended behind the surface of Marvel's daredevil fantasy. But since there isn't any in the film, one could only hope for a salvation of blistering action.<br/><br/>Our story begins with a young pre-ghost riding Johnnie Blanze, a hot-shot daredevil who performs death-defying stunts with his famous father. One day, stumbling across a screwed-up letter in a waste bin, he finds out that his dad is suffering from cancer, and can feel death knocking at his door. Blaze is then confronted by Peter Fonda (played by the devil), who offers to cure his father's cancer in return for young Blaze's soul. Blaze agrees, but it is not enough to save his father from death. Now under the commandment of Mephistopheles, Blaze continues his career as a world famous daredevil, but at night becomes the ""Ghost Rider"".<br/><br/>Nicholas Cage appears to know how silly this project is, and his over-reaching extremities do occasionally make the odd cameo appearance every time something physical happens to him. But even he seems relatively bored with himself throughout most of the film. We get the wide eyes, the maniacal smile, the floating arms, but what we don't get is a truly engaging hero. There is absolutely nothing remotely interesting about his relationship with Eva Mendes, and despite the death of his father, he doesn't appear to be terribly bummed out about it. Half way through the film, Sam Elliot turns up as a manly grave-digger who chops wood and says things like ""A man who sells his soul for love has the power to change the world."" in an incredibly gravely voice. Considering just how bland Peter Fonda makes the devil seem, it is only Elliot who livens up any scene he's in. But it is not enough to save this film.<br/><br/>The action and CGI is disappointing, particularly when Blaze actually turns into Ghost Rider. Making a fiery demon say things like ""You're going down!"" or ""Hey dirtbag! You're starting to p*ss me off!"" doesn't exactly send shivers down my spine, nor does it have any of the Gothic resonance of the Batman movies. Instead what we have is an incredibly stupid, utterly bland film that is so aware of its target audience that no sane person over the age of 14 could actually take it seriously. Hell the actors don't, so why should you?"
"lee_a_scott","7","0","1","11 March 2007"," Hell's baddies are no match for...anyone?
","The stated aim of Nic Cage and Mark Steven Johnson was to make a funny horror film, in the same vein as An American Werewolf in London. As a massive comics fanboy who is often blinded by that I still have to say  they didn't quite make it. However, Ghost Rider is still an enjoyable film, and certainly represents an improvement over Daredevil, Johnson's last Marvel outing. Cage is the star attraction, and his turn as Johnny Blaze strikes the right notes of comedy and confused sincerity, whilst Eva Mendes and Sam Elliott both give able support (and special mention to Mendes' breasts which virtually deserve a mention of their own on the cast list!) and, crucially, the look of the Rider has been nailed  an interesting mix of Blaze and Ketch, for those who know what that means. The big problem here is when they bring on the bad guys  all of whom are just a bit feeble, and are disposed of by GR with less fuss than swatting a fly. This lack of menace undermines the whole movie, as you never get a knock-down, drag-out scrap that you need to root for Ghostie in. Which is a shame, as with a tougher villain, this could have been a top film and, as it stands, it is just an enjoyable movie."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","0","1","9 March 2007"," Mildly entertaining, this is not among the best of comic book adaptations
","Assembling a good assortment of characters  devilish father and more devilish, icy son, three diabolic sidekicks embodying the elements of earth, wind and water, two generations of fiery, demon-hunting ghost riders  this movie should have been better. It's at about 15 minutes into the movie when I started to get the feeling that this one is not going to make the grade after all. Even Peter Fonda cannot salvage the lame script that tells of a Mephistopheles who tricks the protagonist into signing one of those soul-selling contracts by curing his father's cancer and then killing the old man through an accident. No classy devil will stoop that low. The movie makers obviously don't know that meanness doesn't a good villain make. A good, classy villain needs respectability.<br/><br/>Equally disappointing are the three sidekicks - Gressil, Wallow and Abigor. We don't expect them to be exceptionally impressive as we know that they are only warm up shows. But neither should they get away with such banal sloppiness. But the GCI is at least mildly interesting, to be fair.<br/><br/>A little better is Wes Bentley (remember the creepy kid with a movie camera in ""American Beauty""?) who plays Mephistopheles' rebellious son Blackheart. While the character is rather standard, his icy coldness is quite cool, if you know what I mean.<br/><br/>While predictable, the materializing of the previous ghost rider is quite delightful. This is, according to legend, the previous ghost rider who dared to disappear with an important contract, resulting in both villains, father and son, hot on his pursuit. This is where the current ghost rider comes in, a daredevil biker called Johnny Balze (modeled after Evel Kineval), played by one who may be the reason that brought you to this movie, Nicolas Cage.<br/><br/>Some movie critics seem to be uncomfortable with the mixing of Biblical reference with comic book character action flicks. To audience of secular cultures, these Biblical reference (""my name is legion"") are no more meaningful than Greek, Nordic or Chinese mythology or even J.R.R.'s Middle Earth.<br/><br/>One last thing  the use of the Carpenter's music is welcomed. The invoking of the melancholic opening of ""Superstar"" at the scene that introduces us to Blaze's lair is strangely nostalgic and affecting."

There was The Limey a few years back (talk about an underrated film, I loved it!) But Peter Fonda has no facade about him. I never see the tools of his trade peek through... Like so many other actors nowadays. Maybe I'm just growing up and more aware of it. Nicholas Cage is pure bluster, isn't he? I almost didn't go and see this because he was in it.

"tydester","2","0","2","9 March 2007"," Why I gave this two out of ten....
","I'm afraid there's not much intelligent to be said about this film. May I begin with addressing some critics who believe that this film's plot is thin. I disagree outright; the plot is not thin, it is non-existent. I have no further commentary on the issue; to me, the plot was about as discernible as the producer's reasons for releasing the film at all. I reserve criticisms of the plot to those who want to waste their time noting the film's infinite number of failings in that area. I don't.<br/><br/>Also, the punchlines and one-liners that litter this movie are not just hackneyed, not just boring, not just mediocre, and not just outright predictable - they are poorly executed as well. If you're going to throw in a cheesy one-liner comeback (this film is guilty of all too many instances of this), at least execute it fashionably or be original in one way or another. There is no attempt to be original here; quite the contrary, it appears as though this film sets out to cherry-pick the weakest and most predictable one-liners from the cesspool of hero-villain Motion Pictures and then attempt the seemingly impossible: make them worse. All else aside, this film deserves credit just for pulling off this feat.<br/><br/>Again I must disagree with critics: Ghost Rider is actually funny. I personally cried from a fit of laughter when the ""Ghost Rider""'s skull was set on fire, no seriously, this was so ridiculous it was funny. Sure it was in the comic and whatever, but give me a break - at least make the damn thing scary, not some flame-headed clown to be laughed at! The dark guy (I don't even remember his name, that's how forgettable the characters in this film are) also offers some comic relief with his gross overacting, thoroughly deserving of a part in Buffy the Vampire Slayer. No really, we get it, he's evil - cut the snake voice, satanic laugher and dark glances every two seconds, it's beyond a joke.<br/><br/>So what about the screenplay and acting? Well, to be fair, from Nicholas Cage through to Eva Mendes, the performances were not disappointing. They were far beyond that; in fact, disappointing would be a compliment. No more sugarcoating: from Mendes' fake breasts, female cliché (even that was poorly executed!) and forced dialog to Cage's botox-ed face, perpetually half-asleep daze and, of course, misfitted role, the acting just plain sucked.<br/><br/>To rub salt into the wounds, the soundtrack was like being hit by a train, and not in a good, Metallica kind of way, just a downright, pure and simple shredding of the eardrum, pounding of the skull, I-want-to-leave-the-cinema kind of way. Guitar riffs, fifty-decibel-too-loud orchestral pieces mixed with shrieks of the undead really aren't a good mix, trust me on this one.<br/><br/>So why did I give this film two stars when it deserved none? One for the special effects. The other for sheer astonishment - for the fact that, despite the director's blatant incapacity to make a film worth watching, a generous budget was nevertheless acquired for its production. This film should go down in history just for that awesome piece of cajoling on whoever's part it was. Amazing con-artistry. Kudos.<br/><br/>Otherwise, this is honestly the worst movie ever made."

It's main ""sins"" were the bad acting, the pointless moments of unfunny silliness and that it was developed for an audience of the age of 12 and a day. To be fair the visual effects were breathtaking and some fragments of a very few action scenes hinted on how the whole movie should have been made. But what do you expect from Nickolas Cage, come on, no really Why do they still choose him to ruin movies? But it wasn't all him, oh no, this vanilla-dark tale of the flame skull bike riding legend was doomed for so many reasons. It's a story about someone who sells his soul to the devil, going for PG 12 says a lot about how it's going to turn out. STOP MAIKING MOVIES FOR 8 YEAROLDS! I am a comic book reader and I am not criticising the story it's self, yes, it's from a comic book, it's a comic book movie, but so is Spider-man or X-men or the HULK, yet this new Marvel movie pales in comparison.<br/><br/>To sum up, if you must, just because it's a comic book movie, go see it.

","First and foremost, this film is not in the vein of Batman Begins. Nor is it very similar to Spider-Man 1 or 2. As a whole experience, it is probably most like Daredevil, the director's other stab at the Comic Book genre.<br/><br/>The start of he film is much too fast, therefore rushing the back story. It's a shame, because the film should have really utilised the western setting to a far greater degree. The atmosphere could have been really great, with John Carpenter style Gothic settings. Instead what we got was a fairly generic Texas.<br/><br/>However, the film was still entertaining. Cage is always fun to watch, and it was clear he was having fun in this role. The comic touches between him an Mendes was cool and definitely made the film flow better.<br/><br/>What I was there for was action, and Ghost Rider delivers this well. Although the film is rated a 12A in the UK, I was still fairly impressed with the special effects, where the people were all consumed of life. The CGI was blatant, but I didn't mind.<br/><br/>You see, the director's intentions were pretty obvious. This was an entertaining film, which had hardly any surprises, but did pack some good action and fun performances from Cage, Mendes, Bentley and Fonda.<br/><br/>There were moments of soppy-sweet bullshit that makes me cringe in films like these (the Spider-Man 2 wedding moment - eurgh) but overall it was a fun film.<br/><br/>6/10"

The effects were the single redeeming feature of the film but even they were flawed by the team that decided to make a hash job of the most important effect, the Ghost Riders Skull.

Movies like Spiderman, Superman Returns, X-men 1 & 2, Hellboy have shown that even the most fantastic of concepts can be both entertaining and thought provoking if married to a decent script and cast. Ghost Rider had neither of these, and the result is far from what many would call entertainment."

","When I heard that Nicholas Cage would take on the role of Jhonny Blaze AKA the Ghost Rider, I was a little bit unsure...of course he is a big comic book fan no doubt (after all he named his son Kal-El and has a Ghost Rider tattoo) but still I felt the part would not really appeal to him but with Christian Bale managing to pull of a great performance as Bruce Wayne/Batman I thought to my-self lets give him a try. Although I was not totally satisfied I was pleased with his take on as Jhonny Blaze and the film it-self was nothing short of brilliant. Don't get me wrong , its no Oscar winner and we all know that but one thing is for that it is enough to keep any comic book nerd happy. Although some things were changed around (which I dislike), I was willing to let them slide because the actual story seemed to fit in very nicely with the spirit of the comic. Motorcylce stuntman Jhonny Blaze sells his soul to the Devil Mephisto (played in style by Peter Fonda)so he can become the Ghost Rider whose job is track down anyone who escapes from hell. In this case the son of the Devil, Blackheart played to an impressive level by Wes Bentley who is here to unleash hell on earth. Although it is a wafer thin plot, the film moves at a fast pace and does not break off into tiny annoying little sub-plots . There are small doses of romance, and wit which don't through the film of its course. The special affects where dazzling and watching Blaze transform into the fiery entity was definitely something! Too conclude , this film was another great comic to film adaption which any person who is not familiar with the comics can watch and enjoy and gathering from the other positive reviews others are giving it, no one is really listening to the critics. Ghost Rider was not as good as the Spider-man , Blade and X-Men franchise but it certainly blazed passed Dare Devil and Hulk .<br/><br/>GHOST RIDER - 8.9 OUT 10 <br/><br/>LEGEND HAS IT THAT THE RIDER IS THE DEVIL'S BOUNTY HUNTER!

I know, sometimes directors will use familiar props from previous movies on which they, or the stars worked. Rob Reiner, who directed both ""This Is Spinal Tap"" and ""The Princess Bride"" used at least one prop from Spinal Tap in The Princess Bride.

","OK this was never going to be a critically acclaimed movie of substance. I went to see this with an opened mind, yes I knew the chances of this being anything other than average were slim, and yes I knew the dialogue and acting would be slightly cheesy to say the least.<br/><br/>So when I came out of the multi-plex my opinion of the film was that it was OK actually as I went in with the mind set of the above.<br/><br/>Nic Cage was a pretty good Johnny Blaze and Ghost Rider, there was not a lot the guy cold do with the script he was given, but what he did was as good as anyone could have achieved I'm quite sure. Eva Mendez was simply stunning and has out-standing beauty, but never had much chance to do anything ground breaking in this movie. The baddies in the movie let the side down, Wes and Peter were both below par with their efforts, and similarly to Eva, Sam Elloit didn't have much to play with but delivered an OK performance.<br/><br/>Special effects were very good considering the tight budget constraints, the direction was adequate if nothing stunning. Script was awful along with the plot, but to be expected in a comic book movie that tries to be nothing else other than a comic book movie unlike the fantastic Batman Begins and Spider-man. And that is why I will not be over critical regarding this movie. The film knows its cheesy, its knows its a bit silly, it knows it ain't ""The Departed"".<br/><br/>6/10- Not a bad effort, and in my opinion worth the investment of time and money to see it on the big screen."

His portrayal of the character is decent, although I did find a lot of the dialogue, particularly whenever they would start the whole ""is this my destiny' style monologues, very tedious and cliché. And this was certainly not Eva Mendes' best movie, although you think the director wanted it to be considering the ridiculous number of nice-and-close shots of her. Her character existed entirely to be a reactionary person to Cage's lead, which gives her almost no depth and masks what skill Mendes has behind the 'ooh, save the pretty girl' device. Cinematographically, it wasn't bad. I didn't see as many painful homages to other Marvel movies as we saw in Daredevil, although I might need a second look to confirm that. The effects seemed fine to me, although personally the skull CG didn't seem quite to par with the fire effects. All in all, it's a good 'turn off your brain' popcorn movie, but it's certainly not going in my top 10."
"slimjack","4","0","1","3 March 2007"," The Rider Has Yet To Shine
","The Ghost Rider is a super hero who never quite hit the big time. He has a great premise though. Motorcycle stunt man Johnny Blaze runs afoul of the Devil and is cursed to become the Rider, a demon who lusts only for vengeance. Clad in black leather, his head a blazing scull, sitting astride an infernal Harley, the Rider is truly an evocative image. He had his own comic, was canceled, resurrected, failed again and generally puttered in and around comic book limbo for years. Nevertheless he garnered a coterie of fans, one of whom was actor Nicholas Cage and so the Rider has been given a shot at shining on film as he never had in comics. Unfortunately he suffers the same fate in the theater as he did in print. Great concept. Great look. Mediocre follow through.<br/><br/>Like most comic book movies Ghost Rider is part origin story. We see Blaze make his pact and his first forays as the Rider. We learn the Devil creates him because he needs a hit man. There is more than one fallen angel out there and they are all gunning to take down the big man. In stark contrast to the supernatural power plays we also experience the touring stunt show milieu of Johnny Blaze, with his poker playing blue collar buddies, hick fans and motorcycle minutia. All this is great cinematic stuff yet Ghost Rider can't make it click.<br/><br/>The problems start with the acting. Ghost Rider may be Cage's baby but he is too old for the part. Fifteen years ago, perhaps, but now he's just too mature and weathered to believably play a guy named Johnny. Hampering matters further is Cage's habit of striking hokey Elvis poses, rendering Blaze ridiculous just at those moments we should care about him. Gorgeous Eva Mendes plays Blaze's girl. Though winning in Hitch, here Mendes exhibits little spark. She makes absolutely no connection with Cage romantic or otherwise. The Devil is blandly underplayed by Peter Fonda but his infernal rival's fair worse. When the lost angels fell to earth they passed through a trailer park and took the shape of the rednecks that dwelt there. In other words, the Princes of Hell are an unimpressive lot and the Rider earns little respect for his victories over them.<br/><br/>A movie like Ghost Rider can survive casting snafus but what it can't survive is the dimensioned of its premise. While the Rider is truly a wonder of CGI and everything his beleaguered fans could hope for, the movie takes this impressive creation and thrusts him into situations designed for humor rather than awe. As a consequence the Rider is never as terrifying as he should be. Finally, fatally, the poor Rider is not even the most impressive creature in his own movie! What could be more impressive than a flaming skeletal biker? How about a flaming skeletal cowboy riding a fiery horse? One played by Sam Elliott no less. This infernal cowboy is so striking and the casting so right that it further diminishes our interest in the nominal anti-hero.<br/><br/>In the end Ghost Rider is not a particularly bad film. It hangs together, has its fun moments and Mendes is very, very pretty. All of these are important considerations in a popcorn movie. Still if you are a fan of the Rider, or just have an affection for off-beat entertainment, you can't help but wonder if there weren't a better way to utilized such a cool concept."

When the day comes the guy isn't too happy about it, but he knows that he can't avoid it. From that point on he becomes the devils bounty hunter, set out on a dangerous mission.<br/><br/>Based on another Marvel comic this is the umpteenth superhero coming to the big screen and it must be said that it isn't the worst adaptation. It isn't the best either though. Cage doesn't really come of the screen as the rider and the story itself isn't half well enough to be able to live it out. And with that the most of the film becomes a drag, only running on a few widespread scenes that are OK enough to be watched. Special effects are not more than OK, and that makes the ending result into a meager one.<br/><br/>All in all, Ghost Rider is something to be seen on a very bored evening when there is absolutely nothing else to be seen.<br/><br/>4 out of 10 bored riders out of Hell."
"Sparrowmaniac","7","0","1","28 February 2007"," Dull, Lacklustre, fails to make an impact
","Ghost Rider was just the movie I expected. Visually stunning, but fails to make a long term impact. Its small run time contributes to the fact. Nowadays almost all comic adaptations are close to 125-140 minutes long. Compared to Ghost Rider's 114 minute adaptation will disappoint the fans of this franchise. Packed with a star studded star cast(comparing with other comic adaptations of late) a regular movie goer might have thought this would be a decent watch. But I'm afraid they will be highly disappointed.<br/><br/>The entire story of Ghost Rider, the history, everything seems to so hurriedly paced. Although the starting scene seems to think otherwise. I cant understand why it was so hurriedly paced. Also the director and the screenplay writer could have included a few sub plots, which would have made the movie mildly interesting, instead, it focuses on the central plot which is why the movie finishes just when it was getting interesting.<br/><br/>There are few things that are worthy of praise in Ghost Rider. And one of them is the Visual Effects. Visual Effects for this movie have been stunning. Mind Blowing. The stunts were also cool, no scratch that ultra cool. Even the viability of the stunts are questionable, still they are good. Eva Mendes looks gorgeous, just like everyone hoped. Wes Bentley looks superb as the villainous Blackheart. Peter Fonda is underutilized. And Nicholas Cage. What can can I say about him? He sure can act and he has proved that here also, since he has retained his suave nature. But his physique isn't good enough for action roles such as this. He is losing his touch if he keeps on acting in such movies as these.<br/><br/>The background score is decent enough. And even though the screen play was short, it was good. The dialogs were pretty good. All in all, a disappointment but still because of the stunning visual effects I'll give it a 7/10 !!!"

I want to ask myself why wasn't this film screened to the critics. At least Elektra, a little better film, had the courage to do so.<br/><br/>This film is different then what is shown in TV spots and trailers. In fact, there's much less action in the film than you expected and more of the cheesy romance story between the guy and the girl he likes. This continues with cheesy dialog and predictable plot.<br/><br/>Although it has its flaws, this film is just mindless fun. It has good special effects and some great action scenes. There are even some funny scenes in the film.

","Although I enjoyed this movie, I don't feel it should be rated PG-13. There were a lot of scenes that were too graphic for a child of this age. My husband felt that since it was related to Marvel Comics, that it was aimed at kids. From the previews I'd seen, I thought it was too scary for our kids. I checked the rating, and then permitted them to watch. Had I watched it first, like I should have, I would not have allowed them to see it. The story behind it is that the Ghost Rider is a good guy, but some of the scenes were more like R-rated vampire movies I've seen. Most PG-13 movies I let my kids watch revolve around bodily function humor and sexual innuendos. I did not expect this movie to be as scary as it was, for kids.

I was hoping for a Spawn type feel since the plot is quite similar, but a miss usage of jokes instantly killed that dream. The one thing I liked about Ghost Rider was the one thing I liked about Spider-Man 2 great effects. The bad things where also a lot like Spider-Man 2. What kind of Devil chooses a professional stunt driver as their bounty hunter? Well I know Malabogia from Spawn didn't, he choose a man who was a ruthless killer born and bread. Why does Nicholas Cage have to over act so much in this movie, and why is his voice so low when he pointed at Mephisto I was laughing so hard, btw that's not supposed to be funny. And what kind of an official bounty hunter for satin eats Jeally Beans out of a Martini Glass. See I can take a little bit of humor in Action movies, but this and Spider-Man 2 over did it way too much especially in this movie. Why was Mephisto's name Mephistoles, I'm not 100% sure but I think that's not the original name for the character. I do love Caretaker though, but mostly because I'm a big fan of The Big Labowski. Also why with the special effects of today they can't make Black Heart look like his awesome self instead of a half-ass version? All in all I give Ghost Rider 3/10, that 3 is only for when Cage turns into the Ghost Rider, which wasn't a lot, I thought he looked really cool."

","Another Marvel comic book story reincarnated on the silver screen, Ghost Rider is a story of redemption, good vs. evil and the other complexities common in this genre's lore.<br/><br/>Johnny Blaze, a young motorcycle stunt driver does carnival acts together with his dad, whom he tries to save from certain death by accidentally entering a pact with the devil. He grows up doing increasingly more dangerous stunts while trying to redeem his ghastly self and protect the woman he loves.<br/><br/>The unbelievably handsome Matt Long plays the young Johnny Blaze, who unfortunately grows up to look like Nicolas Cage with hair plugs and seemingly fake abs (which Cage has reportedly defended as real and not CGI as suspected). At least the beautiful Raquel Alessi, who plays Johnny Blaze's love interest Roxanne Simpson, grows up to be the equally luscious Eva Mendes. Peter Fonda plays the devil Mephistopheles, and Wes Bentley (from American Beauty) plays his son, Blackheart, who calls on the other forces of evil to help wrest from the Ghost Rider a prized contract.<br/><br/>CGI-effects were heavily used, which is why the movie was about a year late in its release, so I might as well comment on it. When Blackheart transforms into his evil face, he laughably looks like one of those ghosts in Asian horror flicks like The Grudge or The Ring. Blackheart's minions were also not worthy adversaries, very easily defeated by Ghost Rider in the incredible situations, which is perhaps why the children in the theater were not scared.<br/><br/>Ghost Rider is fun stuff, nothing so amazing but it is definitely entertaining."

","I didn't walk into Ghost Rider with a lot of expectations, and I was still disappointed. Nicolas Cage was average at best in the title role, and Eva Mendes used what she was given and did a nice job. Wes Bentley is laughable as the villain of the film. Mark Steven Johnson should never touch another comic book movie. Now let me elaborate why.<br/><br/>Ghost Rider's only good moments are when Johnny Blaze transforms into the devilishly cool Ghost Rider. The special effects and sound are top notch. I thoroughly enjoyed the scenes with Ghost Rider, and the ending.<br/><br/>The script, also penned by Johnson, is horrible. The film is very predictable, the dialog is cheesy and unintelligent, and the characters outside of the title character have no development whatsoever. Nicolas Cage's performance is a confusing one. There's times where Cage seems like he doesn't even want to be Ghost Rider. I'm not talking about the character. Wes Bentley is a good actor, but it's Johnson's direction that fails so drastically that he doesn't notice Bentley delivering the cheesiest performance of all time. He is not believable at all as an all powerful demon that is one of Ghost Rider's archenemies. The film does have nice action and wonderful visual effects, but it has no other strength at all. I really don't want to talk about this movie anymore."

It was as though he was an un-beatble ""super hero"" who could do no wrong, and never die. Some of the dialog was a bit odd at the end. I just wonder why this movie took such a loooong time to come out. I think it would have been worth while watching if it had a bit more action that was'nt so weird."
"reaper123","4","0","2","25 February 2007"," See it for the drama, not for the action.
","First of all, let's get something out of the way right now; you don't need to be a fan of comic books to see this movie. Don't worry if you've never seen or read a comic book in your life; this movie will explain everything you need to know about Ghost Rider.<br/><br/>With that out of the way, on to the review! I was really looking forward to this movie. I, myself, am a huge Ghost Rider fan. I mean, come on, it's a guy who can transform into the spirit of vengeance. What's not to like? And from what I saw, they seemed to be pulling no punches making the movie. So it's safe to say I was pretty excited.<br/><br/>All in all, I was pretty let down.<br/><br/>The problem with this movie is that it seems to be suffering from a severe case of split personality. One personality is a charming, likable fella, and the other personality is a REALLY BAD MOVIE.<br/><br/>Ghost Rider is about a man, Johnny Blaze, who finds out his dad is going to die, so he makes a deal with the devil to save his life. The devil screws him over on it, but a deal's a deal, and Johnny finds himself with more than he bargained for. Mainly, he finds himself transforming into the ""Ghost Rider"", Hell's bounty hunter, and hunting Hell's escaped demons.<br/><br/>Nicholas Cage is great as Johnny Blaze. The way he plays the character is as an impulsive, ""devil-may-care"" thrill seeker, a man trying to honor his fallen father while atoning for the sins in his past. He comes off as a charming and sympathetic character, and the supporting cast around him is great. The humor, especially between Cage and his love interest, Eva Mendes, is pretty spot on. And on the other side of the board, the villains are pretty damned cool.<br/><br/>And then we come to Ghost Rider. I never thought I would ever have to say that a flaming skeleton in a leather jacket is the low point of the movie, yet here we are.<br/><br/>In short, when Johnny transforms into the ""Ghost Rider"" and goes gunning after the bad guys near the middle of the movie, things get really dumb really quick. Every line out of the creature's mouth is a painfully bad one liner. Like, CRINGEWORTHY bad. Stuff that got rejected out of comic books bad. Which would be okay, since we're watching these scenes for the action, not the intelligent dialog. But Ghost Rider completely fails at delivering anything resembling action, too. Apart from a couple of cool chase scenes, Ghost Rider is BORING. The fight scenes between the Rider and the demons last maybe a few seconds each, just long enough for Ghost Rider to do something vaguely interesting with a flaming chain. Seriously, there's nothing else going on. Even the final fight, with the main evil baddie, Blackheart (Wes Bentley), turns into just the bad guy standing there while Ghost Rider throws flaming snowballs at him.<br/><br/>Overall, a very disappointing movie. If you like Nicholas Cage, then I'd see this just for some pretty decent acting. However, if you want to see something with action in it, then I'd probably see something else."
"moises08","7","0","1","24 February 2007"," A Moderate Marvel Adaption
","At first, I had little expectations for Nicholas Cage being Ghost Rider and I found that many others agreed. The Ghost Rider Comics are famous and just like Spiderman and X-Men, to make an adaption out of it requires a lot of work. It's not something you can just slap on the big screen; both longtime fans and newcomers have to find the same power that makes Ghost Rider what it is in the comics, on the big screen. So having seeing the film I admit that although it had a few sore spots and kinks, I admire the work put into the movie.<br/><br/>The cast did a decent job on pulling the characters together. Kudos to Nicholas Cage for his part as Johny Blaze: not too shaby, he didn't over do it and it was enough to both respect the character and add a little spunk to it. Eva Mendes also did a good job as being the clichéd lost teenage love, although the shirts with the top three buttons unbuttoned was way to obvious. I was satisfied with Peter Fonda's work as Mephistopheles, I just wished he put a little more effort as being the vile demon himself. The rest of the cast only added to the nice effort of a movie that Ghost Rider is. The only faults were the lack of character that the film had. Sure there the main cast carried it, but because the plot was so straight forward, there wasn't room for extra characters to weave and twist the story a little.<br/><br/>As said before, the plot was just like an average comic book storyline. A decent interpretation of Ghost Rider and his ideologies, the film should be claimed as a fair success. The soundtrack was great, with a couple of dull scores though. All in all, if you're a dire fan of Ghost Rider it really is a cool action flick to watch and if you're just wanting a quick straightforward ride, then it's a taker too."

For all of less than 24 hours. Tip 1, if your dealing with the Devil - state specifics! He is called to be the Ghost Rider when The Devil can no longer control his own son and sends ghost rider to send his son back to hell.<br/><br/>The visuals of the film are amazing, but you can't build a film just on how cool it looks or the ""wow"" factor. It needs plot and story and this just doesn't have enough of that.<br/><br/>I assume Cage decides to not regain his humanity at the end of the film to leave this open to a sequel.

"Schwabi","3","0","1","24 February 2007"," Usual PG graphic novel movie
","First of all: When I watched this movie last night (got dragged in by others), I didn't expect anything great, so thankfully I wasn't disappointed. At least I didn't have to pay anything. No story-twists. The whole flick is as predictable as a straight road through the desert. Even some lines of the dialog I could imagine before they had been spoken. Speaking of dialog I must say that some monologue is really crappy (e.g. in the end, when Mr. Whatshisname bores us with his thoughts and you already know what that leads to, but enough, I don't want to spoil). Surprises are nowhere to be found, either. If there's a small lake in the desert, you know why (if you have paid attention to the bad-guys-and-elements-thing). Bad guys. A little make-up to make them look pale, some pointy teeth, dark voices with a little hall effects, the result you get is a bunch of bad guys from hell. But no competition for the Rider, as expected. Poor CGI. I really thought we were through with the times when CGI still looked like CGI and not like real stuff. But I must stand corrected, Ghost Rider proved me wrong. Oh, I almost forgot the female protagonist. Cliché at its best. You see three women in that movie who may speak some lines. One is a reporter who asks for an interview. Her only line, but doesn't matter, she is wearing glasses. The second one is a slightly overweight girl, she has two or three lines to say. And last, but not least, the only woman allowed to stay on screen for more than one minute: Ms Mendes. No matter what she's wearing, it's buttoned shirts, buttons almost tearing, revealing enough to distract the male audience from anything else (not a pity at all, though).<br/><br/>So you have all you need for a nice little PG-rated graphic novel movie: a hot chick, a protagonist caught between two worlds, riding a hot motorcycle, bad guys that are easy to recognize as those, and a far too linear storyline from A to B, with annihilating one bad guy after another, but only one at a time, because there are almost two hours to cover.<br/><br/>Two good things about the movie: I could put my brain on Stand-By, and I didn't fall asleep."

","Ghost rider, sounds like a creepy title to me. How about you? <br/><br/>The latest version of a Marvel comic to film is here, and I must say, while I feel it could have been better if targeted primarily at adults rather than teenagers, I still enjoyed it enough to leave satisfied. The movies core audience is going to be teenage boys seeking action, not adults who are looking for a darker thrill ride. While certain parts of the movie do show the possibilities for what it could have been, it is mostly kept to a lighter style. The acting is OK, if not somewhat cheesy given the material, and the special effects are rather well done. Johnny Blaze, to my understanding was supposed to have been a Bourbon drinking tough guy after all he had been through by the time the devil came to collect on their deal, but here, he is portrayed by Cage as a softer, gentler, sensitive if not quirky man who eats jelly beans out of a martini glass rather than drinking. All this leads back to my earlier remark about the target group of ticket buyers, if this movie had been aimed at a slightly higher age group we might have gotten something a little more along the lines of the Crow, or Sin City. I'm not saying I didn't enjoy it as is, just that it could have been something that I, as an older more mature viewer might have liked a bit better.

Here? There was no such sexiness, not even Eva Mendes - who left me cold! As for Donal Logue, all he does is die in Marvel films, it's getting tired now! There was no Jesus-like character (as in the comic-book version) who showed Johnny how to seek redemption, it was not Mephistopheles (the Silver Surfer's true adversary) but Satan himself who trapped Johnny into co-existing with the demon Zarathos.<br/><br/>In the picture, Blaze is given Spawn-like powers; finite changes and a chain that extends or shortens on command and acts as a conduit for his Hellfire. In the comic, Hellfire just made you suffer, there was no Vision of Penance! Yes, there was a Ghost Rider in the days of the West, but he dressed in white and was not a bounty-hunter for Satan; there is no perpetual line of Ghost Riders in the same way Todd MacFarlane's (Hell-)Spawn has had generations before and after the current black hero...<br/><br/>I love Sam Elliott wherever he appears, but sadly his cameo here was wasted, I hope the money was good! As for Mephistopheles - the idea he had four rebellious sons was intriguing, but lasted too short and they were too easily vanquished, here was a marketing ploy gone to Hell... This could have made for at least two sequels if executed properly! The movie it seems, was just a way to test th extent of Marvel's team to use CGI, hope they can use it further to erase this movie and create a telescope to look for their souls - as this pic surely had none to sell or buy!

Nicolas Cage was okay as the lead, but the actress opposite him (whose name I don't remember intentionally) was HORRIBLE. I wouldn't believe she was even a reporter for a UHF channel. There were some funny moments, and the special effects were great, but the good is obliterated by the bad in my opinion. I was really annoyed with the screenplay. The dialogue was stupid, Sam Elliot was completely wasted, and the final climactic fight was almost an EXACT replica of the final fight scene in the movie Blade. Try to watch the end of this movie and not think of Blade. I bet you'll giggle once you see what I'm talking about. Bet me. ;)<br/><br/>Super mega turkey, with all the trimmings. What a waste."

","The JC Experience: Ghost Rider(2007): <br/><br/>Starring: Nicolas Cage as Johnny Blaze/Ghost Rider Eva Mendes as Roxanne Simpson Wes Bentley as Blackheart Peter Fonda as Mephistopheles Sam Elliot as Caretaker Donal Logue as Mack<br/><br/>Plot: Based on the Marvel comic book. Young Johnny Blaze's father has cancer and so Mehistopheles makes a deal to remove the cancer in exchange for Blaze whenever he wants him. That wacky demon doesn't say anything about his father dying in an accident however, so Johnny goes off on his own. Years later Blackheart arrives to cause trouble, so Johnny is made into the new Ghost Rider to stop him. Can he rid himself of the curse, save the day and still find time to have a meaningful relationship with EVa Mendes and her cleavage?<br/><br/>Ghost Rider is an odd film for me. Because it's a bad film. There's no denying that. Some things do work but the majority of it does not and has some serious problems that can't be ignored. I'll go ahead and state that I enjoyed the film. But I love the characters and comic so unless it was mind-numbingly bad there was no way I'd completely hate it. But I am objective so I can also see that there was negative there.<br/><br/>To start off, you can tell the creators of this movie(Or at least Nic Cage) loved the characters and wanted to make an entertaining popcorn movie. Ghost Rider is just a bad ass here, getting off some one-liners, stopping some evil, looking awesome in his CGI-induced glory. I loved the big screen portrayal of the Penance Stare. If you have any love for this character then the scene where he rides up the side of a building on the cycle is one of joy. Nic Cage does a fine job as Johnny Blaze, although instead of a tortured soul he kind of comes off as just an oddball. But he's a likable oddball so it's okay. The effects can be off, and downright bad at times(Wind demon especially) but when they work, they WORK. Also you get Eva Mendes showing off her cleavage, some humor and some action. It's a comic movie about a guy who rides around with a flaming skull for a head, so it's a little ridiculous right out of the gate.<br/><br/>However the stupidity does go over the top. Examples: Roxanne randomly pulls out an 8-ball while waiting for Johnny to come to dinner. Is it explained that she has a personality quirk that makes her constantly check an 8-ball? No. She just does it and it's never heard of or spoken of again. Blaze as a oddball lends itself to really out there moments like complaining because he can't watch his monkey show when you think he'd have more pressing issues at hand. Also the big evil bad guys are pretty much laughable here. Peter Fonda does okay, but Wes Bentley? Man he was terrible Over-acting constantly, letting off bad puns some of the time and smiling constantly. He did look evil so I guess that's all you can ask. <br/><br/>As far as his minions go, they are dispatched easily and you never quite know who they are to begin with. For that matter, why does Blackheart even want the contract of 1000 souls? Why does he hate Mephisto so much? Also, why include a love interest and a police subplot if they are really just there to pad out the story? The love story feels tacked on and forced, and the police are so inept you'd think this was the Naked Gun series. Also, I know the plot is kind of hokey but you could at least make Blaze look like he's suffering once in a while. He's cursed, remember? It's good they say so, because you never quite get that impression.<br/><br/>So, as I've mentioned earlier. I liked Ghost Rider. I really did. It was entertaining, and I love the character/comic. But the fact it's a bad movie cannot be ignored and that pains me. Maybe this will get the Director's Cut like Daredevil did and we can see a more fleshed out story, but who knows. Not recommended unless you really love the character like I do. <br/><br/>Rating: *1/2 out of *****"
"D-dogma1490","7","0","1","21 February 2007"," Not bad...just kinda...not good
","Before I point out all the glaring issues with the movie, I do have to say that it was better then I expected. With only a few exceptions the world of ""comic to film"" crap we've seen lately, I didn't exactly have high hopes for ""Ghost Rider"". I am a comic reader, but I really only have a passing knowledge of this particular graphic novel series. I will say however in my opinion that Nick Cage brought home the character of the Rider in a big way. The actor that delivers some great performances like ""Con Air"" and ""The Rock"", but then turns around and gives us ""The Wicker Man"", there was a chance that the complexities of the Rider/Johnny Blaze may have gotten lost. But I think Cage can be proud to know that he did a great job here.<br/><br/>I would also like to quickly say that if there was an award for ""Best-Bad-Ass in a feature length film"" it would most certainly go to either Cage or Elliot as they both bring the blockbuster rockin'-ness to both their characters.<br/><br/>Now on to the down sideand it is definitely a downside. I must comment first on the ridiculously horrible acting that we get smacked in the face with throughout the film. Most of the Movies worst moments are delivered by three of the worst acting jobs I have had the displeasure to watch. Matt Long as is entirely underwhelming as the young Johnny Blaze, you feel little to no emotional connection to the character until Cage takes the helm. Next we have Blackheart who happens to be one of my favorite Marvel baddies. I find however that you put a potentially good villain role in the hands of an actor that has absolutely grasp on the character you get.well you get disappointed. The performance we have to choke down from Wes Bentley as the son of Mephistopheles (played by Peter Fonda who does pretty decent work here) drags down the whole movie. The last performance is by the digitally animated Ghost Rider. While the Rider has some great moments the audience is constantly turned of by stupid ""Super-phrases"" like ""Time to turn up the heat"" from the guy with his skull on fire hahahahabut not so much.<br/><br/>There was also a pacing problem for sure. We find ourselves stuck in harsh lulls and then we get hit with a not-so-actionie action sequence. There are no great battles here, so much as the Rider gets kicked around a bit, then turns around and ""punishes"" the guilty quickly with his chain or in the final scene where he use his Rider Shotgun-thing.<br/><br/>The CGI is pretty well executed making this a movie you might want to see in theaters. Ghost Rider thrives of it's big summer movie style fx and doesn't have a great storyline to back it up.<br/><br/>So overall, it could have been better, but it could have been way worse. 7 out of 10."
"matthew-nicholls","2","0","3","20 February 2007"," Not hugely enjoyable and not very well written
","Just saw this film and to be honest i fell asleep twice. The basic premise of the story and trailers sounded good. I've always liked Marvel comics, but this was really a bad advert for comic-to-movies!! The worst part seemed to be the script, all good stories have a beginning/middle/end. This one started out bad, there was no depth of explanation to the characters, i'm still a little vague about the mad bad guy and who he was (not the devil the other chap)and why he was bad and therefore why he was so scary. The other little helpers he had i had know idea who they were, why they were bad and therefore why they were supposed to be scary. Without having a beginning to set the scene the baddies lacked any reason to be scared of them. The special powers of the goody didt seem all too special either, so it was hard to know if he had some magic trick up his sleeve. The end was cheesy and weird and it was difficult to muster up any support for the character when there was no character depth to explore what exactly it was he was fighting for. All this was backed up by approx 30 people walking out before the end, it reminded me of England vs Spain, lots of hype, but delivering spectacularly short!"
"AcousticMonster","3","0","2","20 February 2007"," Spawn + Blade + Electra bad guys = Ghost Rider
","When I first seen the internet trailers for this movie, I was seriously pumped up for Ghost Rider. Then after seeing more and more footage from the television commercials, with Nicholas Cage's limited acting range  which never seems to improve between films (Gone in 60 seconds, Snake eyes, etc.), I got that somewhat familiar ""Hollywood slapped something together to make a quick buck"" feeling. You know that sinking feeling you get in your stomach when the family pet dies? Whelp, Hollywood has again proved that leaning on the CGI crutch, and skimping on a solid script, makes crappy movies! This film could have been the next Blade for crying out loud! All it really boils down to is a two hour advertisement for a sequel  one that will never be made - because the ticket sales will not be enough to warrant a Ghost Rider II. So I have to ask""Why bother making this mediocre piece of junk? Why Hollywood, WHY!?!"" If you've seen Blade, Spawn, and Electra you pretty much know what to expect from the Ghost Rider movie. Do yourself a favor and wait till Ghost Rider comes out on DVD."

From bad acting, terrible mixing of lore (the Christian elements added in REALLY did not fit.) and horrid script.... This movie was the spirit of vengeance on anyone who would watch.<br/><br/>I did however learn something of love. Love is Flatulence. It is a given than Methane burns blue. When Ghost rider see's his ""love"" his fire burns blue. Conclusion: Love is a wafting emanation, much like this movie.<br/><br/>Thus I learned that: I am a sinner, and true love = flatulence...

"FlyingZombo","4","0","2","19 February 2007"," ""Ghost Rider"" vs. ""Daredevil"": This Barely Wins
","Ghost Rider is my favorite Marvel character, and I was really looking forward to this. What a mistake that was. As a movie, I find that this was better than ""Daredevil"" (which I hate). But as a superhero movie, this pisses me off so badly. I am happy to say it wasn't as campy as I thought it would be. But, at the same time, it wasn't as close to the comics as it should have been. Now, it doesn't bother me when people depart a little bit from the comics. But, come on, they messed this up so bad. It seemed like Johnny Blaze was turning into the Ghost Rider whenever he felt like it. That's not how it goes in the comic book. If he's around evil, he'll turn and it doesn't matter who's around. Second of all, unless the demons possess a body they don't look like people. Yet, in this movie, they do. They changed the character design of the villains TOO MUCH! Also, the Ghost Rider is capable of carrying out conversations. But in the movie, he can only say a few words at a time, most of the time those words being some one-liner which HE ISN'T SUPPOSED TO SAY! Don't even get me started on Roxanne Simpson. The only reason I tolerate this movie more than ""Daredevil"" is because I'm just not that big of a fan of that character (or of Ben Affleck, for that matter). The acting was mostly bad, although I did like Nic Cage, the fight scenes weren't great, as was also the case in ""Daredevil"", but the special effects were pretty cool. At least they got the back story mostly right."
"james-burnley","4","0","2","19 February 2007"," Crap
","I think giving this movie a four out of ten is being generous. I read someone saying that ""watch the movie before you say it sucks"" well I saw it and definitely would have to say this movie blew hardcore. I enjoyed watching spawn more than this movie. Every action sequence ended in about 2 seconds because ghost rider punched the bad guy once then used his chain. Also, the dialog was terrible. I'm not expecting a comic book movie to be up for an Oscar, but come on, they didn't even try with this movie. There's the part where Sam Elliot and Nick Cage ride to the town where they're suppose to collect the contract...then Sam Elliot just leaves...OK, way to go see ya buddy. Then he tells Cage to ""stick to the shadows"" and taking his advice nick cage drives in on his chopper...how the hell are you suppose to stick to the shadows when you're driving a loud ass chopper. <br/><br/>Somehow Ghostrider was speaking coherent sentences in the beginning of the film, then at the end he talks like he's 3 years old ""Monster"" when Eva Mendez touched him...which somehow she was able to touch his burning skull when not 15 minutes earlier it showed them driving by an iguana and it completely ignited...<br/><br/>I'm guessing that they just tried to push this movie out and didn't care what. There were good actors in this movie, but they did a terrible job of acting. Sam Elliot is the only reason I gave this movie a 4 because anything he's involved with he brings some amount of ""cool"" to it, even to this piece of garbage."
"theevilartist1","5","0","1","19 February 2007"," Could the Rider Be Burnedout Before His Next Outing?
","So I went to see long awaited film adaptation of Ghost Rider. I can't say that I was excited about it. I did want to see this movie but I wanted to see Hannibal Rising more but you know how it is with popular vote plus we had a six year old with us. The movie goes off of the premise that Mephisto, a.k.a. the Devil, made a pact with some town that ended in the townspeople turning on each other. So the Rider of the era is sent to retrieve the contract made between the people and Mephisto. However this backfires and the Rider makes off with it supposedly ""outrunning the Devil"". Fast forward to Johnny and dear old dad performing in their stunt show. Dad has cancer, Johnny makes deal with the Devil, dad is saved but dies the same day from an accident, throw in the whole subplot of young lovers running away together and you pretty much got the first 20 minutes of the movie.<br/><br/>Now Johnny is now famous for his stunts and so on and so forth, Roxanne reappears in his life but he can't fully connect with her because Mephisto has returned to call on Johnny to hunt down his son Blackheart. Blackheart wants to the contract to supposedly help him take over the world and he's using the Hidden to help him.<br/><br/>Okay now that I'm done with plot let's get down to the movie. First off the starts okay but the whole young lovers thing was well...lame. Then you add in the fact that the main villains don't transform into their true selves at any point in the movie. The Hidden are easily defeated in mere seconds and the dialog is just terrible. This movie should have been darker and should have done away with some of the terrible humor. I gotta say with the humor I was very unimpressed. Also take the fact that Blackheart is the worst thing to come out of hell since Mephisto and he's rarely does anything that can be considered terrifying. Look Blackheart is supposed to be huge and almost undefeated heck even GR had an extremely hard time fighting him. However in this movie Blackheart is defeated with little effort. All of the battles in this film are anti-climactic. I kept waiting for the big final showdown and it didn't come. Plus the Rider is not limited to the darkness. The Rider and Blaze are two separate beings and the Rider takes over pretty much whenever it wants. Blaze is rarely even aware of when this happens.<br/><br/>The Penance Stare, while impressive, was overdone in this movie. It's not supposed to kill the target but doom them to a life of pain and misery equivalent to the pain they've caused others. Cage is a good actor no doubt but he was miscast in this. What really did this movie in was the rating. PG-13 is good for superhero fair such as X-Men and Spiderman but with subject matter like this it should have been R but no they once again had to sellout and make to where the kids could see it. Question is how many children born after the early nineties are going to be old enough to even know who Ghost Rider is? It's not like he's one of the most publicized heroes around. This should have been done for the viewers who were old enough to vote. It should have been dark. Eva Mendes, who is always stunning, was just that and only that in this movie. With the bad dialog she was forced to play the stereotypical D.I.D. In short the movie was just way too rushed.<br/><br/>Now that the criticisms are out of the way time to get on to the positives. The special effects were fair. Ghost Rider was rendered nicely and the Hidden were okay but Blackheart was not impressive at all. All they did was turn him blue and give him red eyes and that's it. The flame effects were cool. I like how they gave the impression of speed and the extreme heat the rider gives off. Plus the bike was excellent and the chains were believable. Not to mention Ghost Rider's voice would scare the crap out of me were he real. That roar of his is flesh melting and I like the strange sense of insanity that he possesses. Another good thing was the insertion of the precursor to Blaze's Ghost Rider Carter Slade, who was released in his own comics years before Ghost Rider's comics began being released. This of course at most is only an inside thing since anyone who hasn't read the comics most likely won't know it. I really liked his Ghost Rider form. Too bad however towards the ending it gets a bit preachy with the constant references to heaven and what not and with lines like ""He may have my soul but he doesn't have my spirit."" which was hokey at best. Also the scene where Rider gives the cops the finger as he rides off. The only real eye-catchers are all the building scenes that depict the Rider riding around on them on his bike, and the prison scene. Other than that the others are pretty average. For the most part this movie is just supposed to be cheap fun to go to when you've got some time to kill. You shouldn't be expecting too much since these movies are only designed to showcase how far we've gotten in special effects and that's really all that can be said. So if you just want to be entertained for a few bucks go see Ghost Rider. It's fun but that's all it is. P.S. With every superhero action film the last few second of footage are supposed to showoff the abilities of the hero. It happened with Spiderman and other Marvel films. So all things considered this too was a disappointment."

"SpaceLucas25","8","0","1","19 February 2007"," The movie itself was good, but there was a few issues I had with it
","OK, it sounds to me like a bunch of people who hate comics went to see the movie and then bashed it. That, or a bunch of NERDS when to see it who were over obsessed with comics and bashed it because it wasn't 100% comic accurate. About the movie itself, it was good. Nicholas Cage I felt did a pretty good job acting in this one, and from what movies I've seen him act in, he does a fair job acting. The action was picture perfect, and to me it followed the art style of the actual comic Ghost Rider. The voice of Ghost Rider, I thought, fit perfectly. It was how I always imagined him sounding, ignoring of course the cartoon.<br/><br/>Now I'm not about to sit here and tell you this movie was perfect. It had it's issues, ones that severely cut down my thoughts on the movie. First, Johnny Blaze's relationship with Roxanne was forced extremely. It was so unrealistic to imagine that after 14 years all of the sudden she was willing to get back with him, and after he didn't show up she was only mad for a short period of time. In addition Eva Mendes' acting was terrible. She was a terrible choice for acting. Also, the climax fight between Blackheart and Ghost Rider was very, well, anti-climatic. It was so short lived and there wasn't even any real display of power on Blackheart's part. He was just kinda stumbling around mumbling to himself before being killed. Anyway, this is one movie you have to see to decide for yourself. You can't trust reviews on this one. I know someone who made that mistake, even though that movie is his favorite now. Make the decision for yourself."

","The storyline behind Ghost Rider was extremely boring and un-interesting. During some of the scenes in the movie I found myself laughing and then realizing the scene was a serious one. The only things worth watching this movie for are the special effects and the attractive, yet boring, character played by Eva Mendes. The movie attempted to make the bad guys so scary to a point where it was laughable and borderline childish. Don't even waste your money on seeing this in the theater. If you're going to see it at all wait for the DVD release and rent it.<br/><br/>*potential spoiler* An example of a scene that made no sense: Towards the end of the movie the old ghost rider tells the new one that he's going to come with him to battle whatever demon he's set to take on. They take the 500 mile journey to get there and once they're overlooking the place the old Ghost Rider tells the new one that's he's going to leave him to it. So, basically he just rode 500 miles to turn around and disappear? That made no sense whatsoever.<br/><br/>*end spoiler* I can only hope that next week's profits drop drastically and they don't make another one because it doesn't deserve a sequel. I'm not just saying that because I thought it was bad but just looking at the character there is really no where else he can go. It's just going to be the same basic thing over again. I can't say that I won't be surprised to see a sequel because that's just how crazy Hollywood is over the comic book movie genre but it would be a mistake to make another. Drop this character for a more interesting one."
"Ankhenaten91","3","0","2","19 February 2007"," Why oh Why did they make this so bad?
","I like comic book movies, I however do not live them or know everything about them. I did read Ghost Rider as a kid/early teen and it was cool. By far one of the Best looking characters ever created, but this movie took all that was great about the comics and the character and made them just lame!<br/><br/>First there is Nicolas Cage, I personally wasn't thrilled with his casting but I didn't hate it. He was fine in the movie good deadpan delivery and he is a good actor. But here he is just so flat and boring to watch. Eva Mendes is drop dead, sell your should to Satan hot but her character is so poorly constructed that you just don't care about her.<br/><br/>The story is so redundant, Blackheart (Wes Bentley) is looking for a scroll with the names and souls of a bunch of people that will give him ultimate power to Ahem, RULE THE WORLD!!!! So he naturally needs to enlist the power some boring glorified movie extras who possess useless powers of Earth,Wind and Water OHHHHH I am so scared!<br/><br/>Ghost Rider kills the minions in literally a matter of seconds with no build-up or fight just a couple of hits a bad line and then poof the bad guy is vanquished. The part of the movie that is so bad is that you never care about anyone at any time throughout the movie.<br/><br/>The great part about other Marvel movies is that you feel for these people and want to see them succeed here you don't care because there is almost no feeling in the writing at all!<br/><br/>Effects are good but really not close to great, the editing is kind of sloppy and the writing is just so lame. This one wasn't quite as bad as Daredevil but it is close.<br/><br/>Last but not least the one thing that really doomed this production is the fact that it drowned in it's fear of being offensive, violent and have any edge at all. Something like maybe a tortured character like Blaze really is would be cool or some real fight sequences would help a lot too.<br/><br/>Just too many things to deal with here and no real redeeming qualities."
"oshram-3","5","0","1","19 February 2007"," Dopey fun
","I didn't go to this movie expecting much, really; it looked dopey in the trailers, but that never stopped me before (Torque, etc.). Mostly I went because I read a piece on Friday where Nic Cage ripped Entertainment Weekly a new one, and that made me want to spend $6 to support him regardless of the vehicle he was in.<br/><br/>Ghost Rider is yet another film that owes its existence to the baffling success of the lunk-headed Spiderman films; without Spidey's grotesque box office returns, many superhero movies wouldn't have been greenlighted (greenlit?), and this one probably would have been one of them. Would the world be much worse off for its absence? Not really.<br/><br/>GR follows the story of Johnny Blaze (Cage), a young man who sells his soul to the Devil (Peter Fonda) to save the life of his dad. When the Devil comes to collect years later, he transforms Blaze into the Ghost Rider, a bounty hunter, to hunt down the Devil's enemies, in this case one Blackheart (Wes Bentley), who happens to be the Devil's son. Oh, and thrown in for good measure and eye candy is Johnny's long lost love Roxanne (Eva Mendes).<br/><br/>It's a dopey movie. While nowhere near as mind-numbingly stupid as, say, Ultraviolet, GR seems to understand that it's not Shakespeare (unlike Batman Begins) and wisely never even tries to be anything more than a popcorn flick. Cage is a good choice for an admittedly oddball one-note superhero; his own natural quirkiness makes Blaze a lot more likable (even if the romance with Mendes seems a stretch). Cage walks the line between playing it goofy and playing it too goofy  he never makes fun of the material, and indeed, he seems to embrace it, enjoying himself with it and plainly hoping you'll do the same.<br/><br/>The rest of the casting is fine. Fonda growls and seethes as the devil, and Bentley is acceptable as his even more evil, rebellious son. Donal Logue is well cast as Mack, Blaze's buddy and partner, and Sam Elliot is perfect as a sort of old west mentor to Cage's Ghost Rider. Rounding out (literally) the cast is Eva Mendes, who strikes the same note of bemused sincerity as Cage (she gets the best laugh in the film), and whose cleavage is the source of constant camera attention.<br/><br/>Ghost Rider is dopey fun. I've often said if I have to turn my brain off to enjoy something it's not worth it, but this movie proves a little mindless fun is sometimes just what the doctor ordered. It's only a notch or two above a cartoon, but GR knows that, and revels in it, and because of that, it works. Certainly worth a rental if the weather is prohibiting you from hitting the theaters just now.<br/><br/>February 19, 2007"

","Strike two for Mark Stephen Johnson. Why does this guy insist on making campy films based on Marvel's grittiest characters? To be fair, the director's cut of Daredevil was worlds better than the butchered version he was forced to release in theaters. However, even that contained many elements that just didn't match the hard-boiled superhero and the environment he inhabited. Ghost Rider, unfortunately, is much worse in this regard.<br/><br/>To sum up, there is a cheesiness to this film that oozes off the screen. From acting to dialog to plot, this film falls flat and is so laughable in all the wrong spots. The only shining moments come when Ghost Rider himself is on the screen and even then he is, at times, dumbed down to cracking puns.<br/><br/>Normally a comic-book based film is so bad I would say it is only for the die-hard fans. This is the first case where the film is so far off the map, only people who know nothing about the character should see it.<br/><br/>The Fuzzy Dan Speaketh"

If this movie is gonna do well, the credit should go to the excellent visual effects team (brilliant scenes) and the one man on the screen who did manage to save it was Sam Elliot as Caretaker.....Eva Mendes and Cage = no chemistry....i think this movie is little better than the Punisher though.

"VincentBauer","1","0","3","19 February 2007"," Ghost Rider...
","I myself am a big comic book fan. I've read most of the comics when the characters were first invented. One of my favorite characters was Ghost Rider, who was the third best bad@$$ in Marvel (behind Wolverine and Punisher). I have to say that this movie makes Ghost Rider look like a dork. In fact this movie barely even focuses on Ghost Rider but rather on Johnny Blaze's life and dealing with it.<br/><br/>First off the story is that Blaze (cage) is with his father in a father/son stunt group. His father is a heavy smoker, and has cancer. In an effort to save his father he sells his soul to Mephisto{ (or Mephistopheles) and immediately his father is cured, yet in a stunt his father is killed. The deal involves that Blaze will be immune to any wound so that he may be Ghost Rider. Which becomes his Alter Ego. In this movie they put in a love interest (who was never in the comics {Played by Mendes}). Blaze/Rider must save the world from the demon Blackheart (son of Mephisto) who dares to take over the world and annihilate everyone and everything (like usual).<br/><br/>Second, There are so many misinterpretations from the movie that say who the character was in the comics. First off, Blaze had no control when he was Ghost Rider. The rider was a demon and a completely different person. In fact Blaze would rarely even have any recollection of becoming the rider. Secondly, The Rider can take over at any time he wishes, and blaze had no control over that, and he doesn't need the dark to turn into Ghost Rider even though in the comics that was when he mostly turned into the Rider. Lastly when the Rider used the Penance Stare (at least they got most of his powers right) he did not burn them too a point where their insides were ash, but rather made them feel the pain they had inflicted on all of the innocent so they can live with the pain. Only a few times did he ever burn the soul of someone who really had it coming to them.<br/><br/>Lastly I would like to add that the movie jumps around a little too fast and tries to get done too fast and won't focus enough on things. The film is based on puns and dumb humor. Only very few times is there something cool that happens. I also thought Cage could do a better job as Blaze but then again Mark Steven Johnson who wrote and directed the movie did a horrible job writing it ( he also did DareDevil which sucked {no wonder!}). Overall I expected more from this but it sucked.<br/><br/>Ghost Rider 2/10"

","On the whole the story was poor, Nicholas Cage was ordinary, Eva Mendes was superb, visual effects were fascinating. Especially the people who are addicted to the motorbikes must absolutely see Ghost Rider. The bike was designed like you are dreaming. The trade mark was not seen, but I think it was Harley. When you watch the movie you can find yourself disappointed for not driving such a machine.<br/><br/>According to my understanding the story was captured from comic book Marvel. All the heroes are bad guys, they sell their souls to Satan, they try to sign an immoral contract with him. They are egoist and they live on the edge to the hell. What a nice attitude that they are trying to get back their own soul. If they can take back the other bad souls to the hell, they will be successful to win prize. It is their own souls. Bad guys are fighting with each other.<br/><br/>We will be able to see the second part of Ghost Rider in the near future. In the normal conditions, he must take his soul and stay with Eva Mendes. But he chooses the power and refused Eva Mendes. What a poor guy. You should get married with her, have children's and earn your family's life. Do you think that you are the one who will save the world? Do not make me laugh. Take into consideration what I told you and deserve Eva Mendes, okay."

","Less than perfect, but lively and watchable story of a young man who follows in the footsteps of his father by becoming a daring and courageous stunt motorcyclist, despite the deteriorating affect it has on the relationship with his one true love. He sells his soul to The Devil in order to forward his own personal ends, but it's not until years later that he realizes the extent of the deal which grants him unearthly powers that he uses to try and stop the maniacal demon Blackheart. The latest addition to the rapidly growing comic book genre has plenty of exciting effects sequences, as well as some first-class stunt work, along with a corny script; an excess of cheesy humor and familiar plotting weakens the story, but it entertains on a no-brainer level if you enjoy that sort of thing. **"

","I anticipated seeing ""Ghost Rider"" probably more than even ""Spider-Man"". This so-called ""second-tier"" super hero is one of my all-time favorites. Hero from hell, flaming skull, leather and motorcycle, mean and merciless . . . he's a unique character among super heroes, and his time for the Hollywood treatment is long overdue.<br/><br/>And yet . . . <br/><br/>Like ""Daredevil"" before it, this film was entrusted to journeyman director / writer Mark Steven Johnson. While Johnson has added some nice concepts and modified elements of the character to make it more palatable for a movie audience, he simply is not up to the task. Inconsistencies are everywhere, information gets added in almost as an afterthought, and one gets the impression that the ""rules"" about Ghost Rider and hell and demons are being made up as the story goes along. And, as with ""Daredevil"", the villain of the story is not as present as he should be, thus eliminating a lot of the dramatic tension. <br/><br/>Also, as a director, Johnson clearly could not control his lead actor, Nicolas Cage. Instead of a stoic, haunted man trapped by his circumstances, Cage elects to make Johnny Blaze into a quirky, zen-like, off-the-beaten-path dude with a jones for jellybeans, the Carpenters, and Elvis (Cage is famously obsessed with The King). The character may be more interesting this way, but he's just not acting the way you might think a guy would who got conned by the Devil and learns he's now the living Spirit of Vengeance. <br/><br/>Of course, the film works best when the Rider is on the hunt, busting skulls and taking names. Like an id from hell, the Ghost Rider operates in a full-on rage, relishing his power and taking macabre joy in dispensing justice upon the guilty and wicked, making him a hoot to watch. Honorable mention should also go to Sam Elliott for lending some old-west gravitas to the proceedings, as well as Eva Mendes, who has a knack for bringing a very familiar, very realistic vibe to whatever film she's in. <br/><br/>Originally, this movie was to be filmed by Steve Norrington and David Goyer, the director and writer who surprised everyone with the first ""Blade"" (Goyer also wrote ""Batman Begins""). I can only imagine what kind of a great, moody western-horror adventure that would have been. Instead, we're left with jellybeans, Elvis, and a rickety, rambling plot. Not a terrible movie, but man, it could have been so, so much better!"

","From ""The Lumberjack"" by Gary Sundt (aka ME)<br/><br/>How many times have you gone to see a movie and you just really wanted it to be good? In fact, you so badly wanted it to be good, that you actually thought the movie was better than the crap that it actually is. Well, sometimes a movie is what it is, and you can't deny it was just a bad movie. Welcome, my friends, to the Ghost Rider experience.<br/><br/>Now the story goes that when motorcycle stunt rider Johnny Blaze was a young carnie motorcycle stunt rider, he sold his soul to Mephistopheles in exchange for his cancer-ridden father's health. When Mr. Blaze gets his health back, good old 'Stopheles causes the old rider to have a fatal accident on his bike. So now Johnny has to work for ""the devil"" forever, which means he better cut all his ties, which includes his girlfriend, young Roxanne (who looks so much like Eva Mendes, she could impersonate her in a porno). <br/><br/>Cut to modern times. Nicolas Cage is Johnny Blaze, and he has used his deal with the devil to become famous for doing insane stunts that should rightfully kill him. We spend a bit too much time seeing Blaze without his super powers, so let's just skip it all and say that he and Roxanne (Eva Mendes) meet up again and they want to get things started.<br/><br/>However, their timing couldn't be more off. Mephistopheles' son, a demon called Blackheart, is coming in with his evil gang to do some evil stuff, and this is not Devil-Certified Evil, so he wants Blackheart stopped. He taps Blaze and gives him the powers of the Ghost Rider, which means he is bullet-proof, has the ability to stare, and his head catches on fire. On his fiery motorcycle, he goes off to fight Blackheart and his cronies in what usually ends up being one very underwhelming fight after another.<br/><br/>Mark Steven Johnson, the guy who gave us the not-so-good Daredevil, and the outstanding Daredevil Director's Cut, is at the helm of Ghost Rider, and from the very beginning you can't help but feel that he really wanted to give us a comic book. On one side, we have a fun look, one that never seems real, but more comic book-like, which I appreciated. On the other hand, the film, with its cheesy dialogue and strange story-telling, never feels like a movie. Also, I don't really understand why Johnny Blaze turns into Ghost Rider, and suddenly he can only turn out horrible lines and laugh really hard.<br/><br/>Honestly though, the real problem with Ghost Rider (besides its horrible dialogue and story that doesn't translate well to film) is the fact that the audience never feels any dread. When you watch Spider-Man fight Doc Ock in Spider-Man 2, you have the feeling of ""Oh crap! Spidey is f*%#ed!"" In Ghost Rider, we never feel that. You never get so consumed in the story that you wonder if he is going to make it. When you watch Ghost Rider, you always know how it is going to end: Evil will be punished, the girl is not going to die, and Ghost Rider is going to ride off into the sunset (and in this movie, he actually does)."

","This movie, isn't the worst thing I have ever seen, but it falls from what I was expecting when I first saw the previews. The visuals were explosive and the story, considering you're packing an extensive comic into a 2 hour movie, was at best presentable. I think the major flaws in this film, were the jackass they got to write the script, and the awful director whom I personally hope in the near future kills himself so that he can no longer ruin any more comic to movie projects. It starts out decent, rides through up until Johnny Blaze FINALLY becomes the Ghost Rider. Then things take a turn for worst, the fight sequences were short and over all unimpressive, and the look of the demons and all that were totally corny (of course no where near as corny as some of the dialogue). It all builds up to a horribly cliché showdown, and a chick flick ending just for a twist. Do yourself a favor, don't go in with high expectations, this movie is sub-average."
"mbutle23","2","0","3","18 February 2007"," Misses the Mark by a Mile
","Ghost Rider is a movie comprised entirely of missed opportunities and faulty logic. The character has outstanding potential. He is a tortured man who must deal with the demon inside him to work towards redemption. This is a great source of conflict on a personal and metaphysical scale. And though Cage does well to express Johnny Blaze's torment in the beginning of the film, by the time Ghost Rider appears the movie begins to spiral completely out of control.<br/><br/>The characterization screeches to a halt after this and any interaction between the hero and the villain is reduced to inane schoolyard banter: Ghost Rider: ""You're going down"" Blackheart: ""I don't think so. Na na na poo poo."" There is no wit or depth to any of the verbal interactions between the hero and the villains. Tired and pathetic lines like ""you can't catch the wind"" or ""he wasn't so tough"" seem like they were lifted from rather poor written comics. Just because Ghost Rider comes from an occasionally simplistic medium doesn't mean that the dialogue must be flat and lacking in invention.<br/><br/>Nor is there any logic. When the ""water demon"" pulls Nic Cage underwater in an attempt to drown him, Cage turns into Ghost Rider and yells, ""Surprise!"" and defeats the creature in a matter of seconds. I'm not quite sure how this is a surprise since Cage has been turning into Ghost Rider for the whole movie. Doing it again is hardly shocking.<br/><br/>The one hope that the movie could be visually stunning and have great fight scenes was dashed by the lackluster and unimaginative effects. Ghost Rider's fights with the villains were always pathetically short and lacking in punch. Stylistic action was replaced with simplicity. If Ghost Rider wraps his chain around a villain, they die. No fuss, no muss. The fight is over. There is no grand heroic slug fest that delights the viewer with explosions and senseless visual wonder. Instead we are treated to Ghost Rider throwing flaming balls of sand. Delightful. Even Fantastic Four makes this movie look beautiful.<br/><br/>The one fantastic point of the film was that Ghost Rider looked good. He looked really good. Hell, even Sam Elliot's western Ghost Rider looked good. All this despite the fact that the character grandly transformed, rode to the scene of the final battle, and then inexplicably left without doing much of anything. Nice plot twist.<br/><br/>The casting is also extremely unimpressive. Wes Bentley never manages to be more that slightly creepy as Blackheart. He is far from being an intimidating villain. He instead channels his creepy film student from American Beauty. He looks like he should be worrying about protecting his lunch money instead of gaining control of hell. Peter Fonda plays the devil, Mephisto, and also manages to remain thoroughly unimpressive despite the aid of numerous digital effects and the fact that everything gets cold when he is near.<br/><br/>I wish I could express all of this movie's failings and I feel the above summary of my grievances does not accurately depict the horror and anguish I felt while watching this film. I feel that the character deserves something more. I feel that he deserves epic battles, emotional turmoil, and above all some better dialogue that comes from a dictionary instead of a nursery school. If you want to see it, see it. And then perhaps you can flesh out my line of complaints."

","Step aside Uwe we've got a new player in the game of ""let's slap together an uninspired and down right flat movie based off a licensed IP"". This is one of those movies where characters do things, and plots move forward ""just cuz"". It's mostly Nick Cage sitting around and looking like he made a big mistake, and I think that mistake is he sold his soul for a flourishing early career with the likes of the Cohen Bros. and David Lynch , and it's lost him his hairline and put him in this movie, which as an audience member is a pretty close simulation of a boring and unendurable hell. Characters talk their feelings, the action comes across as an afterthought, and nothing is surprising; a five year old could guess each turn of events. The only lasting effect of this movie is that for the last day or so I've been wondering to myself as to why was Peter Fonda in it? If you're over 12 don't go see this movie."

","The only thing that saved this train wreck from being a complete calamity was Nick Cage offering charisma in this horribly scripted movie. The quipy one liners do nothing for me. In fact, several scenes became unintentionally funny because whoever penned the script, needs help... and fast! The best example would have to be Johnny's heart to heart with his fist... trying to lure out his dormant powers. This movie had potential. I have come to terms that Marvel movies do nothing for cinema. I hope this movie flops after word of mouth. There were scenes that were so uncomfortable for me to watch, just because the dialog was that bad. "" I'm going to fight fire.... with fire ..."" Wow. The fight scenes were abysmal. They introduce these menacing baddies who die rather quickly, rather pathetically. Johnny Blaze's younger self looks nothing like Nick Cage. Eva M can not act, and you know why she's there. Her cleavage can only carry a scene so far though. This makes me sad that such drek can be made. This ... movie... SUCKED! Boo"

","""Ghost Rider"" doesn't work as a movie, and it sure doesn't work as a comic book movie. In an age where this genre has a point in films like ""Spider-Man 2,"" ""Batman Begins,"" and ""V for Vendetta,"" this one seems almost a waste.<br/><br/>Johnny Blaze (Nicolas Cage) sold his soul to the devil to save someone he loved. Now, at an older age, he is the world's most famous biker and stuntman. However, the devil has come back to collect his debt. Blaze is forced to terminate those who have escaped hell. So, during the night, he burns up, and his head and hands light on fire. He is a skeleton. One day, he decides he must use this curse to stop those who spread evil. Johnny does all he can to protect the woman he loves from danger, and rid the dirt off the face of the planet.<br/><br/>One of the main reasons this film doesn't work is because of the devil and hell parts of the film. They are overdone to the point where the story becomes more like a horror movie. Constant use of monstrous images and evil spirits make the film not only repetitive, but pointless. Also, I was sick and tired of burning skull man. I was more interested in Johnny when he was in human form. The action all has to do with spirit powers and evil capabilities. For some reason, I found this annoying. Deaths occur in this film for the sake of letting us know that evil can kill. OK, show us once; but over and over? We've got the picture. And Eva Mendes, like many good-looking actresses, is stumped to the level where directors say, ""We don't care about your acting, we care about your cleavage."" She doesn't need that kind of direction, and we don't need this kind of film.<br/><br/>I did like a few points of this movie. That's why I gave it a 3. Nicolas Cage is likable when he isn't the devil bounty hunter. He may not be making the wisest decisions of late when it comes to movies, but you can still tell talent is about him. Sam Elliot, as his mentor, and a man who wishes to help Blaze use evil to fight evil is hard not to like. He's a good actor, and doesn't lose his talent here. I also smiled at a couple humorous points of this film. Mainly during some amusing t.v. interviews. These good points, however, are weighed out by the much heavier laid negative ones. In my opinion, ""Ghost Rider"" wasn't worth the price of admission. If you want to see it, go ahead. For me, it was disappointing, and it's likely to be the same for you."
"j-leitman","7","0","1","18 February 2007"," Better Then I Thought
","This is first off by all means NOT a bad movie. I have heard people complain how bad it is, and critics alike. I watched the movie, and was actually entertained. The effects were pretty well done, and since the ""rider"" is mostly CGI, Nic Cage doesn't have many lines (always a bonus). As for ""the rider"" He is pretty awesome on screen. He also has little lines which is appropriate since ""the rider"" hardly spoke in the comics. I have heard the director referred to as the ""next Joel Schumacher"". Schumacher single handily destroyed the Batman series (to be revived by Chris Nolan). Mark Steven Johnson, who directed Daredevil also, which I did not enjoy because of Ben Affleck, not because of the director. If you go into Ghost Rider and let go, and not take it seriously it is a fun ride. If you expect it to be a realistic movie (like Batman Begins, or even Spiderman) then you are going to be disappointed. Enjoy the special effects, somewhat decent plot, and cool villains and you have a pretty cool movie. Eva Mendes is also fantastic as the heroine. She is very spunky, and adds appeal to every movie she is in. Without her, I feel the movie would lack in some appeal. Overall I give it a 6.5/10. Considering it opened with $44.5 million in its first weekend, there might be a sequel. After all, in the comics there are 2 separate men who become a Ghost Rider. Stop being so hard on this movie people, and lighten up. Ghost Rider is an action packed, well shot, stunt filled, special effects laden mindless fun! Ghost Rider is one hell of an Anti-Hero!"

","Now, I'm not going to go all out because I've never actually read the comic. But a movie's a movie, so here I go. I wasn't all that impressed. Frankly, I found the character of Ghost Rider incredibly fascinating for a comic, but it simply couldn't work as well as a movie.<br/><br/>Not to say that the movie was terrible. I rather enjoyed it. I can't say I wasted money or time. I just expected more.<br/><br/>The plot line was very bland. I won't give it away but it was just bland and predictable.<br/><br/>The casting wasn't horrible, I guess. There's too many people besides Cage I could imagine playing this role, but he did alright. Eva Mendes as the girlfriend was pretty good, though nothing Oscar worthy. Donal Logue as Johnny Blaze's BFF was alright, I guess, for a minor character. He did seem to have more life that Cage at times. Peter Fonda played off the role of Mephisto way too...""typical-demonic-bad-guy-like"" Imagine the dude who played Dracula in Van Helsing only older. I was really hoping for a freakin awesome Mephisto, since he's one of my all-time favorite Marvel villains. Blackheart was...eh. See, I never read about Blackheart, so I don't know if he's supposed to be a cocky diva (which he is in the movie). He's dark and awesome...but not often.<br/><br/>The best actor in this film was The Caretaker BY FAR!! Sam Elliott hit a homerun wih this smaller role, which he could've done with just his voice. Whenever he was in a scene, I got a little more excited for this film.<br/><br/>The worst part of the movie was Ghost Rider's skull. I'm sorry, but I was worried that this would happen: you can't make a flamming skull talk and have it look real OR cool. It was just...ugh. The rest of the special effects were top-notch and even really breathtaking at times.<br/><br/>The final fight wasn't as cool or epic as any Spider-Man or X-Men fight, but it fit and made sense with the rest of the plot. So...yeah.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie was good. I'm a die-hard Marvel fan (though I never read a GR comic in my life, thus I am ashamed) so this movie really worked for me. However, though I may buy it on DVD when it comes out for a few cool scenes and the blooper reel, many people may leave confused, disappointed, and maybe even a little ticked off."
"clownbaby866","7","0","2","18 February 2007"," average as far as general films go, but great (or above average) by comic-book film standards
","Okay. I love Nicolas Cage. I love Ghost Rider comic books. Now, did I love the movie? Well, I don't know if I'd go that far, but I'd say I really really liked it. For the next couple of weeks or maybe month, it'll stay with me strong, but over time it'll slowly enter the ""average"" rating. Well, let me give an overall rundown of the movie and its pros and cons.<br/><br/>Pros: Nick Cage was great as Ghost Rider and his transformation into The Rider was just about perfect. The general atmosphere of the movie was extremely well done. it perfected the dark, mystic comic book look. It was extremely stylish during night scenes, or when The Rider came out. Blackheart and his gang looked really bad ass and I definitely got a boner when I first saw them on screen. Wes Bentley's performance is kind of a mixed bag. On one hand I liked it b/c of the look he gave Blackheart, but on the other hand I didn't like the way he talked. I can't explain it, judge for yourselves. I liked the way he killed ppl, but it got old quickly. Anyways, one of the highlights of the film is Donal Logue's character, where most of the comedy comes from. He plays Johnny Blaze's sidekick in the motorcycle business and best friend in life, and his presence on screen almost takes away from Nick Cage's bad-ass persona. also, the film picked up pretty fast. the exposition was quick but very enjoyable to watch. When Matt Long's Johnny Blaze turned into Nick Cage's Johnny Blaze, i was kind of sad to see Matt go. he was charismatic and characterized by young love, and it was sort of sad to see that young loverboy go away. And this is coming from someone who is a #1 Cage fan.<br/><br/>Cons: Though Blackheart and his gang look bad-ass, they really aren't. They seem to go down without a fight, which is depressing, for I was hoping these super cool villains would provide a good battle and some interesting special effects. In general I liked the special effects, but sometimes the action of the movie was less like action; the effects and adrenaline of the movie derive from Blaze riding his motorcycle, such as climbing up a building or driving in the water. very cool to watch, but I think the audience was hoping for a little more resistance from his enemies. Also, there were, as suspected, a lot of corny lines. But i mean it's a comic-book film, it should be expected. Actually, in my opinion, I kind of liked the corny lines. But i have a feeling others won't feel the same as me.<br/><br/>All in all, I enjoyed the movie and it fueled me for a couple of days and I am still thinking about it now. Though I see its flaws, I can look past them and realize that not every movie is perfect. And in regards to the chance of there being a sequel...Let's Ride! ;)"
"kurt_baumann88","6","0","1","18 February 2007"," Not what it should've been (spoiliers included)
","Ghost Rider wasn't a bad movie... It's just flawed in several areas. My #1 beef with this movie is that it feels extremely rushed, and several parts of the plot make no sense. For instance: (Spoiler starts here) Why would Carter Slade (who can only change to rider form ONE more time) change to rider form, and DO Absolutely NOTHING TO HELP BLAZE??? That was the most pointless thing in the movie. He could've just handed the contract to Blaze and said ""here take this shotgun with you too"", and just left, but no he changed and rode with him, and then upon arriving to their destination changes back, and just disappears??? The one part I loved about this movie was Blackheart. Wes Bently did an amazing job playing Blackheart. Even though they don't really show his true form (it fades in and out at the end), I was amazed. I hope I see more of this actor in other movies.<br/><br/>Fight scenes are short and unimpressive with the exception of the police pursuit.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, Ghost Rider is an unimpressive attempt at bringing a mediocre comic book hero (more of an anti-hero) to the big screen. It wasn't horrible, but it can't compete with the mainstream franchises. My prediction is there will be no sequel, and to be honest, it doesn't deserve one."

","OK. I have to admit I am fan of visual effects-infused, comic book adaptations. But I personally think this one of the worst. The story was all over the place. I didn't care about the characters; Nic Cage, who I LOVE...was just doing his usual Elvis Pressley imitation (It was great in Wild at Heart and Honeymoon in Vegas, but the Ghost Rider?), and Eva Mendes was the most unrealistic part of the movie as a television reporter. I just think the filmmakers were off the mark with the story. There were so many plot holes I don't even know where to begin. Again, I realize dumb, action movies can be fun, but I need a little bit of story. The most ridiculous part, is the end...I understand leaving the story open for sequels, and it may be how the comic went, but he practically said, ""No, don't take this curse away from me, I have to go on and make a couple more sequels..."" <br/><br/>The parts I did like, we're when he became the Rider. I actually felt more sympathy for the CG skeleton head than Nic Cage. There were some cool effects, and Nic Cage's motorcycle jumps as Johnny Blaze, we're absurdly funny...so that was entertaining. There were also good performances by Donal Logue and Sam Elliott...<br/><br/>I don't know...I'm glad I saw it and it was fun, but not my favorite. Still worth watching, I guess. I just wish I would have laughed at it because it was good, and not because it was so bad."

","First, lets be clear. I love comics; I love stupid action movies, and I love explosions.<br/><br/>Ghost Rider is one of the coolest concepts, and had potential to be one of the years most fun movies.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this wasn't the case.<br/><br/>The movie was weak, the lines were poorly written and even more poorly delivered, and despite that a comic book movie requires suspension of disbelief, this movie was not believable at all.<br/><br/>--- May contain spoilers --- The CGI was pretty good ... too good, in fact. The movie spent way too much time animating scenes and making ""cool"" effects (there were several scenes that were a CGI artist's wet dream ... but these served to detract from the movie rather than add to it). The effects were fun until the last scene when, a la the end of blade and highlander, a character is filled with the souls of others - and the effect here is almost as poor as it is in those movies. They should have spent less time detailing every single flame on Nick Cage's head and more time on this scene.<br/><br/>--- End Spoilers --- The acting was, at best, third rate. None of the actors put any effort into their characters ... the villains sounded like high schoolers in a bad play. The interactions between the two ""main"" villains inspired less respect for or fear of them, and more cringing at how poorly the dialog was both written and presented.<br/><br/>Eva Mendes shows her cleavage throughout the movie. At first, this is a positive, but as the film wears on you find it does nothing to alleviate the lack of effort she puts into her character. And by the end of it, you're pretty sick of seeing the inch of flesh between her breasts ...<br/><br/>I would honestly say that the best reason to see this movie is if you're either a fan or student of CGI, or if you want to see what is probably the best job of casting a ""younger version"" of the main actors (both young Eva Mendes and young Nick Cage looked a lot like their older versions).<br/><br/>At best this movie deserves a 1.5 out of 5."

"odintal282","6","0","1","18 February 2007"," low expectations surpassed(not by much)
","I was not a huge Ghost Rider fan as a kid. I believe the only true exposure i had to the character was in a series (going from memory here) where he teamed up with Vengeance. As a comic movie Ghost Rider for me ranked along the lines of other lesser known heros including Hellboy, Blade, and Punisher. A very solid popcorn flick complete with cheesetastic dialogue and fleeting moments of true talent. The problem for me about the movie didn't stem from any of the performances. The weakest link in the chain was Wes Bently as Blackheart. I'm unsure if this was due to his delivery or the material he was given. It's very easy for a comic book villain to come off as campy in movies if not given the proper treatment. The special effects were great but for me the battles with the villains weren't as spectacular as i expected. I don't want to post any spoilers but it hardly seemed anyone was much of a challenge for the rider."
"laverdure-m","5","0","1","18 February 2007"," Just because it's a comic book movie doesn't mean that it shouldn't be serious
","First off I kind of enjoyed this movie being a ghost rider fan but then the more I thought about it as a movie fan I lost a lot of faith in Marvels ability to make the proper choices regarding some of their more popular brand names. This movie had a lot of potential and at points it really delivered. One of the weaker links in this film were it's inability to stay true to blackheart an mephisto's characthers. They both fealt more like a soap opera digest version of their comic book companions. The other thing that bothered me were the desert and western town sets. For such a large budget movie they looked oddly like they were filmed in a studio and not out in I don't know a spaghetti western or actual ghost town set in the middle of a desert.<br/><br/>My other major complaint about this movie was the acting. I don't claim to be an Eva Mendez fan although I do thoroughly enjoy Nicholas Cage. I have witnessed his acting skill in numerous films and am well aware of his potential. It appeared as though that any and every moment before he is about to redeem himself in his role as Ghost Rider his acting takes a drastic and campy turn for the worse(If he was really such a huge fan he wouldn't have taken the role as Johnny Blaze knowing he wouldn't be able to do it justice).It was almost as if they were reading off of cue cards for some of the more dramatic parts of the film. In my opinion the only one who stayed in character throughout the film was Sam Elliot but who would expect anything less from him.<br/><br/>I understand to a point that this movie does not take it self seriously and it is meant more as a fun and easy going cash cow for the marvel movie empire and in that it succeeds. What I don't get is why marvel won't grow a pair and make another movie for adult audiences (like the first Blade) just because a movie has am 18+ or R rating does not mean it can't become a blockbuster. Think about it a movie about a man who sells his soul to the devil and is forced to become his bounty hunter only to experience the endless torments of hell and such by any other name would be directed at an adult audience if marvel is worried about it's more impressionable viewers it always has the Fantastically disappointing Four and the good, good and alright X-men movies.<br/><br/>Overall i put this one behind Daredevil (thats right)and X-men but way out in front of Electra and Fantastc Four. On that note I just want to say Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man (if you've seen both the movies you'll know what I am tali-king about)!"

","Due to the recent comic book adaptation craze including ""Superman"" and ""Spiderman"", ""Ghost Rider"" is no different. Unless you read the comics (which I haven't) there is nothing to compare it to. For me it's a cheesy, poorly crafted piece of overly redundant CGI garbage which results in nothing more than 10 seconds action sequences and over the top talk-talk-talking about ""being the rider"". The only time the screen justly held my attention was when Nic Cage first changes and the few scenes that don't concentrate on his stupid Nemesis Blackheart. The villains are lame, the effects were even worse than ""The Hulks"", and Eva Mendes had nothing more to do than show off some cleavage. Over all skip-able and way to hyped up, lets pray to god there isn't a sequel but with Hollywood adapting every comic there is, chances are 2008 can call for ""Ghost Rider 2"" - **"
"ftoomsch","6","0","1","17 February 2007"," Great effects/spectacle, not-so-hot acting
","As a long time Ghost Rider fan, I was willing to overlook a lot on this movie. For one thing it is comic-book based and people should not expect it to be full of profound acting. However I was only actually impressed by Sam Elliot as Caretaker. Nicolas Cage was next, he did as good a job as he could under the constraints of the direction and script. Peter Fonda was impressive due to camera angles, shots and props, rather than really being allowed to shine through his own effort. Eva Mendes was just OK but there was no real chemistry between her and Cage; guys will enjoy looking at her ever-present cleavage. Wes Bentley as Blackheart, son of Mephistopheles, was totally unconvincing and as a villain utterly unimpressive. The NY Post, which rarely gets anything right, accurately described his look as ""rockabilly Eddie Munster"". His henchmen, the Hidden, were equally without any gravity as villains, leaving a real hole where a nice hateable villain should be (except for Fonda/Mephistopheles).<br/><br/>On the positive side, the action and effects kept me glued to the screen for more; speaking as a long time GR fan, the way they did his transformation, his flame cycle (even the sound) and his action scenes were very cool and satisfying! At least 4 times during the movie the audience in my theater broke out into applause, all during great special effect or action scenes, such as the first time Johnny Blaze turns into Ghost Rider.<br/><br/>I did laugh out loud at several (intentionally) funny moments; but this movie was all over the map and not consistent in what balance of action, horror, camp and comic relief to aim for. There wasn't enough horror or tension to call for that much comic relief.<br/><br/>This movie is worth seeing on the big screen for the spectacle; it is fun and I am glad I saw it. I think Nic Cage and Sam Elliot were the right choices for their characters. However I was disappointed in the villains and supporting characters for the most part and they were bad enough to distract me even during the ""comic book movie"" I had anticipated."
"murrayspeer","5","0","2","17 February 2007"," Another mediocre Marvel movie...
","Everything about this movie was mediocre - by which I don't mean it was bad, but it certainly wasn't good.<br/><br/>Let's say, it didn't fulfill my hopes, but it didn't disappoint my expectations.<br/><br/>At times slipping into sophomoric melodrama, at other times tripping over metaphysical speeches that neither actors nor director seemed properly prepared for - surprising because the director is also the screenwriter.<br/><br/>The ""creature effects"" for Ghost Rider go over the top - a CG visage combined with a heavily processed voice mean that there is nothing accessibly human about the character. A more 'natural' voice would have upped the pathos and the audience involvement.<br/><br/>The thematic material is pretty light - the best theme I could come up with is that Blaze realizes that in order to live his life he must come to terms with the ""monstrous"" aspect of himself and embrace it. But more could have been done to connect this self-image of ""monster"" with the character's rhetoric about second-chances.<br/><br/>In other words, he saw himself as a monster even before he ever transformed into a flaming skeleton. Is this what we are supposed to gather from the film? It's only there piece-meal, if at all.<br/><br/>And I have some issues with casting. Eva Mendes is a true beauty, but she's ten years younger than Nicolas Cage - and their characters are meant to have been teenage sweethearts at 17. How does that work? And while in the late 90's I would have said Wes Bentley was an up-and-coming great, his performance in this movie leaves a lot to be desired.<br/><br/>In the pantheon of recent Marvel movies, Ghost Rider for me ranks somewhere above Daredevil and Punisher, and somewhere below Hulk and Elektra. In a word, mediocre."
"fenixurban","8","0","1","17 February 2007"," It has its ups and downs
","Alright, I'm sure that a lot of people were expecting this movie to suck because of Nicolas Cage, or it will just flat out suck. Let me be the first to say that this movie has its ups and downs.<br/><br/>Ups: Great CGI, compelling characters, good enough story/plot.<br/><br/>Downs: Not Nicholas Cage's character, (he's not a bad actor, but it isn't his greatest role) very clichéd 60 percent of the time, and there are a few ""random moments."" (The crap that happens and there's no point in it) Personally, I like this movie because it has an awesome character, the Ghost Rider, and it's about Hell. So if you can hack the clichés and the ""downs"" in general, you may enjoy this movie enough. Again, it's not the greatest, and the movie could have done better with another actor playing Johnny Blaze, but it's impressive. 8/10."
"hydrolistic","5","0","3","17 February 2007"," An action film for teens.
","I saw ghost rider opening day, actually the first showing in my area, and I have to say I really could have waited. I have read a few comics, but not nearly enough to say I have a firm understanding on the big picture of ghost rider, however I can say this movie isn't it.<br/><br/>The movie starts OK, and spends enough time establishing Johnny Blaze's character (even with some rather large changes in the back story), and actually achieves a relatively charming feel. Its when the movie tries to be serious that it falls apart.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie is an anti-climatic spiral of events, that seem all too familiar, and focus completely on special effects. The opponents Ghost Rider must deal with are a joke, offering completely unsatisfying battles. Even the ""climatic"" ending leaves you feeling as if there MUST be more. Unfortunately this seems to be a common theme in action films these days.<br/><br/>On top of that, this movie fails pretty much where other Marvel films, with dark comic origins, fail. Spider-Man, X-men and Fantastic Four are great because they can be translated easily into a movie for many audiences. However films like The Punisher, and now Ghost Rider suffer because they fail to accept their darker origins, and compromise the story with dumbed-down action, lightened stories and unnecessary love interests.<br/><br/>My advice to you, is if you're going to see a mediocre pop-corn movie, and don't particularly care about a good story, then you'll enjoy this. However if you enjoy depth to your films, and like them to be faithful to their origins, save the 10 bucks and wait for a rental."

The bad guys were really evil but the were wimps. Nic Cage does his usual mumbling-aside dialog stuff and he is hilarious and is pretty ripped.

If you go see this with a wife or girlfriend be prepared to have to suffer through at least three chick flicks to make up for it. Nicholas Cage, the unfortunate carnival worker who sells his soul to the devil for his father's health, plays this role as though he were cracking a private joke with the director. How do the stars of these movies sit through Hollywood premiers and have the audacity to look their peers in the eyes afterword?

","Greetings again from the darkness. Film versions of comic book characters are usually either very well done or not worth watching. This is the odd one that falls somewhere in between. Any adult or older teen will probably consider it a big waste of time. Some younger kids (11-14) will undoubtedly find a hand full of ""cool"" moments. Of course, overall it has very little entertainment value and is definitely not on the level of the Batman or Spider-Man series.<br/><br/>Nicolas Cage, whose hair manages to look worse than ever ... it is actually a relief when his skull bursts into flames, is downright awful as motorcycle stunt rider Johnny Blaze who sells his soul to the devil. By looking at his career, Cage seems to want to be taken seriously as an actor while still playing like he is a kid. That attitude combined with a poor script and amateurish direction lead to mediocre messes like this. And enough with the Elvis obsession. Your impersonation stinks!<br/><br/>Supporting work is provided by the eternally untalented Eva Mendes, who was probably not the first choice, but the only actress who would take this dead-end role. Wes Bentley (from ""American Beauty"" fame) actually looks the part of the devil's son and Peter Fonda as the devil (nice to see him around motorcycles again) has little to do but tap his cane and let his eyes glow. Sam Elliott brings a touch of class to the story as the caretaker with a link to the ""mystery"".<br/><br/>The director of this garbled project is Mark Steven Johnson, who also has ""Daredevil"" to his credit. That should really tell you all you need to know about what to expect. This one scores as high as a 5 only because it will provide some enjoyment to a small age group of young boys who will think it cool when the head and bike are flaming. For even more torture, stay till the credits and listen to the worst ever version of ""Ghost Riders in the Sky"" by Spiderbait. Definitely not Johnny Cash or Vaughn Monroe!"

","So I saw Ghost Rider tonight b/c my friends were looking forward to it and i figured why not? I went in thinking it was going to be an average film and i was right. The only elements I enjoyed were the ones that pleased the eyes more than anything which were the special effects and Eva Mendes. I'm not gonna lie, her first appearance on screen is worth the price of admission if you thrive on nothing else from this film. Nicholas Cage I thought was a good choice for Ghost Rider. The film has some great comedic elements (intentional as well as inadvertent). The scenes with Sam Elliot definitely make up for the sour parts of the film (i.e. Blackheart). Casting Sam as the original Ghost Rider was the best decision the casting directors made. Overall, it's worth seeing if you're a big comic book fan and don't enjoy spy thrillers since the only other good film out right now is Breach. Whatever you do, if you're looking for comedy, see this film b/c you'll probably get more laughs from it then you would from epic failures such as epic movie as well as the vile and downright hateful Norbit."
"jeff_bennion","3","0","4","16 February 2007"," Somebody sold their soul to the devil...to make the suckiest movie ever
","The movie was mildly entertaining. If I knew what I knew now, I would never pay to see it. Also, I liked the previews before the movie. Here is a brief summary of the problems:<br/><br/>1. Cheesiness: Here are some lines (quoted from memory): -""You didn't see your soul for greed, you sold it for love. And that gives you the power of God. You are more powerful."" Gay. -(By Ghost Rider. Apparently, he speaks in grunts like a caveman) You. Guilty! (While pointing). ""I. Monster."" -At night I turn into a big monster because I work for the Devil. That's why I couldn't meet you for dinner last night. Also, whenever Nicolas sees the devil, he just stands there and points his finger at him and says, ""YOU!!!"" and the camera zooms out.<br/><br/>2. The acting: Eva Mendes has many many great qualities, but acting is not one of them. Also, Nicolas Cage is one of the most overrated actors in the world. Sam Elliot plays a horrible role as a cowboy/mentor for Nicolas Cage. The devil's son was horrible as well. Horrible.<br/><br/>3. The storyline: It starts out with a son who loves his dad and the dad loves his son and the son has a girlfriend and they love each other. It's impossible to describe how bad the acting is during this part of the movie. Given this much information, you can guess the structure of the plot - dad dies and the protagonist has to leave his girlfriend, but she shows up later in the movie, all grown up and extremely hot and no ability to act. <br/><br/>Also, there are these 3 sub henchmen that help the main bad guy. The fight scenes where Ghost Rider kills them each take like 30 seconds. Everyone is immortal, but apparently, chains with fire is their only weakness. Good thing Ghost Rider has a chain with fire. <br/><br/>When he first turns into Ghost Rider, his bike destroys everything that gets close to it as he drives down the street. The destruction is so powerful, that he burns a 6 inch groove into the asphalt. Yet, he can drive up a glass building and it only breaks the glass directly under the tires. <br/><br/>Then there's his books. He has a bunch of books about the devil. During the course of his research (reading Faust), he comes across a line about how the firey demon within can control the possessing spirit through will power. This reference was enough to instruct him on how to control his power. <br/><br/>Although I used to read comics when I was twelve, I never read Ghost Rider. I realize that the writers were trying to keep some parts true to the comics, but maybe this was a relatively unpopular comic for a reason. Sam Elliot's character is just horrible. It brings in this whole element of cowboy that is very out of place. I don't want to include too many spoilers, but the last scene with Sam Elliot is just weird. It makes no sense. At all. <br/><br/>I love comic book movies - Blade, X-men, Spiderman. But this one is just so horrible. I have written a lot of school papers the night before they were due (*a lot*), and that is what this screenplay stinks of. <br/><br/>So basically, this is a movie with bad fight scenes, bad story, plot holes, bad acting. The last ten minutes of the movie, I was hoping that all the loose ends would be tied up with no hope for a sequel."

But no I didn't. I went and I screened it with my projectionist at midnight at my theatre. Now there have been good reviews and now a lot more bad reviews. This is the latter. Someone said this director is the new Schumacher. Its worse...he might be the new Uwe Boll, with alittle schumacher mixed in. Where was the fighting...there wasn't any. All the battles lasted seconds at best. The dialogue was cheesy and the acting horrible. I don't mind cheese especially with popcorn flicks but this was absurd. I also accept i must give up my sense of reality in a movie like this. No problem with that I love spidey and other marvel heroes. But when a guy has a flaming skull you cant exactly create a friendly environment. Out of all of this i don't really know what powers ghost rider had other than the penance stare and a magic chain he picked up somewhere. There was some good. The transformations were good especially the first one and the others were also nicely done. I just think this movie could have been so much more. I like ghost rider, I think the character had potential. I just don't know where it went wrong. Maybe the villains had something to do with it as Peter Fonda is the first devil that couldn't scare a kitten and Wes Bentley really wasn't that fierce either. The fact that some scenes dragged and some scenes made no sense hurt the movie. They also rushed through parts especially the fights. And the one liners...were they necessary. They really could have gone a totally different way and the movie would have been amazing. Instead of cheesiness why not make this a dark moody piece.
