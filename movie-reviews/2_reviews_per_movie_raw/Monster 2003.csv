","Why would someone want to be comment number 458? Because it might mean something to somebody. This movie meant a lot to me.<br/><br/>I spent about four hours, sole-to-sole, in the back of a pickup truck hitch hiking with her and a friend of mine in Florida. This was before she had killed anybody, I believe.<br/><br/>Years later, I saw the ""wanted"" drawing. It sort of rang a bell, but a lot of usual suspects look like that, don't they? What are the chances? Then, they caught her and showed the first photo, then gave both the nickname (like a cousin), and the real name (like another cousin, only spelled in Irish.) At the time, she mentioned the spelling with an ""A."" I asked her if she was Irish and told her about my two cousins. What a small world, right? She either told me her last name and I assumed it, or told me she was Greek. The point being, the whole name aspect was the first part of a four hour life story discussion we had. And you don't forget four hours of a face like that either. The life stories matched. It was her.<br/><br/>The mood swings Charlize Theron portrays are perfect, as are the mannerisms, body language, clothes, teeth, complexion, hair, the body fat, manner of speaking, that strutting walk and just everything. It was absolutely uncanny. You never forget someone like that, and then when they pop up alive like that again. It was just unreal.<br/><br/>She was mood swinging, or perhaps ""cycling,"" the whole time I was with her. I imagine if that was portrayed realistically, the movie would be unwatchable. I remember thinking at the time, her behavior seemed like the popular portrayal of those ""possessed."" <br/><br/>After I saw Monster more than twenty years later, I called the other guy that was with me. We have remained friends over the years. I told him ""Oscar this, Oscar that,"" blah blah blah, just out of the shock of reliving the experience of Aileen again. The fact that she was played by the glamorous, beautiful, Charlize Theron on top of it, was beyond all comprehension. What a transformation! Of course, my beloved, goof-ball buddy was sitting beside her sleeping most of the time in the truck. His head kept on falling on her shoulder and she would push it off. It was like Three Stooges. They shared the Doritos like it was the school cafeteria or something. Can you imagine, in hindsight? Yes, it is good for a few jokes, I admit it. She hadn't killed anyone yet, so far as I can tell from reading about her and piecing the time-line back together. This was the first and only time I had been in Florida in those college-age days, so putting that together was fairly easy.<br/><br/>I don't know if I ever met anyone, before or since, that I have felt more sympathy for at the time. She was very talkative, about herself and the hard times she'd had. She was believable. She wasn't scamming us or anything, as I first suspected, just shooting the breeze. I wanted to cry for her. I think I even did so later, in hindsight. She was unreal. She had, what I thought, were ""multiple personalities."" Really just two, she would laugh one second, cry the next. She was like a big, tough hard-ass girl of eight years. She told me all about her childhood abuse, the horror of being a prostitute, and taking beatings and abuse from the men. She mentioned living in hotels. She didn't seem like too much of a drinker or a druggie. I just thought she was deeply, emotionally disturbed. In those days, we should have said ""mental."" My friend and I were a couple of happy middle-class college snowbird guys on Christmas break. She had about the worst kind of life of anyone I had ever met. She was only about four or five years older than us, but looked twice her age. When I thought later about the hand she was dealt, compared to mine, you better believe the religious feelings and tears well up. They still do. I can't bear to watch the movie sometimes, or at least parts of it.<br/><br/>Yes, what she did was wrong, if not evil. I don't think she was evil though, at all. She had the innocence lost, naive but semi-funny sweetness portrayed in the movie. I don't usually contemplate these things, its just that you could see there was a good person there, just profoundly _____ed up. For some reason, I was proud of her when she wanted the execution. She was nothing if not honest. As an outside observer, I don't know how you feel sorry for someone like that, but if you knew what happened, you just might. I have no agenda in that regard. Watch this and ask yourself if monsters are made, or are they born? This movie captures my feelings perfectly. If you have read this far, you can see the conflict. The movie reflects that so well, I can not do it justice by praising it with words.<br/><br/>If you were a victim of her actions, I wouldn't blame you for hating what I'm writing. If I read something like this about Charlie Manson, I'd never believe it.<br/><br/>I just want to thank everyone involved in telling this bizarre story.<br/><br/>I would advise people to see this if they want to be challenged, not just entertained. I've read some of the headlines on the index. So should you."
"preppy-3","9","228","257","14 February 2004"," Gripping but incredibly depressing
","Based on a true story this movie is about Ailen Wuornos, a prostitute, who killed quite a few men who she ""serviced"".  She was convicted in 1990 and executed in 2002.<br/><br/>She's played by Charlize Theron who's just incredible.  It starts off just before she began murdering men and has met Selby (Christina Ricci), an adorable lesbian who loves her.  It basically chronicles their relationship and what led Wuornos to kill these men.  Also she reaccounts her childhood and how she became a prostitute.  It's more than a little depressing--it's a tragic story of a beaten woman who saw murder as the only way out.  Only three murders are shown and that's more than enough.  The violence is not glorified--it's bloody and sick and one is the most harrowing thing I've seen in years.  What's so fascinating (and scary) about this film is that I actually began to sympathize with Wuornos!  While I could never condone her actions you can see clearly what led her to it.  This is a rare film--it makes a serial killer look sympathetic.<br/><br/>Theron is a wonder in this--she became Wuornos (who was very unattractive). She gained weight, shaved off her eyebrows, colored her hair, used contacts and dentures to change her appearance completely.  Never once did I think I was seeing Theron acting--she BECAME Wuornos.  A great performance--she'll easily get the Oscar for this one.  Ricci is also good here.  She's been ignored in the press but she nicely underplays the role of Selby and is a perfect contrast to Theron's acting.  Also nice to see Bruce Dern in a small role.<br/><br/>Music is used very effectively here.  They play songs of the time it took place (1980s) so you know when this is happening and also nicely complements the actions on screen (especially with Journey's ""Don't Stop Believing"").<br/><br/>A very good movie but a very depressing one.  Proceed at your own risk."
"rmax304823","8","113","130","18 December 2004"," Lying Down With Dogs.
","An intense, depressing movie. It sticks pretty close to the facts but focuses chiefly on the relationship between Charlize Theron as Lee and Christina Ricci as Selby. The police are hardly there at all. In fact, neither is anyone else except for Bruce Dern who makes one or two short but welcome appearances.<br/><br/>It could easily have been a by-the-numbers TV movie. (Come to think of it, it has, hasn't it? With Jean Smart?) But the production values are good, and the time and money has been spent on this film that we usually associate with feature films.<br/><br/>The cinematography is outstanding. The shots of Lee near the end of her rope, hitching on a foggy blue nightime Florida highway look like a desktop theme from some arty horror/occult site. The script doesn't have many tag lines. No ""Rosebuds"" or ""I coulda been a contendah."" Nor is it folksy or catching in some other way. The dialogue follows the story in being pretty straightforward and without much in the way of noticeable touches. The director should be commended on her handling of two things. One is the explanation for Lee's crimes. None is given. There is a short scene in which Lee tells one of her johns about her miserable childhood, but the abuse excuse is vitiated by Selby's mother, an orthodox and unimaginative woman, who says simply that lots of people have hard childhoods without growing up like Lee. And the men are not all turned into sadistic hogs, which must have been a temptation for the writers. The second virtue in the direction is its management of the murders. Instead of exploding heads, there are a few squibs, and usually not even that, before the victim yields to the fathomless, cool, enwinding arms of death. The themes explored here are not so much violence as love and desperation.<br/><br/>Ricci looks the part, with her broad forehead and tiny lips, but comes across more as a Valley Girl than the kind of outcast who would pick up and move off with someone like Lee.<br/><br/>Which brings us to Theron's performance as Lee. It's startling, of course, to see a glamor-puss like Theron so thoroughly deglamorized. It's the kind of performance that wins Academy Awards -- lesbians, the height-challenged, autistics, all have won awards in recent years. Theron deserves recognition for her effort too, but not just because of the makeup and wardrobe. They're all splendid. Makeup has shaved her brows to a Mona Lisa extent and turned her face just blotchy enough and given her a raggedy set of teeth.<br/><br/>But that's not all that has made her performance as the central character so memorable. (She's in almost every frame.) And it isn't the thirty or so pounds that she put on for the role either. What's so homeric about that? I can put on thirty pounds without blinking an eye, and enjoy doing it. Heck, I can put on forty or fifty if she wants to get into a peeing contest. No -- it's Theron herself who MAKES the character. She's great, particularly in her physical manifestation of Lee -- her body language, for instance. Instead of coasting through the role, she animates it. The way she struts around with her shoulders thrown back and her face down, emphasizing her several chins and the girth of her neck. Maybe it takes a profession ballerina to figure out these little techniques. Her voice isn't as coarse as that of a hooker who constantly puffs on cigarettes, but Theron does what she can with her own. She overcomes her native South African speech with no trouble and introduces us to a breathless bravado that she's never used on screen before -- not that I know of.<br/><br/>Her movements, her speech, her dreams, are filled with a desperate illusion that doesn't exactly make us feel sorry for her but does make us worry for her -- that she might, for instance, start screaming at any minute and never stop. A nerve-racking picture of a ruined soul.<br/><br/>Is it worth seeing? Absolutely. You won't learn too much about how Aileen Wournos turned into the person she did. Even the narrative itself is a little confusing at time, so that you can't be sure where Lee and Selby are at given moments. But it's Hollywood professionalism at one of its rare high points. It's made by a mature team for an audience of adults. Refreshing."
"sunangel2005","10","113","133","13 October 2004"," Brilliant film; extraordinary, moving performance
","I just saw again Monster, followed by Nick Broomfield's gripping documentary on Aileen Wuornos, and what a brilliant film it is. It sort of reminded me of the kind of movies they used to make in the '70s, where the characters were really the center and they weren't trapped by formulas or by the self-indulgency of the director or the actors. The characters aren't judged, but they're shown with their humanity. With empathy. The result is not your usual indie movie that tries to be hip, or a sugar-coated version of this tragic story with an answer for everything and a nice confortable message in the end, but a truly moving and absorbing film that focuses on the people whose story is telling. At the core there's the amazing performance from Charlize Theron, who's deserving of all the praises and the awards she got. Her work is powerful, subtle, moving and layered. It's incredible to watch Broomfield's documentary, after seeing the film. Sometimes it really seems like watching the same person. It's not only that she recreated her mannerism, which she did perfectly, she's also, somehow, got her energy, as a person. She got to the emotional reasons as to why Aileen's mannerism was like that. In short: an extraordinary performance and a powerful film."
"kdjohnson01","10","168","201","6 December 2004"," For once the Academy got it right!
","For once the Oscar went to the most deserving. I was not sure I wanted to see this movie, but after seeing a trailer I became curious and decided to check it out. Charlize Theron completely blew me away! She is barely recognizable and seems to be channeling Wuornos at some points. Patty Jenkins is to be highly complimented on her writing and directing skills also. Rarely have I been so moved by a film but this one simply cuts to the core and leaves you raw. Wuornos was obviously not well, yet Jenkins provides insightful monologues that allowed me to understand and sympathize for Wuornos. It is a sad and moving movie. Never have I felt so disturbed yet riveted by a movie such as this one."
"sloanepeterson","Null","168","201","17 February 2004"," Black day for Hollywood if she doesn't win the Oscar
","Charlize Theron's performance in this movie was so incredible I felt compelled to shout about it to every single person I know. I was so blown away by her that her performance actually reignited my own passion for acting and made me realize why I'm trying so hard to break into this business and to do it well. I never thought that Charlize Theron (of whom I was never a big fan) of all people could make me remember what movie-making is all about. With one role, she's converted me into a life-long fan. If Oscar means anything anymore, she deserves that award, hands-down. The movie itself is one of the most gripping and emotional stories I've ever seen in a film, and, true or not, its right up there with the other great indies depicting the sorry lives of Middle-Americans, such as Boys Don't Cry and, ironically, Monster's Ball. I wept straight through the last twenty minutes of this movie, continued weeping intermittently throughout the day, and wept some more about it during my preparation for acting class the following day. Before I saw the film, I saw Charlize on The Daily Show, talking to John Stewart about how Aileen Wuornos' story (and I'm paraphrasing) forces one to re-examine how we might label someone ""evil"" for doing horrible things. I thought, that's just a bunch of liberal bulls**t. Then I saw the movie. Like I said, we can't know how much of the movie is one-hundred percent factual, but it's almost scary how little that mattered to me after I left the theater. This film moved me so much that I actually decided then and there that I would, that I would have to, think a little harder the next time I thought of someone as ""evil"". If the goal of the filmmakers was to just try to get people to think about the fairness of the death penalty, I believe they succeeded."
"AlsExGal","8","20","21","17 February 2015"," How can you show any humanity if nobody has ever shown you any?
","This film starts just as homeless prostitute Aileen Wuornos is going to kill herself with a gun she ironically keeps for protection, but first she wants to buy a drink with the few dollars she has left in her pockets because she doesn't want anybody to get for free what she worked so hard to get. So she goes down the hill to a gay bar to get her last drink where she meets Selby. Selby is sexually attracted to Aileen, who at first gives her a fierce rebuff. But then Selby tells her a little about her story - how her family is trying to ""reform her"" from being gay - and Aileen accepts at least some friendship from her, and changes her mind about suicide.<br/><br/>The friendship grows to mutual sexual attraction, and Aileen and Selby run off and move into a motel. Aileen intends to go straight, dresses up for interviews, and gets turned down by everyone. Selby's affection turns to impatience and ultimately angry manipulation as she uses Aileen's attachment to her to get her to go back into prostitution so that they can go out and have a good time. Aileen ultimately gives in, and that's when she meets up with convicted rapist Richard Mallory, whom she claimed to kill in self defense. That is the scenario the movie shows. From that point forward something in Aileen just snaps and she sees every john as a rapist worthy of death, even the ones she had to cajole into accepting her services using sob stories of fictitious hungry children.<br/><br/>The movie is grim and if you read the headlines at all during the late 80s and early 90s you know the story, but just let me say that for once the Academy got it right by giving Charlize Theron Best Actress Oscar. If you've ever seen the actual Aileen Wuornos captured on film, somehow the beautiful Theron got her down even to the wild look she'd get in her eyes - the look of an animal caged.<br/><br/>The movie didn't go too much into the real Aileen Wuornos' past, but all I can say is that she never had a chance given what I read. Born to a teenage girl and a schizophrenic criminal father, abandoned to be raised by grandparents who didn't want to be burdened with her or her brother, and then thrown out of the house by her grandfather after her grandmother's death when she was 15, nobody ever treated her like a human being. I'd like to think the title of this film - Monster - is the ultimate in sarcasm, because what else could Aileeen Wuornos ever have become but a monster given that all she had ever known from other human beings was monstrous treatment.<br/><br/>Highly recommended but very depressing."
"robc-11","Null","13","13","24 June 2004"," Grim Portrait Of A Sad, Wasted Life
","Let me begin by saying that Charlize Theron gives the best female performance that I have ever seen on film. Theron deservedly won the Best Actress Oscar for her portrayal of serial killer Aileen Wuornos. I can not recall a performance, male or female, with such raw intensity. For those who may not know, MONSTER is the true story of Aileen Wuornos, a Florida prostitute who was executed a couple of years ago for killing men that picked her up on the highway. However, this is much, much more than a deranged serial killer flick. This film shows us, very convincingly, how a person can be led to a life of violence. Aileen had an awful childhood and an awful life. She was molested as a child by her father as well as other male relatives. As a child, she was surrounded by abuse, drug addiction, and domestic violence. Men horribly abused her as a child, and she began prostituting at age thirteen. In her later years, Aileen became a prostitute because it had been grilled into her head all her life that she was just a whore. As MONSTER opens, Aileen's car breaks down and she wanders into what she doesn't know is a gay bar. Sitting alone at a table is lonely, confused lesbian Selby (Christina Ricci), who strikes up a conversation with the dirty, unkempt Aileen, who washes her hair in gas station sinks and uses the hand dryer to fix her hair. After many drinks, Aileen and Selby become close, and soon enter into an unhealthy, torrid, tragic love affair. Selby is naive and has always been sheltered, and she just wants genuine love. However, Aileen has issues that Selby doesn't see at first. There is certainly nothing positive or redeeming about serial killers, but you often feel yourself having a small bit of sympathy for Aileen because you realize why she kills the men who pick her up...SHE HATES MEN. Aileen has always hated men, and the only love scenes in which any tenderness and emotion is shown are the lesbian love scenes between Aileen and Selby. You also feel some sorrow for Aileen because she DOES want to improve herself, but has no way of knowing how to do so. There are scenes where Aileen applies for jobs because she really wants to do right, but she is always rejected. She applies for secretarial jobs at law offices and is laughed right out of the building while she curses and screams at everyone. She doesn't know any better because she has no social skills. In one of the most powerful scenes, Aileen is hitch hiking and is picked up by a genuinely nice man who offers to help her. He is sincere and doesn't want sex. He is a decent man who offers a helping hand, but Aileen just can not trust any man. She tells him she doesn't want to kill him, but because her previous killings are all over the news, she has to kill him so she won't be identified. Selby, meanwhile, learns of Aileen's murderous rampage and tearfully decides to go to the authorities. What makes this film so powerful is that this is A TRUE STORY. Aileen Wuornos had a miserable life. Life dealt her a s@@@@y hand. She never had a chance. Growing up, nobody....teachers, parents, relatives....reached out to her. You can't excuse a serial killer rampage, but this is the only ""serial killer"" film that I have seen that at least offers some reasoning behind the insanity. Again, this is intense, and Charlize Theron is AMAZING."
"oliver-123","10","144","176","20 October 2004"," Extraordinary performances.
","I watched this on video and was completely blown away. I thought Charlize Theron's performance as Aileen was extraordinary, not simply in the scenes with the men (especially the ""last john"", when she has to shut herself off from the humanity of the man she is about to kill) and in generally suggesting an increasingly out of control personality, but in the scenes with Shelby (Christina Ricci), right up to her near-breakdown when she is putting Shelby on the bus. Despite adverse comments from other reviewers, I consider Christina Ricci's portrayal of Shelby equally remarkable, conveying childlike naivety, seductiveness, stubbornness and growing manipulativeness very well. They dominate the film between them, but the supporting performances are fine also. I gave this 10 out of 10."
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","8","81","98","17 April 2005"," About as bleak and depressing as they get, but in no way a bad movie
","After just seeing this film, I'm pretty much speechless. This is a tough film to comment on. This is mainly due to the fact that it's a serial killer film where you actually end up feeling sympathy for the killer. Near the end of the film, when it goes completely out of control for Aileen Wuornos, there's no feeling of ""justice is done once again""... quite the contrary, actually. It's so moving and disturbing, following this person's life, through the last part of it. In the beginning, we get a fairy tale-like presentation of Aileen's hopes and dreams in her young years. Without warning, we're thrust into the hard reality of her current years, immediately afterward. From there on out, we're in her world, feeling her pain, experiencing her failures. We get to know her as the film goes on, but we feel for her from the very beginning, without even knowing why she is like she is. That says something about the masterful direction and writing of Patty Jenkins that is featured in this film. The plot is great, and it's surprisingly easy to follow the thought process of Aileen... we understand why she kills. The pacing is very good, there are only few scenes that seem to move slow, and I don't think there was really any point where I was bored. The locations is incredibly authentic. Jenkins actually went out of her way to get shooting done at several places where the real Aileen had been, and even cast people who had met her in smaller roles. Cinematography is great. Acting is pretty much flawless; both Theron and Ricci shine in their roles. The movie also has a unpleasant view of prejudice from the 'other side'(the people who become victims to prejudice), and hopefully this will act as a much needed wakeup call for the people who believe in and go by prejudice. What really makes this film have an impact is how dark and real it is. No happy ending, no silver lining... just tough, uncut reality. When you see it, you can't help getting engulfed in this person's world. The raw horror of her life moves you. I can't see anyone, no matter ignorance, beliefs or moral and ethic standpoint coming out after seeing this film and believing that Eileen was the 'bad guy' in this story. It's just not possible. I haven't seen any of the interviews with the real Aileen Wuornos and I didn't follow her case, but I would like to know more about her, find out what she was like to a greater extent than a movie of 1 hour and 45 minutes can tell me. That's what this movie did to me. It made me care for this person, and that says more than anything I can put in this review. You need to see this film, unless you refuse to watch anything that has harsh reality instead of a happy ending. I recommend this to anyone who can take it. This movie will depress most people, but after this one viewing, I consider it required viewing for just about anyone. 8/10"
"orangecls","10","29","33","25 March 2005"," Unbelievable
","This movie really helped me to begin my own healing. I, to a small degree, relate to the lead. I am a rape survivor (as a toddler and a college student), it stirred up so many feelings that I've experienced. My innocence is gone... why not try to make some money while re-claiming my sexuality? And of course, I've had a problem with viewing all men as perverts. But she did come across men that were actually wanting to help her -- I wish that could have turned her around the way one man helped me come around. And I'm so lucky to have him. I'm so glad that I chose to see this movie. I hope others can be as positively impacted by this film as I was."
"supah79","8","14","15","6 October 2005"," Hard and bleak story
","I had my reservations before watching this. I was sceptical cause of the buzz. Everyone was talking about the way Theron, ""the most gorgeous woman alive"", transformed herself into Aileen. A prostitute who killed several clients. I thought Theron was just looking for success, another ambitious actress wanting a gold statue. That director Jenkins had a reason to make the film didn't matter for me then.<br/><br/>But everyone involved in this film deserve the credit. Monster is gripping. It's a film that makes you feel almost every emotion you can think of: sadness, anger, compassion, wrath. It confuses you. Do you identify with Aileen or do you disapprove of her actions? I guess both. You despise her for killing the men. But the film challenges that. You can almost explain (and thus condone) her actions. I guess the one thing that stayed with me was that it occurred to me what it must feel like to be really and utterly alone in this world."
"laurax112","10","13","14","11 April 2004"," Why You Must See This Film
","This film is absolutley amazing, it picks on nearly every single human emotion and brings them all to the surface.  As an audience you're left confused about how you should feel towards this serial killer.   Charlize Theron certainly deserved her best actress Oscar, her performance in this movie was moving, thought-provoking, and truly believable, something I find lacking in many currently released movies.  Behind each emotion expressed on Therons face you see a whole lifetime of pain and anguish in Lee's character, you find yourself knowing her past without it being explained to you.  When watching it's easy to find yourself thinking that you're actually seeing Aileen Wuornos.  Being familiar with the story of Wuornos I feel that Patty Jenkins touched on a hugely sensitive subject, and delivered a story with immense passion.  Whether or not you are familiar with the actual events of Wuornos' destructive 1 year period is irrelevant, as Jenkins and Theron bring a character to life that we all can relate to in someway. The notoriety of the actual story brings the problem of making a charicature of Lee, a problem that Theron has easily side-stepped, showing what an amazing actress she is.  I think that this may be my all time favourite film, or it is certainly heading that way.  This film has everything that a REAL film should have, it doesn't need big stunts, CGIs, $20million-a-movie actors...It's just a brave idea, fuelled by a passion that comes through to the audience.  A truly excellent piece of film-making, and even better acting talents."
"Pasafist","Null","111","147","19 January 2004"," Gripping and Tragic
","I sometimes wonder why more people can't be nice.  I wonder why the sins of the father have to plague the lives of his children.  Why people rape, abuse, hurt, and maim.  In a perfect world everyone would be happy.  In a perfect world no one would ever want.  In a perfect world a women like Aileen Wurnos would not have been sentenced to die on death row, and in a real world I wouldn't have to write about a movie like MONSTER.  It's a movie that drips with exceptional performances, and yet leaves your soul so cold to the core.<br/><br/>MONSTER is the tragic true story of a woman who longed for a friend, and nobody came to her aid.  It stars Charlize Theron (The Devil's Advocate) as Aileen Wurnos, one of the first women to ever die on death row.  Of course the film doesn't begin that way, when we first meet her she's sitting in the rain with a gun contemplating ending it all.  You see she's has no future. She has nothing but a past that's not worth repeating, and all she has in the world is in a storage locker. What little money she has, is gained by being a prostitute.  But one day in a little bar in Daytona Beach, Florida she meets and falls for a woman that finally makes her happy.<br/><br/>The woman is named Selby (Christina Ricci, The Opposite of Sex), and she's a young lesbian just trying to figure out the world for herself.  At first this relationship puts Aileen on cloud nine.  She's willing to do anything to provide for the first person that ever loved her.<br/><br/>But one night when Aileen kills a john who gets a little to rough, a series of events take our characters on a one way trip with destiny. Leaving the landscape of these two women's lives are forever changed.  If only someone had just been nice to Aileen.<br/><br/>MONSTER is not a happy film.  It's one of those movies that leaves you dead at the end.  You lose faith in humanity; you lose faith in yourself.  I like these kinds of movies, cause they convict me.  Here I am a young guy who sometimes gets ticked off at a driver in front of me on the road.  For one split moment I have murderous anger when that guy cuts me off.  What if I was in Aileen's situation?  Would I do the same thing?  I would hope not, but hey you never know.<br/><br/>If there is one performance that will tear you up inside this year, it's Theron's.  For the entire movie you can hardly believe that this is, in real life, a beautiful women.  Theron throws all the glamour out the window, gaining weight and frumping herself up to the point of being ugly.  This is a complete 360 and she's so engrossing.  She carries the film to heights. A lesser actress might turn in a wonderful performance, but Theron was Aileen. This is some brilliant acting.<br/><br/>I also give Kudos to Bruce Dern .  His character has the distinction of being the only person who shows any real compassion for Aileen.  While a small role it sticks out because it's the only real bit of bright light in an otherwise dark and gloomy picture.<br/><br/>The screenplay by Patty Jenkins (Who also directed) does a great job of giving Aileen and those around her life.  What Aileen did was reprehensible. What she did was evil, and she must pay for that.  But it allows for sympathy. Not all evil is dark and black, and not all people who murder are 100% culpable.  But yet you reap what you sow no matter what you're past.<br/><br/>
MONSTER is a well-made, brilliantly acted film that's not for the weak of heart.  It's engaging, engrossing, and realistic.  I think I want to rush out and get the silliest comedy I can find right now, because I need something to offset the dark tone of this film.  While it get a fine recommendation, I just hope that the next time you feel like treating someone like crap, you'll remember just how tragic the life of Aileen Wurnos turned tragic because nobody reached out."

","As a Floridian, I watched Aileen Wuornos' trials and news reports as they were unfolding. She was imprisoned and put to death less than five miles from my house. I didn't see the film until after Charlize Theron won the Oscar, and so much had been made of her gaining weight and becoming unattractive for the role I was downright cynical about why she won the award. That is, until I saw the movie!<br/><br/>Charlize Theron's on screen portrayal of Aileen is so eerily realistic that you forget it's an actress behind some prosthetics: she WAS Aileen for the entire duration of the film. I kept saying,""Oh my gosh, oh my gosh"" the whole time, as she had every single mannerism of Aileen's down to a T. It was the most impressive portrayal of a real person that I have ever seen, hands down. This woman deserved that Oscar!<br/><br/>Although several people thought the film was sympathetic to Wuornos, I didn't see this as being the case. We saw that Aileen was manipulative, violent, abusive,and didn't take responsibility for her actions. We also saw her as a human being: vulnerable, traumatized, and lost. Despite the insight into Wuornos' humanity, we still knew she was beyond help.<br/><br/>Christina Ricci also delivered a terrific performance as Shelby, and was a perfect complement to Charlize-as-Aileen's abrasiveness.This was the best film of 2003, IMO."
"nycritic","8","15","17","20 December 2005"," A Sordid Life: Aileen Wuornos
","What drives a person to commit murder? And then do it again and again with no apparent end to the madness? One may never know, and certainly MONSTER does not offer easy answers because no matter how you look into it, Aileen Wuornos was herself a kaleidoscope of changing, flighty emotions, ranging from occasional sadness, an unrepentant attitude, sheer rage, disbelief at what was happening to her, and basic incomprehension.<br/><br/>People will know, at least in a marginal way, the story of the Wuornos' trial and for the eight murders she was convicted for. MONSTER attempts in a way not to romanticize her as to why she committed these murders, but to offer viewers a glimpse as to what it was like being her, living under her skin day in, day out, seeing no way of escape and desperately needing it until one day she just woke up and snapped.<br/><br/>Charlize Theron deglamorizes herself so well she is unrecognizable as the ill-fated Wuornos, but her disguise does not overcome her. As coming from the wrong side of the tracks Theron gives this abrasive woman a soul down to her mannerisms and her harsh stare, and even a small scene in which Wuornos admires herself in the mirror before she leaves for hooking -- mannishly so -- speaks volumes about who she is at that moment. Wuornos may not ever receive sympathy from the public given her interviews and her combative parting last words, but at least in Theron she has found someone who under the guise of acting, could indirectly speak for her and somehow give clarity to the torment and the unstoppable fury that dominated her entire life."
"cwrdlylyn","7","7","7","13 August 2006"," MONSTER : The Film Is The Performance, & Theron Is Brilliant
","MONSTER Watching this film proves that, despite the boredom and predictability of the Best Actress race in '04, Charlize Theron is one of the most deserving Oscar winners in recent years. It's amazing how such an average film holds up so beautifully in repeat viewings solely on the shoulders of Theron's unbelievable performance as Aileen Wournos in MONSTER.<br/><br/>MONSTER tells the story of Wournos, a homeless street-walking loner with a grim outlook on life. Although her rage doesn't manifest itself to murder till later in the film, it is clear that Wournos' ability to live in a world with men is shaky. She holds loathing and hatred towards the men that belittled her as a child, and instead of removing herself from those situations... she has chosen to live a life where her survival depends on men's carnal desires. However, after finding happiness in a relationship with a young girl named Selby (played by Chrisina Ricci), that rage that has been simmering deep down unleashes itself in a murdering frenzy as Aileen becomes one America's first female serial killers.<br/><br/>Virtually all of MONSTER's acclaim was focused on Charlize Theron and her startlingly good performance. And though it was certainly warranted... it should also be noted that MONSTER is a solid effort on it's own as well. It's a simple film told from a rather simple point of view. However, by remaining simple first time feature-director Patty Jenkins manages to keep the film well balanced. MONSTER never takes sides on the issue of violence, it is clear that Wournos is not justified to do what she does... but it is also clear that is not entirely her fault the her emotional state ever got to the place it was. If the film had taken sides, it would have been far less gripping. Thankfully Jenkins, with the help of Theron, manages to make this film an accurate portrait of this woman's life.<br/><br/>Aside from Theron, the only other performance that registers in the film is that of Christina Ricci. Her's is a polarizing performance, because it's hard to tell whether the incredibly annoying aspects of her character come from Ricci's acting, or Selby's personality. Personally, I think it's a little bit of both. Nonetheless, Ricci's performance works in the context of the film... and Theron obviously has no difficulty playing opposite her.<br/><br/>Though MONSTER is an solid film, it's clear it would have been nothing without the conviction of Charlize Theron in the leading role. Much flack has been given to the Best Actress category in recent years for being too quick to award any Hollywood actress who ""de-glams"". However, I think such a generalized criticism is unfair because it slightly taints Charlize Theron's win. Yes, she ""de-glammed"" and got fat... but even without that, her performance is one of the most emotionally hypnotizing female performances I've seen in years. This film IS her performance, and she's brilliant here.<br/><br/>... B- ..."
"jillrc","10","10","11","14 July 2004"," One of the best in a while
","I found this movie riveting. Charlize Theron turns in a brilliant performance as Aileen - she was unrecognizable. The relationship between the characters is realistically portrayed and the movie gives us some insight into the serial killers motives and mindset. Selby comes off as a weak if loving parter, totally in the dark as to her lovers vicious killings. The innocence of the lovers and ""Lee's"" intense need to be loved form a centerpiece around which the killings seem almost incidental. Theron plays Wuornos as a freaked out victim, raped since a young age and abused all her life. You see her as someone who never really had a chance. The performance is excellent and the intensity of this movie just riveting. I'd see it again and probably will. Highly recommend."
"raptor_2","Null","15","19","5 March 2004"," The real Monster of this movie? The soundtrack! Hooooooooh!
","Okay, seriously, i needed a bit of comedy before reviewing this dark, serious movie about murder and human nature.<br/><br/>""Monster"", as most of you know, is the story of serial killer Aileen Wuornos, physically ugly; abused as a child, living as a prostitute, falling in love with another woman, and killing men.  An upbeat film this is not.<br/><br/>As much has been said about Theron's performance as Aileen, I won't comment too much.  I will, however, make the joke that she got an oscar just for looking ugly!  Seriously though, she doesn't just look like Lee, but she lives and breathes as Lee.  Just watching the littlest facial quirk, the way she holds and moves her body, all I could think of wasn't who was playing her or how amazing the make up was, but just about the character.  That's why she's so good in this. The rest of the cast is okay, with Christina Ricci playing against type as a needy lesbian who stands by and allows Lee to kill, becoming something of a monster herself.<br/><br/>Another thing to comment on, is that this isn't called ""Monster"" because Godzilla's in it.  My friends and I commented that there were maybe 2 nice people in the entire film.  This movie is dark and depressing.  Now, we've got a macabre sense of humor, but after seeing this, it took a while for some jokes to seem funny again.<br/><br/>Of course, this leads into just how realistic is the movie to life and the events surrounding it?  Some people have claimed that the film misinterprets some of the victims, and that it over-sympathizes with Lee.  And then there's what I said about there being maybe 2 redeemable human beings in the whole thing, with self-righteous religious stereotypes in it as well.<br/><br/>I believe the movie is that way for a purpose.  I can't defend the misinterpreting of some of the victims, but other things I can.  Notice how the film is narrated from Lee's point of view.  And since it's from her messed up, murderous point of view, wouldn't most of humanity seem irredeemable?  And wouldn't she play us, the audience, her jury, for sympathy?<br/><br/>This movie is so successful because when I left the theater, I was made because I figured I had just seen another psycho-liberal movie bashing religious people and the death sentence, among other things.  But as I left and talked with others, I realized that that's how I'm SUPPOSED to feel: the movie is told from Lee's point of view, of her trying to justify her horrible actions by making people see her view of how bad the world is and how much a victim she is.  The filmmakers want me to get mad at her, to not agree with her.  If they didn't, if the filmmakers really wanted people to feel sorry for Lee, they wouldn't have called it ""Monster"".  Looking back on it, i see how the directing, the writing, and the few really innocent people in the film were put there to make me feel a certain way.  Excellently done! They were so successful I didn't notice until long after the movie was over.<br/><br/>That said, aside from being depressing enough to bring down a guy high on ecstasy, the movie's main flaw is the music.  The orchestral music is okay, but some of the songs, like the one they play when Lee and Selby are cuddling, made me want to kill someone!  And the guitar sound that starts to play before their tastefully shot sex scene sounded like 70's porn music, i kid you not.  But man, if that was meant to be funny, i sure needed it, because nothing else in this movie is a laughing matter.<br/><br/>Alltogether, sorry Lee, but I only empathize with you.  I would probably found you guilty as well.  If the way you were treated by the first guy was accurate in the film, and you had turned yourself in, I'd have found you not-guilty, it being self defense.  But you couldn't stop, or wouldn't, and tried to hide it.  Besides, lots of people who do get raped and abused as kids don't go out and kill.<br/><br/>""Monster"" is an incredibly, subtly effective film, but definitely not for the faint of heart.  It's more ""Henry"" than ""Hannibal"".  But, for those who can take it, or enjoy studying the darker aspects of humanity in a serious light, gather your courage and see ""Monster""."

","Just the most incredible acting I've yet seen from Charlize Theron! This is what true acting is all about! She WAS Aileen Wournos. Monster is one of the most well-put-together movies I have ever seen. It's a pity the story is so tragic. It's not often that a group of people can come together and make a movie that does justice in every way to the subject, perhaps justice is the wrong word, but I felt that by the end of the film nothing more need have been shown or said. Perfect script and I have to say handled perfectly by all concerned. Richly deserves the award attention it received. I'm gushing here I know, sorry but this one really IS a must-see film. If you like to be told a story so well that IT is all you see/hear for 2hrs then this is one for you. It felt like the truth and looked like the truth and after doing some research I found it IS the truth, a real 'based on fact' movie. You have no choice here, love it or hate it you WILL be captivated by Charlize Theron in the lead role."
"Agnelin","Null","5","5","20 July 2006"," Definitely worth seeing
","""Monster"" is, overall, one of the saddest films ever, and one which doesn't step back at the view of the darkest side of existence: the fact that there are people who will lead their entire life without one single break, without any long-lasting achievements, success, or happiness. The title suits the story very well -there are many possible interpretations, but I personally like to read it as the description of what Aileen Wuornos's life is: a monster. There's nothing remotely nice in this story about her, and when she seems to have accomplished something, there's this feeling of impending doom -we know that it isn't meant to last long. The story is told by Aileen herself, in a very sarcastic and cynical tone, and she proves how adagios like ""all you need is love and self-confidence"" are just nice words, empty formulas with no real ground.<br/><br/>The film offers a handful of good messages. For example, I find it very interesting that it doesn't chalk all that misery up to life's natural lack of any justice, so that Aileen doesn't appear as just a victim of circumstances, as she says in one moment of the film; instead, the film shows that Aileen often has the option to act one way or the other, and she makes a decision. It could have been different, she could have picked the other option, but she knows what she is doing and she gives many reasons why she's doing so. The film sympathizes with her, but doesn't pity her; it just shows her actions and the motives that she feels are valid. It doesn't justify her. The viewer is left to reach his/her own conclusions. I find this one great achievement of the film, and one that makes a big difference between this film and many dramas that wallow in pity and justification of the character's deeds.<br/><br/>Like many have said, both Charlize Theron's and Christina Ricci's performance are flawless. I feel that Theron really deserved the Oscar. Ricci is great too, and this should be even more of note since she isn't given a lot of space to develop the character of Selby, Aileen's lover.<br/><br/>The film has its flaws, but it still is a rather impressive document, and one that certainly gives some food for thought."
"eddieknocker","10","8","9","14 January 2007"," Phenomenal performance from almost unrecognisable Theron.
","It's rare that I feel the best actress Oscar is ""won"" by the most deserving recipient but Charlize' performance unquestionably was the best of that year and arguably any other year.<br/><br/>For even an established character actress to have pulled this off would be one thing but for a Hollywood pretty-girl to have done so beggars belief.<br/><br/>Where did Charlize get it from? I'm assuming that her personal history was a factor - I believe her mother killed her violent father in self-defence - correct me if i'm wrong - so she perhaps knows something of the life of Aileen Wournos.<br/><br/>If you haven't already I suggest that you see Nick Broomfields two documentaries on the same subject to see how perfectly Theron nailed Aileens aggressive yet vulnerable persona and for further background.<br/><br/>It's an incredibly sad film as well and though the film doesn't spread it on too thick how Aileens loveless childhood created the ""monster"" you can't help but agree in this case that Aileen was created and not born ""evil"" and hopefully feel as i did immense sympathy for her and the trail of almost accidental death that for a few brief moments allowed Aileen to avenge the despicable treatment in her life but then led to her own betrayal by her girlfriend and ultimate demise.<br/><br/>Once again - an astonishing display by Theron."
"bgfield","10","8","9","28 June 2004"," More than just the bio of a killer
","Monster is the true story of Aileen Carol Wuornos, a prostitute in Florida who murdered seven men in the late eighties and early nineties.<br/><br/>Based on the title of the movie, and knowing somewhat of what the movie was about, I watched this film expecting a rather brutal depiction of the actions committed by a serial killer. While it does go into detail of some of the killings and what led to them, it's more than just a recount of a killing spree. It's mainly a love story, with a very depressing theme to it.<br/><br/>Aileen (played by Charlize Theron, who did an AMAZING job) meets a younger girl, Selby (played by Christina Ricci, also a fantastic performance), and the two eventually fall in love. While they appear to be complete opposites, they share two characteristics: a sense of rejection from the world, and a desire to be accepted by others. Selby, a lesbian coming from a very strict religious family, and Aileen, who suffered from an abusive childhood, were both looked down upon by those around them.<br/><br/>The movie makes little attempt to portray Aileen as a monster as the title might suggest. Instead, it displays a different perspective of Wuornos' life. We get to see the human side of Aileen. However, the film in no way tries to condone the murders, but instead goes to show that they weren't simply the result of an evil mind. When not killing people, Aileen appears to be a decent, though short tempered human being.<br/><br/>This film effectively tries to show you that sometimes you can be placed in a horrible situation against your will, and that you might have no say in these life-altering events. Aileen, though a murderer, was not someone who decided one day to get up and start killing people. She was severely abused as a child, destroying her self-confidence at a very early age, and effectively crushing any chance she might have had at a decent, normal life.<br/><br/>Monster is a beautiful and depressing drama with superb acting. A movie that can make you feel sympathetic for a serial killer, without glorifying the murders, is a truly effective one I believe. I think this fact intimidates some people, who might not actually WANT to feel pity or sympathy for a person who committed these crimes. I gave this movie a ten, though I'm not sure if it deserves one, I wanted to try and help raise the average as it certainly deserves more than a 7.4."

Aileen Wuornos is a prostitute from Daytona Beach who become one of the most famous serial killers of United States, and the first female serial killer as well. Her story is so tragic, that we stay moved even she being a killer: Abandoned by her mother,her father died in prison(psychopathic child molester ), she was molested as a kid (8 years old) as well, she started to be a prostitute at 13,became pregnant at 14 (needing to give her kid away for adoption) and things ended with Aileen's love, Selby,even being cold and insensitive with her in Court, acting like she never liked Aileen. With so many problems, I could not be surprise for this woman be so desperate for love, and entering in a life of drugs and crime."
"jackie-107","Null","56","96","4 November 2004"," The American Monster
","This is the desperate story of a woman whose child-abused background led her to teenage prostitution and a disgust with herself and humankind before she reached 30, and then, desperate to keep the spurious affection and shabby love, however ill-judged and unbalanced, of an immature, lonely, and rather stupid lesbian, she turns into a serial killer. Based on the life of Aileen Wournos, Patty Jenkins and Charlize Theron have achieved not only a film of excellence and importance, but of a depth and darkness that takes your breath away. Charlize Theron's brilliant, bravura performance, Christine Ricci's impressive supporting acting, Patty Jenkins's direction, and the structure and script, make Monster an impressive film. Despite the depressing themes, all the more accentuated by sad motel rooms, low-life bars, and dismal highway nights when Wournos is seeking clients - and victims - the film is so strong on characterisation and with a script which rings true at every stage (despite some difficulty in understanding the mumbled dialogue between the two leads at times), it leaves a lasting impression of ineffable sadness.<br/><br/>The film works on many levels and the bottom line is a thorough indictment of the dark side of American society. The monster is American society which can produce, through ignorance, prejudice, abusive behaviour, easy gun-license laws, the death penalty, and so on, the kind of people which Aileen and Selby become. They are extreme examples, of course, but the message is clear. And this film does have a message even though it takes pains not to be judgmental. At the centre of the film, when Aileen confesses her first murders to Selby, she says she is okay with the Lord, it is the society that brought her up, the politics and the religion, that made her what she was. If politics and religion justify so many killings, her own killings are justified (as a way of compensating for the rapes, abuse, the inevitable prostitution, leading to more abuse and rape and hatred of men as well as herself). Her logic may be questionable but her point is well made.<br/><br/>I have noticed a recent succession of movies which focus on lesbian killers and the lesbian lead always ends up badly. Is it no longer valid to make film with a heterosexual female aggressor? Do those women have to remain passive, or victims, or at least equal with the men they are teamed with, but the lesbian is still 'the bad guy'. Thelma and Louise were not portrayed as lesbians (although they still had to come to a sticky end because of their crimes), but since then there is a noticeable trend in Hollywood to recognise these lesbian themed movies by giving the leading actresses Oscars - Frances McDormand in Fargo, Hilary Swank in Boys Don't Cry, and now Charlize Theron in Monster. (However, Monster knocks Boys Don't Cry and Fargo into insignificance.)<br/><br/>I wonder about the motives of Hollywood. The film world may pay lip-service to liberal tolerance of female homosexuality by recognising these actress performances, but the overall impression is that lesbians are not good people and I question that audiences will be encouraged to see lesbians as acceptable members of society, given the film examples in front of them.<br/><br/>So, to me, this film was not so much a feminist polemic as a depressing, but gripping, story about alienation and isolation, told in a way which can't help but leave the viewer asking a lot of questions about a society which creates such 'monsters'. Aileen is simply the flip-side of the American dream and, as such, turns the dream extremely sour."

","This was not an easy movie to like but I was so enthralled at Charlize Theron's makeover and performance that it took center stage over the story.<br/><br/>Theron's physical transformation from the incredibly beautiful woman she is to hard-and-rough looking serial killer Aileen Wournos was just amazing. More than that, I appreciated her effort here, not just with all the makeup but all the mannerisms, the way she walked, moved her head, speech inflection....everything. She was worth the price of the film and I felt the same way after the second viewing months later.<br/><br/>The story is a sordid one, filled with a lot of f-words, so be ready for that if you haven't seen it and wondered about the language. It's very rough. It also includes a lesbian relationship between the two main characters, a relationship I have yet to find that anyone found appealing, frankly.<br/><br/>I may not be able to recommend the movie for its story but if you want to see an actress really step out of her element and give a great performance, check it out.

","If you've seen Nick Broomfield's doc 'Aileen: Life and Death of a Serial Killer' then you'll know how uncannily accurate Charlize Theron's performance is in Monster, as the alternately terrifying and sympathetic Aileen Wuornos. Given the rest of her output, I'd be shocked if it isn't the defining performance of her career, but given the towering nature of it, most people would be glad to add it to their résumé. Monster is a bleak, depressing and harrowing film, and Theron is the centre of it. However, of equal importance is Christina Ricci, as she serves to balance Theron and give a dramatic hook to the story. As the plaudits showered upon Theron, I think Ricci was overlooked, as she also gives a terrific performance as the weak Selby, who is complicit in most of the crimes and thus just as much a Monster in many ways.<br/><br/>Certainly the film takes liberties with the facts of the case, but so what? It is entertainment, not education. I am sure Wuornos' victims' families were not all happy that she was painted in such a way as to help understand her crimes rather than to simply vilify her for them, but as a disturbing picture of the evil that men and women do, Monster is top class."

That image was in my head for days. My boyfriend even started crying a little during it. After going through all that, I would probably start killing men too! After I watched it though, I watched the documentary about Aileen Wournos and in it she said she never got raped, she just made it up. So maybe they just ignored that part to make a better movie. Which is terrible. But I do believe she was abused and molested as a child so I am not surprised she ended up where she did. If the system would just make sure kids were safe, we wouldn't have most of the problems we have as a society."
"Kevin_Maness","8","3","3","17 June 2006"," horrifically disturbing movie
","I watched Monster last night, and it's one of the very few movies that's ever stayed strongly with me this long after it was over. I had trouble sleeping because the movie's scenes kept playing through my mind, and then I woke up early and couldn't get back to sleep because I couldn't stop replaying the horrifically disturbing scenes of Aileen's life as a prostitute.<br/><br/>I guess I'll comment briefly on Charlize Theron's performance--everybody else has. It was good, but not as great as I've heard over the past couple years. Her facial make-up sometimes seemed like a mask that obscured her expressiveness, but then again, maybe she was playing it a little dead at times to show the numbness that Aileen sometimes must have felt. OK, I'm not sure this will come out right, but I'm just not really into the idea of a very attractive actress dressing down to play a rather non-attractive woman. In a way, and I don't mean to cheapen this by analogy, but it's kind of like blackface. Here we have Hollywood, where beautiful women get almost all the roles available, and out comes a movie with an amazing role that calls for a woman who's not the gorgeous Hollywood glamor type, and who gets the role? A gorgeous Hollywood glamor type. That's what I mean by the blackface comparison--it's a little like having a movie with roles for black actors and choosing instead to cast white actors with painted faces (although Theron's portrayal was not, in itself, derogatory, unlike blackface). It happens all the time--""need an Arab? cast a dark-skinned Italian."" In Monster, it's, ""need a woman whose life's pain has made its mark on her face and body? cast a woman whose face and body perfectly represent our nation's weirdly skewed ideal of beauty and then make her fatter and, pardon me, uglier."" Just doesn't seem quite fair to me. Perhaps it has something to do with the Academy's penchant to give awards for this kind of role (think of Hilary Swank's role for Boys Don't Cry), and part of it probably also has to do with the fact that Theron was one of the film's producer.<br/><br/>Anyway, the film made me feel ill, and that's a good thing in this case. I have a lot of trouble believing that there are so many men who would hire prostitutes along the side of the road (or anywhere else for that matter). Or, rather, I don't want to believe it, but I guess it's sadly not hard to believe. Even more broadly, I think the film is another scathing indictment of a wealthy society that cares so little about its poor, particularly its poor children. I'm not so naively ""liberal"" as to agree that Aileen's character had no choice but to do what she did to survive, but I think it's painfully obvious that the choices available to her were fewer by many orders of magnitude than the choices available to me, or to people of the wealthiest groups in our nation. What can we do to open up more opportunities for the poor, and when will we do it? Good movie, although I hope I never see it again."

Christina Ricci once again dominates and shocks the world with her talented acting yet the one who did the greatest job is Charlize Theron as Aileen. I also give a hand to the make-up department because they made Ricci very young (like a teenager) and Theron VERY, VERY OLD and decrypted (She 49 years old, and she was in her thirties!!)

"flask","Null","3","3","10 April 2006"," In each of us there beats a heart of darkness...
","In one of the most unexpected cinematic performances of the past decade, the naturally beautiful actress Charlize Theron has metamorphosed herself into a troubled and not particularly glamorous prostitute in director Patty Jenkin's ""Monster"" (2003). <br/><br/>""Monster"" (2003) dramatizes the heinous acts committed by Aileen Wuornos, a Daytona Beach prostitute who became a serial killer. Aileen's story is both tragic and repulsive: a testament to our cruel world in which good and evil are often the same. The cruelty of this world and the effect it has upon Aileen would not have been conveyed so powerfully if not for the heartfelt performance of Charlize Theron.<br/><br/>Some critics may assert that Theron's changed external appearance for the character is the key to her depiction of Aileen. I would disagree. Much like the performances of Lon Chaney, the make-up itself -- shaved eyebrows, dark contacts, latex eyelids, an obtrusive mouthpiece and spray-on skin blemishes -- are merely the finishing touch on a powerful, haunting emotional performance that sears the viewer's memory.<br/><br/>And no more memorable is the performance of Christiana Ricci. Ricci has been typecast as the oddball character or the cutting ingénue in past films, but her performance here as a repressed suburbanite with no friends due to her overt homosexuality is downright inspired and is perhaps unfairly overshadowed by the gripping performance of Theron. However, no amount of great acting can overcome a poor screenplay or story. Thankfully, ""Monster"" is quite compelling in this department.<br/><br/>Based on actual events, the plot of the film is fairly straightforward: An emotionally and physically abused individual, Aileen (Charlize Theron), seeks companionship with Selby, a moonstruck lesbian. Although Aileen is not a homosexual, her lifelong loneliness and brutal experiences with males compel her to seek an emotional haven in Selby's arms as another female outcast. In return, Aileen unknowingly infuses Selby with the free will and raw authority Aileen wields in every situation. In need of money, Aileen begins sporadically murdering the clients she attracts while soliciting.<br/><br/>Now, I have conducted no research whatsoever as to whether this film is accurate to the actual story or historical personages it is based upon. However, as a piece of cinema, the film evocatively captures both the quaintness and bleakness of gas stations, the depressing loneliness of cheap motel rooms and the gloomy, never-ending stretches of interstate highways which project as a whole an oppressive sense of inescapable despair.<br/><br/>This disturbing film represents a newer, truer, darker and grittier strain of cinema that unflinchingly explores the mercilessness of our society and the nonreturnable, often miserable, lives we are given. It contains no heroic ending or fairy-tale fluff, but stark reality spoon-fed in large gulps."

","I watched this movie recently after seeing Nick Broomfield's Docu, The Death Of A serial Killer. After reading a lot of user comments,most of which I agreed with,ie.that this is a very fine film, albeit lacking in some areas.What I am surprised with, is only a few contributors are making any reference to Aileen's state of mind at this stage in her life. I don't condone murder, capital or otherwise and surely this woman's fate was to serve her time in a facility for the criminally insane. I for one, am of the opinion that Aileen had lost her mind and was clearly insane at the time she was committing this heinous crimes. I was very impressed with this film. Theron was spellbinding in the lead and fair play to Ricci, I thought her performance was top drawer. Patty Jenkins has to be commended on a wonderful directorial debut and portrayed some very emotive and contraversal issues with poise and balance. The question for me was exactly who are the victims in this film? The only answer that makes any sense to me, apart from the obvious, is that Aileen had died a long time before these murders ever took place. Surely society as a whole must take a little responsibility for letting people as vunerable as this fall through any form of safety net. Enough said, I rate this movie as one of the best I've seen in a while and would have no hesitation in recommending it."
"Chris_Docker","8","3","3","7 April 2004"," Heavy drama
","A gripping, gruelling, story of a highway prostitute who becomes a serial killer and one of the most powerful films of the year. The performance by the heavily transformed (normally gorgeous) Charlize Theron into the rather scary overweight Aileen is an all-time great. Christina Ricci also adds notches to her promising career, this time as a convincing teenage lesbian, enthralled by the older woman, and deeply in love until she realises she's run off with a mentally unbalanced murderer. Theron's character is based on a true life story (the subject of two separate film documentaries) - perhaps the emotional power lies in the sympathy the audience feels for her for quite a long time - a sort of, ""if only something good could happen once in her miserable life, just one ray of light, surely she deserves a chance . .."". Be warned, it contains very disturbing scenes, including extreme sexual violence. It's a pretty depressing tale, convincingly seen from the point of view of someone who's life has little or no hope."
"RoboSlater","1","75","145","17 September 2004"," Theron Ignored the Victims
","Monster claims it is ""based on a true story."" But it is not as true as you might think. <br/><br/>True, serial killer Aileen Wuornos was convicted and then executed 12 years ago in Florida. <br/><br/>In the movie, Wuornos is presented as a killer with a soft side in a loving lesbian relationship with her girlfriend, played by Christina Ricci.<br/><br/>Here's the problem: If filmmakers say their movie is ""based on a true story,"" shouldn't the heart of the story be true? <br/><br/>Down on Her Luck, or Brutal Killer?<br/><br/>Wuornos was a prostitute who hitchhiked across central Florida to find customers. In the movie, she tries to go straight but society lets her down, making it difficult for her to find a job, so she returns to the streets.<br/><br/>As Monster tells it, one john brutally beats and rapes Wuornos in some very disturbing scenes. When the attacker threatens to kill her, she shoots him in self-defense. When moviegoers see the graphic rape scene, many feel Wuornos is the victim. This has family members of the real victims unhappy.<br/><br/>Theron helped produce the film, and talks about the research she did while promoting the film. I would think the research would include talking to the prosecutor, John Tanner, who spent years investigating Wuornos and the seven men she killed. <br/><br/>But he was not consulted.<br/><br/>""You know, these men had wives. They have daughters, brothers, sons, friends,"" Tanner told ABCNEWS. ""And anyone that sees that film is left with the impression that - at least some of the men that were murdered deserved to die and that she was acting in self-defense. It's a total lie.""<br/><br/>Wuornos even admitted that her crimes, committed in Florida in the 1980s, were not ""self-defense."" During her trial, Wuornos took the stand and said she ""robbed"" the men and killed them ""as cold as ice.""<br/><br/>""And I'd do it again, too, I know I'd kill another person, 'cause I've hated humans for a long time,"" said Wuornos. She then continued to claim the men were innocent while in prison, after she said she found God.<br/><br/>""I want to come clean. There is no self-defense,"" said Wuornos. ""And so I need to come clean, I need to tell the world that there is no self-defense in my cases."" <br/><br/>When picking up her Golden Globe for her performance, Theron thanked lots of people, but she never once mentioned the families of the murdered men.<br/><br/>""I don't think they cared about the victims' families,"" said Linda Yates. Her mother was engaged to Gino Antonio, when Wuornos killed him. ""[Wuornos] was just a vicious person,"" said Yates. <br/><br/>In fact, the filmmakers didn't talk to any of the victims families. Mike Humphreys' dad was also murdered. He has a problem with the way the movie was produced: ""I don't think that they ought to do this to the victims out there,"" said Humphreys. <br/><br/>""This movie is portraying her as a victim,"" said Letha Prater. ""She isn't. She was not a victim. My brother was a victim."" <br/><br/>Most of the family members won't go to the movie. <br/><br/>The movie does acknowledge Wuornos killed one man who was trying to help her, but all the others are shown as johns. The families say that's cruel to them.<br/><br/>I confronted Brad Wyman, one of Monster's producers. <br/><br/>I told him that while in the movie, Wuornos' character is tied up, beaten and raped, but in reality, she said that never happened. ""I believe she said that in order to actually try to expedite her own execution,"" said Wyman. ""She really wanted to end her own personal tragedy."" <br/><br/>Wyman said the filmmaker did her best to protect the victims in the portrayal, changing details including their license plates and the color of their cars. But they never spoke to the victims' families because, as Wyman puts it, they did not want to ""unearth more tragedy in their lives.""<br/><br/>Wyman explained why the film took liberties with some facts. ""It's not a documentary. I mean in no way is it,"" said Wyman. ""It is a dramatic portrayal searching for kind of a greater truth rather than a  a factual truth."" <br/><br/>A greater truth than factual truth? <br/><br/>Give me a break. <br/><br/>-- John Stoessel"

","""Monster"" is based on the true story of Aileen Wuornos, the prostitute that turned serial killer in the 1990's in Florida. As we first see Aileen as a girl, you get to understand her past a little: molested as a child and treated with cruelty while growing up, which leads her into prostitution by the age of 13. We cut to Aileen (Charlize Theron) years later, working her trade in Florida. She seems on the brink of suicide until she meets Selby (Christina Ricci), who is living in Florida because her parents sent her there because she kissed a girl. Aileen falls deeply in love with Selby and wants to keep her happy. However, since she doesn't have any job skills other than being a hooker, she continues to do what she knows. It's during one night when one of her johns become brutal that Aileen begins to kill.<br/><br/>Shelby soon realizes the scope of Aileen's crimes, but is torn as to what to do. And Aileen world is getting out of control, killing johns in a way to lash out at her horrific past and to keep Shelby happy by robbing them of their cars and money.<br/><br/>This film pretty much is a twisted love story: Aileen finds true love with Selby and does anything to keep that love from slipping away, even if it results in someone's death. And Shelby clearly loves Aileen, although it can be said that she may love the freedom that Aileen gives her (She runs away from her relatives house to be with Aileen because her relatives are trying to ""cure"" her from being lesbian).<br/><br/>Theron's performance won an well-deserved Oscar. She is frightening and loving at the same time. Ricci's performance is also right on the mark. And it was nice to see Bruce Dern's performance as Thomas, the only man that seems to treat Aileen with kindness (Even trying to help her escape). This is a can't miss film."
"bob the moo","Null","13","22","29 September 2004"," Unpleasant and very little fun to watch but, despite some slips, it is a strong film and fair dramatisation of the story that is tragic, depressing and has nothing that will uplift you in any way
","Aileen Wuornos is a drifter and low rent prostitute. Turning up in a gay bar to spend her last $5 before killing herself brings about a chance meeting with the young and pretty Selby, trying to work out her own sexuality. While turning tricks for enough money for a motel, Aileen experiences a violent John, who she kills in response to a brutal rape attempt. With the money and the car she takes from him, Aileen takes Selby away with her for a life of partying and fun but, when the money runs out and the chances for real employment amount to zero, Aileen goes back out on the street. However faced with one more penis to sick, Aileen kills her John, starting a violent cycle of murder. <br/><br/>A few months ago I saw Nick Broomfield's follow up documentary on Wuornos in which he followed her appeal and then her final days, hours and minutes before her death sentence was carried out. From that viewpoint I was left with no doubt that Wuornos was in no fit mental state to be executed even though she killed those men in cold blood  I suggest you see it for yourself because it is a film that will shake you deep about your sense of justice. Seeing Monster after that film puts me in a strange position where I felt that the film was unsure whether or not it felt sympathy for Aileen or judged her. I think it was a strength of the writing that it didn't seek to totally excuse or to condemn and ended up somewhere in the middle  acknowledging the totally sh*t life she had but never excusing her murders or making them less than the cold blooded executions that they were. In trying to dramatise this story the film just about manages to do it well, producing a film that is tragic, violent, idealistic and repulsive in equal measures. Occasionally I did wonder why I was watching such a bleak, depressing story when I'd already heard it from the woman herself, but it was worth it overall.<br/><br/>The main criticism I would have was that Jenkins was making a dramatisation of this story, not a totally true one  so we don't know how brutally she was beaten that caused her to kill, nor do we know if she really wept and struggled to kill some of her victims; these are things that are added to the character that we can't be sure of, but I didn't feel they were over the top. As director, Jenkins is much better; she frames her shots well and she directs with style but without making it flashy over too obvious  some shots are so sparse and bleak that I felt they captured the tone really well. Of course the film is carried by a massive performance from Theron who, looks, sounds and acts just like the Wuornos that I have seen on the documentaries. So often trading on her looks and denied good roles, she takes to this with total enthusiasm and she thoroughly deserved the Oscar that she got for it. Ricci is equally as good but obviously is in the shadows for most of the film. Her character was never really explained and was treated more as our way in by Jenkins as opposed to being a major part of the story and the murders. Minor roles for Dern and Vince add interest but I did have to wonder why either of them were happy to accept such minor roles  certainly Vince is a much better actor and too well known to be given a role of 'John #5' and be given a hand job.<br/><br/>Overall this is a powerful film that avoids swinging one way or another, although it is evident that, at times, Jenkins did find herself coming down on the side of Wuornos at some points  but happily never too heavily. The story is unpleasant and it is no fun to watch no matter what your view of the outcome is. It is greatly helped by two great performances, especially Theron, who I seriously doubt will ever get a role this good again."
"wchngliu","10","4","5","27 June 2007"," A Killer Performance By Theron That Explores The Motives Behind Wournos' Mindset
","For all of the debates surrounding the prosthetic look of Charlize Theron and her physical transformation into Aileen Wournos, it is her performance and the manner of which she has carried off that performance as that character, that makes Monster such a interesting film to watch. With the direction taken by Patty Jenkins, it is not so much a film about a woman committing heinous acts, but unlike so many serial killer movies which very much rely on violence and in depicting that violence on screen to explain their evil intentions, Monster attempts to show to us that the violent nature of Wournos' erratic behaviour is partly as a result of society's failure to acknowledge and assist those who have fell through the net and were let down by the system; thus they turn to crime, such as murder. I am not saying that I condoned the actions of Aileen Wournos- apart from one who- according to her, tried to rape her-, but rather with the abuse that she had experienced as a child,they played a considerable part in her growing up as an angry, bitter woman. Her psychological and emotional damage was inflicted by those who were in her care and of whom were in the hands of those people of whom were supposed to protect Aileen.<br/><br/>Monster is alas, not a serial killer movie, but neither is it a lesbian one: the violence for example is not as excessive and gory in stark contrast to other so-called films of a similar nature. Having said that the rape scene in the car where Aileen is attacked and taken advantaged of was somewhat distressing to watch. It is most certainly not implying that violence is, in the context of this film, utilised as a way of empowering women over men. It is in fact a film which attempts to underline how behind the troubles and abhorrent actions lie a emotionally scarred and frustrated person, who was clearly troubled and not happy, nor satisfied with oneself. Irrespective of her gender. But also that she was often misunderstood by certain parts of society; like for instance when she goes and applies for jobs she gets turned down. Also in one scene which also took place in a car, she had killed her first john, as an act of self-defence, after he tried to rape her. Because of that incident, she is spurred on by the assumption that all men are women rapists, paedophiles etc and continues her killing spree by targeting her male victims and thus shooting them, one by one.<br/><br/>The role that Selby, of which her real name is Lydia and whom was Aileen's lover, plays is important because it was during the time in which those murders were carried out, that she had been in a lesbian relationship with her. Christina Ricci gave as good a performance as she did and it was interesting that it was Monster where she made her film comeback, after spending a couple of years out of the limelight.<br/><br/>The acting was first class, the direction was masterful and the locations looked spectacular. Theron delivers a killer and mesmerising performance as Aileen- never had I seen her in a performance of a lifetime, until I saw this film. Even without the prosthetics, I do think that she could've just about pulled it off, still. Given her not too impressive previous on- screen roles as stereotypical male eye candy and blonde bombshell figures, there was always this danger that she would be ridiculed, as well as type casted as an actress. Thankfully for her, her solid efforts in Monster, as well as North Country, put an end to all that and the persistent criticism being levelled against her.<br/><br/>Overall, Monster is a superb film full of raw, passionate emotion. I very much doubt that any other movie that Theron had starred in or will star in, will ever supersede and surpass her excellent rendition of Wournos. Kudos to Theron, Ricci and Jenkins though. It is one of the best films to come out of the 21st century."
"Bjork-is-God","10","4","5","19 June 2004"," Absolutely heart breaking!
","This film is based on the true life story of highway prostitute turned serial-killer, Aileen Wuornos. Charlize Theron playes Wuornos, one of life's damaged people, she is jaded about life, down to her last $5 and suicidal when she meets Selby (Christina Ricci). After a rough start the two connect. Wuornos continues 'hooking' and is servilely raped by one of her Johns. She shoots him in self-defence. Aileen then begs Selby to move in with her and when Aileen is unable to find legitimate work she is forced to go back to working as a prostitute. Aileen soon makes a habit of shooting her costumers. Charlize Theron gives a totally convincing performance which is transcendently great, genuine and entirely astonishing. Her transformation from super beautiful to super ugly is amazing. It is not just a matter of make-up but a totally psychological embodiment. She truly gets into the psyche of Wuornos (she defiantly deserved her Oscar!) Charlize's performance is one that will be talked about for many years to come and it's done with an incredible amount of understanding of Wuornos' sentiment. Not for a second did Theron lose focus of Wuornos. It's a gut wrenching performance that is easily the unsurpassed. Theron finally has received the role that proves herself as a wonderful actress. To me this film was absolutely heart breaking. The authentic writing combined with Charlize's tour de force performance is totally compelling. The tragic ending will stay with you hours after the credits have rolled. 10/10"

","I wasn´t really prepared for a film like this. When I saw the Oscars I had only seen ""Somethings Gotta Give"" and not ""Monsters"" so I was like ""How could Charlize win over Diane Keaton, one of the best actresses ever?"" I didn´t think that a film about a prostitute killer could be so good and so touching that it would give the leading role an Oscar for best actress. While watching this film I felt sorry for Aileen, who really wanted a good life for her and her new girlfriend, the only person in her whole life who liked her, thinking that maybe there was a plan for her too. A chance to live a normal life, like everyone else. I guess she didn´t have that luck anyway. She gave up that for her lover Selby. For her she went back to the prostitution, so she could maker her happy, but after that her ""John"" was about to rape her, she got enough. Once again her loving Selby got her get back in the hard rough world. It was too much for Aileen who was probably by that time really fed up with those men. So she killed them one after one. Like she was punishing them for what they were about to do, buy sex. For everyones sake I wish it went a better way.<br/><br/>This film is one of the best ones I´ve ever seen. Believe me or not I did feel sorry for her for all the things she went through in her life, and that it had to end up the way it did. She was a killer and a victim at the same time. I believe that Selby also was guilty (manipulating her to kill).<br/><br/>Now I understand why Charlize got her Oscar. And she did more than deserve it. It must have been really hard playing this part, for which she probably will be most known for."
"Sandman138","10","4","5","14 March 2004"," This is What Film Making is all About
","SPOILERS<br/><br/>I cannot say enough good things about this movie. It is what film is all about. This had to be one of the most human stories I have ever seen. Most movies about serial killers either paint them out to be pure evil or misunderstood. Monster showed Aileen to be just another person who screwed up. Some feel that this was sympathetic to Aileen. It may have been, but I saw it less as a justification of her actions and more as an attempt to see Aileen as more than simply a ""female murderer"". Any justification for Aileen's actions came more from her own head then from the film. The first man she killed seemed justified as self defense. However, the rest of the men she killed for their money and her justification that she knew they were rapists and bad men was obviously her attempt to ease her guilt. Charlize Theron gave an amazing performance that truly made Aileen believable. Christina Ricci is really the underrated gem of this piece though. As Selby, she perfectly portrayed a young woman trying to be an adult yet unable to make her own decisions. She was horrified that Aileen was killing these men but at the same time she would complain to her that she needed money. The cinematography was incredible. I was amazed that they were able to hold a scene on pretty much one shot and not become dull. The seeming simplicity is in reality a huge accomplishment. The only real complaint I could have is with the soundtrack which at times betrayed the emotional impact of the scene and made what could have been a powerful moment feel a bit cheesy, and the last shot which just felt contrived. Other than that, this film is for me, a tribute to the craft. 9/10"

","Monster will grip you, captivate you, seize every emotion in your body, and then....it will disturb you for years to come. Patty Jenkins did an excellent job directing this title, and all actors and actresses did their part in making this is a well made film. Monster is the true story about Aileen, a Florida women who was put to death by lethal injection in 2002 after finally being caught for the murder of several men. Simply put, circumstances turned her into a brutal, man killing monster, and the film follows the tragic events that led up to such an event. It's not really her fault that one man can mess your mind up to be driven to commit horrific slaughter as such, and the drastic measures that the state takes can be questionable. Many will have have their own thoughts, opinions, and beliefs after watching this film, and its very important that everyone has some kind of respect for each others thoughts, opinions, and beliefs, because the way I see it, there's no right or wrong answer here. I appreciate a lot of the reviews on this site, I have read several, and I love that everyone has different points and takes on the film, in ways that I would have never viewed or looked at it, something ( if not everything) has worked here. Its designed to be controversial. It's designed to shock and disturb you. And there aren't any words to describe the surreal feeling that this movie manages to capture, toying with your every thought and emotion. Some may feel sorry for Aileen. Others may despise her. Some may see her as a monster. Others may see her as a hero. I, myself, cannot defend why she did what she did. Killing is wrong, murder is wrong, taking the law into your own hands is wrong, but on the same token, I truly understand why she did the killing. I understand why she did the murders. I understand why she took the law into her own hands. Female serial killers is rare, making up only 1% of the serial killers in America. Aileen was only the ninth or tenth woman to be executed, sentenced to death by lethal injection. The film is engrossing, and yet can be very difficult to watch by very sensitive viewers, especially the ones who may have been victims themselves. The film seems to silently beg for any of these victims to get help before any of these events take place. Besides, nobody, no matter what they've done to you, is worth dying over....your life has more value then anything that's taken place. I give Monster 8 out of possible 10 stars.<br/><br/>""He who fights with monsters might care lest he thereby become a monster"" A quote from Mark Twain."

The most painful aspect of this movie is that the world pushed her towards being a monster.

","Even now, eleven years after 'Monster' was first released, it's still difficult to comprehend that that's Charlize Theron you're watching. We all know that it's her of course, but it's still hard to reconcile the wild eyed, jittery and aggressively-defensive woman at the centre of this film with the glamorous Hollywood starlet we're used to. What's even more remarkable is that despite being a violent, foul-mouthed and unhinged lunatic who winds up killing several people, Theron still manages to make Aileen Wuornos a sympathetic character. She does some terrible things, but you'll still feel sorry for her come the closing credits. It's a masterful performance and that Oscar was well deserved.<br/><br/>A single terrific performance doesn't make a movie however and even if it were a different actress in the lead role, 'Monster' would still be an excellent movie. It tells the story of a woman who became a prostitute at the age of 13, never escaped it and eventually grew into a gun-totting serial killer who would pick up men at the roadside, then murder them to steal their cars and money. It's a film about life at the bottom rung of society and is mercilessly harrowing in its depiction of life in the gutter. There are scenes of rape and murder, some devastatingly un-erotic sexual encounters and there's more chance of Godzilla turning up than a Richard Gere shaped Knight In Shining Armour.<br/><br/>And yet, 'Monster' still has moments of warmth and humour. Aileen's rather misguided attempts at pursuing a new career lead to a few unexpected laughs, while her roller-disco kiss with her lesbian lover Selby is remarkably touching. There's also a brief but moving appearance by Bruce Dern as Aileen's only real friend and his speech about survival is one of the great understated moments of the film.<br/><br/>Plus, there's Christina Ricci as Selby who plays off against Theron admirably. Where Aileen is loud and confrontational, Selby is shy, quiet and for the most part rather sweet. She also gets rather petulant at times and Ricci manages to just about convince that she can remain innocent while begging Aileen to start prostituting herself for money again. What's more, they have a natural chemistry and do genuinely seem to love one another, even when screaming at each other in alcohol fuelled frustration.<br/><br/>In other words,this is an excellent film. Theron gives the performance of her career and the film does a remarkable job shining a light on the grubby underbelly of modern society. Prostitutes, alcoholics, junkies and vagrants all exist and while 'Monster' doesn't exactly make them seem noble, it does humanise them. Highly recommended."
"paul2001sw-1","8","2","2","16 November 2006"," Spot on
","The cinemas often seem to be over-run by films depicting implausible female serial killers with unusual sex lives as inhuman monsters. But this film is actually based on a true story, and in spite of its title, never reduces its central character to sub-human status. Indeed, anyone who has seen the documentary films Nick Broomfield made about Aileen Wuornos during her time on Death Row will be struck by how precisely Charlize Theron has captured her voice, her physical presence, and quite a lot of her character, although she never quite manages to represent the full extent of Wournos' madness, which is perhaps slightly suppressed in order to allow the film to bear at least some resemblance to a more normal story. Still, this is a tough and brave movie, actually interested in understanding how something as terrible as the events it depicts could have happened, and worth watching although unquestionably grim."

I must say life has a grotesque irony sometimes!...Returning to Aileen I believe she didn't kill men because she was a pure blood killer, because she liked to kill, but because she was seeking love - which she could get by providing Selby money, whatever she needed..., i think Selby was superficial and selfish - in the end she ""sold"" Aileen to the police having no remorse...I believe Aileen did not realize what she was doing until it was too late...I believe she was a victim, she was defenseless, vulnerable...this movie really made me think more about justice, prejudice, love, tragedies..."
"ooogadoooga","9","2","2","9 October 2005"," Impressive and realistic performances
","I watched this film tonight, on The sundance channel, knowing nothing about it...When I hit the remote and saw the description, I figured the Charleze Therone credit in the movie must have been a mistake---I kept watching and thought..O.K. maybe Charleze has a small role later on in the film--<br/><br/>Then not seeing her, after watching for quite a while, I was convinced this credit was a typo, one way or another, this was someone else...The character she created was compelling, it's why I decided to watch it...She was very unattractive, but a realistic idenifiable person that I felt for. I am extremely impressed with how much charleze transformed herself--totally un- recognizable. <br/><br/>The film was kinda horrible, what with the subject matter, and yet, because there seemed to be a real person in real pain, somehow I identified with that pain and desperation of the character, but after the first murder, which seemed to clearly be in self defense, the further murders became more and more horrible and disturbing, especially the last one, who was a really kind hearted man that pleaded with her and offered her his car and wallet. That one was particularly horrible, as the man was particularly kind hearted.<br/><br/>Overall, I don't see too much reason for a ""Serial Killer"" film to be made, as far as improving or inspiring the world, but I guess a few of them can be a little educational, but again, I don't know how necessary this education is or could ever be for society. However, I guess, if one understands the background of this character, and how it directly influjinced this character to become who she was, it may be educational in just that, understanding what makes these kinds of people tic. <br/><br/>I wish a film like this might be seen by those parents who are responsible in creating this kind of a person by their abuse, and it would influence them to stop, but somehow, I don't think that happens too often. Other than that, and having some understanding in how someone comes to this sort of a thing, I don't see that there should be more than a few films of this category made.<br/><br/>I think that the film is certainly more realistic than most."
"aimless-46","9","2","2","21 August 2005"," A Different Kind of Love Story
","While IMHO ""Monster"" is an absolutely amazing film, it obviously is not going to be everyone's cup of tea. But the only reasons for criticism are writer/director Patty Jenkins' exploitation of a real-life situation and the perception that serial killer Aileen is portrayed as more of a victim that those she murdered. While there is some logic to those arguments, I think Jenkins actually showed considerable restraint. Exploitation and character identification are inevitable in this type of story. It is more a question of degree-if you compare this to 1990's tearjerker ""Too Young to Die"" (starring Juliette Lewis in an almost identical story), Jenkins comes off as a model of objectivity and distanced perspective.<br/><br/>What is most unique and compelling about ""Monster"" is that it is much more a love story than a thriller or a crime drama. The two main love scenes are absolutely riveting, with intensity levels higher than you are likely to find in any other film. ""Tide Is High"" and ""Crimson and Clover"" will never sound the same.<br/><br/>One thing that works unexpectedly well is the incredible contrast between the two characters. Jenkins works hard to emphasize this, with camera shots that emphasize the physical size differences coupled with dialogue and behaviors that emphasize the contrasting personalities of this odd pair. Having Scott Wilson play the last murder victim is a homage to an earlier ""Mutt and Jeff"" pair of murderers, as he played Robert Blake's ""In Cold Blood"" sidekick.<br/><br/>Although most of the critical acclaim has gone to Theron for her portrayal of Aileen, I think that a lot of the credit for Theron's masterful performance should go to Ricci's subtle and nuanced portrayal of Selby. Watch Ricci's eyes in all her reaction shots, it is as close to acting for the camera perfection as you are likely to ever see.<br/><br/>If you really enjoyed Theron's incredible transformation from her typical hot starlet to this gritty prostitute role, then check out Catherine Deneuve in ""Repulsion"" (1965) and ""Belle de jour"" (1967). While not as physically extreme as Theron's transformation, Deneuve's two characters are equally hard to reconcile as being played by the same actress. Yet another acting for the camera marvel, as wardrobe, makeup, and hair-styling combine with behaviors and speech to effect an amazing range between two characters played by the same actress."
"Blooeyz2001","9","2","2","16 January 2005"," Aileen Carol Wuornos (2/29/59 - 10/9/02)
","This movie is not for everyone. It's hard to take & depressing. It's the story of a lost, tortured soul who was certainly ""walking wounded"". She was a serial killer & by all accounts only the first killing was justified & the lowlife deserved his fate. The film tells the story of Aileen (Lee) Wuornos without justifying what she did. The viewer actually gets to know her as a human being & I sympathized with her to a degree. It's the humanization of her that made me sympathize with her. Otherwise, she'd just be another nut-job/hooker/murderer who also got what she deserved. There are some insights into her here & there in the film (molested as a child, raped by a family ""friend"", beaten by her father who later committed suicide, discarded by her siblings, became a prostitute at 13 to survive, battered by partners & cops, alcoholism etc.) that make you feel that this somewhat powerless & uneducated woman actually became addicted to killing once she started because it was a release of anger & hatred that had built up inside of her for so many years. I also felt sympathy for her because she wanted to ""go straight"" & work but she set her sights too high & was knocked down once again. Granted, the attempt to straighten her life out was mostly out of fear of being caught after she killed the first guy in self defense, but she also loved Selby & possibly wanted more ""nomalcy"" for them as a couple in that respect as well. I know the movie takes liberties with some facts. For example, the real Selby was not a whiny, naive nineteen year old, but a big bruiser who enjoyed instigating & egging Wuornos on into fights with others. Charlize Theron deserved her Oscar for portraying & transforming herself into this complex woman with so much passion & dedication."

","""Monster"" comes at the story of notorious highway hooker and serial killer Aileen Carol Wuornos from a unique angle by developing a character who is so beat up by life, so failed by society, and so weakened by emotional pain that the only way she knows to sustain the shred of happiness she finds in an ill-wrought lesbian relationship is to seduce her victims by plying her trade and then killing them to get all of their money. Theron's Oscar winning and much lauded performance as Wuornos is first rate indeed but probably over-touted because of the rub-off from her physical metamorphosis and the intense drama of her situation thanks to the vision of the film's relatively obscure auteur Patty Jenkins. It is rare that a film engenders such compassion for a killer as does ""Monster"" in a society which tends to simply lump all street whores, drug addicts, homeless people, etc. into the ""loser"" category so they can be swept under the cultural carpet and forgotten. Kudos to Jenkins for this moving and disturbing look at the price of ignoring those most in need but too fractured to cry for help. (A-)"

We could not even move until the theatre lights has come back on at the end of the credits. Normally, I would hold a small amount of contempt for Ms. Theron because of her previous roles being reduced to nothing more than mere ""eye-candy"", but she really pulled my heart out with this movie.

"feronique","3","7","12","7 March 2010"," Could be better....
","I finally got a chance to see this film, after a very strong recommendation from one of my friends. I don't know whether there's something wrong with me, but I found Charlize Theron's character unbelievably annoying, her face expression always tense and the behaviour as well as gestures - very unnatural (does anyone really smoke cigarettes in such a way?). Generally looking at her made me uncomfortable and having seen the actual pictures of Aileen Wuornos, I think that the creators overdid it a bit with the make-up, making Theron look unnecessarily ugly. I have to say that I found Ricci's performance much more believable and convincing. <br/><br/>When it comes to the story, I find it rather incredible how people are quick to defend the victims and judge the Wournos as a heartless murderer.<br/><br/>Because of the circumstances in which she committed the murders it is impossible to say to what extent they were acts of self-defence and to what extent these were cold-blooded killings. However, one sure thing is that, whether Wournos was a heartless murderer or just a very scared, cornered and terribly lost person, she still was a product of her childhood experiences. I think that if the director wanted to present some wider picture of the protagonist and her circumstances, he definitely should have put more effort into showing what led to the ""birth"" of the Monster. It's rather obvious that what triggered the murders didn't happen on the night the first victim died, but years earlier. Unfortunately I had a feeling that the murderer's childhood experiences were really marginalised in the film, being reduced to just a couple of comments made by the protagonist on various occasions. But then, probably if the film showed the events from Wournos' childhood, it would be even more disturbing and possibly unwatchable. Which in its turn leads me to the following reflection - if the whole truth is too disturbing and the half-truth that the film serves is insufficient, then was this film really worth making? Was it indeed worth watching? Well, you should probably judge for yourself. Personally, I fully suspect that any of the actual documentaries made about Wournos might serve better in explaining her motives and possibly in presenting her story. The story of her life is not much of entertainment material and the film does not provide enough information to be considered substantial food for thought."

","Charlize Theron's performance in Monster was impressive, but in no way deserving of the acclaim and awards the actress has been getting. Monster is a film that is bleak to the heart, and the gimmick of seeing a gorgeous woman convincingly look ugly does not erase the fact that the thematic content of this movie is void of redeeming facet.<br/><br/>Patty Jenkins supposedly does not want us to sympathize with this woman, but the film I saw cried out for us to sympathize with her.<br/><br/>Even worse, the families of the victims of this serial killer have claimed to be upset that the film shows some of the murders as having been committed in self defense, something that there is no evidence of in real life.<br/><br/>Great crime films are about the victims, and the great ones that are not about the victims do not attempt to make horrible people like martyrs.

","Some people who have seen what Charlize Theron looks like in her new film `Monster'-either from the film or in publicity photos-have said that she looks `fat and ugly.' There is a perfectly good reason for people to have this reaction: they are morons. Anyone who sees this film and complains about Theron's looks should probably stick to `The Cider House Rules' or `2 Days in the Valley' or something, because to come away from a performance of this magnitude and complain that Theron isn't hot is like getting a free tour of heaven and complaining about the altitude. Theron's transformation into serial killer Aileen Wuornos is so complete and perfect that it will be impossible to discuss the all-time greatest acting jobs in the future without mentioning this one. She's that good.<br/><br/>The film is based on the true story of Aileen Wuornos, a lifelong hooker who killed seven of her patrons in the late 1980's. Like any good story, `Monster' lives in its details. In less caring hands, this movie would have been nothing more than an exploitative shocker. The pieces are there: a lesbian relationship, a hooker, serial killings. But the actors and filmmakers have made a truthful film about real people, and that is what most viewers will come away with. `Basic Instinct' was another movie about a lesbian murderer, and that film took a lot of hits for presenting lesbians as evil, manipulative killers. This film will not have that same kind of backlash because it is not a film about lesbians as killers; it is a film about a woman who is driven to kill, and happens to be a lesbian.<br/><br/>While Theron has gotten all of the press, Ricci is also very impressive as Wuornos' young lover. While I am not surprised to see Ricci in this kind of a movie-she has always been an actress who takes chances-I was surprised to see her performance. She is not her usual sardonic, cynical self; her Selby is more innocent and naÃ¯ve than the character she played in `Casper.'<br/><br/>`Monster' is a frightening movie, but it is also filled with intensely dark moments of comedy as Wuornos struggles to relate to people like a normal human. She is so inept in social conventions that when a man tells her to `call him daddy,' she asks him if it's because he likes to sleep with children. Wuornos is not like any serial killer I've seen before; aside from killing them, she did not horribly violate or mutilate her victims like Bundy or Dahmer, and she was not an intellectual like Hannibal Lecter. Perhaps more interesting and more telling than the fact that she was the first female serial killer is that she was the first serial killer to simply use a gun.<br/><br/>`Monster' does not excuse the actions of Wuornos, nor does it present her as some kind of super-villain. It simply presents her story honestly and unflinchingly. Theron took a chance by bulking up for this role, and it paid off. This is a terrifically powerful movie."

Yet somehow the ridiculous yahoos that run Hollywood decided her life was worth sharing, even immortalizing...What a waste of my time...Yet having said all that, if stories that disturb you are of interest, this is a compelling watch.

She a nasty sociopath who by day seemed to be a charming law abiding citizen but by night was a monster prostitute and killer. She approached her clients by hitchhiking rides from them. Then once she had them in an isolated place, she had sex with them and killed them. I have no sympathy for her in terms of these killings, she was not incompetent or insane, she knew it was all wrong. Like the prosecutor said about her, ""She's not a robber who kills, She's a killer who robs"". There are plenty of people who have had tough lives who do not later go out and become psychopath killers, instead they go out and they become productive members of society.

Let me tell you, I was absolutely blown away. Weight gain and makeup aside, Theron's performance was hands down absolutely brilliant. She had the mannerisms of Wuornos down perfectly, and found the emotional depth that this character needed. From the second that Theron is on screen, the electricity of her character breaks through, transcending any boundary. The first half of the film is not as powerful as the rest, but the second half was absolutely on fire. WARNING, SPOILER! The scene towards the end when she is sitting outside the bus station with Ricci, words cannot begin to describe it. She broke down, and that is acting. She wasn't screaming, she was honestly crying, and that was the most incredible acting I have possibly ever seen. One Oscar could not be enough for this performance that Charlize Theron gave. Having seen documentaries on Wuornos as well, Theron had her down perfectly, which is in a way horrifying. Bravo to Theron on this unbelievably incredible performance that will go down in history as one of the best ever performed on screen."

All I saw in her performance were her eyes widely open, and her chin always tense. I can't tell I was persuaded. And I don't think everything that actor has to do to make it is a changing-person make-up, and repeating the person's mimics and movements. Maybe she is good.

","It takes more than acting talent for a rich Hollywood actress to truly emulate the down-and-out, the homeless, prostitution, the so-called dregs of society... it takes true genius.  Charlize Theron is clearly no genius.  No amount of makeup, ""trash talk"" or other pretense can communicate the pervasive sense of despair, the drug abuse, the mental illness, the real attitudes and situations that poverty tends to bestow upon a person... having had occasion to be temporarily homeless a few times, maybe I'm a better judge of this than most.  From the beginning this film had ""Hollywood pretense"" written all over it, and I admit that I couldn't sit through any more after the first rape scene.  The film kept pegging my ""BS meter,"" although it may appeal to the more privileged (Roger Ebert?) who really have no clue what it's like to live this sort of a lifestyle.

","Perhaps I am in the distinct minority when I say that this movie fell flat on its face, due to Ricci's flat-footed ""interpretation"" of her role (if you can call her complete lack of nuance an interpretation at all).  Ricci seems incapable of grasping the concept of the lipstick lesbian, much less the purely vulnerable, unreasoning drive for protection, acceptance, and safe haven.  There is one desperate scene of ""untamed passion"" in which Theron drastically overacts, apparently in a desperate attempt to get some sort of reaction from Ricci.  Instead Ricci just giggles uncomfortably and peeps ""I thought you weren't into women"".<br/><br/>Who could believe any straight woman would be attracted to the leaden Ricci, much less attempt major life changes to assume a role as her protector? Although Theron's performance is a valiant effort given the extreme limitations she has to deal with, it ultimately fails.

","Here we have the Oscar-winning ""Monster"", an American biopic movie from 2003 that will have its 15th anniversary next year. These 105 minutes are the most known work by writer and director Patty Jenkins, which may change when her new Wonder Woman movie will finally come out. And it is also the career-defining performance by South African actress Charlize Theron. In here, she plays Aileen Wuornos a prostitute and serial killer who had her very own way of dealing with clients. And while I am sure that a lot was added in this film for drama purposes, I am perfectly fine with it as it makes the entire film more interesting. I am honestly personally not too sure if Wuornos' life or character justify a biopic, but the way things looked here, it is okay. Was she really driven by inner demons/forces to kill these men the way it is depicted during the last killing scene? Was she really that upset by authority and rejection as we see during her job interview? Did she really hate men as much as it was depicted in here? I don't know. Only she knows (""knew"" I should say) I guess. But regardless of what the true answers to these questions may be, it all works pretty well in this movie.<br/><br/>As for Theron, she dominated the awards season with her portrayal here and a lot of this may have to do with how she went for ugliness. Theron known as one of the most stunning women/actresses on the planet looks homely here from start to finish. So the make-up sure helped her a lot with her awards ambitions. And what also helped was the fact that Theron's character was depicted as a human being with feelings and emotions despite the horrible acts she committed on these many occasions. That final murder scene I already mentioned and also of course her relationship with Ricci's character shows that very well. Eventually, she is the one who may have been cured if her girlfriend loved her as much as she loved her too, but this was not the case. Anyway, all in all, I personally found nothing really too memorable here apart from Theron's performance and I guess many thought the same as the film received not too much recognition at awards ceremonies beyond that, for example no Best Picture or writing nominations at the Oscars. With Theron, a nomination may have been enough, but I am also okay with the win I guess, even if I'd never consider it one of the greatest Best Actress winners / female performances. From 2003 for example, it is certainly not on par with Scarlett Johansson in ""Lost in Translation"". That's why seeing ""Monster"" once is enough. But seeing it once is also very much recommended. Thumbs up. Final note: Bruce Dern is a much better actor than what he was allowed to show us here. Extremely underused."

The story of Aileen Wuornos here is told here as more than just a serial killer film, it is instead a powerful film told with harrowing chills and tender humanity with Wuornos herself portrayed as more than just a monster without being glorified or over-humanised.<br/><br/>An earth-shattering, career-best performance from Charlize Theron as Wuornos helps enormously, a performance that goes way beyond changing her appearance completely by gaining weight and using dental prosthetics to the point of being unrecognisable and is one of gentle compassion and frightening coldness. This may sound oxymoronic, but it isn't, it means that what could easily have been a one-dimensional portrait of Wuornos is given surprising complexity by Theron.<br/><br/>She is superbly supported by an understated Christina Ricci, though one wishes that her character had a little more development and was more vividly drawn. The supporting cast all round are strong, if not burning in the memory as much or as long as Theron. 'Monster' is directed beautifully by Patty Jenkins, and the production values are similarly terrific especially in the gritty and classy cinematography that perfectly captures the dark subject matter. The music is used sparely but when used is very evocative of the period.<br/><br/>Further advantages are an intelligent and beautifully-constructed screenplay, that balances Wuornos' character with aplomb and the different mood components with equal adeptness, and a continually gripping story that is frightfully rich in atmosphere and mood.<br/><br/>Overall, truly excellent film especially for Theron, that avoids all the potential pitfalls it could easily have done in other hands. 9/10 Bethany Cox"

They will both make many more talented projects; but none will ever reach the height of this film."

","Every now and again an actor doesn't simply act their part , they become that person.

The day she won that oscar I literally jumped for joy."

","I won't spoil the movie for you all. All I can say is that seeing Charlize Theron play this part must be the most breath-taking moments a person can have whilst watching a movie. She isn't just playing the part, she IS the part.<br/><br/>All the characters introduced into the movie were interesting, but, honestly, Charlize steals the lime light in a way I have rarely seen before. She definitely deserved the Oscar. If in doubt and you watch this movie for the sole reason of finding out whether she deserved it or not, please... Watch It.<br/><br/>The storyline and plot is perfectly paced to ensure you are neither bored or too overwhelmed. Over all, a fantastic movie with a lot of meaning."

","This movie affected me on so many levels. It was so brilliantly done. The performances were intense and so believable I found myself crying in parts. What is a sign of brilliant acting is the fact that Charlize Theron succeeded in making us sympathize with her character despite the fact her character was a cold blooded killer. In fact in the attempted rape scene where she retaliates and murders the man I was silently cheering. To say Charlize Theron deserved that Academy Award is an understatement her performance is so flawlessly brilliant that she's barely recognizable as the blonde beauty she is in real life. This movie is frighteningly brutal in it's honesty. I cannot recommend it enough!"

"powermandan","10","1","1","10 October 2016"," The Best Performance of the Decade and One of the Best of All Time!
","I was not even ten when this movie came out. But seeing promotional material was quite disturbing and I had a hunch that if I were to see that I wouldn't be able to handle it. My parents didn't even allow me either. Fast-forward years later to a time where I am an adult and nothing phases me, I decided to watch Monster because I never forgot the acclaim it received. I shouldn't say that nothing phases me, sometimes movies do depress me, but Monster is one of the few films that really packs a punch. Charlize Theron is the best in this, but I was also surprised at how much more the movie had to offer other than her embodiment.<br/><br/>The only flaws I would like to point out are the lack of facts given to the backstory of infamous serial killer and protagonist of the film, Aileen Wuornos. Not much is said about her early criminal activity and violent behaviour prior to the movie's timeline, including a failed marriage that she had when she was 20. The movie treats Aileen as if the murder of her first john was when her reign of terror began. Well, that's Hollywood for you! Luckily the changes made aren't that bad and don't effect the overall experience much.<br/><br/>Aileen Wuoronos was a woman from an abusive family who had a long criminal record, a very early pregnancy and severe abuse and mistreatment from everyone around her. She never experienced any love, and that takes a toll on her mental health and perception of the world around her. Charlize Theron transforms herself into Aileen in ways that must seem painful and plays her to a t. Her wide-eyes, trembling, and deep stares, and overwhelming emotion really make this such a hard character to play. But Theron does it and does it right. Wuornos moves to a town in Florida where she stumbles into a gay bar and meets unhappy lesbian, Selby. Christina Ricci always captivates the audience with her performances, with her role as Selby being added to the list. Although not as good as Theron, Ricci is still great. Apparently, Selby was not the real person involved with Aileen because of permission purposes. I don't think much difference would have been made if they used the real girl involved with Aileen.<br/><br/>Aileen and Selby are the only good people that each other has known for quite some time. Selby is living with family friends who are not supportive of her sexuality. And I already stressed Aileen's loss of hope. Although Aileen is not a lesbian, it is the emotional comfort that she finds in Selby that leads to anything sexual.<br/><br/>The first john that Aileen kills is the most disturbing part of the film. She is beaten, raped, and is about to be raped hard to certain death before she is able to make an escape and kill him in self- defence. She then quits prostitution and hunts for real jobs to support her and Selby. Her lack of qualifications, criminal record, and unprofessionalism cause her to fail the interviews and she returns to prostitution. She goes on to kill more johns and steal their money, some of the johns of whom aren't even violent. But she is reminded of before and is determined to provide. Complications with the johns arise and loyalty with Selby becomes tested, which leads Aileen's to life in behind bars before being executed in 2002.<br/><br/>I have seen Youtube videos of the real Aileen and it is more than evident that she was mentally ill. Instead of jail, she should have been in an insane asylum. She is scary in some videos, but it's not her fault. She is the perfect example of somebody suffering from the Battered Woman Syndrome. And, I can't express enough just how amazing and convincing Charlize Theron is. But aside from her, everybody is mighty fine. And the writing was great too. It wasn't a picture full of just crying and yelling and rape. There's actual layers, and juice...themes. Some of these are primary components that lots of these depressing factual films lack.<br/><br/>Monster is an amazing and compelling movie about acceptance and love. It may be a sad watch, but it is definitely worth it.<br/><br/>4/4"

Perhaps I thought it's yet another chick flick or something that I didn't want to be bothered with. Recently however I bumped into it again, and I must admit that I regret not having watched it before. I always liked Charlize Theron as an actress, but this movie proves many new things about her capabilities. Being all beautiful and awesome, she has always been casted to play the sexy or the bad-ass yet still sexy gal. But here, with all the make up and turns, this is just pure acting, and she somehow manages to do it to perfection.

"saeedchoganbaz","8","1","1","3 July 2014"," based on a true story
","A beautiful woman turning herself physically ugly in pursuit of the almighty Oscar is nothing new. When Charlize Theron won the coveted golden statue for her portrayal of Aileen Wuornos, ""America's first female serial killer"", most everyone agreed that it was richly deserved. Indeed, she earned her Oscar for much more than an outer change. Her mannerisms, her voice, her wild-eyed look are all Aileen, all the time. In the beginning credits of Monster, we are given a brief overview of the early life of Aileen. It's a quick montage, and one that's better served if you already have some knowledge of the subject. She had a hard and cruel childhood beset with physical and sexual abuse, was plagued by drugs and brotherly incest, and finally become a prostitute -- and pregnant -- by the age of 13. Aileen eventually left cold and snowy Michigan for the sunny shores of Florida where she became a highway hooker, servicing anyone who'd give her a few dollars. Monster focuses on the 9-month period in 1989 and 1990 during which she had a lesbian relationship with a needy, immature woman named Selby Wall (Christina Ricci, playing a renamed - and by far more beautiful - Tyria Moore) and during which she also began murdering her clientele. In real life, Aileen flip-flopped on whether or not these killings were in self- defense - the movie compromises, showing the first one as self-defense and the rest as murders for money. Although the story of any cold-blooded murderer, and a serial killer in particular, certainly qualifies as ""horror"", Monster focuses on Aileen as a person and what might have driven her to turn her rage outward. The killings are brutal, but not dwelt on or glorified in any way. While I feel that Monster may have been too soft on Aileen's crimes and stumbles here and there on the narrative trail, there's no denying that writer- director Patty Jenkins had a distinct, singular vision and she followed it through from beginning to end. While Theron's stunning transformation and performance sucked up all the accolades, Ricci is also quite wonderful. Her performance is subtle and she's saddled with playing an unlikable character but it's an admirable effort that flies just under the radar. Bruce Dern has a very small but memorable role as an alcoholic war vet, and the superb Pruitt Taylor Vince has a short stint as one of Aileen's johns. Monster shows how a series of betrayals can damage and eventually break an already fragile psyche. Everyone from Aileen's mother (who abandoned her as a baby) to Selby (who ultimately turned her in to the law) betrayed her. One of the final scenes, which depicts the phone call during which Selby entrapped Aileen into confessing, is extremely powerful. Aileen took the fall for everything and absolved Selby -- who was certainly an accomplice toward the end -- of any wrongdoing. Even though it may look like a Hollywood ending, in fact Aileen did take the blame for everything and even went so far as to send Tyria money while she was on death row. In this aspect, Monster offers a rare glimpse into her life as a regular human being; monster or not, she too longed to love and be loved. Monster is often slow and rambling, but it's still essential viewing for anyone who is interested in another dimension of this repellant and fascinating character. And it's definitely worth seeing for Theron, who deserved her Oscar for so much more than just her physical abandon. The DVD extras offer US and International trailers, a Making of featurette (which shows the makeup transformation), two featurettes on the music lauding the composer, BT. Monster is being released in tandem with the 2003 documentary, Alieen: Life & Death of a Serial Killer. Excellent idea, as both films are not only worth watching, they're worth watching together."
"Richard_Alex_Jenkins","9","1","1","1 November 2013"," Intense Acting Performance
","I enjoyed this film for pretty much one main reason; the amazing acting and role-submersion of Charlize Theron. She shocked me at times with her boisterous, bullish and downright unfeminine behaviour, but to say I enjoyed the film as a whole and got anything really positive from it would be going too far.<br/><br/>The acting by the rest of the cast, including Christina Ricci, was pretty average in places, maybe because the lead role was so well done. I've no idea how Theron managed to completely adapt to this role and become such an unhinged person, but she did. It still doesn't make for a very fun viewing experience though, watching a person going completely off the rails but convincing themselves and their partner that she's doing nothing wrong and is a still a good person, is pretty weird.<br/><br/>My enjoyment of the film was also dampened because I read into the life of Aileen Wuornos before watching it. It's based on real life facts so I didn't see any harm in doing some research, but it made it feel a little A-Z.<br/><br/>The director emphasised that Wuornos was indeed raped before murdering the first guy, using an additional outburst at the end of the film to underline this fact, iterating a certain sympathy and understanding, although not justification, for the actions of Wuornos - a person abused and despised with a very serious anger problem, unable to distinguish between small disagreements and really, really serious goings on.<br/><br/>I thought the final killing of the man at the end, pleading to be spared to go home to his wife and kids, and the utter inner disgrace and disgust felt by Wuornos at just killing him anyway was really effective. But that was largely down to Theron's acting performance I feel. I knew what was going to happen too, so it wasn't an absolutely amazing film, and maybe I was looking for something else, something more abstract or sinister to get my teeth into, which I didn't fully find.<br/><br/>Sometimes films bring you down, like this one did, eliciting negative or half-arsed reviews, but on reflection turn out to be real wonders if you can get through the sad, relentless depravity.<br/><br/>I'm re-appraising my review and giving the film an upgraded 8-star based on how unbelievably well played Wuornos was by Charlize Theron."
"lastliberal","8","1","1","17 March 2007"," Charlize is the real thing!
","I was entranced by Charlize Theron's impersonation of Aileen Wuornos in this film. She carried home an entire shelf full of awards for her performance and she earned every single one of them. The prosthetic makeup that transformed the gorgeous actress into a bedraggled, weather-beaten street person was uncannily good at recreating Wuornos's crooked teeth; and the vocal similarity between the fictional and the actual Aileens was striking.<br/><br/>Christina Ricci played an equally impressive part as the rejected lesbian, whom Wuornos latched onto after being abused and rejected by so many others. But this film was all Carlize and she dominated it. She was so convincing that she virtually disappeared and I saw Wuornos back from the dead on the screen. Eiree."
"view_and_review","7","1","1","15 March 2007"," Criminals are people too
","A fairly attractive Charlize Theron plays a grossly unattractive Aileen Wuornos, a prostitute that murdered some of her johns. When the movie was being previewed and talked about before it hit theaters I saw Charlize Theron on a talk show promoting the movie. At that time I had no idea who Charlize Theron was. The talk show showed a picture of Theron in the movie compared to her normal look. All I could say was: Wow!!! The transformation was astonishing. I don't know how much make up they had to put on her (or take off of her) to get her to look the way she did, but to complete the amazement, she also gained weight for the film.<br/><br/>I watched the movie on T.V. and Theron not only went through great lengths to look the part, but she did a helluva job acting the part too. To transform from a dainty, attractive Hollywood icon to an overweight, foul mouth, masculine prostitute, was just awesome. On top of that, the movie was good. Criminals are people too. Aileen's story was not particularly unique, but her character coupled with her lifestyle was compelling. I am interested in the minds and lives of criminals. I'd never want to be a criminal myself, and I don't even condone of criminal behavior, but like the scientist or the psychologist, I like to know what makes them the way they are.<br/><br/>Aileen, was an interesting case and an interesting person. She was a homeless wandering soul, looking for money, looking for love, looking for a suitable life. She found a person of interest in Selby (Christina Ricci) and they shared a life together briefly before Aileen's criminal actions caught up with her. They were almost reminiscent of Thelma & Louise in that they were on the road & somewhat on the run, and all they had and all they could trust was each other. Aileen's story, and in fact Aileen herself, was compelling."

","I finally watched the movie tonight on DVD. I have avoided it for years as I actually met Aileen Wournos. I met her in a Burger King in Wildwood, Fl. on my way to Miami. The next morning in the hotel I received a newspaper with the composite sketch. I was blown away and naturally I called police right away. It took on a life of its own while she was being searched for and I was on the witness list but never called. Fortunately she was captured around Jan. 10th or so.<br/><br/>I have to say I understand why Theron won the Oscar. It was almost like seeing Aileen again. Theron had the chilling features and expressions on her face, the only thing she didn't have was Wournos's eyes. I have never been stared through to the bone before as she looked at me. My stomach still hurts for watching the movie but it is the only time in my life that I was ever withing 2 feet of a serial killer.So, seeing the actions of this ""monster"" in the movie was cathartic to me."
"Doylenf","7","1","1","6 January 2007"," Real-life story of a prostitute turned serial killer is realistic and chilling...
","CHARLIZE THERON has to be quite an actress. The only other film I recall seeing her in was GIRL WITH THE PEARL EARRING in which she was quietly subdued, demure, and looked like a charming young woman who stepped out of a masterful painting--a work of art.<br/><br/>Here she is as Aileen Wuornos, the serial killer who spent twelve years on Florida's death row convicted of three murders and guilty of how many others, I don't know. I was afraid the film version of her life would show sympathy for the devil, but not so. While it does give you an idea of the hard knocks dealt her from childhood onward, it doesn't justify any of her crimes because of her bitter childhood.<br/><br/>Theron completely captures Wuornos, her haggard appearance, her demeanor (mouth twisted in disgust, the darting eyes, the outbursts of raging temper tantrums), and makes the character so completely believable that it's like watching Wuornos, who was viewed after her capture by TV cameras and interviews.<br/><br/>Christina RICCI is less impressive as the naive and immature girlfriend, dependent on someone to buy her things so she could ""hang out"" and enjoy life. She comes across as a more limited actress who managed to play a couple of her scenes competently, no more, no less, despite excellent direction from Patty Jenkins.<br/><br/>Had a hard time recognizing BRUCE DERN, who looked so much visibly older than I pictured him, that I thought he must be wearing age make-up--I guess I just haven't seen Dern in a film in a long time! <br/><br/>A tough film to watch because it doesn't flinch from telling a pretty sordid story that made headlines when Aileen was finally captured and went on trial for her crimes. <br/><br/>CHARLIZE THERON definitely deserved her Oscar for playing a very unsympathetic, mentally deranged character and making us feel her pain, as well as the victim's. Especially chilling are scenes involving the last two Johns, neither of whom did anything remotely deserving of the penalty she inflicted on them."

In reality, there are people like her, and those who watch this movie are unlikely to have them as friends. This movie is good because it's so realistic partly due to Charlize Theron's incredible performance. Charilize Theron is very beautiful in real life but very ugly in the movie. This huge contrast is so ironic, reflecting the contradictory society where low people are the victims of ordinary people, who could be teachers, doctors, lawyers or cops.

I would have to say that this one of the top five best performances ever given by an actress, or actor for that matter.<br/><br/>Based on actual events, the story is set in Daytona Beach, FL, in the early 1990's. A poor-white female in her mid-thirties, ends up at a gay bar by mistake one night, just in hopes to have a drink. She meets Selby (Ricci), who offers to buy her a beer. Several hours later, the two become friendly, and Selby offers to have Lee (Theron), stay the night with her, since she has no home. The prostitute with no real job, money or place to stay accepts. The next evening they meet again, and begin their romantic relationship.<br/><br/>Through a series of events, Lee, the prostitute turned lesbian, turns to murder and thievery, to keep herself alive, and her relationship with Selby as well.<br/><br/>It is one of the best films to ever come out, not just in 2004. It will make you cry, and feel emotion for the loss, sacrifice, and hardships that the characters go through. It is an emotional ride through the eyes of a mentally tormented woman, and how she deals with the situations she is given in life.<br/><br/>Charlize Theron, again was brilliant in this, and Christina Ricci was also profoundly well casted and her poignant moments in the piece as well.<br/><br/>Definitely not a film for anyone under eighteen, but I would recommend it to anyone over that age.

","Last year, I heard we had a South African actress who won an Oscar for doing a good job staring as Aileen Wuornos. And she deserved the Oscar! Here's my review...<br/><br/>A film, which was based on a true story which happened in the early 1990s. A tramp , named Alieen Wuornos (Charlize Theron) was out looking for a guy and later bumps into a girl named Selby Wall (Christina Ricci) at a night club. When Aileen met Selby, she was so uptight about Selby buying her a beer and then touching her. And soon, Aileen had no problem with it and she stayed with Selby for the night.<br/><br/>Now, Selby was a girl who was sent to go live with her aunt to cure her homosexuality when she tried to kiss a girl in church whereas Aileen was a prostitute. On the following day, Aileen and Selby hit the skating floor and they fell in love without her Aunt's son Trevor (Chad Vaccarino), wasn't looking. Aileen decided to fall in love with Selby because, she was the only person who cared about her.And later, tucked away in the woods. Aileen and this low life taxi driver got drunk. And at that very moment, the taxi driver attacked Aileen due to her not wanting to make love to him. Aileen was knocked out, she then woke up and she discovered her hands were tied up. And when the taxi driver tried to attack Aileen, she broke loose, she the guy and she beat ed him to death! SHE WENT CRAZY!!!!! Then she put on his clothes and she took off with his car.<br/><br/>Aileen had to be herself in order to support her's and Selby's relationship. They move in together into a motel. And later, Aileen dumped the taxi driver's body in his car in the middle of nowhere. OH! There was such a funny part when Aileen when to go and apply for a job in order to be a secretary, she got so angry when she didn't get the job. And she swore at everyone! I soon realized that Selby sounded just like my friend Tammy Philpott. That girl, will one day also become as famous as Charlize Theron! Anyways, in another quiet place somewhere, some guy payed Aileen to give him pleasure. She then shot him and she took off with his car. Selby was soon going to discover that Aileen isn't borrowing these cars, she was STEALING them!<br/><br/>HA! NO ONE messes with Aileen and Selby!- They were told by a manger of a restaurant (Glenn.R. Wilder) and they rebelled and Aileen knocked the manager down followed by a table.And later that night, Aileen killed another man! And soon she killed another man when she said she didn't need a lift because she was going to take his car. And then, Aileen returned home and told Selby to get packed. Aileen lied again about what she did. Uh-oh!<br/><br/>The cops began to track Aileen and Selby down from all the places they passed and all the people they bumped into. And soon, Aileen sent Selby home by bus in order to protect her. Once again, Aileen was on the street. That evening, Aileen walked into a bar and she said she needed to use the telephone. She was taken outside and she got arrested. And she quickly began to change.WOW!!!<br/><br/>The next day, Aileen and Selby saw each other again in court. And that was the last time they saw each other. It bought tears to my eyes. As we know, Aileen was executed on the 9th of October, 2002 after 12 years on Florida's Death Row.<br/><br/>This film was VERY touching!"
"PWNYCNY","8","1","1","10 October 2005"," Excellent acting.
","First, let me make it perfectly clear - I found this movie to be well acted and fascinating. I certainly recommend it as a interesting dramatization of the the life of a very disturbed person. Yet, let us not forget for a moment that the woman in question was a serial killer who was not only a victim but a victimizer as well, who committed vicious acts of violence that went way beyond any rational explanation for what she did or why. Ms. Charlize Theron's performance was incredibly powerful and poignant, as she portrays a woman whose unrequited quest for love and never-ending rejection of her by society is transformed into an all-consuming and uncontrollable rage. Normally, such a character would not evoke feelings of sympathy, but Ms. Theron manages to do so. It's a remarkable piece of acting.

","As advertised (and Academy-awarded) this movie contains a brilliant, startling and sensational performance by Charlize Theron as the true-life prostitute/serial killer Aileen Wuornos. Theron is over the top yet at the same time so totally controlled that her character is beautifully--if horrifically--realized. Opening as a much-abused street hooker who is treated like trash by almost everybody, Theron morphs ""Lee"" into a swaggering, macho murderess in a manner sure to chill many viewers straight to the bone. Yet all the while Theron conveys the vulnerability of a tragically twisted person who was never loved, only beaten, raped and tossed aside. The sordidness of her life and the hopelessness of her future are indelibly etched upon our memory.<br/><br/>Much of the credit for this once in a lifetime performance must go to director Patty Jenkins who also wrote the script, which is itself quite a sensation. Jenkins books no compromise with propriety or with the audience's sensitivities. She rubs our face in Aileen's dehumanized life as a street hooker picked up by strangers who treat her like filth and abuse her in ways that are unspeakable. Central to the irony of the film is the fact that her life is that of a likely serial killer victim herself, since women who ply their trade in such a way are most vulnerable to sadistic attacks. But ""Lee,"" inspired by her passionate and first-in-a-lifetime love for Selby, her mousy lesbian girl friend, played with sly and sneaky sparkle by Christina Ricci, turns the tables on the sickies who pick her up and finds a measure of short-lived empowerment by blowing the johns away with a large revolver.<br/><br/>Jenkins uses quick and deft strokes to establish who and what Aileen is, and just as deftly establishes Selby as the church-going wallflower at the local same-sex bar. Jenkins's technique thrusts the viewer headlong into the story as Aileen drags herself out of the rain and into the bar to meet Selby who immediately latches onto her. Quickly they become friends, and then in a compelling and entirely convincing scene, fall in love while roller skating. This is followed by a steamy alley engagement in which both ""Lee"" and Selby discover their wild passion for one another. Both scenes are among the best of their type that I have ever seen.<br/><br/>Although Theron got the major share of the glory for the success of this movie, and Jenkins most of the credit, Ricci was not far behind. Her character too is etched in my mind. How wonderfully cast were the two, the one physical and manlike, the other weak, naive and femme. And how lifelike the chemistry and how tragic the conjoining.<br/><br/>Yes, this is an American tragedy thurbo'ed up for sensation-seeking audiences, presented with relentless views of violence and sensuality, featuring humanity at its most debased. So over-the-top were some of the scenes that I found myself unaccountably laughing in surprise at the sheer hutzpa of Jenkins's savage treatment.<br/><br/>Be forewarned that this movie leaves little to the imagination, and when it does, it makes sure you know exactly what depravity you are to imagine. As such I would not recommend that anyone with delicate sensibilities view it. It is a study of the character of two women who find first love and first real passion together, but it is so thoroughly laced with violence and depravity that for many that love will become nothing more than ignoble animal lust.<br/><br/>See this for both Charlize Theron and Christina Ricci, two of cinema's most gifted young actresses.<br/><br/>(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""

","Ugly and uncomfortable to watch, ""Monster"" is the first true crime movie since ""Dead Man Walking"" to leave me feeling utterly broken inside. Aileen Wuornos was a sad and pathetic creature whose past made her into what she became and Charlize Theron brings every complex dimension of her completely to life again in this film. It wasn't just the makeup and added pounds that made Theron into Wuornos but her uncannily accurate portrayal of the woman who was lost between the horror of her personal life and the dreams she had to be somebody more than her circumstances dictated. Theron almost seems to be inhabited by the soul of Aileen Wuornos with every word, body movement and tormented and crazed wide-eyed look. Her performance certainly deserved the Best Actress Oscar for this role and possibly of the decade. The music by BT adds another suitably eerie dimension to the film but it is really Theron's performance of the wonderful screenplay that makes this a great film. There's really not any gore to speak of, but the raw and bottom-line truth of Wuornos' life is what makes the story nearly unpalatable. Guaranteed, this movie will sicken, frighten, sadden and make you squirm. If it doesn't, you should check to see if you still have a pulse. Undoubtedly not for the faint of heart but if you do see it be prepared for an unparalleled ride."

","There are no words to describe how mesmerising Patty Jenkins' 'Monster' really is. From the first time I seen it, I was hooked. I love it. I adore it. The story of Aileen Wuornoss is one that I have always been familiar with and the most refreshing thing, I found, was how careful 'Monster' was not to judge Aileen. Instead, it allowed us to see the story that lead up to the killings and the difficult life Aileen had. Although this does not justify what she did - it is a heartbreaking though that she actually killed seven men out of the love she had for another woman. I find it admirable. Charlize Theron gave - in my opinion - the most dazzling, gripping performance in cinematic history. I cannot express enough how outstanding I find this film and all aspects of it. The score is beautiful. BT - who I would've never have guessed would be the kinda guy to do it - had me in tears. ""Don't Stop Believin'"" by Journey is a song that will always remind me of Monster; of the greatest love story I have ever seen. I would like to take this space to thank Patty Jenkins for making such a revelation. It is my fvaourite film and one which I will never tire of watching. It hits me evry time I see Aileen and Selby rollerskating or waiting on the bus for Selby to go back home what a beautiful story this is. I love it. I cannot say that enough. Patty Jenkins you are a pearl among women, of which there are few."

","Actually when you look closely to this movie it is nothing more than an average drama with a standard visual style and all. It are really the performance's that bring this movie to an higher level and make this movie an impressive drama.<br/><br/>Yes, Charlize Theron is excellent! Did she deserved that Oscar? Most definitely! But it also is Christina Ricci who should get lot's of credits for her role as lesbian girl Selby. Both actresses play a role you never expected them to play. Both gained a weight of a significant amount of pounds for their role. I have to admit that before this I never was a real big fan of Christina Ricci but this movie made me look differently at her. It was also great to see Bruce Dern again in a fairly big but quite insignificant role.<br/><br/>The story is told in a good way. It doesn't justify Aileen's murders but it helps you understand better what was driven her to commit these horrible murders. Normally we just read about murders in the papers or see it on the news, all we think is that those who commit these murders are horrible monsters but there is always more behind it than meets the eye and this movie shows that perfectly and emotionally.<br/><br/>Worth seeing if only for Charlize Theron and Christina Ricci.<br/><br/>9/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

","Not being very familiar with the true story behind this film, I'll opt out of judging its veracity in terms of objectively defining Wuornos' character.<br/><br/>However - Charlize Theron has indelibly stamped her mark on the shortlist of actresses who truly morph into each new role. Meryl Streep, for example.<br/><br/>The film, for all its shortcomings, is riveting, mainly by virtue of Theron's portrayal. Christina Ricci and Bruce Dern are notable, as well. The seamy, downscale side of Florida is well represented, as is the unrelenting desperation of its down-and-out underclass. <br/><br/>It's a film worth watching several times. The dialogue is sometimes slightly muddled and hard to follow, simply because Theron is so absorbed in being Wuornos, she doesn't always enunciate well enough to be understood. <br/><br/>I'd like to have seen a bit more fleshing out of her background and the process that led up to her death sentence. The major flaw in the whole premise may have been that it was told entirely from her POV -- which causes some dissonance between the person we see and her ultimate fate, which comes across as quite unfair. As another reviewer said, she couldn't have been just another ""misunderstood bad guy."" None of the above detracts from Theron's work here. Her range is the stuff of legends.<br/><br/>/r"

This in fact was the greatest and most powerful performances ever. People may have been disturbed by some of the scenes in the movie - but it was all the disturbances, violent scenes and foul language that made Aileen's character look outstanding.<br/><br/>Not forgetting the make up- after the movie was done- i had to research about Aileen Wuornos- and for a moment it was difficult to distinguish Charlize from the real Aileen- it was that close.<br/><br/>This would not be the best movie to watch on movie night but it is definitely worth watching altogether- i wish i could congratulate Charlize in person- as after that powerful performance she gave- she has definitely made her mark as a serious actress."

Charlize Theron gave one of the most astounding performances of the year, I knew that she had it in her to give good performances, but I never expected this from her. I think director Patty Jenkins has some good things going for her in the future. There were some troubles with the script, and I think Ms. Jenkins went a little to easy on Aileen. But, this film is a unique experience and a unique piece of work. Charlize Theron's performance is one to be remembered. And, it is a shame so many only look at her ability to grunge down for her role. Well People! She has to do that! SHE IS AN ACTRESS! She wasn't trying to win an Oscar(for all I know) she was doing her job, trying to make us believe she is Aileen. She gives an amazing performance you have to see, even the skeptics! I used to be one, but this was a fantastic performance! It will surely be remembered."

","The main reason I rented MONSTER on DVD is to see for myself why Charlize Theron won the academy award for Best Actress this year (2004). Her being almost a pin up girl (much like Halle Berry), I was really intrigued by what I was gonna get. Well, MONSTER is a truly brilliant picture and it was Charlize Theron's show all the way. Not only did she looked very much like the actual character she was portraying (a round of applause to the make up team)but she literally submerged into the role. It was only at the end of the movie that I suddenly remembered reading something about the real Lee (the killer's real life name)in some magazine a couple of years ago. Christina Ricci was also superb as well as Bruce Dern's brief part. It must've been hard for a woman as beautiful as Charlize to make such a radical role in which her beauty was not required. It goes on to show that this lady will always be Oscar material. As for the movie itself, it is nicely paced, with enough drama to keep things interesting, but if you're looking for the typical hollywood fare, then forget it. This is more like ""indie"" stuff. For those who think this movie tries to explain why Lee Wuorons was the way she was, or that it tries to show some sympathy, they are missing the point. Everytime someone sets foot in deathrow, we only know part of the story, so in a way, MONSTER trys to give that perspective and succeeds at that. It's a raw movie and it's not for everyone. 9* out of 10!"

Unfortunately others here had problems to keep up with her brilliance, most noticeably her movie girlfriend, played by charismatic Christina Ricci.<br/><br/>I was also impressed that a movie about a 'Monster' showed not a monster, but instead a very living and understandable human being, tortured by her really horrible life before finally making some really stupid decisions.

"cz-11","Null","1","1","6 July 2004"," Greatest Performance Ever? Absolutely!
","Charlize Theron's performance as serial killer Aileen Wuornos is the greatest acting job in the history of film. Even though every aspect of Monster is deeply moving, powerful, and touching, Charlize Theron is the most important piece of the film to discuss. She brilliantly plays the damaged and lost Aileen who strikes back at a society who never gave her a chance to live happily and successfully. Roger Ebert said in his review on the Ebert and Roeper television show that Charlize embodies Aileen Wuornos, but I will add that her performance is so outstanding and remarkable it's as if the film makers brought Wuornos from the dead and had her play herself. Charlize is not in the film being an actress named Charlize Theron, but she has literally become Aileen Wuornos. Theron is great because she knew and understood this tragic woman completely. It will be difficult to watch other films without comparing the performances of others to Charlize Theron's in Monster because she has accomplished what nobody else has in acting; both in movie history and current film. Acting students will be studying this performance for many years and they will learn much from it.<br/><br/>Monster is disturbing and upsetting, but Charlize Theron's part as Aileen Wuornos must be seen. She's truly fantastic."
"dsweetla","10","1","1","28 April 2004"," A near miracle
","Theron and Ricci give performances in this film that defy what anyone can reasonably expect from actors.  They are so credible, so vulnerable and so utterly convincing, they become more than just believable; they become real. After watching this film twice, their realism is disturbingly intimate. I honestly feel  a sense of 'knowing' these people.  Wuornos and Selby feel, in my gut, like people I actually spent time with.  Acting rarely has the power to occupy a part of our memory; here, it possesses the power of an actual experience, an actual acquaintance. Theron rightly won an Academy awrd for this role, and should receive recognition as one of the best, riskiest actors working in mainstream film today.  Ricci's role was less of a physical transformation, but no less compelling.  She deserves an equal share of recognition for the greatness of this picture.<br/><br/>Patty Jenkins direction is perfect, from the use of sound and (period) music, to her masterful choices editing.  Film violence is so common as to be dull, yet Jenkins crafted a genuine sense of horror around the inevitable killings.  Cutting away from them to emotional aftermath scenes made the weight of the crime almost unbearable.  You don't necessarily 'side with' Wuornos, but you empathize with her panicked fear, her demand from the universe that the violence be forgotten as much to have peace in her life as to evade human justice.<br/><br/>Reading a little about the Wuornos case after the film, I am a bit disappointed at the dramatic license taken in the script.  Time is compressed into what appears to be a few panicky weeks of killing; in fact, Wuornos killed more men over a longer time period than shown here.  This makes the film's version easier to choke down.  The film Wuornos seems more surrounded by fate.  In reality, Wuornos had much more breathing room between her crimes, and less of a linear pressure to come up with cash. Also, Selby (who is based on a real life woman named Tyria Moore) is far more vulnerable and empathetic than Wuornos' real girlfriend.  Moore, for example, called Wuornos numerous times in prison to manipulate her into confessing her crimes over a bugged phone.  Moore also was not the gentle, church-raised young lesbian Selby was; she had had numerous other female relationships, and a minor criminal record prior to meeting Wuornos. Their love may have been as intense and genuine as shown in the film, but their lives were so distinct a contrast of innocence and experience.<br/><br/>Departing from fact doesn't detract from the film's power or value.  It does, however, temper what I took away from it.  The film's trapped, desparate and tragically lonely women elicit a good deal of sympathy.  As such, the reality of Wuornos' execution in 2002 seems indicted by its sense of justice.  Regardless of your opinions on the death penalty (and I am against it), however, the facts of this film differ from those which sent Wuornos to death row.  As such, the raw emotions brought about by this excellent film should be tempered with that perspective.<br/><br/>On the whole, MONSTER is a nearly flawless film.  As depressing as its subject may be, the emotional intensity is very rewarding experience.  It should become the classic it deserves to be."
"rwint","Null","1","1","18 April 2004"," A Good Approach That Just Doesn't Go Far Enough
","5 out of 10<br/><br/>True story of Aileen Wournos.  A prostitute who killed over seven men in and around the Florida area during the 1980's.<br/><br/>The most interesting aspect of this film is the fact that it merges the morality.  Nothing is black and white and the Wournas character is portrayed in a sensitive light.  In a lot of ways you really grow to have a compassion for her and a feeling for a her rough existence.  In fact during the first incident where she kills a man you are actually rooting for her to do it as he has tied her up and torturing her.  Wournas is really a victim and is no way the 'monster' that the title infers.  This is one of those 'stories behind the headlines'  that allows you to see it from a different perspective and have a better understanding about what happened and why.<br/><br/>
This also allows for a good commentary on society where the film seems to place the brunt of the blame.  We see her trying to go clean and yet when no one will hire her she is forced to go back to her old ways and then punished for simply doing the desperate acts of a desperate person with few if any options.  The real monster here seems to be our socio-economic structure and certain puritanical people who underneath are really quite ugly and just as scary.<br/><br/>The atmosphere is gritty and authentic and never let's up.  There is also a nice running commentary by the Wournas character, which allows for further insight into how she rationalizes what she does.  Some of her observations are right on target.<br/><br/>The film's biggest flaw is that it  puts too much emphasis on her relationship with lesbian lover Selby (Ricci).  It's a rather offbeat relationship for sure and there are some telling moments about it, but it's only one element.  Some of the scenes between the two go on too long and become boring.<br/><br/>The film also completely skip Wournas's childhood, which seems like an almost fundamental stage to examine.  The scenes involving the killings of the male customers are pretty benign.  Only the one involving Wilson, who was simply a kindly old man at the wrong place at the wrong time, has any emotional impact.<br/><br/>Theron certainly plays the part without fault and was an obvious choice for the Oscar yet some of the credit really needs to go to the make up department.  Ricci is usually pretty good, but some of her responses here seem affected.  Still she has a real nice innocent girl look here that ends up exposing a dark side you just don't see at the start.<br/><br/>Overall the film doesn't seem too have as much impact as it  should. The approach is a little too biased and they seem almost intent at making Wournas into some sort of martyr.  Despite an earnest effort it still seems like just an overview."

","Charlize Theron's performance is better than the movie itself, and the movie is very good. She plays prostitute Aileen Wuornos who killed seven men in the 1980's. Here is a movie that does not try to justify or condemn the things she did, it just shows us how events happened and in the end we are able to understand most things a little better.<br/><br/>This approach makes the movie probably better than if it had taken sides. We see and hear how Aileen's life must have been terrible from a very young age. She was abused and abandoned by people close to her. She has been a prostitute since she was thirteen and now she is through with it, but she meets lesbian Selby (Christina Ricci). Whether Aileen is gay or not does not matter, Selby is the first person in a long time who really cares about her and Aileen feels kind of happy for the first time in her life. But then a client beats and rapes her and she snaps and ends up killing him and after this other clients.<br/><br/>The movie could turn into a thriller or a real crime movie, but since it has its focus on Aileen and Selby it turns out to be a dramatic movie, with some really disturbing moments. Although Aileen does things we can not approve of you feel sorry for her almost the entire time. It is Theron's performance that makes sure we do this. In every scene we can read her eyes, see how she feels and what she has been through. Theron won the Oscar for her Aileen and it is hard to argue about that. Ricci does a pretty good job as the naive Selby as well, although you should not compare her with Theron. This is a good movie, made even better by a great performance."

The film focuses on that time period and Wuornos' budding lesbian relationship with Selby Wall, a quiet, shy young girl looking for companionship.  The film dosen't attempt to glamorize Wuornos' life, but it does paint a shocking portrait of why she killed her ""johns"", problems dating back to her childhood.  Until now, Charlize Theron has just been seen in decorative supporting parts (""That Thing You Do!"", ""The Cider House Rules"" and ""The Italian Job""), but this time, she IS the lead character, and she IS Aileen Wuornos.  Her Oscar-winning portrayal of the emotionally broken and suffering Wuornos is devastatingly real and brilliant.  Kudos to Christina Ricci, as well, for her quiet, fierce, award-caliber role as Selby.  Their scenes together are intensely effective, but ther are also scenes with Wuornos and her ""johns"" that are quite heartbreaking as well: the vignette when she is with an equally broken, stammering man named Gene (Pruitt Taylor Vince), and the shockingly realistic scene with Horton (Scott Wilson), a middle-aged passerby who unsuspectingly gives the young woman a ride, little expecting the danger in store.

She actually has human feelings - see, she kills out of love (and frustration but that is due to her background), but she actually feels sorry for the big guy she at first believes wants to ""ruff"" her up. Then what I don't get is the old man killing by the end - but maybe it is all to show that she has now totally lost it, who can tell....small points there, but still an amazing film..<br/><br/>Seems also to be a trend among Hollywood beauties to put ""ugly-face"" make up and then win oscars, it's been going like that for quite a few years now, but as long as it is deserved, fine - and in the case of ""Monster"", Charlize Theron definately deserves her oscar, no doubt!<br/><br/>8/10"

","Having taken a slight interest in the story of Aileen Wuornos, I was appalled by ""Monster"" because it does no justice to her story. To be fair, Charlize Theron gives a good performance as Wuornos, but after seeing Nick Broomfield's ""The Selling of a Serial Killer"" (1992) I realized just how biased and dishonest the film adaptation ""Monster"" is.<br/><br/>Patty Jenkins does have a clear agenda to push which is this: Aileen wasn't a bad person, it was men that made her that way because she was abused by them. It's true, yes, but that doesn't negate what she did -- she still murdered innocent people and ""Monster"" really tries to gloss over some of this.<br/><br/>Second of all, my big problem with the film is that it spends so much unnecessary time on the relationship between Aileen and her lover, played by Christina Ricci. It's true, they were involved together, but the movie stops midway to focus on the trials and tribulations -- trying to add depth to the characters -- and fails (or at least it did for me) because I soon lost interest in the ""love story."" In fact this is yet another case of the film glossing over events -- most of the stuff involving the two in this movie is completely made up.<br/><br/>I would have preferred a less biased viewpoint on the matter. Although Broomfield's documentary is also very biased (on Channel 4 he even provided a post-chapter where he explains Aileen was just troubled and not aware of what she was doing) it is far more truthful to Aileen's story.<br/><br/>Her story is a true American tragedy and to see it glossed over by Hollywood like this, added on top of lies and a biased agenda, is really a shame.<br/><br/>A lot of people are going to disagree with me on this but I can't hide my dislike for ""Monster"" and the disappointment I suffered after seeing it."

","***POSSIBLE MILD SPOILERS***<br/><br/>What a dog of a movie.

Charlize Theron's performance is awkward and over the top. If there was an Oscar for overacting, it'd be hers. Aileen's paranoia comes across a little, but her hate for men really does seem cartoonish, and when she is trying to seem conflicted (like when she kills a family man who was just giving her a lift) she's just downright unconvincing. The other thing that was weird were her breasts - absurdly large when clothed, and none too large when not! (no, Im not a pervert, but it was that silly it stood out!) <br/><br/>The biggest crime Monster commits is it reliance on the shock of the true story (which it tones down nicely) to add depth, instead of actually capturing solid characterisations (cmon, they could have had a cardboard cut-out in place of Ricci and you wouldn't have noticed the difference - and it's not her fault. Her character is so absurdly one dimensional it must be embarrassing for her) and developing realistic situations. The writer/director, Patty Jenkins, is the greatest criminal in this whole mess."

","This film, is pretty good, owing most of course to the intriguing story and the great acting of all involved (in particular that of Charlize Theron). For me though, the film holds a couple of flaws as well though. First of all, I find the end and the way Wuornos is picked up in the end a bit hard to believe, with regards to her suspicious nature towards depicted throughout the film. Also, the film could have shown more of the trial of Aileen. Maybe it is, because I am a psychology student, but in my mind (judging from the portrayal of Theron of course) this woman was mentally ill. Therefore I would have liked to hear some expert testimonies. Additionally I would have liked to know how many people she killed and in what time-frame etcetera. Another thing that wasn't cleared up in the film was: ""What 'old thing' was she arrested for???"" I mean, there remain numerous questioned unanswered by the film. Those who want the answers to these and all other questions check out: http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/women/wuornos/1.html?sect=11<br/><br/>The fact that I found so many downsides to this film (in my opinion) might make it sound as if I didn't enjoy the film. This is not true. I found it heart-breaking and heart-warming at times and thought it was a pretty good movie (I did NOT regret hiring it). Yet I felt that for this movie to be GREAT, to be A CLASSIC, it would have had to be made different.

","So another of Tinsletown's beautiful people piles on the pounds for a couple of months, spends a few hours in make-up every morning and walks away with an Oscar. Hollywood is indeed a fickle place. When they need a broad, greasy-haired lesbian serial killer who looks like she's been hit in the face with a spade, who do they pick, but Charlize Theron, one of the most attractive women in the world who, if memory serves, earns a handy extra income by promoting shampoo. Forget about all the aspiring actresses earning five dollars an hour as waitresses in LA diners, most of whom are a good deal closer to Aileen Wuornos in the looks department - lets pay millions of dollars for a celebrity, plaster her in make-up until she's unrecognisable and force-feed her Big Macs.<br/><br/>And of course they are right. A movie like Monster needs a star and a story to make it fly. Most Academy members recognise that if one of their leading lights is prepared to slum it for a while, come off the Atkins diet and slap on some unflattering prosthetics in the name of art, then they deserve some appreciation. Put them through scenes of rape and torture and constantly greasy hair and the Oscar is a certainty. Nobody ever won an Academy Award by acting happy-go-lucky.<br/><br/>As it happens, Theron's Oscar is about the only point of interest in the whole project. In truth, hers in an average performance in an average movie. Wuornos seems to have been a fairly nasty piece of work. A career prostitute, she is on the brink of suicide when she meets Selby (Christina Ricci) in a gay bar. The two strike up an unusual alliance and go on the run together. What follows is an unpleasant, awkward buddy movie - a downmarket Thelma and Louise - with little aesthetic or emotional appeal. Wuornos spends the entire time drinking, smoking, cussing and offing her clients while Selby slouches around in grimy motel rooms. A sort of love borne out of mutual need develops eventually as Wuornos, her trust in men shattered, succumbs to Selby physically, but it is never truly convincing.<br/><br/>That is the trouble with true stories, as the cliché goes, they are often stranger than fiction, and when you throw in two famous, alluring actresses, the bounds of plausibility stretch ever further. Frankly, one gets the impression that Ricci, free from the constraints of half a ton of foundation slapped on her face could do a lot better. Aside from her psychotic tendencies, Theron wanders about with the same crazed bulldog-chewing-wasp expression for the whole film. Maybe she spent too long in make-up and her face dried solid. Either that or she's method acting.<br/><br/>Monster falls in to the trap of introducing hackneyed devices to illustrate the point it's trying to make: The walls in the motels are black with dirt indicating that the whole affair is sordid and dirty; Selby's family life is ultra-conservative so THAT's why she rebels; There is the whole hooker-tries-to-get-regular-job scene that has been done a million times before. I could go on. It has all the hallmarks of a TV movie - I was half expecting high-rolling lawyers played by Brian Dennehy and Harry Hamlin to enter the fray at the trial and get her off on a technicality.<br/><br/>I am being overly harsh. Monster is not a bad film. It just isn't very good. So to give it the Oscar-winning tag is a little misleading.<br/><br/>

The sole purpose of this film was to shock and nothing else. Put in some gore, some nudity, some yelling and crying, and all of a sudden you've got a master piece? I don't think so. This film has nothing new to say, and nothing new to show. The only reason for all the hype is the fact that you've got an ""A"" lister actress on it. Charleze's physical transformation is amazing and all, but it doesn't change the fact that her acting was all over the place. The facial expressions, the movements- were all exaggerated. I can't count the times I've rolled my eyes while watching her. The Oscars needed a little Glamor and Drama on their show, so who's better to fit that requirement?

","Monster may have been a passable film had it been good art, or at least attempted to portray the true story of Aileen Wuornos. Instead, it fails miserably on both scores, content to have an ABC Afterschool Special like patina in its approach. I also, after viewing this film, know another reason why I wanted to not see it, and that's because after two years of this unjust and wasteful war of invasion President Bush launched in Iraq I did not want to be reminded that sometimes even the reactionary Right Wing Radicals can still be right about something; and that is only a deluded out of touch Hollywood Feminazi sympathizers could serve up such crap, and then fete it ceaselessly. This is one of those films and performances that in ten or so years people will cringe at as being one of the worst selections ever. Let me be the first to say it- Theron's award winning performance is one of the worst to ever win an Oscar- it is not deep, nor scary, and even lacks the essential redeeming silliness of a Hannibal Lecter or Freddy Krueger. This film is one of those that people are just agog at, and so at odds with the Hollywood machine and its fawning parade of acolyte critics, that no one has the guts to say it's terrible. And, worst of all, every time I think about the film, and Theron's performance, it slides down another notch in my mind, just like so-called feminists who see a hero in Aileen Wuornos. That said, the Monster referred to in the title of the film most aptly applies to the film itself. Avoid this tripe!"

","I thought this movie was going to be superb after hearing Ms Theron had won an Oscar for it; however I was a little knocked back by the slow detailed script and lack of imagination of the Director to get the best out of his actors and surroundings. Basically I thought this movie verged on boring. By the end of the film and I think my Nth cup of tea/coffee I didn't get the point of making this movie. Was she an unfortunate abused child? Was it just a gory murder movie? No this was well thought out, but the problem with this script like all others like this is that it was based on a true event. Not all true events are exciting or that interesting, just because some strange woman starts killing people doesn't mean she's interesting.

","Charlize Theron as convicted murderess Aileen Wuornos. Intriguing true story becomes a fashion-staple's Oscar ticket, and for good reason: the speech, the mannerisms, the fierce stare, the bravado of a dead-end life on a ruinous road are all letter-perfect, and Theron's make-down gives our imagination just what it needs--nothing over the top. I found however Christina Ricci, despite some strong early scenes, badly miscast as Wuornos' bedfellow and partner in crime (she's too young, of course, but she doesn't match up well with Theron, either in stature or in their acting styles--and their love scenes are most uncomfortable). The film is slackly directed, with some of the power of the situations muffled by the editing. Scenes run on too long or not long enough, while a few of Theron's outbursts are not fully explored (sure she's angry, and she's got a right to be, but in a job interview? and why would Wuornos apply for secretarial jobs--did she feel she was above warehouse or assembly-line work where she might have excelled?). The overreaching finale misses the mark while striving for higher importance, and this is surely the fault of the director, but Theron manages to eke out a credible characterization, a performance that nearly overshadows big faults with ""Monster"". **1/2 from ****"

I love crime-dramas and true crime, but this movie was so bad, I wanted to walk out. And not just once, almost a dozen times. The only real star in this movie is the make-up applied to Charlize Theron. Is she good? Eh. Alright at best. I think she peaked in 2 DAYS IN THE VALLEY. She has mannerisms and voice down, but doesn't remain consistent. Her narrative voice-over appears to be her own voice, separating it from the rest of the film.  Not much even seems to happen in this film. For a movie about a serial killer, there is miniscule violence. Maybe the director was just trying to push the gay angle. Who knows.

"hall895","5","3","7","7 January 2011"," Ugly yourself up, win an Oscar
","Oscar voters love it when performers transform themselves into something as far away as possible from who they really are. Charlize Theron is not crazy, is stunningly beautiful and I rather doubt she will ever kill seven people. So playing a crazy, ugly serial killer gets her an Oscar. Never mind the fact the movie isn't any good. Yes, Theron undergoes a stunning transformation. And it certainly took some serious acting talent for her to pull off this role. She's believable as notorious murderer Aileen Wuornos. But you'd like to think winning an Oscar would require more than just being believable in a role that doesn't suit you at all. Especially when, however good your performance may be perceived to be, the movie itself fails rather miserably.<br/><br/>Monster suffers from a severe lack of drama. OK, so it's a true story and we know from the beginning exactly where this is headed. But there have been plenty of movies based on true stories which, even though you knew their ultimate destination, have been throughly compelling and entertaining. Sadly that is far from being the case here. This movie is mind-numbingly boring. There are only two characters even worth mentioning. One of course is Aileen, the other is her little lesbian lover Selby who spends the whole movie following Aileen around like a pathetic, clueless little puppy dog. Poor Christina Ricci is saddled with this part, the character is such a total zero there was never really any chance for Ricci to make anything of it. She really has nothing to do, it is Theron's movie through and through. And that brings its own problems. First off the layers of ugly makeup slathered all over her face look ridiculous. For much of this movie Aileen doesn't even look human. With all that gunk on her face it's nearly impossible to see Theron emote at all. Her face is a blank, ugly slate. Note to future filmmakers: if you want to make a movie about a notably unattractive woman perhaps best to not cast one of the world's most beautiful women in the role. All the effort required to make Theron look hideous ends up hurting the film. Quite frankly, she looks ridiculous. Theron certainly gives a game effort, trying so hard to be something she so obviously is not. But the way she carries herself, all her exaggerated mannerisms in trying to show how uncomfortable Aileen Wuornos was in her own skin, it just doesn't work. If you have to try this hard to appear awkward and ungainly perhaps this isn't the role for you. The movie is also hurt by the director's obvious, and obviously misguided, attempt to turn Aileen Wuornos into a a sympathetic figure. This effort fails miserably. You don't feel sympathy for the character. Honestly the movie is such a snooze you really don't feel much of anything at all. But if you did, sympathy for this monstrous murderer would certainly not be the prevailing emotion. The only good thing you can say about this movie is that Theron took on an incredible challenge and that she did about as well as could be expected with it. But it's not the stuff of Oscar dreams. And the movie as a whole is a nightmare."
"engelst","6","3","7","10 March 2004"," Average in every way
","Monster aspires to do what Boys Don't Cry has achieved: a human portrayal of a freak. But Monster falls short because it takes itself too seriously and because it is too sentimental. The director stumbles over her own feet trying to make us sympathize with the monster, something that would have been much easier if she wouldn't be breathing down our necks: ""Look, pathos!"" ""To your left, human kindness!"" ""Hey, more good deeds just around that corner!"". Especially the ending suffers from it, because the director raises the emphasis to bring across a sense of urgency and tension. It left me with dry eyes and an empty heart. Charlize Theron certainly did a good effort with her role. But her performance was very uneven at best, wavering between warm femininity and an unconvincing macho attitude. One is left wondering whether she is portraying a gauche character or whether she is having trouble portraying a woman with a male attitude. Certainly it was not an Oscar-worthy performance. If you compare this role to the one portrayed by Hillary Swank, the latter stands out with ease."

","I have mixed feelings about Monster. First and foremost, Charlize Theron's acting is beyond comprehension in its perfection. She has become Aileen Wuornos (whom she portrays) in a way so intense and so completely it literally scared me. Tour-de-force performances like hers inhabit a realm far above mere mortal efforts: Oscar worthy / Oscar won. Christina Ricci's performance left me cold, though I understand her underplayed / understated performance might have been more in keeping with the facts -- still, it seemed that Charlize Theron owned each and every scene the two of them were in. I suggest a case of bad miscasting / directing / scripting. Secondly, I understand that certain plot points weren't accurate regarding the genesis of the crimes Aileen Wuornos committed...and that's a key to making the character much more sympathetic. If true, then the producers have done the public and the true victims of her crimes an unconscionable disservice. Finally, one has to judge whether the movie was worth watching. It's an uncomfortable ride on many levels. I recommend the movie solely for Charlize Theron's masterful performance and will leave the other aspects of the movie up for your consideration."

Wuornos was having a lesbian relationship at that time with a young woman named Selby, superbly played by Christina Ricci, she would murder the men in cold-blood by shooting them so she could rob them of everything they had so she could support her love Selby.

No, of course not. Should we not have some compassion also for her victims? Yes, of course. But this film compels one to sympathize with the killer of several men, ironically enough, because we see how very desperate she was to find some source of goodness and joy in her miserable life. Tragedy with a capital ¨T¨.<br/><br/>I must say that I feel also some regret for the families of Wuornos´s victims, who have now been forever etched into popular cultural history as johns. Not all of them were rapists. Perhaps the biggest lesson of all here is that one should be wary of picking up hitchhikers--regardless of gender--because you never know where people have been or where they are going.<br/><br/>Incredibly sad story. Incredible performance by Chalize Theron, who we now know is not just another pretty face. She really dug deep to pull this one off so convincingly. Brava!"

","The movie is beyond excellent in the matter of directing and production aspects. The story is very well been presented where one can say it is not possible to do it better. The acting is superb as well especially Charlize Theron's magnificent performance.<br/><br/>The story itself at the other hand is not as good as those perfect qualities. It could be paced better in the scenario I think. Turning worse from bad is something expected but showing the exact break points and the effects of the pas right in the present is not an easy job. I think scenario could have been written better in which the audience could see the chain of effects from the past while the current events happening, the true motives and how they work. The movie tells the story of a broken young girl turning bad and worse from an abused child to a prostitute and then a killer. That is well explained but while we see a movie about that process the most interesting part would be a detailed explanation of how that happens. I felt like the ""how"" part lacks something after I have watched it.<br/><br/>However, beside that lack of detailed scenario, the movie absolutely worth watching and is no doubt interesting. You will enjoy it for sure even if you are not a big fan of crime movies."

","Monster, released in 2003, is a film about the tragic life and crimes of serial killer Aileen Wournos. Director Patty Jenkins, along with Charlize Theron (who starred as Wournos) spent a great deal of time corresponding with the subject of their film via letters as well as watching interviews and reviewing court documents to create the most accurate portrayal of Wournos as possible. Theron underwent a dramatic transformation for her role, gaining over 30 pounds and was practically unrecognizable on screen. Wournos was a sex worker who went on to kill seven men after being assaulted by one of her clients or ""Johns"" as they are called in the film. After surviving a brutal and abusive childhood, she was homeless most of her adult life. While working as a street prostitute when she was in Florida, down to her last five dollars and pondering suicide, she stopped into a bar to have a drink. There, Aileen met Selby Wall (played by Christina Ricci), a woman in her early twenties who had been sent to live with relatives after her parents became aware of her lesbian lifestyle. Selby is immediately attracted to Aileen, and while Aileen has never been in a lesbian relationship, she soon finds herself equally attracted to Selby. After running away from her family, Selby moves into a cheap hotel with Aileen, who pays the bills by working the streets as a prostitute. The relationship becomes a tumultuous one, as the stress of Aileen's work and the couple's poor financial situation beings to boil over. After the initial brutal attack by a john, and his subsequent murder, Wournos spirals into somewhat of a murderous psychosis until she is eventually caught and arrested. Although her first murder can be considered self-defense, Aileen's disgust and hatred of the men who pay her for sex becomes so extreme that she begins killing her customers regardless of their behavior. Meanwhile, Selby slowly becomes aware of the full extent of her partner's mental instability and violent acts. The filming of scenes in the real-life bar where Wournos would often visit adds a gritty realism to the movie. The graphic assault scene that resulted in Wournos's first murder almost makes the viewer feel sorry for her, and rationalize her crimes. Theron does an excellent job in her depiction of Aileen Wournos, and the movie sends you as a viewer through a multitude of emotions. I would highly recommend seeing it."

","Monster is a 2003 film written and directed by Patty Jenkins that chronicles the life of convicted serial killer Aileen Wuornos. Wuornos (played superbly by Charlize Theron) is a prostitute that meets a young woman, Selby (played by Christina Ricci), who has been sent to Florida after coming out to her parents. Selby is lonely and becomes inextricably involved with Wuornos. It is during this period that Wuornos, after a brutal rape, begins to kill and rob the men she solicits.<br/><br/>This can be a tough film to watch. Wuornos is a tortured soul and exhibits psychopathic tendencies even before the murder spree begins. Jenkins expertly divulges Wuornos' back story during the film with a series of narrations. The viewer learns that Wuornos' childhood and upbringing were heinous. Abandoned by her parents, allegedly abused by her grandfather, and a mother at age 14, Wuornos probably had many emotional scars by adulthood.<br/><br/>Selby is simply a lost young woman trying to find herself and sees excitement in Wuornos. Ricci does a good job portraying her as willfully clueless. Selby knows and accepts that Wuornos is a prostitute and eventually learns that she killed someone. But, somehow, Selby never questions how Wuornos arrives with a different car every few days or where she is getting large sums of cash. Selby only seems concerned that she is relegated to the motel rooms and apartments where they stay.<br/><br/>This film is ultimately about justice. One can certainly have sympathy for Wuornos' upbringing and position in life. Her first killing may very well have been done in self-defense. However, it is hard to justify Wuornos' subsequent actions. Premeditatedly killing people as a way to salve one's emotional wounds, no matter how deep, is difficult to warrant.<br/><br/>Selby's actions are enigmatic. While Wuornos supported both of them, Selby never really tried to help Wuornos out of her position in life. In the end, Selby seems to coax a confession from Wuornos (in exchange for leniency) with no real remorse. Selby's caretaker in Florida remarks that Wuornos is only out to take advantage of her. By the end of the film, it appears that perhaps it was Selby taking advantage of Wuornos.<br/><br/>Monster is a movie that ultimately makes the viewer feel empty. Except for Wuornos' internal rage, there is no other resolution or motive for the main character's actions. Theron provides a glimpse into Wournos' psyche but the movie proceeds actually as you know it will."
"shannen-l-c","8","0","0","20 January 2019"," Incredible and harrowing story of a real-life serial killer
","'Monster' is based on the life of prostitute and serial killer, Aileen Wuornos, who killed seven men in Florida between 1989-1990 and was executed in 2002.<br/><br/>Before watching 'Monster' I knew nothing about Aileen or her story and went in completely blind. Nevertheless, I was enthralled with the film that I immediately switched on Nick Bloomfield's documentary 'Aileen: Life and Death of a Serial Killer' (2003) to see the true story. I now give this review having watched the film and documentary, knowing more about Aileen's crimes.<br/><br/>The film follows Aileen from just before she starts committing the murders, providing insight into her lifestyle on the streets as a prostitute and her meeting with her lover, Selby (Chrisitina Ricci) and ends with her conviction. It shows Aileen's relationship with Selby, her desperation to break out of prostitution and inability to keep control of her life. It shows three of the seven murders she committed, and although it is very much a story of a serial killer, the primary focus is on Aileen's motivations.<br/><br/>'Monster' is a harrowing tale of a woman who was branded a murderous men-hating wh*** and killed for her crimes. This film tries to go beyond that and digs deeper into Aileen's character and past to explore her personality and her motives. The result is incredible, as it genuinely makes you sympathise with her despite the horrendous and unforgivable crimes she commits. No one will ever truly know why Aileen committed the murders, but 'Monster' makes a convincing case that it was a result of her traumatic up bringing, her experiences of violence from men over the years of working as a prostitute, her inability to integrate into 'normal' society, desperation to provide for the one she loved and a way to take back control of her life in the only way she could. It's sick and twisted, but makes for fascinating film-making.<br/><br/>Our intrigue with crime stories and serial killers lies in the looming questions of HOW and WHY. How does a person become so evil that they can take another life? How can they justify their crimes? Why would anyone wish to harm/kill another human being? These are the questions 'Monster' explores and attempts to answer. It's fascinating that in this case the answer doesn't appear to be the simplistic answer we usually hear of ""Because she was evil"" or ""Because she was a psychopath"" but something much more complex. Aileen is a victim as much as perpetrator, a woman that has suffered throughout her life and is afflicted with mental illness which she never receives medical help for. Does that justify her crimes? No way, nothing could ever justify it. But that grey area that 'Monster' explores is what makes this film so interesting.<br/><br/>Charlize Theron is INCREDIBLE in her role as Aileen. She lives and breathes the role, quite literally becoming Aileen. Not only does her physical appearance resemble Aileen very closely, but she also has the same mannerisms and impulsive and reckless nature. When watching Charlize as Aileen, it is hard to believe you're truly watching Charlize at all. Generally, when people think of Charlize they think of glamour, beauty and grace, but as Aileen she becomes an ugly, erratic and abhorrent human. She truly deserves all of the awards for pulling this performance out of the hat.<br/><br/>Overall, 'Monster' is a thrilling and chilling tale of Aileen's crimes that is thought evoking and harrowing. Charlize's performance makes the film the success that it is and I will remember 'Monster' for many years to come."

","He is definitely a really good movie that has impressed and surprised me in many ways. I do not like watching movies that deal with crime. Just say I'm not a fan of crime thrillers or crime movies but I'm very interested in what's going on in the human head and that's why movies based on true events and the biography of a criminal or convicted person are always very interested I do not have much of this Film expected and even if I had that I would still be surprised to the most positive.
The actors are doing a great job but I can not say more about the story the music the rest of the movie is okay but I think the director is really unique and this is one of those movies where I wish there were more female directors because there are some topics feelings and mindsets in films that can only be followed by a woman and therefore only women can bring decent.<br/><br/>So this is not a movie I would buy or anything but definitely one that I would watch at again when he is on TV or whatever I can recommend to anyone who is also interested but I say you should have a strong stomach.<br/><br/>PS:
I take my hat off to Charlize Theron not only because she is, in my opinion, one of the most beautiful white women of all time.
she is a fantastic actress who always goes out of her way even in her bad movies she does a good job and a good job and here comes the best of her for show and I just can not believe what the make up artist did for a fantastic job because they are unknowable and it's almost unbelievable who is going to do it.

"ThomasDrufke","7","0","0","27 July 2017"," Humanizing a Killer
","One of the hardest things to do is made a typically unsympathetic character sympathetic. Monster deals with a famous serial killer from the early 1990's who believed she was killing for good reasons. Finding a way to write a direct such a character so that the audience doesn't automatically despise your lead is a difficult thing to do. Patty Jenkins and Charlize Theron found a way to do just that with Aileen Wuornos. The story deals with Aileen, who has had a rough life to say the least. She's been a prostitute since an early teen, physically abused by her family, and has been homeless for years ever since being kicked out of her home. Just by hearing that, there's at least some sense of pity I feel for her. This all leads to her meeting Selby Wall (based on Tyria Moore). The film portrays both of them at a rough patch in their life, which makes it all the more timely that they meet each other. After a relatively sweet romance for the first 40 minutes of the film, Aileen begins her crime spree. We may never know exactly how it all went down, but if she originally killed first victim because he was raping her and likely going to murder her, then I can feel a lot of sympathy towards her. As I said, Jenkins makes a choice to present Aileen as a victim herself, but that changes about halfway through. But I really appreciate the balance Jenkins gives to the crimes. They aren't faceless crimes without purpose, she's doing them for love and because her life is close to worthless without the money she's getting. By no means does that dismiss her from having any guilt, as no one should be murdered, but you can begin to understand her mindset just a little bit. It doesn't hurt that you have a great actress like Charlize Theron to build your film around, as she earned an Oscar for her turn as Aileen. It was well deserved I may add. Overall, Monster is a fascinating movie to get inside of a murderous psychopath, but it's more the moments of humanity in Aileen that stand out the most.<br/><br/>7.4/10"

One night while at work, a man stops, picks her up, obviously wanting her services, but the man is brutal and vicious, beating poor Aileen to within an inch of her life, out of sheer desperation Aileen struggles free and kills the man in cold blood. <br/><br/>A fatal mistake, and was this the end? Oh no, it was just the beginning! A light bulb went on in Aileen's head, from then on, instead of simply hooking, she would instead flag these nasty men down, take them somewhere secluded and kill them, then steal all their money, hey, it's far more profitable, plus she gets to kill nasty, violent men, what's not to like?<br/><br/>One day she took it one step too far, by killing a cop, this proved to be Aileen's downfall and eventually she was caught, arrested and sentenced to death in court. <br/><br/>Personally I enjoyed Monster it was just very difficult to watch, I was drawn in and became quite sympathetic to Aileen, but my heart went out to Selby even more so, a simple, frightened girl who is pretty much brainwashed into being Aileen's sidekick and partner, should've stayed at home Selby, carved out a better, legal life for yourself, and I continued saying this every time the character was on the screen.<br/><br/>Charlize Theron won the academy award for best actress for Monster, a rightful choice, she was absolutely superb as Aileen, just as I said earlier, unattractive and rather disgusting. <br/><br/>She was the first female serial killer in America, and her story is well told, my only snag is the runtime and the fact it could have broke the 2 hour mark rather than being a little over an hour and 40 minutes."
"Screen_Blitz","8","0","0","17 July 2017"," Charlize Theron gives a prodigious portrayal of an unsettling tragic figure in this disturbing, yet gripping biography
","Most serial killers we know in the celluloid are associated with the slasher-horror genre, with such figures as Michael Myers, Jason Voorhes , and Freddy Krueger. What does these serial killers have in common? They are all based on fiction. Director Patty Jenkins offers a deeply upsetting account of a serial killer who is not work of fiction but was in fact a real-life figure who was enough to sit in the category with such grisly figures as Ted Bundy and Charles Manson. This woman's name was Aileen Wuornos, and she was not a very friendly human being. Capitalizing on the tragic accounts of its central figure who is now deceased after sentenced to death by lethal injection, this film offers a grim, yet realistic portrayal on the dark side of human kind, a path that lead to the death of both innocent and non-innocent individuals. The title could not be justifiable, and Jenkins makes the daunting, yet triumphant choice of casting Charlize Theron in the subject role in effort to support that claim. Set in 1989, this film chronicles the life of Aileen Wuornos (played by Charlize Theron), an unlaundered woman growing up in Daytona Beach as a prostitute while developing a lesbian relationship with Selby (played by Christina Ricci) who grows up in a religious family. Selby's family immediately disapproves of her and unaware of her desire to turn her life around. That proves to be easier said than done when she struggles to land a job due to her criminal record and lack of social kills. On the night of what is supposed to be her last customer of dirty business turns into a bloodbath when she brutally murders her client who tries to rape her. This night soon marks the beginning of her homicidal life. <br/><br/>Patty Jenkins does not aim for a horror movie approach nor does she stray into the degree of exploitation when drawing the grim portrait of Wuornos. Nonetheless, the film certainly has a feel of a horror film not only because of the brutality of her behavior but also due to the fact that it is inspired by true events. Although Jenkins takes just a few liberties from the documented tale, she does not fail paint a picture on the abhorrent nature of the film's tragic figure. Charlize Theron is the apex of the film. While Theron has never been resorted to particular typecasting, this film marks her first time in a role residing the wrong side of the moral compass. Shaving her eyebrows and gaining thirty pounds to maintain Aileen Wuarnos's distasteful appearance, Theron disappears into the role boasting an incredible amount of ferocity and grit that greatly sticks out in each scene when she has a startling encounter with her ""sex customers"". The story goes out of its way to portray not necessarily as a nihilistic figure, but a woman who believes killing is part of human nature, as he addresses in one scene. ""People kill because of politics, because of religion"" she cries during this scene which is an accurate account of what goes on our society as well as around the world. Her relationship with Christina Ricci is suitably mapped out. That is not to say that the two actresses share a fashionable chemistry. But each the two are on screen, there performances shine diligently, and their heart-thumping relationship propels to a bittersweet conclusion when Aileen comes to realize the filthy nature of her image. <br/><br/>Monster is deeply disturbing and frequently uncomfortable to sit through, yet marks for a gripping biopic of its central figure thanks to the poignant performances by Charlize Theron and Christina Ricci and intelligent direction by Patty Jenkins. As painful as it is, the movie speaks a truth of human nature and Jenkins never tarnishes his feat in favor of exploitation. For those mature enough to dive into this tragic story, the film is a fascinating tale."

The plot mainly covers the relationship she develops with a young woman after moving to Florida, and attempts to shed some light on the events that led her to a path there was no coming back from.<br/><br/>Written & directed by Patty Jenkins, Monster is an impressive start to her filmmaking career and remains one of the strongest directorial debuts of 21st century. Jenkins approaches the real-life account with an open viewpoint and portrays Aileen's life as a tragic one without undermining the unforgivable acts she committed. Also, her relationship with her girlfriend is sincerely illustrated.<br/><br/>The best thing about Monster, however, is Charlize Theron who single-handedly makes this film work with a performance that's as compelling as it is chilling. Undergoing a physical transformation so profound & disturbing that she's almost unrecognisable in the role, Theron plays Aileen from inside out, and keeps a firm grip on her emotions & expressions at all times. Christina Ricci is in as her girlfriend and does well with what she's given.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Monster is a skilfully crafted, grippingly told & outstandingly performed biopic that is able to infuse shades of grey into what appears black & white from afar, and will always be memorable for Charlize Theron's career-best performance. Making the viewers feel sympathy for an unlikeable character is never an easy job but thanks to Patty Jenkins' refined script & first-rate direction, and Theron's total devotion to her role, Monster accomplishes that with effortless ease. Highly recommended."

","When you see Aileen Wuornos and hear that she is a Daytona Beach prostitute and serial killer, you would probably expect her to be absolutely out of her mind. And you'd be right, to some extent, but you wouldn't expect that she had big dreams at one point in life, and all she really wanted to do was have one person to love. In fact when she seemed to almost accidentally stumble into becoming a prostitute at a young age, when she dreamed of becoming rich and famous, and expected to just stumble into fame as well. Soon enough she had become a full blown hooker, and she seemed to do the same when she became a serial killer. And Charlize Theron seems to completely inhabit this human being with a damaged soul. She not only physically transformed herself, but mentally as well. She is not the beautiful Charlize Theron that we've seen before. All of the performances in the film are fantastic, but Charlize Theron completely becomes this new person and there's almost no other performance in film that matches her's in this one<br/><br/>So Aileen's downfall started out when she was trying to get money to share with her new girlfriend, Selby Wall. She was ""hooking"" and happened to get into the wrong man's car. She got into the car of a sadistic psychopath, and he rapes her and tortures her, and definitely would've killed her if she didn't kill him first. She hides this from Selby, because she knows Selby is like the old Aileen. Selby believes people are good and Aileen doesn't want to take that away from her. She tries to quit hooking, but discovers she has dug herself too deep into a hole she can't get out of. After being raped and almost murdered, then being rejected by every job because of her lack of credentials, she begins to lose hope in herself. She finally confesses that she murdered the man to Selby, and decides to go back to hooking. But, when she gets in the car with the next man, she seems more nervous, more paranoid. The editing becomes closer and quicker, with intense music in the background, just like it did when she killed the first man. Suddenly she kills the man. She is then at home with Selby, and this is when the guilt begins to eat away at her, but it got them money, and the money gave them happiness, so she continues to kill. We see that she first needs to convince herself that the person is bad in order to kill him, and if she can't do that, she can't kill him. But she begins to kill nicer people, one of them a man that she thinks is out to get her because he has a gun, when it is only revealed that he is a cop. Next she gets in the car of a man that is a genuinely nice person with a family, who doesn't want to hook up with her, yet when he sees her pistol, she feels that she has to kill him, even though she doesn't want to. This is the most painful scene in the movie. From there it is all downhill for Aileen and Selby, and it all culminates to one heartbreaking phone call between Selby and Aileen, when it pans over to show cops in the same room listening to Selby, revealing that Selby is turning her in by getting a confession from her.<br/><br/>Was she a bad person? Yes. But she was also genuinely scarred and damaged from a horrible childhood. We learn she was kicked out of her house, beat by her dad, and raped at the age of 8, among other things, yet for a long while she truly believed in herself and that things would get better. The truth is, in the end, all she really wanted was to be with the one person she ever seemed truly loved in the world. This is a hopeless, cynical film, about a similarly hopeless and cynical one, but it is a fantastic and devastating film as well."

And yet in ""Monster"", about the notorious and mentally-ill Aileen Wuornos and her lesbian lover, Theron and Ricci don the clothes and outlook of lower-middle and even lower-class America. No longer are they the elite of Hollywood but two struggling lower-class nobodies, except, unlike her girlfriend, Wuornos is mentally ill, possibly schizophrenic, and she eventually becomes a serial killer.<br/><br/>Charlize Theron, in a performance which is nearly unbelievable in her transformation from Hollywood starlet to Midwest hooker for which she won the Academy Award for Best Actress, plays Aileen Wuornos, an unstable prostitute who engages in a romantic fling with a young lesbian, Selby, played by Christina Ricci in an equally-compelling performance. (Wuornos' real lover's name was Tyria Moore.) Selby is a misunderstood and somewhat unloved young woman constantly residing with different family members who don't know what to do with her. For them, her lesbian predilections are anti-Christian. She meets Aileen Wuornos in a gay bar in Florida, and she's the first woman to respond to Selby's advances. Although Aileen is a prostitute and very high-strung, often flying into rages for little reason, she seems at first harmless. Shortly thereafter, Wuornos takes on a ""client"" who drives her to the woods and subdues her. Wuornos breaks free and ends the prostitute-client relationship--violently.<br/><br/>At the same time, Aileen and Selby's relationship is on the upswing, and they decide to run away together, infuriating the younger woman's family who know how Aileen makes her living. Aileen decides to renounce prostitution, but can't find a legitimate job. They are running out of money, and Selby is disillusioned with the entire affair. Her lover then returns to prostitution but with a twist. She's not going to engage in any sexual acts, as she had before. She's going to use her clients in a different way.<br/><br/>This is a very dark story about the underside of American life. Part of what makes it very disturbing is how real everything is. The dive bars, the cheap cars, and broken down houses are places often not portrayed on the large screen. None of the characters are particularly likable, except Selby (Ricci). Her parents are god-fearing but seem very heartless. And Theron as Wuorno is so unbelievably convincing you can't reconcile what she does in this film with her persona at social events. After production, Theron and Ricci returned back to the world of the Hollywood elite, but this story is forever etched in celluloid."

Young Adult, Mad Max Fury Road, Hancock, Prometheus, Snow White & The Huntsman, these are just a few of her best pieces of work, holding the screen against other big stars and never faltering. It has taken me too long to get to Monster, and finally I've seen it. Holy mother this is a cinematic performance for the ages, Theron completely melds into real life serial killer Aileen Wournos, and it's terrifying and gripping throughout. Ditching her scolding South African-American beauty for a greased up and bruised hooker, this is a performance not to be missed in a film that holds up to the Theron's power. Christina Ricci is absolutely sublime, her best performance in my opinion out of many. With many scenes filled with shock, peril, violence and surprisingly enough heart, Monster is a superb showcase for Theron's screen-dominating talent."

","Y'know the title reminds me of Rihanna and Eminem's song ""Monster"". I've thought of it all through the beginning and the end of the movie. <br/><br/>Anyways Charlize Theorn was honestly great for playing a serial killer , like the accent and the trashy looks, pretty match the real Aileen Wuornos. I love Cristina Ricci but I think she was too sweet to be in this movie. I wish they didn't call the character Selby, it would've been better off if they named the character after Aileen's real lover Â Tyria Moore. Then they could've got someone better like Melissa McCartney, it would've pushed me to give the film 10 stars really.<br/><br/>I found the movie quite horrifying to look at when she shoots her 'clients'. Those men really made a huge mistake although I don't know about the first one to be honest. The last guy made me cry, he seemed to have been a nice poor fella but who knows though? Did the real Aileen mention him in court? We pretty much live in a sad world and there will always be unfortunately murders happening in the world!"

","Sorry, I make jokes that I think are great it's just that most other people don't.<br/><br/>So I watch a few docs about this case and have a pretty good mental image of Aileen. Fast forward a few years and I am looking for movies I haven't seen and Monster pops up. I couldn't believe that was Charlize for one but since I knew it was I was amazed at how good of a transformation they did with her. More than the physical resemblance Charlize nailed Aileen's mannerisms. That women is one complex nutter so I give Charlize two thumbs up. <br/><br/>I think you need to go in to this movie knowing that the story is gruesome and sad. I also really suggest you watch some video clips or even a documentary on the case so you can appreciate how great Charlize does. For me her portrayal was 80% of what interested me about the movie. To be honest I can see why the movie didn't get many awards. The dialogue felt clunky to me and often I feel like they didn't take enough artistic discretion in making it more suspenseful and adding more emotional peaks and valleys to keep interest.<br/><br/>My bottom line is that the acting is great, dialogue is not, cinematography was okay, and the story is gruesome. And Charlize is a baller."

","Charlize Theron's portrayal of Aileen is magnificent throughout. I completely forgot it was her within seconds of watching this movie and it's very rare that such a well known actor has the ability to do that. Theron's representation of someone who shows immense mood swings on a daily basis had me in awe of her. This character could not have been easy to play but she pulled it off flawlessly.<br/><br/>The film as a whole is so moving. This is the kind of movie that you wont easily forget. The casting for this movie is incredible, I have mentioned Theron but Christina Ricci also did her role a great deal of justice. There is so much emotion and depth in the characters, you will feel your heart racing for Aileen and Selby as well as for very minor characters. It will have you questioning many things about our society that you may never have considered before. An outstanding movie in every way."

","Charlie Theron won the best actress Oscar portraying Aileen Wuornos in this true life crime drama. Christina Ricci is Selby, her lesbian soul mate. The movie is more of a love story than the usual serial killer thriller we are used to seeing. Theron is so good that I felt as if I was watching a documentary. Ricci is also quite good as the clueless love interest Selby. The violence is there, but not overwhelming, and in the end, we have no one and nothing to root for, but Theron and the underrated Ricci make Monster well worth watching.

","Model-turned-actress Charlize Theron leaves her glamorous image behind for this gritty drama, in which she plays a disturbed prostitute who becomes a serial killer. Aileen Wuornos (Theron) was a woman who survived a brutal and abusive childhood in Michigan to become a thick-skinned but emotionally damaged adult. Homeless most of her life, Wuornos subsisted by working as a street prostitute; later, when she was in Florida, down to her last five dollars and pondering suicide, she stopped into a bar for a beer. There, Aileen met Selby Wall (Christina Ricci), a woman in her early twenties who had been sent to live with relatives after her Christian parents became aware of her lesbian lifestyle. Selby is immediately attracted to Aileen, and while Aileen tells Selby she's never been in a lesbian relationship, she soon finds herself equally infatuated with her. Selby runs away from her family and moves into a cheap hotel with Aileen, who initially pays the bills by hooking. However, as their money runs low and Aileen finds herself unable to land a regular job, tensions mount between the two. One night, after a john attacks her, Aileen pulls a gun and kills the man. Although her first murder can be categorized as self-defense, Aileen's loathing for the men who pay her for sex becomes so extreme that she begins killing her customers regardless of their behavior. Meanwhile, Selby slowly becomes aware of the full extent of her lover's instability and the bloody consequences of her actions. Monster was inspired by the true story of Aileen Wuornos, whose life and death was chronicled in two documentaries by filmmaker Nick Broomfield, Aileen Wuornos: The Selling of a Serial Killer, and Aileen: The Life and Death of a Serial Killer."

","Although Charlize Theron won an Oscar for her performance here, deservedly so, the film bends over backwards to put a human face on Aileen Wuornos that she doesn't really deserve. True, for those at the very bottom of society, life does seem like a conspiracy to hold them down, something that is evident here, but Wuornos had her chances. There is no mention in ""Monster"" of her marriage to a much older and extremely wealthy man, a big chance that she threw away by brutalising him. Her love interest Selby (in reality Tyria Moore) was a butch lesbian and absolutely nothing like the delectable Christina Ricci. Having said that, she was undoubtedly the only good thing in the serial killer's life after they met, and did her best for her. Here, she is portrayed as a little girl lost sponging off Wuornos, and in awe of her prostitute image.<br/><br/>The first victim - Richard Mallory - is shown brutalising and raping Wuornos after the ""trick"" turns sour; in reality, although Mallory was a sexual deviant, there is no evidence that in their encounter he was anything more than a man who paid for sex and ended up dead.<br/><br/>The film ends effectively when Wuornos and her lover part company, although we see a glimpse of her first murder trial, but nothing after that. Not a bad soundtrack either, but although ""Don't Stop Believin'"" is a great song, it sounds lyrically dissonant here."

","First time in my life, I felt sorry for a serial killer. Charlize Theron was astonishing as Aileen Wuornos, it was one of the greatest performances I've seen in years. Movies are a form of storytelling and this is a unique humanitarian way of telling story, of a notorious serial killer's life. Hats off to Patty Jenkins. Usually I like to watch serial killer movies which are made from the cop's point of view. Because I don't have any interest on how they become a monster, I don't like to travel their sick complex mind. Monster (2003) was an exception to that and what an exception, it was! The Aileen Wuornos's capture scenario could have been better. I've seen a couple of documentaries based on Aileen Wuornos real life. It was literary a tough-tense state of affairs for the police who caught her. Because she was angry, hopeless, broken and a ruthless killer. I guess the film misses this part's excitement. Anyway, for me, it is a recommended movie for all movie lovers of this genre."

I cried before anything sad even happened. <br/><br/>I first cried as Aileen was speaking about the dreams she had as a child, to be beautiful and famous, because I knew what was going to happen. This was the only part of the story that I could personally relate to (as in, it was the only part that had happened to me), but that's what made it so emotional. If all the stuff that had happened to her had happened to me, I couldn't say I'd be in any better place than she was.<br/><br/>There's a lot of talk about how amazing Cherize's transformation was, but I haven't seen anyone comment on how much it added to film. She talks about how she always wanted to be beautiful and famous, and knowing that it's Cherize playing her only reminds us that if her circumstance's were different she could've been. It stops people from just dismissing her as an ugly woman who never found something else to fall back on. It causes us to think. Beauty is not only innate, it, like everything else, depends on circumstance. <br/><br/>This is a beautifully made and acted movie. It is worth watching only for that.

","Uhh.. When I think back to when I first watched this movie, and how much I loved it, and how many times I watched it, it makes me want to puke with regret. Never has a movie made me cry more than two times. In this unapologetic tear-jerker, I cried more than three times--and I meant every painful tear...and I'm not ashamed to admit it. Alas, as I exposed myself to the movie more and more, all the mistakes started to become visible, and with this discovery I saw that I actually found the movie quite disappointing. No, i'm not comparing it to the documentary because I know as well as everybody here that documentaries and Hollywood movies are not supposed to be the exact. Just...I wish their was more to it, more time to dive into their circumstances. It felt rushed and the script felt unbalanced at times. <br/><br/>Charlize Theron goes through a brutal transformation(gains 30 pounds, changes her accent, makes herself look unattractive) to play the tortured soul, Aileen Wurnos. And she gives a performance worthy of unhealthy amounts of adulation and it is because of her superb acting ability that I boo-hooed like a baby. Christina Richie does well in making me kinda hate her. The guy that broke Aileens murder cherry was chillingly realistic...I get chills just thinking about him..The rest of the cast provided filler. You know, watching it now, I laugh more than feel bad for Aileen. but not because I don't, I do, really. But there moments that are just so laughable that I can't help it.

This is one of the most emotional characters that the movies have ever given us. <br/><br/>Now I know I've only been talking about the performance in the movie and not the movie itself, so now I'll talk to you about that.

I felt I was there with them every minute, and I was always hoping that there love would work out. You'll love them both, even if you're against gays. They honestly truly remind me of Glinda and Elphaba from Wicked. As a matter of fact this movie kind've reminds me of Wicked. Charlize Theron plays the girl that nobody ever talks to, and Christina Ridding is a little more glassy than her, and very soon they develops a connection. Although in this movie, instead of just being friends, they fall in love which to me is way more beautiful. <br/><br/>So yeah.

"fathersonholygore","10","0","0","8 May 2013"," Shattering portrayal of Aileen Wuornos
","This film is essentially a straight forward drama about the crimes of Aileen Wuornos. What makes it so special is the absolutely searing performance of Charlize Theron. There has never been a more accurate portrayal of a criminal ever put on film than Theron's version of Wuornos. If anyone has ever watched the documentaries about her, or even seen a small clip on the internet with Aileen, it's hard to deny that Theron completely embodies this woman; her hardships, her tortured life, her paranoid delusions. It's incredible. Both mentally and physically, Theron becomes Aileen Wuornos, as we watch her struggle to try and hold on to whatever life is left inside her. She struggles with a deep love for a woman named Selby, her life as a prostitute, and soon, the lives she takes. It begins with a man who was planning on raping and murdering Aileen after paying for sex with her; she blows him away with a gun, and begins to move along doing the same to other men she believes are like him, stealing whatever she can from them to support herself and Selby. The problem with Wuornos' real case is that she changed her story so many times, for different reasons, that nobody really knows what is or isn't true. In the end, she claimed to hold back her stories about how it was in self defense she murdered these men because Aileen only wanted to get executed, and be done with it; what we see in the film is a mix of fact, and what you might only be able to call myth, as we'll never be sure for certain what really happened to Aileen while she was with those men.<br/><br/>The director makes you feel for Wuornos, but simultaneously you can stand back and see the horror in what she did. It's a mixture of sympathy, and disturbing reality. I give this a 10 out of 10 stars because it was unbelievably amazing how Charlize Theron became Aileen Wuornos. It is a well-directed drama with some other nice little performances by Christina Ricci, as well as smaller roles by the always interesting Bruce Dern, and a favourite of mine (playing a horrid character), Lee Tergesen. I can't recommend this enough. As an avid fan of true crime (more specifically, serial killers and other murders/et cetera), I love this movie, and anyone who shares my taste should absolutely watch this; more than once also, so you can really let the nuances of Theron's performance sink in over time."
"selenedm999","9","0","0","25 February 2007"," harrowing
","I saw this movie well before the Oscars were announced, and I remember thinking Charlize Theron's nomination (and subsequent win) was well deserved. While I was watching the movie, I found myself startled into tears more than once. I can't say I felt sorry for Aileen Wuornos, exactly, but having met and sympathized with real life prostitutes, I found the portrayal of a life gone wrong very sad and moving.<br/><br/>The story is the ""true"" story of Aileen Wuornos, often called America's first female ""serial killer,"" which if you know your jargon is a misnomer. She was technically a spree killer, but that doesn't matter--she killed a number of men for profit (money and cars, according to the movie) in a relatively short period, and was put to death shortly before the movie was made (2000, I think).<br/><br/>Charlize Theron's performance was bang-on accurate, not in how she looked (people made much of the prosthetics and weight gain), but in the aggressive, desperate quality of Wuornos' character. If you watch the old news clips, or the documentary Aileen, you can see how jittery and furious she was. Not only did she commit violent crimes, but she managed to justify them to herself. The character is sympathetic without making you feel like she's gotten away with something, and I find this an interesting theme in movies where women commit violence. Unlike the action heroes in say, Schwarzenegger or Stallone movies, where bodies pile up and no one has to answer for them, Theron's character in Monster shows the horrifying results of being both a victim and a perpetrator of extreme violence. While one sometimes leads to the other, it's never alright, no matter how bad you may feel for the people on-screen, or the lives they've led that brought them there.<br/><br/>The one downside to the movie that made me feel sad and uncomfortable was the Hollywood Beauty Myth. At the heart of most love stories, which Monster ultimately is, is the idea of a genuine love that motivates and elevates its hero to be something better than he could have been. Unfortunately, it only seems to be the beautiful people who can find this kind of love. If you're ugly, the movie insinuates, all you're allowed is something sick and desperate, and you have to take it where you can get it."

","I believe that this movie did an excellent job of remaking Aileen Wuornos. I believe that they could have featured more about the trial and ""Selby Wall""(whose real name is Tyria Moore. Obviously the name was changed for this movie.) About how she said that she had never known that Aileen killed anyone, and how she complied with the police to convict Aileen and to save herself. Other than the fact that the movie did not show Selby(Tyria) for the heartless snake that she was, this movie did excellent. They turned the beautiful Charlize Theoron to look almost exactly as the true Aileen Wuornos did. That was an accomplishment that not many movies will actually take part in, and I was thrilled to see that this movie had. I also liked the fact that it showed Aileen gradually losing her mind. How she killed a man who had begged her not to, how she had pushed Selby and thrown stuff, and how she killed so many men that did nothing to her. That shows the flaws in the court system which will put to death an apparently crazy young woman. Two Thumbs Up."

I don't see how people can say the Oscar was to go to anyone else. That would have been an outrage. Christina Ricci gives a good supporting performance, and Jenkins has good writing, but Theron stole the show. The whole movie depended on the actress who played Aileen since the movie has a character-driven conflict and plot. Theron went above and beyond ""acting"" as Wuornos and became her.

","Although it has become increasingly exceptional, once in a while a movie comes around that makes you think. ""Monster"" certainly belongs to this category. It takes us back to basics: although we are all supposedly responsible for the content of our own lives, this generally acknowledged premise is proved to be utterly untrue. What can be expected of a person who has grown up in an environment where not even the most elementary form of loving care was present? This monster was created from early childhood on and all the ensuing dramatic events that took place in her life only contributed to reinforcing her low self-esteem and feelings of insecurity. If only this woman who was a victim of circumstance, had been as attractive as Charlize Theron is in real life, she possibly may have overcome the curse that her environment had placed on her. Aileen doesn't know who she really is, what she really wants and in a constant state of despair as to what the future will bring. She has many moments of doubt as to her own feelings, her moral dilemmas and choices in general but never gets an answer to the many questions she asks herself due to the fact that her personality structure is basically non-existent. ""Maybe I should get help"" she says when she is about to leave her friend although deep-down she realizes that it is much too late. Tragic, is the word that defines this movie best. Charlize Theron is exceptional: the camera is practically constantly focused in close-up on her tormented facial expression and this alone reveals the talents of an extremely gifted actress.When in the final scene Aileen turns abruptly around and stares the viewer straight in the eyes, her expression is one of total bewilderment and hatred towards a world she never fully understood."

"aliasanythingyouwant","Null","0","0","31 January 2006"," Aileen Wuornos, Misunderstood Homicidal Looney
","Monster, the life-story of murderous highway prostitute Aileen Wuornos, is the most disarming, sweet-natured movie about homicide you're ever going to see. The real Wuornos must've been the most abrasive, unpleasant person on the face of the earth, but in the hands of Patty Jenkins and Charlize Theron she's transformed into someone almost lovable, a sympathetic misfit who lets her dreams of prosperity carry her away. The naiveté of this conception is striking, and is the reason for the film's success as a personality piece.<br/><br/>What, anyway, would be the point of re-hashing all the tired Lecterian psycho-nonsense about serial killers? Most screenwriters fancy themselves experts on criminal pathology, but not Miss Patty, who views Wuornos' life not in psych 101 terms, but as an example of the warping of the American fabric. In the hands of Charlize Theron, an actress with a remarkable capacity for projecting toughness and vulnerability at the same time, Wuornos becomes a feminist anti-heroine, a Thelma or Louise with the gloves off. Wuornos kills because society has screwed her out of the good-life, and because the johns who become her victims are mostly rats.<br/><br/>It's astonishing how much crap the movie gets away with, and the credit goes largely to Charlize, who projects the radiance of a fallen angel through all her prosthetic make-up. The physical transformation is only the beginning of the performance; the ugly, life-battered surface of Wuornos is merely the shell of a soft, sensitive, gooey creature. Charlize has more than make-up, dirty hair and thirty pounds of evenly-distributed weight going for her; she digs down into her soul, as they might say on Inside the Actors' Studio, and dredges up a whole lifetime's worth of pain and disappointment, capturing the hard-bitten defensiveness of a sad little waif grown into a furiously insecure wretch.<br/><br/>The word ""pathos"" is unavoidable when describing a scene like the one where Wuornos, decked-out in a suit donated to Goodwill by David Byrne, tries to get a job at a law-firm, and lashes out at the smug jerk who rejects her for such trifling things as having no education or experience. This stuff works because Theron's freakishness is so convincing, and because she plays the anger on the verge of caricature. It's a performance that lives on the edge of being over-the-top, but stays heroically true to the sympathetic-naive-sociological conception. It's a hell of a thing, the way Theron pushes herself deeper and deeper into craziness, and never makes a fool of herself.<br/><br/>Patty Jenkins has a legitimate feel for the tackiness of everyday reality (Solondz used Air Supply in Happiness and it was mocking; Jenkins uses Steve Perry and it's exhilarating). She sees Wuornos as both perpetrator and victim, and sets her ugly existence against the general ugliness of modern life. She gets from Christina Ricci a capable complimentary performance built mainly out of looking directly at things with alien-lost-on-a-distant-planet eyes. Whatever else the movie is, it's a story about two lonely weirdos finding each other, a kind of odd-ball tragic love-story with overtones of social commentary. It's heartfelt liberal claptrap, a gutsier piece of feminist myth-making than the hypey Thelma and Louise, and a more compelling argument for mercy than the didactic Dead Man Walking."

","A great little film with a power-house central performance by Charlize Theron as Aileen Wuornos, one of America's female serial killers.<br/><br/>The film is essentially a love story, as Aileen meets and falls for Selby (Christina Ricci) - a young girl who is estranged from society and her immediate family. This infatuation takes place whilst Aileen is beginning to murder her victims and Selby seems to ignore any tell tale signs of the murders taking place - the film shows Aileen hiding this from Selby for most of their relationship. Making Selby an innocent party in this portrayal of the events.<br/><br/>Most Serial Killer flicks are driven by the killer being hunted by the detective, but Patty Jenkins (writer and director) moves away from this and progresses the movie by character development, emotional insight and empathy - it's a very female approach and works extremely well with this story. I think a male director may have taken a different slant with this subject matter, both in the character motivation and lesbian aspects of the movie, but Patty's approach softens these themes and lets the characters come through, but still leaving them interesting and slightly ambiguous.<br/><br/>Patty and Charlize have a lot of sympathy for Aileen and this shows in the screen treatment - even the title demonstrates this - here ""Monster"" refers to a Ferris Wheel and Aileen's fondest childhood memory, rather than the human ""Monster"" that she became. It's a brave move as a lot of the Genre's fans may be expecting a gore or chase movie, and this gives a very human portrayal of Aileen Wuornos, exploring a lot of her abusive back-ground and examining the potential inherent violence in prostitution. She also shows regret and reserve when the murders are not as a result of direct violence against her. The ""serial killer mythos"" is also de-glamorised in this instance, both in appearance (with Charlize Theron made up with a blotchy skin condition and shaved eye-brows) and in portrayal - Alieen is shown as a regular working woman trying to make life's circumstances work for her, not the cold-blooded reclusive ultra-intelligent sociopath from most of these flicks.<br/><br/>It's a sad little tale, and you feel that the cards were really stacked against Aileen, but there must be thousands of people in exactly the same circumstances who do not end up as serial murderers. Well worth a watch."

","The life of American serial killer Aileen Wuornos (tough as nails Oscar winner Charlize Theron) is the subject of this demented and dominant picture. Wuornos, a cheap Florida prostitute, is raped one night by one of her charges and is forced to kill him in self-defense. Something snaps though and the event turns her into a murderer who deems it necessary to kill other men who pay for her services. Also along for the crazed ride is a young girl (Christina Ricci) who seems to be the only beacon of light (and it flickers sporadically) and love (and although lovers, their relationship is strained to put it mildly) in the sordid mixture. Theron's risk here pays off huge dividends. The exotic beauty decided to go through a complete physical transformation that is both fascinating and admittedly a bit horrifying. Ricci seems out of place in the end, but honestly I think her character is meant to be that way from the start. ""Monster"" is a slap in the face that colors everything in oddly tinted shades that will leave you feeling numb and even confused. Though definitely not for all tastes, it is a movie that stands up and allows itself to be noticed and scrutinized. 4.5 out of 5 stars."

","Just to say that this is the perfect example where a good movie is good thanks to an astonishing individual performance. I think that Chalize Theron must have suffered some kind of violence to be able to act in that ""disturbing"" way. The academy award is the logic prize for a performance unique in his genre. Before this movie I liked her very much. After seeing Monster, I adore her and admire her talent. The physical transformation is startling and I was surprise by the dignity of Chalize in showing her wonderful body tortured by make up but also by some extra kilos and unnatural (for such a beauty) posture. During the movie you stop to think ""look at the power of the make up"" and you are forced to forget that there is a mask on her face. Morever, after 5 minutes you start inexorable to feel a growing pity for a girl that, considering that the movie is strictly based on a true story, has lived in a nightmare since she was 8 year old and has been unable to work it out, day after day simply for somebody to love and to be loved."

","The tag line dictates: Based on a true story. The small print at the end of this movie states something similar to this: While the movie is inspired by real events in A. Wuornos life, many characters are composites or inventions and a number of incidents in this film are fictional. Other than A.Wuornos, any similarity to any person is not intended and purely coincidental. <br/><br/>When going to the cinema, it's interesting seeing a film and not, at times, knowing anything about a movie, who is starring, its story line etc. <br/><br/>We chose Monster. We chose right.<br/><br/>As the ending credit's rolled up, we just sat there stunned. What an intense movie. Extremely well shot, I can't say this enough. With a great musical soundtrack that complements each scene as the character's come to a crossroads in their lives. <br/><br/>Written and Directed by Patty Jenkins, who has done an excellent job at bringing the sordid life of Aileen Wuornos, the unhappy victim of life's underclass, to the Big Screen. This film is brought together by a great team that star's Charlize Theron and Christina Ricci. <br/><br/>This self-pitying and self-destructive life of an uneducated working class woman who turns to prostitution as a form to earn money, who not only blames society for her position in life but is finally prepared to murder for the better life that she has always longed for. On the run with her very naive young lover, Selby Wall. Who is placing too many demands for the better life that unbeknown to her is a price too high. Finally, when the bubble bursts it is far too late to turn back, it is time to face their demons and ironically for the first time, for Wuornos be responsible for their actions and to grow up. <br/><br/>How much of this movie is true and factual I don't know, but as a movie that brings the emotions of loneliness, love, passion, anger, hate, friendship and hope together then it has succeed in every way possible. <br/><br/>Ms. Jenkins has done a great job in bringing the audience close to a woman who should be despised for her grudges and self-pity, we should not condone the killings and the poor victims and their families who are the only victims of this very sad individual. But as we all, as Human Beings, deserve life, love, happiness and respect, then there is a very tiny amount of empathy. Who has not suffered similar situations as Wuornos, not in these extremes, but life cannot be judged by false hopes that turn into grudges that you are willing to murder. She was wrong to murder but so very right about the real side of Human Nature, that also, ironically, she played a big part in herself. <br/><br/>This movie is a fantastic piece of work, through the writing, direction and the back up of a good crew. It rightly deserves the recognition of the Oscar. Well done to one and all."

","I had been so curious and intrigued by the reviews and critical acclaim of Theron's performance in, ""Monster"", so it wasn't strange this film was on my must-see-list. I finally watched it and needless to say I was indeed impressed by the performances by her and the entire cast. It was obvious from the start it was going to be definitely a ""Theron"" film, a lot was riding on her though; basically the entire weight of the movie. Winning an Academy Award proves the effort (physically and mentally) she put into this film.<br/><br/>The story of 'Monster' is from the viewpoint of Aileen Carol Wuornos; she's telling her side of the story. She comes from an abusive home and starts to sell herself (from a young age) for 'so-called' love. She's starved for love and affection and goes looking for it, the only way she knows how. Eventually it goes beyond this (after meeting and forming a relationship with a young girl named Selby). As always money takes over as the prime motivator. Having no other working skills to support herself and her new partner she continues to prostitute herself. Once caught up in such a life style it's so difficult to remove yourself from it, as Wuornos finds out. Incidents occur and she begins her reign of murder. In her mind she justifies these crimes, now she becomes the 'predator' and not the 'prey'. Whatever you have read or seen of the 'real' Wuornos, might help you to weigh up and compare notes towards this film. I've heard not all accounts contained are actually true, so don't base any opinions on what you see.<br/><br/>One aspect I thought was outstanding though; was the make-upabsolutely incredible. The make-up artists were 'spot on' creating Theron to resemble Wuornos, all credit to them.<br/><br/>This film (to me) was indeed 'depressing'..no escape from one's past, no hope of a future, only hopelessness. 8/10"

","Roger Ebert writes, ""This is the greatest performance in the history of the cinema."" I could not agree with him more. What Charlize Theron accomplishes here is absolutely astounding.<br/><br/>Monster is a look at Aileen Wourouse (Spelling) whose claim to fame is that she is the first female serial killer. This movie is not about the killings and her running from the cops or how she is captured. This movie is much more than that. This is a movie that delves deep into a serial killers mind. This is a movie about love, believe it or not.<br/><br/>Is it possible to feel sympathy for a serial killer? Watch Theron's portrayal of Aileen and I guarantee you that you will. The relationship between Aileen and Selby (portrayed wonderfully by Christina Ricci) is great and what we see is someone who wants more than anything in the world to just hold on to the one thing that makes sense. If that means killing people to please her ""girlfriend"" then she will do it.<br/><br/>What an amazing movie this is. An amazing amazing amazing performance by Charlize Theron. She deserved every ounce of that Oscar.<br/><br/>Highly recommend."

","This is a very glum and depressing movie. But it makes you realize even more that you don't have to judge anyone. We all have reasons, and most of us, very good reasons for acting the way we do. And more, there are circumstances in our lives that we can face or not, depending on the level of self trust at that time. Charlize's character - Aileen- had a rough childhood deprived of warm feelings, good words and right guidance. And that made her the way she was, lonely, bitter and with no reason to go on living. That is until she mets Ricci's character - Selby. I wonder if the situation would have ended differently if Selby assumed some of the responsibilities of the couple herself. But that couldn't have happened cause she was just a child that needed to have fun without any complications. The actors performance is remarkable and the atmosphere is build in the most appropriate way, making it uncomfortable but also deep and tormenting."

","as played by Charlize Theron; that is how you know a good film has been produced, without the usual stereotypes and violence.<br/><br/>When we do see violence, it is depicted realistically. For example, when Aileen Wuornos is raped. It seems that she initially kills for self-defense; she is basically working as a prostitute on the main highways in Florida, so that she can survive.<br/><br/>Sadly touching is when she tries to apply for a job in a law office: while she has no skills, she tries to straighten out her life, to no avail. It is shown how society fosters the demise of those without any resources; she has no one to help her; and is also taken advantage of by a local police officer.<br/><br/>Another pivotal scene is when Christina Ricci is arguing with her aunt; Christina plays Ty (pseudonym Selby, in the movie), Wuornos' friend. Her aunt lectures ...""these people can't be helped... or we'd all go 'round killing' people or doing drugs just cause we had a mean mom""... She also says they would all be better if they ...""found the light"".... This accurately reflects society's denial and judgmental attitude when it comes to any rehabilitation or nature/nurture debates.<br/><br/>It is easier for society to blame the individual, Aileen Wuornos, than to examine the psychological cause and effect of her upbringing; it is a fact that she was raped by her own father as a child, and her mother abandoned her to the streets at age 13 when she was impregnated. Many of these facts would have been worth exploring (For example, how does her mother live with herself, now), but perhaps the length and flow of the film was a factor.<br/><br/>I hope that we see another film with similar subject matter in the near future!. Aileen Wuornos was executed, and society helped her get there. This is not simply a ""liberal"" viewpoint; it is a humane point of view."

","Crouched by the freeway like a weary bird of prey, Aileen Wuornos (Theron) looks back on her miserable life and contemplates suicide. A meeting with direction-less teenage lesbian Selby (Ricci) convinces her to give life another shot – until she's raped and half-killed by a john, who she shoots in self-defence. Like some feminist Robin Hood (the point's rammed home explicitly), she's soon killing and robbing her sleazier clients to support her girlfriend. Then she begins to gun down innocent parties. Lost in the zone, she hurtles inexorably toward tragedy. <br/><br/>Almost every appraisal of writer-director Jenkins' film has latched onto Theron's unlovely prosthetic, serving to objectify both Theron and Wuronos, and unconsciously mirroring the kind of misogyny Aileen faced daily. Truthfully, she's less ugly than plain – yet the camera seems to 'hate' her too, continually picking over her cornbread complexion and tombstone-teeth. 'I always wanted to be in the movies' Wuronos muses over the opening, and Jenkins pieced her plot together from a series of correspondences with the Death Row inmate herself – not the most reliable source, perhaps, when attempting to tell the 'true' story; documentary-maker Nick Broomfield's already made much of the inconsistencies surrounding the case, and it would have been better to show how the hooker-turned-serial killer became so brutalised in the first place. <br/><br/>If Theron's undoubtedly punishing role, all nervous tics and bravado swagger, results in a skilled impersonation, it's Ricci who neatly steals the movie from under her nose with a subtly-layered performance of quiet depths. But ultimately what remains is a particularly earnest form of Trash-ploitation."
"jmc_automatic","Null","0","0","3 September 2004"," A missed opportunity
","As a portrait of Aileen Wuornos, ""Monster"" is an ambitious but hugely flawed film. Writer-Director Patty Jenkins' desire to romanticise rather than demonise her protagonist is an admirable one, but in doing so she skates over a key element of Wuornos's character: her mental illness. Watch Nick Broomfield's documentaries on Wuornos and you'll find a far more complex and troubling character than Jenkins seems able to portray, and one which haunts the memory for much longer.<br/><br/>""Monster"" seems torn between being both a love story and a psychological character study and, as such, Jenkins never quite captures the evilness of many of the crimes committed. Yes, Wuornos was undoubtedly a victim, but to hold this as rational justification for what were often irrational acts is a dangerously reductive strategy. It doesn't help that Christina Ricci's performance as Selby only occasionally convinces and the film's soft-rock score is often grossly inappropriate (particularly in the closing scenes), both of which only lend a glossy sheen to the proceedings which threatens to drown out many of the ambiguities evident in the material. Consequently, the film is always watchable but carries a nagging sensation that this is a very slight representation of a multifaceted individual.<br/><br/>That all said, the film's major plus-point is the central performance of an unrecognisable Charlize Theron. Like Halle Berry in ""Monster's Ball"" before her, Theron continues the tradition of the Oscars rewarding great turns in average movies with a performance that is truly astonishing. Inhabiting the character of Wuornos in both body and soul, every physical and verbal mannerism is so accurate, so meticulously executed and so inherently rooted in the character's internal psychology that for 100 minutes you genuinely forget that you are watching an actress at work. Her performance is so impressive that it elevates what is otherwise a rather sanitised biopic ever-so-slightly above the norm."

Not once was there a hint of the breathtakingly beautiful, woman that has graced so many other movies. She actually became this extremely tortured soul. Much like ""Dead Man Walking"", ""Monster's Ball"" and ""Leaving Las Vegas"", this was a movie I hesitated to watch. When I did see it I was drawn into the pain and chaos of the characters lives. It did not seem overly sentimental or slanted to make me sympathize with the situation. As various aspects of the characters background was revealed it became clear that these were people desperate to have a little happiness in their lives regardless of what has happened to them in the past or the cost to themselves or others. My heart goes out to the victims and their families. This includes everyone who was involved in this tragic situation, for everyone was a victim in this movie."

","When the movie ""Monster"" came out last year, I was actually living in the Orlando/Daytona Beach area of Florida. As a result, even before the Oscar nomination for Charlize Theron, the film had received a fair amount of press, though it was hearing the nomination that made me go to the Universal Cineplex and see the film for myself. I had no prior knowledge of the backstory of the real Aileen Wornous (having only moved to Florida a few months prior)<br/><br/>The performances by Theron and Ricci really made the movie a gripping, suspenseful, tragic, and dare I say enjoyable experience. Prior to this film, I did not have a lot of respect for Charlize Theron (remember ""Mighty Joe Young"" and ""Sweet November""?) But seeing her transform so much in appearance and personality really made me grow respect for her as an actress. I felt she had turned around a bit in ""The Cider House Rules"" and ""The Italian Job"", but this really put her in my favor.<br/><br/>However, I felt a little indignant after hearing that Theron was (deservadly) nominated for best actress, Christina Ricci was snubbed. I think that her performance was a great naive, lonely counterpart to Theron's jaded rage. Like Theron, I think she took the part she was given and totally expanded it and made it her own.<br/><br/>The few drawbacks I have to say for the film, are that it got a little grating to see tragedy after tragedy hit Aileen. That got a little depressing to watch. Also, that Selby on a dime switched from being unknowing partner to conspirator to turncoat made her a little unlikeable, but other then that, great direction and score! The music was some of the best I'd heard in a movie in a long time.<br/><br/>8/10 from me! Bravo Charlize, Christina and Patty"

","Monster (2003) C-109 min. D: Patty Jenkins. Charlize Theron, Christina Ricci, Bruce Dern, Lee Tergesen, Annie Corley, Pruitt Taylor Vince, Marco St. John, Marc Macaulay, Scott Wilson. Theron delivers perhaps the greatest performance by a lead actress ever, playing female prostitute/serial killer Aileen Wuornos, executed in 2002 for murdering seven men in 1989. Ricci also hits home as her lesbian lover Selby. The murders are gruesome and disturbing, especially the last murder that is extremely hard to watch, as Aileen murders a man who simply wants to help her. Highly recommended, though not for the squeamish (or close-minded). The film does a good job of not excusing Aileen's behavior, instead just serving as an explanation of how a human being could turn into someone so cold, heartless, and devoid of any redeemable qualities whatsoever. It's a beautiful, sad masterpiece of film-making. RATING: 9 out of 10. Rated R for violence, profanity, sexual situations, nudity."

","Although it's about a serial killer, ""Monster"" isn't devoted to Aileen Wuornos' killings; it's more about the relationship between her and her sheltered-at-first girlfriend Selby. In other words, this is more about a woman who becomes a killer than a killer, full stop.<br/><br/>Characterization notwithstanding, Patty Jenkins' movie won't be mistaken for a propaganda piece; it doesn't try and make her an understandable killer (except in the first case), but simply lets us make up our own minds about her. As laid out through Jenkins' script and acted by Charlize Theron, she's hard to take as a human being; foul-mouthed, desperate, hard to control, but also sad and thoughtful - compare her on-screen behaviour to her more measured and introspective voice-over narration, showing the woman inside that no one other than Selby gets close to seeing on screen.<br/><br/>In fact, ""Monster"" is more or less a two-hander; everyone in the movie other than Theron and a cast-against-type Christina Ricci as Selby is almost a cameo, particularly Pruitt Taylor Vince as one of Aileen's customers. Apparently a lot of people only noticed Charlize Theron's ability to act because of this movie; some of us came to that conclusion a while back (back in 1997, in fact, when she almost singlehandedly redeemed ""The Devil's Advocate""). She may be buried under makeup effects, but it's her doing the emoting, not the looks - this is not the Charlize Theron from ""Mighty Joe Young"" or ""Reindeer Games"" (although like the latter, ""Monster"" takes advantage of her being one of today's most nudity-friendly performers). Both she and Ricci deliver powerful performances which carry the movie, though its point of view helps; it's grimy for sure, and generally depressing from the opening - setting up her life as a prostitute from when she was a teenager - but no one should go into this expecting a cheerful two hours.<br/><br/>""Monster"" isn't really exploitative (even the love scene between the two leads isn't that graphic), and it's a good watch all round... but in the end, somehow you can't really feel as much for the MOVIE as for its lead characters. It's still worth seeing, however, and it's an eye-opener both for non-Theron fans and for those who want some kind of idea as to what makes a person do the things they do - both in the case of Aileen and in the case of Selby."

Her performance is truly spectacular as it doesn't appear that she is acting -- she becomes Aileen in every sense.  <br/><br/>The movie moves at a good pace, but I would change the beginning and spend a little more time showing Aileen's upbringing and the fact that her father was a child molester.  It was also rumored that Aileen had an incestuous relationship with her brother and that he was possibly the father of the baby she had when she was just 14.  And Aileen was not just a prostitute. In her real life, she was guilty of numerous solitary crimes including theft and aggravated assault.  I believe that these skipped events set an early stage for Aileen's eventual demise.  Aileen started out troubled and lacking self control and self worth.  It was only a matter of time before she exploded.<br/><br/>Although some viewers may criticize the apparently light relationship between Aileen and Selby, I think it was realistic.

Perhaps it's because I'm a sucker for stories that truly celebrate love, but this film gutted me. While the story is unconventional, it's not irrational. The love, more than the romance, between Theron's Wournos and Ricci's Wall is towering. The movie grabs you and pins you down, showing you pure desperation and madness, intertwined with adoration and the desire to be loved, which is the world's single most powerful emotion.

It's not the murder scenes or the graphic sexuality, which are not for the faint of heart, that make this film so rough, but the open and grand presentation of desperate love. <br/><br/>This one is worth more than its weight in platinum."

","Charlize Theron's tour de force performance highlights this gripping true story of Aileen Wuornos, a hardened street hooker who became an infamous serial killer during the late 1980s and early 90s by murdering her clients along the Florida highway, though most of the emphasis is placed on the relationship between Wuornos and her naive young lover Selby Wall (Ricci). Extremely dark, often tragic, at times unbearable story explores the violent and graphic depths of a life gone wrong, but it's well told and acted with conviction.

","A film I recently saw was ""Monster."" It is based on a true story about a serial killer named Aillen Wuornos (Charlize Theron). Wuornos past involves an abusive childhood. At an early age, Wuornos becomes a hooker at truck stops in Florida to escape her life. While at a gay bar, she meets a woman named Selby (Christina Ricci), who later becomes her lover. Selby and Aileen decide to live together and Selby's family disowns her because she comes from a strong religious background. This movie is about the journeys that Aileen and Selby experience together. One night at her job, Wuornos experienced something horrible that made her inner demons come to life. Her demons are 'John's' that she encounters.<br/><br/>Director Patty Jenkins was trying to show a true story that many people do not know of. Headlines, like what happened with Wuornos, does not happen every day and I believe the movie was trying to express what Wuornos was going though. The director was trying to show the life of a female who has had a horrible childhood that turns to a life on the streets. Also, the director was showing the audience how hard it is for society back in the 1980s to accept a person who is a homosexual. The director accomplishment was showing the audience what Aileen experienced in her life.<br/><br/>At the start of the movie, it shows a girl growing up through different situations. The screen looks like they are playing it from a home movie, so that way the audience can tell it was from the past. Also, in the background there is an older, more rasper voice which gives the audience another hint that it is from the past. I liked whenever Aileen was with a 'John,' and her past flashback to her."

","I read the featured review for this film and I found it to be grossly over critical and unfair. While I agree that the film shows Aileen in a victim's light, I am not convinced that this perspective is entirely unfactual. I did not know Aileen, but I find the film plausible and I guess part of me wants to believe that someone who did all those murders was doing them with the kind of rationale that was hypothesized in this movie. It makes the acts almost understandable that way.<br/><br/>At any rate, the story that the film does tell was deeply moving and powerful. I think that critics forget that a film says, ""based"" on a true story for a reason. It is not always the intention or responsibility of the director/artists to deliver the complete real story. A film like this is art, and it presents itself that way. Therefore, I think it can be seen as an important story about the human condition (regardless of actual events or facts) -love, acceptance and survival.<br/><br/>There are only three adequate words for Charlize Theron's performance -""OH MY GOD!"" I didn't even realize who she was until the movie was almost over. I haven't seen footage of the real Aileen, so I won't evaluate the likeness or lack thereof achieved by Theron. All I can say is, I haven't seen acting that good since Cecily Tyson did Ms. Jane Pittman 20+ years ago (with the exception of maybe Pacino in Scarface, and Kingsley in Ghandi). Theron put herself in a completely different category of acting when she delivered this performance, which was absolutely unforgettable and truly scary. I was totally absorbed in her character,. The emotional depth and complexity she brought was off the charts! This film DOES NOT LACK FOCUS (as the featured reviewer claims), Theron does not overdo it, and there was plenty of stuff going on that moved the film along.<br/><br/>This film will stay with me for many years. It affected me deeply, and personally as a human being to be taken to a world of such pain, loneliness and hopelessness. I think its greatest achievement was that it strongly reminds us of how important real love is.<br/><br/>A++++++++++ Charlize and Patty. EXCELLENT JOB! You GO GIRLS!!!!!!!!!"

I knew she was gonna say something as everybody does; and that wasn't of some great interest to me. But when I heard her speech I just got my eyes pointed to the TV screen and thought ""what the hell""! ""This lady is a South African and just got the Oscar"". Till then I didn't know that Charlize Theron was a South African. Her speech turned me on so much that I'll never ever forget those moments when she expressed her deepest feelings about South Africa and South African cricket team. I instantly took the decision, went out and collected the movie 'Monster'. And after watching the movie, a whole new chapter to my movie interest was disclosed. Charlize Theron absolutely dominated in the movie with her strong performance. It was obviously one of the greatest performance. No doubt about that.

I came away feeling nothing but disgust for her, and little sympathy even for the pathetic little wretch who went along for the ride, so I think the direction of this film was pretty even-handed if so many can take away different perspectives -- probably stemming from intellectual baggage we brought with us.<br/><br/>For me, this film is just another example of why the death penalty serves a useful social purpose.

","I wanted to watch this movie twice but could not get through it the second time. It's morbid and it's very depersonalizing. It's depressing and it's scary. It brings up so many questions. Was Aileen a ""victim"" that defended herself, or was she a cold-blooded killer? I still don't know which is the truth. Charlize Theron gave the performance of a life-time in portraying Aileen Wournos, the first ""so-called"" serial killer of her time. I watched ""Monster"" with the eyes of a detective, searching for the beautiful movie star Charlize Theron in the character of Aileen and failed to find her. She was that convincing. The weight gain was significant but more detailed was the way her mouth so vividly moved as Aileen's did and they eyes that seemed to me, to be fearful of everything.I will admit that I cried. I saw Aileen's trial and interviews on death row about 3 months ago on Court TV and when I watched ""Monster"" recently, I saw Aileen, not Charlize Theron. The movie was gritty, dark and it opened more questions for me than closed them. Was Aileen a victim of circumstances? This is a woman who never knew what love was, was never loved, was on her own from age 13 until her execution in Florida in 2002. Yes, I have sympathy for Aileen. I have sympathy too for those she killed with the exception of two that were in the movie which does say at the end that ""some of the people and incidences were ""created"" for the movie and not meant to imply an actual person."" I saw, in this movie, a woman who was lost in the system, unwanted, unloved, a rape victim, a struggler who was trying to survive despite society rejecting her and turning away from her; a woman who was violently raped, and yes, prostitutes get raped, who killed the man who was going to kill her after torturing her. It was traumatizing to watch. In the movie, I saw a woman struggling to be accepted by anyone anywhere and I saw everyone fail her and toss her aside. When she went to get work and used honesty to help herself and was rejected, the attorney who made fun of her in his office for applying for a job, these were incidents of her being ""failed"" by cruelty. I felt sorrow for Aileen. I wished someone would help her, show her some humanity, show her basic kindness, but it didn't happen. She seemed to be aware of her terrible life, of not fitting in, of not being what society deems normal, of living on the fringes. In the beginning of the movie, she is contemplating suicide when she goes to spend her last five dollars and meets Selbie. Aileen had a keen awareness of how she appeared to others and...she had a wisp of optimism for a better life. Selbie gets no sympathy from me. Christina Ricci did an excellent job of portraying the lesbian lover as a ""user"" and then turned on her to save her own neck. Aiding and abetting. <br/><br/>No actor has ever turned in a more grueling, life-changing portrayal of a real person and a true story as realistically as Charlize Theron. ""Monster"" will bring out either the worse in the viewer or a lot of compassion, depending on how they ""see"" Aileen. )***SPOILER***) Was she a victim as she proclaimed in the court room when sentenced to death, yelling at the judge ""You're sending a raped woman to death!""? or was Aileen lacking in conscience and of morals, a true lost cause? If she was a lost cause, was it after she was raped or before? It's a thin line to walk when viewing a life so far removed from anything familiar in your own. <br/><br/>Charlize Theron earned her Oscar. She had to walk in Aileen's shoes and be Aileen- and if it horrifies us to just watch it, imagine the emotions Charlize when through to put it ""out there"" for us to see. In the end, a horrific movie about a woman who we may never know the real truth about except for knowing she lived. And she died by execution. In this disturbing, vivid portrayal of a woman called the ""the first female serial killer of our time"", Theron defined ""acting"" and I haven't seen anyone come close to her in sinking their entire being into a role as difficult as this one had to be."

","""Monster"" is a great film almost entirely carried by its lead actress, Charlize Theron, who delivers one of the most superb, convincing, honest performances in the history of cinema. I have seen Theron in other films, and acknowledge that in reality, she is even a rare beauty. Yet seeing this film, I did not imagine for one second that she was anything else but this fascinating, unique character. Theron manages to captivate us with this seemingly contemptible, hideous ""monster"" (as the title suggests) and take us into Wuornos' world of frustration, confusion, delirium, and desparation. We learn that Aileen Wuornos was not born an infamous, heartless serial killer, but that she once had other aspirations in life, sabotaged by a very unfortunate series of events, particularly in her childhood. Through Theron's compelling deliverance, we discover the painful misery, as well as shades of happiness and hope, in this tortured woman, so afflicted from life and never really given a chance to succeed as anything else than a ""nobody"" prostitute on the brink of collapse. Wuornos, without seeking, befriends Selby, with whom she will develop a relationship which will be the culmination and happiness of her life. We realize that Wuornos' horrible crimes can never be reasoned or excused, for they are truly monstrous. This film, however, essentially through the understanding conviction of Charlize Theron, provides us with perhaps an explanation of how Aileen Wuornos came to despise the world and commit a series of perfunctory and brutal murders which would ultimately be her demise. Or perhaps the demise of Wuornos was life itself, which never gave Wuornos a rightful place in the world. Compelling and devastating film. **** out of ****"

She did earn the Oscar at all, giving a great performance and playing perfectly the part of a gal plagued since the childhood by every sort of disgrace. You see Theron slowly turning into a psychopath, unable to control any action; the movie doesn't justify her, obviously, but helps the audience to reason and wonder how a killer may be born. Cristina Ricci is also believable in her role and makes a great couple with the leading actress. I figure the movie is worth seeing but under the expectations; what makes it different than other pictures is the way it tells about a serial killer tale. You see the parallel world created by the killer and her girl-friend but nothing of the police investigations and almost nothing about the trial."

","I'd have to say, with all respect to everybody involved in the real events, that this is absolutely the ""best"" real serial killer movie I've seen so far. I guess there are only two which come close to this: ""Ed Gein - In the light of the moon"" and ""John Wayne Gacey - To catch a killer"".<br/><br/>The performance of the lead actress and also the close resemblance to the real person was so freaking stunning that, had I not looked up her movie history on this site, I'd have believed she'd be the real Aileen Wuornos!!! And I mean that and what I think you should know: I am extremely peckish about saying things like that! Absolutely stunning performance! Did she ever get an Oscar for that role? Well she sure deserved one!<br/><br/>However, I am not all to sure about the accuracy of most of the dialogs and such. But thats mainly because obviously I don't know where the movie makers got all that information from. But who knows, maybe Mrs. Wuornos told that stuff to somebody while she was on death row. But whatever, I really have to say that whatever the details of all the conversations might have been in real life, they sure braught you a lot of insight about the person and what made her tick... or not tick. The only scene I can clearly point out to be inaccurate was the arrest. Because not only obviously, but also factually, was it never the undercover cops which got her arrested! They were only there to keep her in place and check her out in case she'd slip up and say something about the murders. So when the arrest was underway the undercover policemen were arrested just like her, to keep the cover up! She never said anything about the murders, so the police coudn't completely prove it was her, until they got her girlfriend to agree to the staged phonecall you see in the end. After that she told the police herself and confessed to the murders.<br/><br/>I would also have expected Wuornos to be a bit easier to get much more angry, but I wouldn't know if my image of that is correct. Anyway, seeing this movie made me almost feel sorry for her. I'd twice previously watched the discovery program about her. In that program it was much easier to identify her as some kind of psychological freak, but on the other hand was that documentary seen out of the polices viewpoint, not really from hers. I'm not saying that I understand any of her actions, but it's just that through the movie at least I can feel some sympathy for the reasons why she was so screwed up.<br/><br/>I have to say this again - and Mrs. Theron if, by any chance, you're reading this... your performance was absolutely mind blasting!<br/><br/>I'd be more than surprised if she just played that part out of her sleeve so to speak! I'd much rather believe that she really put herself into Wuornos shoes, trying to be her even off set (at least partially and only mentally of course), because that is the only way I'd understand why she played her part so well!<br/><br/>A well deserved 9/10"

One day in a bar she stumples across the young and insecure Selby. Selby is what Aileen was in her young life too, a lost soul. In Selby, Aileen finds love, her soul mate, her force to continue life, but things get complicated when she is forced to take care of Selby and her heart can not make her life the life she lived before Selby came along, after being raped, she kills her first victim, and her hate for men grows.<br/><br/>Considering that this movie is based upon a true story, naturally we know the end from the start. The story doesn't bring much new to the genre, everything it as it should be, the strength of the movie is the absolutely terrific portrait of Aileen, given by Charlize Theron. What a triumph this is for Theron, her absolute breakthrough, it's almost sad that she will never be able to play a character this well again, this is near perfection, and it gives the movie all the heart and soul it has, Charlize Theron simply is Monster!<br/><br/>Both direction and supporting roles are average of this movie, it's at times rather obvious that the director ain't the most experienced one, sometimes the storytelling slows too much down and makes for some rather boring moments, but overall it works pretty well, but again, it's mostly thank to Charlize Theron. However Christina Ricci also gives a good performance, a performance that is strongest in the start while she is very insecure, her first entrance in the movie, the scene in the bar, that's the best moment for Ricci in this movie.<br/><br/>Basically, this movie works good because Charlize Theron gives a performance that will make the audience feel her pain, without feeling that pain, this would have been just another movie, but in the end you can really feel the anger, the confusion, the sorrow. Everything she is feeling, i can't praise her performance enough, i thought Watts should have won the oscar, but now i understand why Theron got it, she is the heart and soul of an entire movie.<br/><br/>7/10"

And, in light of this film's debt to Malick's classic take on the Charlie Starkweather case, it's more than a little unfair that Christina Ricci has taken some criticism for the low-key nature of her performance.  Her character here is basically Sissy Spacek's from ""Badlands,"" repainted as a half-closeted lesbian.  Heck, Ricci's character here doesn't even get to narrate the story.

Initially, when she won the Oscar, I was a bit cheesed off as Naomi Watts is my favourite actress and I didn't see how anyone could beat her performance in '21 Grams'. OK. I was wrong. Theron's performance is awesome, even taking account of the completely altered appearance. Christina Ricci, who I adore, seemed somewhat dumbstruck (which she's good at anyway - witness her semi-wordless role in 'The Man Who Cried', an underrated movie)in the company of Theron's 'monster'. I really believe, watching Ricci closely (as I always do!), that the camera captures her actually admiring her co-star's acting during their many scenes together. It is almost as if she cannot believe that it is Charlize Theron opposite her, acting as if her life depended on it. Ultimately, CR's performance is somewhat marred and overshadowed by this awe of her co-star. It doesn't matter, though, because she does her job as the easily manipulated and unwitting ally in the unfolding of events. The film does not glamorise proceedings. It is as gritty as '21 Grams' without its tricks of confused chronology. I liked it, even though most of the audience grimaced in their seats. Not as depressing as '21 Grams' in spite of the subject matter.  Simple direction and story-telling perfectly recreates the seediness of the story. I hadn't realised that the woman was now dead. I assumed she would be considered ill, but maybe that doesn't alter the American system...Now, would Charlize please go back to being glamorous and leave Naomi to take over for the next few Oscars.

","Charlize Theron and Christina Ricci excel in their respective roles as serial killer Aileen Wuornos and her lover in director/writer Patty Jenkins' imagining of the circumstances that would drive Wuornos to commit the murders of seven Florida men (most of them thinking they were picking up a streetwalker). Jenkins' theories are all over the map and include pretty much the garden variety of possibilities (Wuornos' abuse as a child, her lack of education precluding her getting reasonable employment, her brutal rape at the hands of her first victim, etc.) but, fortunately, she's less interested in dwelling on her sociological positions than in letting her performers dissolve into their characters. Theron, in particular, is stunning: she seems to connect with Wuornos in a primal, subconscious manner and you get the feeling Theron is living the part, not merely acting it. Always an intriguing performer (she was quite good in `The Devil's Advocate'), here she refuses to hide behind her sun-scarred makeup and weight gain and succeeds in letting emerge Wuornos' entire personality rather than simply her barbaric need for revenge. Ricci is also excellent, as usual, smoothly underplaying a role that could have easily evolved into a histrionic attempt to capture the picture; like Theron, she seems attracted to the darker side of her nature but is able to use her complex powers of suggestion for definition rather than signal her conflicts. Together, the performances lift `Monster' above its overall routine disposition (though there is some nice late-afternoon cinematography by Steven Bernstein and the font used by Elton Garcia in the title, the same one used for Marlboro cigarettes, is a nice touch). With Bruce Dern as Wuornos' homeless ally and Pruitt Taylor Vince as the pathetic stuttering john intended by Jenkins to emblemize Wuornos' misguided compassion."

There is also her partner / lover, Selby, a lesbian, and she is not directly involved with these murders. Throughout the movie we see Aileen's ups and downs, and we get some voice over from her, describing different events in her life. This builds up a psych profile of her, so we can see the reasons behind her violent actions. In the movie, the murders slide from justified to reprehensible, I think this simplifies her character.<br/><br/>The character I don't understand is Selby, the movie doesn't explain her actions, but putting it down to child's immaturity doesn't seem right.

But regardless of the level of acting or directing, I think this movie deserves the recognition it has received. Some may criticize this as being over-the-top shock value.  But the shock value is needed to tell a story such as this one.  Many of us sitting at home with our big screen T.Vs and computers have never experienced a day of hardship.  We can criticize and look down upon all the ""low-lives"" out there, but most of us don't fully understand the the dirt on their faces, or the shame in their eyes.

But how much does it cost to have compassion? To have compassion is to first understand.  And I think this movie lifts up the rug under which we often sweep the ""dirt"" of our society.

","Charlize Theron gives one of the most brilliant performances of a lifetime. So brilliant in fact that if she continues to be a successful actress by choosing the right roles then she will never top this.  This is her masterpiece.<br/><br/>Based on a true story, Aileen Wuornos is a woman who was executed in Florida in 2002 for murdering several men while she worked as a prostitute. Wuornos had real problems in life.  Abused as a child, discarded by her siblings and friends and other family as well as never finding success in life drove her insane enough to become a serial killer.<br/><br/>The first time she kills someone in the film is when she is raped by her john.  She is bound and gagged but breaks free and then kills the man by shooting him.  After the initial shock passes, she finds killing easier and easier.  Befriended by  a young lesbian (Christina Ricci), she drags the young girl into this life with her.  Ricci's character never kills anyone but she knows what Wuornos is up to and is either too scared to report her or too sympathetic towards Wuornos' mixed up and miserable life.<br/><br/>Theron's performance is so authentic and so good that it is just chilling. I left the theatre shaken up and that hasn't happened to me in a very long time.  Dare I say it is up there with the great female performances of the last 15 years alongside Jodie Foster in 'The Silence of the Lambs', Frances McDormand in 'Fargo' and Hilary Swank in 'Boys Don't Cry'.

","""Monster"" follows the downward spiral of street person/prostitute/serial killer Aileen Wuornos.  It's a bleak story, to be sure, but it's told with such compassion and it's so remarkably free of pathos that the film is thoroughly engrossing.  From the start we sense that Aileen and her younger lesbian girlfriend are doomed - a sense of dread hangs over the characters. It may be the same kind of foreboding that we felt with ""Boys Don't Cry"".<br/><br/>Most of the comments are, of course, about the gorgeous Charlize Theron transforming herself completely into this character.  It is astonishing, to be sure.  But it's not simply a case of an actor gaining weight for a role; Theron delivers a startling performance; she has dug deep into this character and you can feel the layers to this woman.  In ""Raging Bulls"" Robert DeNiro went through a similar, physical transformation but what was the point?  It seemed to be an exercise for its own sake because his Jake LaMotta was beyond redemption - simply a brute - and it left us asking why should anyone glorify this character with a film.<br/><br/>Theron delves deep into her character too but achieves sympathy.<br/><br/>Not enough comments remark on the stunning achievement by first-time Writer-Director Patty Jenkins.  She has delivered a superb film with a sure and steady hand. Bravo!"

","If ever there was an example of how society can miserably and devastatingly fail a person, Aileen Wuornos is it. Raped by age 8, pregnant by 13, hooking by 13, and eventually becoming the first noted female serial killer, her life was one nightmare after another. Of course, this in no way excuses her actions; she deserved the punishment she was given for the 7 slayings, but it makes you wonder...what if someone had intervened way back when? What if someone had given her a chance when she tried to go straight? Would so many have died? We may never know, but what is for sure is that Charlize Theron's portrayl of Wuornos in ""Monster"" is so chilling, so dead-on (pardon the pun,) and so shockingly believeable that when it was all over, I had tears in my eyes. I saw the film yesterday, and it's still resinating with me. I went home and popped in my Journey CD and listened to ""Don't Stop Believin',"" absorbing it all again. It's not just that she put on 30 pounds, fake teeth, and some special make-up. She WAS Aileen, down to her foul mouth and body language. I saw no hint of the glamourous Charlize I've come to know and like over the years. This was not just great acting...this was a total transformation. She pretty much blows Christina Ricci (Selby, her lesbian lover) off the screen most of the time. Wuornos is damaged by life, full of hatred and rage, but still capable (although barely) of love, however warped it may be. Theron brings humanity to the 'monster' as well, and although there is no excuse for her actions, Theron makes us feel slight compassion for her at times. This is no small feat, and Theron is absolutely brilliant. She got the Golden Globe and SAG Award for Best Actress for ""Monster;"" come Oscar night, if her name is not announced as the winner for Best Actress, then THAT will be a crime in and of itself."

","I am of course lying. This movie is about as charming as a cockroach in your pudding cup. Monster is a tale of abuse, addiction, murder and codependent lesbian love. I don't think your mother would approve of this movie.<br/><br/>So, what does Mom know? Monster is not a happy movie; there is no uplifting message buried in this screenplay. In Monster, the downtrodden stay down, the villains don't always get their comeuppance and innocence is no protection against evil. You won't leave the theater with a warm glow or a spring in your step but you won't leave feeling like you wasted $9, either. Monster tells a gritty, harsh, depressing and dark story. Monster also happens to be a very good movie.<br/><br/>Monster's central character is both hero and villain. Into her life comes the one thing that can make it worth living, again: love. Sadly, our hero-villain's life has already twisted her beyond repair and she chooses some rather unorthodox methods of keeping her new affair from falling apart. I won't waste many more words describing this movie's content. Suffice it to say that love really can make people do strange things.<br/><br/>I found Monster to be deeply moving. Most screenplays that involve homosexuality tend to caricature either the relationship or its participants. I think that Monster handled the issue very well with both Aileen and Selby displaying real human emotions and reactions. In the early stages of Aileen's relationship with Selby, the passion is intense and easily felt by the audience. Charlize Theron delivers an astounding performance that leaves no room for doubt about her skill as an actress and Christina Ricci's Selby is very believable as the selfish insecure center of Aileen's new life. Both performances are suitably powerful. As with other films of its type, I do think Monster falls into the trap of trying to make the main character more sympathetic than she deserves but it's nearly impossible to not feel empathy for Aileen.<br/><br/>If for no other reason, I recommend Monster because it is unlike most other movies you will see. The movie industry cranks out a lot of raw footage of film every year but most of it falls easily into one of the handful of formulae we are used to seeing. Monster is not entirely immune to this formulaic style of moviemaking but enough of it is uniquely Monster that you won't find yourself thinking, ""I've seen this movie a dozen times already."" I think that's a Very Good Thing.<br/><br/>Monster: 8/10"

It is quite simply one of the most astonishing pieces of acting that any of us mere mortals will ever witness. I cannot speak for the authenticity of this performance, but I can say that she managed to turn a character that I went into the film expecting to hate into one of the most sympathetic souls that I have ever seen. Ricci does an admirable job of playing second fiddle here. (I swear, you can almost see it in her face that she knew that Theron was turning in one of the best performances ever here.) I don't know how well the average moviegoer will appreciate this film, but for those of you who are interested in seeing one of the best realized, and most engaging, tragedies this side of Shakespeare, you are in luck. ""Monster"" is  smart, sad and sometimes humorous. It doesn't make the mistake of attempting to make the audience agree with every decision the primary character makes.

","Monster can only be described as a powerful piece of cinema.<br/><br/>It follows the life of one troubled woman, Aileen `Lee' Wuornos (played by Charlize Theron), the real life serial killer who made headlines in the 1980's. The movie shows you the last years of freedom she endured, following her relationship with Selby (Christina Ricci), a young lesbian who was in desperate need of a friend. The movie is told by the point of view of Aileen, which allows you to sympathize with the killer.<br/><br/>The performance delivered by Charlize Theron was so believable, you forgot that behind this ugly sun-spotted face there is a beautiful, talented woman who had the guts to pull this role off. Theron proved what a good actress she was by transforming herself, mentally and physically into the role. Her performance was Oscar worthy, and if she does not win, then like Roger Ebert said ""the Academy needs to retire"".<br/><br/>Christina Ricci tends to get pushed on the back burner because Theron's performance was so mesmerizing. However, Ricci cannot be forgotten. Her performance was also quite wonderful, and I have no doubt that she played the character exactly as written. Naive, and selfish can only describe the character of Selby. However, her love for Lee was real and that's all that mattered to both women.<br/><br/>The movie begins with Lee telling a short summary of the fantasies that went through her head as a young child. She dreamed of being famous, rich, and successful. Like any other child. But instead, she became a prostitute at age 13, after her father committed suicide (which she explains later in the film). By now, we understand where her hardships started, and why she turned to the streets.<br/><br/>Monster is a disturbing and depressing look into the life of an abused person. The character of Aileen represents non-sociopath killers around the world. It shows you how a human being, who does not kill for `pleasure' can spiral out of control and snap; destroying his or her life, and the lives of many others.<br/><br/>The movie focuses more on the relationship of Lee and Selby, rather than the killings. The characters are portrayed as real people caught up in the drama of life; something we can all relate to. By the end of the movie, you may find yourself in tears after seeing Selby and Aileen's relationship waste away.<br/><br/>Monster puts a personality to Aileen Wuornos and allows the viewers to step inside her world. It does not make excuses for her, nor does it view Wuornos as a victim who killed because she `had to' (with the exception of the first killing). Rather, it helps you understand her state of mind when the killings occurred, why she felt she had to, and why she went through with it.<br/><br/>There have been many complaints that Monster is not `factual'. Well, my argument to that is `who cares'? It was still a well made, well acted, well written, intense drama with emotion filled to the brim. What more could a person ask for?<br/><br/>This movie is one of my favorite movies of all time. If I could give it a rating higher than 10/10, I would."

","There was not one thing I didn't like about the movie MONSTER.  There was not one thing about the story that I found fault with, and though it sounds negative, it's hard for me say that for most movies out there.  Everyone starts out with a 10, but most have points categorically ticked off as everything unfolds.  This movies stays at a 10 through every minute.<br/><br/>I won't comment on Charlize Theron's performance because starting off at a 10, this is what acting should be.  Engrossing.  I found no Charlize Theron in this character, because it was purely Aileen.   Praising Charlize's performance is old-hat by now, and I'll just say that she will win the Oscar, again, because this is what acting should be.  Enough of my not commenting about Charlize.  She had better win the Oscar, or I'm coming after somebody.<br/><br/>This is a rough story, and I looked around curiously at the middle-aged to older-people in the theater and wondered if they really know what they were getting themselves in for.  Personally, I couldn't bring myself to see the film the first week it was in our theater because I knew it would be devastating.  And it was, and I loved it.  Everyone else couldn't wait to leave the theater (though no one walked out, I will point out) and that seems a shame, but at the same time fitting, that everyone wanted to turn away from this ugly Truth that was being shown to them.<br/><br/>This is an absolute credit to the film and its creators.  The story is so hard to watch, but you can't turn away from it.  It seems to hold some essential information about the world around us, its hardness, the animals masquerading as human beings (which often resemble the ordinary Us), and those of us who are really in it for survival's sake because there is no viable alternative.  These are the people we turn away from because it's all too painful to look at, and too painful to imagine if we were them. Nonetheless, I wish there were more stories like this out in the public. Perhaps it would shake us from the lush, much-too-busy-for-our-own-good lives.   For now, we have the luxury of looking away. <br/><br/>

","""Monster"" is one of the best films of 2003, with many memorable scenes and performances.  Even for those who say it's just a good film can't deny Charlize Theron's great performance as Aileen Wuornos, everybody's favorite female serial killer.  I saw it nearly two months ago and still remember it vividly.  If you haven't seen this film, if you assume it's a slow-moving arthouse movie, you're wrong.  There's plenty of ""action"" sequences and a pretty good body count.  But it's not about that, it's about an American tragedy, about Aileen Wuornos, who always wanted to be famous, despite the horrors of her tragic life.  She finally got her wish for fame with her long stretch on death row (and then her much publicized execution).  She had to kill seven men to do it, and the circumstances in which the killings took place are still controversial (Wuornos was the only witness), but it can be safe to assume quite a number of those killings were in cold blood, so it's justifiable to call her a monster.

","It always seems a little ironic when a brilliant movie is made about miserable little people doing bad things.  ""In Cold Blood"" is probably the best example.  Scott Wilson (who's also briefly in ""Monster"") and Robert Blake were perfect as the guys who killed a Kansas family for about forty bucks but through no fault of their own, the technology and impact of cinema gave their characters a kind of elevated resonance that the real killers (probably) didn't have. If the executed killers could see the movie in some kind of afterlife, I wonder how they reacted to it or if they thought it should have been done at all.  I wonder the same about the executed Aileen Wuornos and ""Monster.""<br/><br/>As the hapless harried prostitute who went down in history as ""America's first female serial killer,"" an unrecognizable Charlize Theron assumes a completely alien physicality that rivals that of Robert de Niro in ""Raging Bull.""  But it would be unfair to credit the make-up department for her performance.  It's an absolutely fearless and ballsy job on her part; while of course any thespian playing a real person (especially with lots of ""warts"") has a kind of background edge, in a way it's even more of a challenge to create an onscreen persona to whom audiences can ""relate"" when the character is real as opposed to one created out of whole cloth, because there can't be any little ""twitches"" that don't tally with what the audience members know (or think they know) about the real person.  So e.g. in ""Monster"" we couldn't see Theron hugging a puppy or something because we can't imagine the late Wuornos ever having done that.<br/><br/>Wuornos denied she was a ""serial killer"" because in her view each of the ""johns"" she killed did something to provoke it; in the movie the first john-victim is depicted as a misogynist psycho (an almost equally unrecognizable Lee Tergesen from TV's ""Oz"")  who would have killed her if she hadn't killed him.  It's then suggested that the other killings had a somewhat premeditated aspect to them, although Wuornos is hardly depicted as being coldly methodical about it--quite the contrary.  I suppose Wuornos took the truth about it to the grave with her.<br/><br/>There's a subplot about Wuornos' relationship with a conflicted young lesbian played by Christina Ricci; while I can't claim to know how ""true to life"" it is, it's compelling enough onscreen. I've never been much of a Ricci fan but she can be effective in the right part, like this one; she's like Wynona Ryder with a kind of sinister undercurrent.  Most of the other cast members (all but a few played by unknown actors) aren't required to do much more than look the part.  Bruce Dern is a real treat as Wuornos' only friend, a Vietnam vet a step away from homelessness.  Why doesn't he get used more?<br/><br/>The movie's overall tone reminds me somewhat of T. Malick's mid-Seventies epics ""Badlands"" and ""Days of Heaven,"" meditations on the dichotomy between ""evil"" and the somewhat (anti-)heroic stature we attach to it on the one hand, and on the other hand the decidedly mundane and pedestrian aspects of the actual people who do the actual ""evil"" things. ""Monster"" is a true slice of ripe Americana filmed on location in Florida where Wuornos lived, killed and died.  It's a great little piece of work in quasi-documentary style (which doesn't mean ""looking crude"" like that stupid ""Blair Witch"" thing) and I hope lots of foreigners watch it since they'll see us Yanks at our best, our worst and in the middle.  Not a single character comes off as being representative of a ""Superpower"" which I love because neither does any actual Yank I've ever met, including or especially yours truly.<br/><br/>Awards, of course, don't affect a movie's inherent qualities but I'll admit I was happy Theron won the Golden Globe, partly so the movie would have wider distribution.  Even though Uma Thurman in ""Kill Bill"" was the tour de force par excellence covering a vast emotional range, Theron had the ""Billy Bob Thornton"" kind of role, staying rigidly within the character's emotional limits.  That, I think, is even more of an achievement.<br/><br/>A few quibbles: I thought ""Monster"" somewhat breezed past the judicial proceedings and the execution was only mentioned on a title card at the end, but of course that wasn't the thrust of the story.  I didn't think it was necessary to have Ricci's Norman-Rockwell-Nazi mother character use the word ""nigger"" to hint at the lifestyle against which Ricci was rebelling. We had grasped that already.  If the movie is ABOUT racism or has it as a strong theme or subtext, then words like that are appropriate.  (Quentin Tarantino uses the word when he thinks it's needed, and when its not needed, he doesn't use it.) But just tossed in as a quick jolt seems a kind of cheat.<br/><br/>
So what do we ""learn"" from ""Monster""?  Maybe nothing we didn't already know, or maybe just to remind us to count our blessings because however each of us may find his or her life lacking or crappy, look around and there's bound to be someone even worse off...<br/><br/>No offense to Floridians but it's my theory that Florida is actually Hell. The guy who buried his puppies alive was there, and the woman who shot her kids and herself only the kids didn't die and had to lie on the floor wounded for a week, and Elian Gonzalez was kidnapped by Federal storm troopers, and Ted Bundy finished up there, and other criminal types, and of course Wuornos, and the latest horror with the girl on videotape.  Plus of course there's Janet Reno, Jeb Bush & the Hanging Chads...."

","This is one of those rare movies you keep thinking about after you leave the theatre. Aileen is a victim, but also a victimizer. She killed a man who beat her, but also one who only wanted to help her. It's an object lesson in rationalizing. I thought of George Bush (an easy example, but it could as easily be Richard the Lionhearted), a man who truly believes in higher power and morality, but is able to rationalize killing people for a desirable end. History is full of such people. The crime news is full of the same people, but they operate on a smaller stage. By lumping all men together, Wournos is able to rationalize picking them at random to kill, either for their money or to act as a self-righteous avenger. You have to admire an actress who takes a part like this, and Theron excells at making us feel alternately sympathetic and repelled. How could she top this? Ricci is good enough, though she falls back too often on cocking her head to one side (like Diane Keaton) and something about her eyes reminded me of Steve Buscemi.

It is become cliche in hollywood in recent years...the truth of that statement...but I didn't think it would be as true as I realized it to be.<br/><br/>I was deeply moved and for moments disturbed by this film.  Certain scenes made me seriously contemplate getting up and leaving the theatre.  But I am glad that I stayed because theron's portrayal of ""a dying soul"" was breathtaking."

","Charlize Theron has always struck me as Hollywood's new goddess, tall, blonde, regal, gorgeous, a shtar. Her beauty, alas, was working against her, pigeonholing her in glamour roles of secondary consequence, in most cases. Clearly, she decided to take matters into her own hands and play against type. It was a good career move, certainly. But after seeing her performance today, I'm convinced she chose Monster not only to further her career but to fulfill herself as an artist. I had thought she wanted to be the new Grace Kelly when all along it was to follow in the footsteps of Streep. Huzzah.<br/><br/>In Monster, Charlize looks like some kind of Joni Mitchell on Skid Row, all washed out and unkempt. She seems not to be playing Wournos so much as channeling her. I've seen that kind of body language in unhinged people before--ramrod spine, jutting jaw--and I accepted it totally. It's one of the things that makes the character so real and so frightening. Still, the screenplay does provide an arc to this character. At first, she just seems like an outcast, with an outcast's armored bearing, and her first murder is executed in self-defense. Then she just loses all semblance of humanity as she gets swept up in the pursuit of easy money and vendetta for a lifetime of abuse and exploitation by men. <br/><br/>(A subtheme in the movie has to do with cops. One cop, who once arrested her, forces her into a sexual act; one of the johns she kills is a retired cop. This all rings pretty true. The New York Times Magazine recently did a cover feature on prostitution slavery--girls and children abducted to this country, kept against their will, and forced to turn tricks for their keepers. They have nowhere to go. One was quoted as saying that cops and child psychologists have been their johns, so they trust no one. What is wrong with this country?)<br/><br/>I don't know what to make of Christina Ricci. I tend to think that she ruins almost every movie she's in, The Opposite of Sex and Ice Storm being exceptions. To me, she usually seems to just sit there like a blob and read her lines. This movie was no exception. They already had Charlize, they could have given the Ricci part to a gifted newcomer. Or had someone else play against type, like Julia Stiles or Anna Paquin. That bit of casting is my one gripe. I recommend this movie, for its dark honesty, it's seamless, nearly invisible direction, and for Charlize Theron's stunning work."

","There is nothing ""pretty"" about this movie.  Charlize and Patty did their homework and captured the essence of Aileen Wournos.  You can't help being drawn into Aileen's world.  The rapid eye movement, the awkward facial contortions, her need to be loved for herself, and the indignation that anyone can't understand why she did the things she did.  You certainly can't excuse her actions, but after this you will no doubt understand why.  Was she the `Monster', or the life circumstances that created her?"
"Chris Knipp","Null","0","0","5 February 2004"," Dark journey: extraordinary performance
","This recreation of a Florida female serial killer's true story is nasty, brutish, and short. Yet the movie is one to be seen, both for the strength of the acting and the originality of the material.<br/><br/>The film and the acting have been compared to Hilary Swank and Boys Don't Cry.  Both performances are remarkable works of sympathy and embodiment involving real life stories of lesbian relationships. But Swank's character was a young woman who made herself into an attractive young man and her brutal end was sweetened for her because Teena Brandon/Brandon Teena achieved, if briefly, the bliss of living a lifelong dream.  Aileen Wuornos (Theron) is a beat-up, weather-beaten women who never achieves more than a few moments of happiness, and who instead is hell-bent on shaping her own doom.<br/><br/>We first encounter Wuornos when she meets her soon-to-be female companion and lover Selby (Christina Ricci) in a Florida lesbian dive bar. Down to her last few dollars, the suicidal Lee, who lives the grim life of a car hooker, hooks up with Selby: The meeting begins the one tender relationship she has had in her whole life.<br/><br/>Briefly we see her make pathetic stabs at finding a better life, but her grim appearance and her instant rages make her a hopeless job interview. Paradoxically, the newfound power of being in love leads to Lee's doom; it emboldens her to kill so she and her girlfriend can live better.<br/><br/>
The narrative slides from bar to motel to vile rental house to car sex and death scene as the movie rushes headlong toward a disaster engineered by Wuornos, with Selby in tow.  Aside from a few moments when the cinematography turns a damp twilight into an instant of dark poetry, the movie offers few grace notes. It's relentless. All the roadside pickups are shot in the same dark, damp twilight. The cinematography could have been less monotonous; but at least it has the virtue of highlighting Theron's performance and underlining the claustrophobia of the life.<br/><br/>People exclaim at the pretty Theron's physical transformation and this is the great novelty of the film. In movies like The Astronaut's Wife and The Italian Job and James Gray's excellent, brooding The Yards, Theron plays the dewy-eyed, shapely blonde a young man wants to have on his arm.  How did she become this prematurely aged, broken-down wreck of a woman? The actress underwent lengthy makeup sessions and prepared for the role by putting on 35 pounds. She learned to mimic the way the real Wuornos looked and moved by watching footage of interviews used in the documentary, Aileen:  Portrait of a Serial Killer.<br/><br/>In her embodiment of Wuornos, Theron walks and stands with shoulders and head back, chest out, legs spread, hair flipped back like a mane; mouth turned down, eyes frowning and glaring, face a succession of pouts and grins.  Her patter pours out of her uncontrollably. From her first moment onscreen she's a doomed life force, sputtering with nervous energy and self-destructive menace.  It's not only an amazing embodiment, it's a compulsive one to watch.<br/><br/>Typical of the detractors, one of the Voice's clever-hip flacks describes this as `an Oscar-angling performance that swings from muscularly sympathetic to pre-Extreme Makeover crass. . .' She says  `the bulked-up, butch-struttin', perma-frownin' Theron is poised to ride the tribulations of state-executed Florida prostitute and john-snuffing serial killer Aileen Wuornos straight to Slingbladin' Hilary Swankdom.' That's clever, isn't it? But so mean spirited it needs no comment. More thoughtfully, veteran film critic Michael Sragow recently wrote in commenting on the Oscars that, `the Academy tends to over-value performers who break with established images (like Charlize Theron in Monster) or adopt disguises (like Nicole Kidman in The Hours) or accents (like Meryl Streep in anything). And the Academy tends to undervalue performers who dig deep into their own personalities and screen personae and find something revelatory and new.'<br/><br/>
That's true, and it's the underlying reason why people downgrade Theron's inspired work in Monster to a blatant Oscar bid.  That's a gross error. The Academy's biases shouldn't be allowed to detract from Theron's accomplishment.  Neither Monster nor Boys Don't Cry is just a screen test to show off an acting tour de force.  Monster isn't as strong a film as Boys Don't Cry, but it too is a brilliant collaboration between director and actors, with a thoroughly involving screenplay.<br/><br/>It's been said that Ricci's acting is inadequate and weakens the movie. This is another error. Ricci thoroughly understands her character.  Selby is a nervous, shy, weak person, only 18 when the movie begins and struggling to find an identity.  With Lee she becomes a kvetch, a passive-aggressive detractor, while she needily clings to Lee and her un-keep-able promises. She's terribly insecure and naive. Ricci doesn't inject any unwonted irony or sophistication into Selby.  It's a real and touching, yet chilling, performance - as well as a selfless and perceptive one.<br/><br/>Bruce Dern, as Lee Wuornos' one friend, a ravaged, alcoholic Vietnam veteran, manages to seem a good deal less mannered and quirky and more sympathetic than has sometimes been the case in past roles.  Minor characters - the succession of johns and victims - are disturbingly authentic.<br/><br/>There's a terrible compulsion about watching this movie.  The two lead actresses (despite Ricci's more familiar look) are breathtakingly authentic. Lee believes men are beasts and from her angle it looks that way:  her first kill is a particularly evil, violent man who would have killed her. Eventually we see her murder a gentle soul who only wanted to help her. She's on a roller coaster ride now, acting out her terrible anger at men and life.  Her murders are also robberies and for a while Lee and Selby feel rich.  Eventually Lee unknowingly kills a cop and from then on she's unable to cover her tracks.  Selby escapes prosecution by ratting on her lover and companion.<br/><br/>That's it:  this is an ugly, sad story, worth watching for the feat of acting that will earn Charlize Theron lasting recognition, and for a look at the darkest side of life."

","I recently seen the film monster and was extremely impressed with Theron's portrayal of Wurnos.  The film itself didn't interest me that much since i was already quite familiar of the true story and so there wasn't much room for surprise.  And I have to say by the end of the film I actually felt kind of sorry for Theron's character and put most of the blame on Selby played by Christina Ricci.  There is no reason in this world to kill people but people like Wurnos who are deeply troubled in the first place are usually very likely to give into any pressures put on them by who may be the only person they feel in the world cares about them.  Bottom line... not one of the best films I've seen in my life but if you want to see a extremely believeable performance put on by an actress(theron)  then watch this movie."

","I knew the back-story on Wuornos before I went to the theatre to see ""Monster,"" but I had no idea what the film would be like. After seeing it, I have to say that it was simply extraordinary and that Charlize Theron's portrayal of Wuornos was as real as it gets. I never got the sense for one moment that she was ""acting."" She literally embodied the soul and spirit of Wuornos--evoking all the pathos, sadness, anger, and pain of the woman.<br/><br/>I believe that come Oscar time, Theron will take home the cherished award for this performance. And, it's not just because she gained 30 lbs. for the role, or because she allowed herself to look less beautiful than normal. It's because she looked deep into the heart of Aileen Wuornos and saw the wounded animal that she was. As a result, she was able to convey the heartbreaking truth about the woman--that she was kicked around, beaten up on emotionally and physically, and became violent as a result. She made you feel that Wuornos was a human being and that we should empathize with her. Because of the way Wuornos had lived her life, she became a killer. And, honestly, almost anyone in the same situation might do the same.<br/><br/>Charlize Theron performed a theatrical miracle in this part. She truly broke through all the boundaries and showed what it means to ""become"" a character, not just ""pretend"" to be one.<br/><br/>A lot of people have said that Theron went over the top with her strutting poses, but in the documentary footage I've seen on A&E, she was like that. She used struts and poses to hide her fears. And, I think Theron was spot-on. She researched the character thoroughly and became close friends with the only friend who stood by Aileen in the end (the woman who visited Wuornos the night before her execution). She got all her information from Wuornos' letters and from people who really knew her.<br/><br/>All I can say about this film and about Theron's performance is: BRAVO!!"

"livewire-6","Null","0","0","2 February 2004"," The makeup of a monster
","The title of this film lends itself to misinterpretation. It is all too easy to assume that the ""Monster"" in question is serial killer Aileen Wuornos, played by Charlize Theron. Yet the script makes it clear that the title refers to an amusement-park Ferris wheel that Aileen (or Lee) rode though it made her nauseous. The Ferris wheel is thus an image or a symbol of how humans are capable of doing unpleasant and downright nasty things to survive.<br/><br/>However, the title works on other levels as well. Lee might well be regarded as a monster. The label does not apply so much at the beginning of her killing spree. Her first murder might legitimately be considered a form of self-defence. Even a little later in her criminal career, a case could be made that she has become a kind of vigilante exacting justice for the hurt men have done to her since childhood. But, by the end of the film, Lee becomes a monster because she is presented with a moral choice -- to kill or not to kill someone who is innocent of wrongdoing toward her -- and deliberately chooses to kill. That is when her character crosses the line from hurt human to moral monster.<br/><br/>The label ""monster"" could also be applied to all the people who have taken advantage of Lee during the course of her life, from her father's friend who raped her at the tender age of eight, to the boys and men who have used her as a prostitute since the age of thirteen, to the one person Lee allowed herself to love -- a young lesbian, here called Selby and played by Christina Ricci. As Shakespeare would say, ""This is the most unkindest cut of all."" Selby, it seems, doesn't mind Lee hooking to earn cash and steal cars and help Selby escape her church-going, whitebread, mid-West American lifestyle. But when the chips are down, Selby is no more there for Lee than anyone else.<br/><br/>I found Ricci less than convincing in the role. Her wide-eyed naivete at the start of the film did not ring true for me. She also fails to convey totally why Selby might have been attracted to Lee, or how Selby is able to break free of the strictures of life with her straitlaced parents.<br/><br/>Much has been made of Theron's performance as Lee. Roger Ebert has even called her role one of the best in cinema, period. I will concede that Theron may deserve the Best Actress Oscar this year, but I think it is gilding the lily to go beyond that. Again, critics have raved about Theron's transformation from glamorous Hollywood star to plain Jane (shades of Nicole Kidman's nose in ""The Hours""!). But even with her plucked eyebrows, mottled skin, added pounds and false teeth, Theron's ultrafeminine beauty shines through. You can see it in her eyes and in her occasional smile. Even the studiedly nonchalant way she holds a cigarette lapses, at times, into a more girlish type of gesture. As they say, what's bred in the bone will out in the flesh.<br/><br/>The problem for me is that we do not see, and thus understand, how Lee morphed from the pretty little girl she once must have been, to the swaggering tough she becomes. Perhaps it is not enough that we are told about her childhood woes. Perhaps we should have been shown more graphically where Lee's troubles began. It takes more than makeup, externally applied, to create a monster. We need to see and understand the makeup within."

","Charlize Theron unleashes her inner hag with her compelling portrayal of Aileen Carol Wuornos, a Florida prostitute who starts murdering her johns after beginning a lesbian relationship with Selby, a naive younger woman played by Christina Ricci.<br/><br/>I commend both Ms. Theron and Ms. Ricci for their performances, but this ugly and pointless film leaves me at a complete loss.  It is ironic that I saw this film within a couple of days of watching, and reviewing, the far superior ""In Cold Blood.""  The two films have much in common.  Both tell true tales of senseless and brutal crimes.  Both invite us to feel sympathy for the perpetrator, but ""In Cold Blood"" succeeds where ""Monster"" ultimately fails.  Why?  Because ""In Cold Blood"" was about something.  It had theme, purpose and judgment.  All three are lacking in ""Monster.""<br/><br/>
Director Patty Jenkins takes the events at face value, seemingly afraid to make any judgment.   As a result, all she delivers is a tarted-up exploitation film.  Take away the name actors and half the budget and all you would have left is a straight-to-video release in the same league as ""I Spit on Your Grave"" or ""Last House on the Left.""<br/><br/>I respect the performances of the two leads, and the general craftsmanship of the film, but I can't recommend the film.

Do you really believe she was this 'tortured' individual with her horrible childhood in most of the scenes when she killed? Do you really feel she was sobbing buckets when she murdered the last guy? That her gun, accidentally slipped from her bag, so she had no choice (poor thing) but to kill him?

Set in the 80's Monster follows the relationship that the two women have together and their escape from the `real' world. While trying to better their own lives, Aileen begins to take the lives of some unsuspecting men. Two some the story may be long and dull, but beneath the story there is a woman who is lost in her own world. She lived a tormented life where the only rule was to shut up and take what's being given to you. Charlize Theron gives the performance of a lifetime. She plays Aileen in a way where you can actually feel bad for her. In reality Aileen was a horrible woman who killed because she felt that life owed her something, on the surface Charlize creates a character both horrible and charming. She only wants to live a life far different then she has ever been accustomed too, she wants Selby to be happy, but most important she wants to find happiness. I believe that Charlize does something that not too many actresses have done before; she has taken herself completely out of her body and transformed herself in Aileen. There is a lot of tale out the makeup and how she had to gain weight, well anyone can make themselves look ugly, but what Theron does is something far more challenging then making herself look unattractive, she really embodies Aileen. She gives the BEST performance of the year! She is outstanding and extremely captivating, I found it hard to take my eyes off of her. The only problem with a performance this good is how will she top it? The answer is she won't, she'll only grow as an actress. I don't think she will ever be able to play someone like this again, and I don't think that's a bad thing. Theron is brilliant here; I think this is a once in a lifetime performance. I hope that after this movie fades she is still considered a wonderful actress. As for the other performances, oh yes there where other people in this movie. First off there is the always-amazing Christina Ricci as Selby, here Ricci plays the naive woman who is out to find happiness in herself. It's a shame that Theron over shadows her, but for Ricci this character seems like a broken record. I feel that Ricci has done this before, and while I feel it's always ok to play a similar character, I think it's one thing when you play these types of people over and over again. Monster is a very important story; it is a film about the relationship between two people and the road they take in life.It's a story for anyone who has tried to live a better life, for anyone who feels that life never goes their way.

I saw the documentary Aileen Wuornos: The Selling of a Serial Killer several years ago and while I was watching Monster, there were times that I forgot Charlize Theron was in the movie.  She does such an amazing job as Wuornos that it is hard to separate the real Aileen from the fake one.  For people who have never heard of Aileen Wuornos, they will be just as blown away by Theron.  The movie starts strong as it shows the beginning of Aileen's relationship with Selby (Ricci).  The audience also begins to understand how this monster was created although it never seems to be explored in depth.  The bond between Selby and Aileen, as well as Aileen's story, are both very interesting but midway through the film the movie begins to repeat itself and loses its focus.

","Come on Aileen! Why did you have to turn to a life of prostitution, which made you a habitual street midnight runner? Why did you not face your demons and get psychological help? And of course, why did you go on that killing spree? These monstrous questions are answered in the biographical film `Monster'. Monster is of course on the life of Aileen Wuornos. She was labeled by the media as the first American female serial killer. Wournos, a prostitute, killed 7 of her johns during the late 80's and early 90's in order to support her lesbian lover. Charlize Theron plays Wuornos in what has been described as one of the best transformation acting performances in cinematic history. Miss Theron, who gained 30 pounds for the role & had a wickedly scary Wuornos makeup alteration, is no Charlize Angel in this picture. Her mannerisms & gestures ,which copied those of the mentally disturbed Wuornos, were done with pitch-perfect accuracy. I mean that serialously, i mean seriously. Christina Ricci also executes an astounding performance as Wuornos' teenage lesbian lover. Monster's screenplay was also a monster ingredient in the film's success. There is dialogue in this film that is unforgettable and will be fixated in your cerebral cortex for days. First-time Writer/Director Patty Jenkins is deserving of newcomer accolades in a film that was challenging to direct and probably was not some type of pattycake project.

"Garp23","9","0","0","29 January 2004"," One of the best films of 2003 (possible spoilers!)
","`Monster' is based on the true story of Eileen Wournos, America's most high profile female serial killer. The keys words in that sentence are 'based on', as they should be in any movie that aspires to tell the true story of someone's life. Walking in to the theater, I knew only that Wournos was a hooker who shot her johns, and that she was responsible for a number of killings before she was caught in 1990 and put to death in Florida in 2002 for her crimes. `Monster', as so many movies before it, wants to portray the events of someone's life, events that in this case only an executed killer and a murder victim were privy to. The movie opens with Wournos wandering in to a bar one evening and meeting her true love. She has not begun killing yet; she is merely another disheveled prostitute, and has been since she was 13. Inside the bar she meets Shelby (Christina Ricci), a lesbian who is just as insecure as Eileen (who is called Lee in the film), only she displays her fears openly rather than hiding them behind false bravado and swagger as Lee does. The two unlikely partners begin to fall in love, and Lee goes out one day to make enough money to get them started on a life together. However, she is picked up by the wrong john, and she is knocked out. She comes to naked, tied to the car. After a brutal series of events, she breaks free and kills her attacker, and discovers a hacksaw in his trunk; had she not shot him, he would undoubtedly have killed her. She lives in fear for a while, but soon realizes that the police are not looking for her. A lifetime of abuse and rape explodes inside of her, and after a brief attempt to go straight (which is met with painful skepticism from the working world), she exorcizes her demons by killing more men who should be home with their wives rather than in a car in the woods with her. She hides her actions from Shelby, who she now lives with. But living with a hooker is not easy, and the two quarrel constantly. The film is very effective at showing their relationship; how lust turned to love, and how it all came crashing down. Was Eileen Wournos a monster? Yes, undoubtedly. But she was also a victim herself, a tired concept that gains new strength here. We see Lee commit horrible crimes in the name of love, to give her lover money; in one harrowing scene she kills a man who does not want sex but only wants to help someone in need and offers his son's old room in a house he shares with his wife. I enjoy true crime books, trying to understand why people do what they do (all the while understanding that some people are just evil through and through), but I also know a lot of people who have had horrible childhoods but learned from them and became better people. Wournos truly had no right to kill the men she did, with the exception of the man who would have killed her, but the movie does something no book or movie has ever done better: it makes us see her as a person, to empathize with her. By the end, I was surprisingly emotional, so good is `Monster' at painting a three-dimensional portrait of a bad person who doesn't see herself as bad, and who can justify all of her actions. We feel for her just as much as we fear her. Charlize Theron plays Wournos, and it is a real shame that so much press has been devoted to the make-up tricks she used in the role. Yes, she gained thirty pounds and shows no glamour, especially in her nude scenes; and, yes, make-up was used to freckle her face and make her a dead ringer for the real-life Eileen. But the acting is all Theron, and it would be unfortunate if it is seen as a camera trick. Theron gives the best performance of her career, but that is no great achievement; with the exception of `The Cider House Rules', most of her films, like `Reindeer Games' or `The Italian Job', have just required her to look pretty and flash a little skin, something she does very well. But what is amazing here is that she gives one of the best performances I have seen in a very long time, not just compared to her earlier work. In many ways `Monster' plays like `Boys Don't Cry', an effective love story set against horrific events, and it is every bit that film's equal. Theron is the reason; she inhabits the role, and shows fearlessness alongside a breathtaking amount of talent. Ricci has been somewhat overlooked, but she is amazing as well, using her eyes to portray a woman who has more strength than she knows. She has one amazing scene in a bar where she channels Lee and takes on her attributes in front of some strangers, and the film would not work as a love story if we don't believe both leads, regardless of how strong Theron's performance is. Both women deserve Oscar nominations, if not the awards themselves. `Monster' is one of the best films of the year, a movie that sidesteps numerous pitfalls to tell a sad, violent, and affecting story. Maybe it happened this way, and maybe it didn't; the dead cannot speak to defend themselves. But without stooping to bleeding heart liberalism or exploitation, the movie tells a tale no one who sees it should ever be able to shake."

","There's a reason Charlize Theron was nominated for this movie but nothing else was.  That's because the rest of the movie is very ho-hum.  The script fails to examine fully the Aileen character.  We get a surface explanation of she was abused and it is left at that.  From what I have read on the real case there was much more to this case then the movie let on.  It would have been more fascinating to see Aileen after she was incarcerated and try to explain her actions.  A shallow movie with great a great central performance."
"Docterry","Null","0","0","27 January 2004"," Charlize is the bomb.
","I'm not exactly sure what the motivation was behind the casting of Charlize Theron in this part.  Was it a gimmick?  Was it inspired by Nicole Kidman's defacing nose job in `The Hours'?  Was it meant to garner a deeper consideration of the painfully beautiful Theron's other talents? I don't know, this just strikes me as weird, weird casting- perhaps unnecessary. The producers could have given one of the thousands of struggling, undiscovered actresses out there a shot.  However, the fact remains that Charlize is simply wonderful in this movie. Her performance contains, as they teach us in acting class, multiple layers. She manages to exist in this role as both a somewhat non-realistic, grandiose drunken bad girl and also an insular woman filled with moments of self-realization and private emotion. This role is for the most part a firecracker whose audacity is hard to resist. Another film, `Boys Don't Cry', comes to mind in that Hilary Swank's performance was another big transformation for an actress however her sexually confused character was more subtle and elusive and thus more challenging to portray.  Swank did a beautiful job.<br/><br/>Again like `Boys Don't Cry', much of the film could be described as a love story. Christina Ricci is quite adorable here and her character's quiet passive aggressiveness feels right on target.  She gives an impressive performance keeping the viewer's attention all the time while competing with Theron's vivacious portrayal.<br/><br/>Charlize is awesome though. When I think about the black and white image of her walking down the runway in `Celebrity' and striking a pose that just stops your heart, I can't help but think Hollywood has gone crazy having her make this movie. Why take a gorgeous face like Charlize's and blotch it all up?  Is it simply to prove that she can really act, that she's the real deal and her looks don't matter?  Well, that's just a stupid idea. She's got nothing to prove. The whole movie system is messed up anyway since the advent of the independent film. You have the big studios dishing up tons of money for Lord of the Rings, special effects type movies where years ago they were making films like `Looking for Mr. Goodbar' and nobody really goes to the movies anymore for true cultural illumination.  Does Hollywood really have to keep looking under rocks for story ideas?"

This is far beyond acting -- Theron IS the character.<br/><br/>I haven't seen any of the documentaries on Aileen W. and do not doubt that there are alternative perspectives on her life that could be held.

","Charlize Theron does an intense, dark, and unbelievable transformation into Aileen Carol Wuornos, a highway prostitute turned serial killer.  It took me some time to acknowledge that Charlize Theron was the same person as the character that she was performing on the screen.  As Aileen, Theron turns in a performance that is quite possibly her best ever and will take considerable effort to surpass in the near future.  It's a role that explores the depths, physically and mentally, of her acting talents.  Her performance in this harrowing story is alone a reason to watch this movie.<br/><br/>She plays a character that is so damaged, confused, and lost in her search for what I can only define as hope.  Her character has been scarred mentally and physically since childhood by parents, friends, and strangers.  This movie makes no excuses for what Wuornos, but does provides an account of her steps down the path the complete and utter ruin, from which she will not be able to return.  Theron's portrayal doesn't leave you thinking that this is a woman who didn't get what she deserved, but as a woman who could have been someone or something else if she had chosen differently.  The movie shows us that even in the worst of circumstances you may find hope.  Sadly, sometimes finding that hope may be too late.<br/><br/>Christina Ricci is equally as compelling as Selby who is one of the catalysts for Wuornos transformation from highway hooker to highway killer. She is a simple person, filled with emotional and mental complexities that stem from a religious upbringing and dealing with the reality that she is a lesbian.  Two worlds that seemingly never seem to co-exist in harmony from what I can tell.  Selby isn't completely faultless either, but apparently is the weaker to the two women when it comes to have a spine, which we can only guess stems from the innuendo that her family life was one where women did what they were told, when they were told to do it.  The conclusion of the movie indicates that this may not be far from the truth.<br/><br/>The movie is designed more to give insight to what happened to these two women in the brief period of time that their lives crossed.  It makes no attempt to vindicate either of the two women's actions.  The movie paints a painfully truthful picture of the darker side of this flawed world we live in, which many choose to ignore and deny even exists."

If you know the facts, you will be disappointed, so I suggest that you just view the film as a study of how a dysfunctional life can lead to hatred, madness & rationalized murder.<br/><br/>Eileen Wuornos, as portrayed in this movie, is much more sympathetic than her real-life counterpart seemed to be.  Because we see intimate, unknowable moments dramatized on the screen, a ""character"" begins to take shape, a very sympathetic-but-ruthless character.<br/><br/>The love story between the two women is largely fictional.  The ""waif"" nature of her lover (Christina Ricci's character) is highly an invention, as is her helpless, jobless lesbian identity.  In reality she was working as a hotel maid and GAVE UP her job to let Wuornos support her as a prostitute. When the killings began, Eileen Wuornos was very up front and matter-of-fact about them to her real lover (who merely asked to be kept in the dark about them so that she wouldn't feel guilty and thus the urge to turn Eileen in).<br/><br/>Many things have been smoothed over to make the film's character sympathetic to the audience.  This is handled very well in the film; in fact, the script seems to address just about every argument one could make about Eileen Wuornos' character.  There is a telling scene with Eileen's only constant friend (played by the great Bruce Dern) about the nature of ""blaming"" circumstance for our inevitable actions.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this film, but if you really want to know more about the reality, I suggest searching the 'Net for the true details."

Charlize totally embodies Aileen's appearances, clothes, gait and etc. These are easy (yet not often done right), but to get into a personality is not. Charlize's performance will be archived for study by all in the film industry. Perkins should get a lot of work also. <br/><br/>There will always be controversy about Aileen's guilt reference her history of abuse. What is interesting about this story (if the movie is true) is that Aileen's killing spree only occurs when she has a sense of love in her life and someone to live for. She killed for money to support her only love. That's what the story is about as portrayed in the movie; the killer is humanized, a bad intersection of emotions, but a powerful story that is not melodramatic. <br/><br/>I have to admit that I did laugh at some parts (not any violent or emotional ones) such as when she was making fun of secretaries, what Johns like and etc. <br/><br/>About the makeup. Charlize's makeup was distracting extremely briefly in the beginning because I knew that was Charlize but the distraction quickly disappeared and I do mean QUICKLY!

The film does not ""pre-quel"" her killing spree or spend any time whatsoever on her prison time.  It tells only the story of her killing and relationship with her lesbian girlfriend Selby.<br/><br/>I really didn't know how to react to this story.  It seemed to play both sides of the fence in its perspective toward Aileen, sometimes sympathetic sometimes horrified.  What I can say for sure is that there will be a great deal of hyperbole in the entertainment media that will praise the appearance of Charlize Theron in her resemblance to the real Aileen; it is eerily on the money.  The  thematic elements of the story itself have been told before in earlier films.  Forbidden lovers on a real life killing rampage?  Try renting ""Badlands.""  Lost lesbians short on brains and cash looking to get away from it all and start a new life together?  Try ""Boys don't Cry.""  Whatever elements are to be realized from this story, they are unapologetically sordid and the movie wallows in them.  A.W.'s victims were typically middle class 60-something white males, well dressed and driving nice cars, wearing their wedding rings for the world to see.  It is obvious she is symbolically killing her abusive father, but we never get to see this man.  All we hear is Aileen's version of him.<br/><br/>In summary I can't say this story needed to be told.  True crime stories are inherently fascinating especially when it is intertwined with a large dose of sex.  Do you ever drive by a bad car accident and gawk, hoping to see a dead body?

So what about the rest of the film? Well, Monster is an effective and compelling film. However, the reason it is effective and compelling is for Charlize Theron. Without Theron this movie would be ok at best. I found the script to be mediocre. I really felt that Charlize made the film into something worthwhile. <br/><br/>One of the problems with the film is the Theron's voiceover. When used at the beginning it is fine. However, it seemed rather pointless and distracting the rest of the time. Her voiceover at the end came off a bit corny. <br/><br/>I should praise the make-up crew. Charlize was unrecognizable, although I never found Aileen to be a hideous looking woman. She was no Charlize but still I found her to be an overweight but somewhat attractive woman.<br/><br/>
The only other actor to have significant screentime is Christina Ricci. Ricci does gives a good performance but she is completely upstaged by Theron. However, they do exhibit some chemistry together. The rest of the cast was forgettable, well Bruce Dern was sort of memorable despite not much screentime.<br/><br/>This is the debut film of Patty Jenkins. She was the writer and director of the film. Her screenplay is not remotely interesting and her direction is fine at best. Her job was to make sure that the film was never boring and to make sure Charlize completely WOWED us. She achieved those well(She may be able to do more on her next project). Monster is certainly not one of the years best films and without Charlize this film would be mediocre at best.

","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** We have all seen serial killer films before and they usually have the lead actor come across as some unbelievable psychopath but this is a film that takes the rare approach of showing us the person who became a killer. It doesn't make any excuses for her actions but it does take an extremely honest and realistic view of a woman who did become a monster. Story is about Aileen Wournos (Charlize Theron) who is a Florida prostitute and down to her last five bucks when she stumbles into a gay bar. While sitting there she meets Selby Wall (Christina Ricci) who is an 18 year old lesbian clumsily looking for someone to talk to. After a nervous start the two of them hit it off but Selby is scheduled to go back to Ohio in a few days so Aileen tries to convince her to stay. Aileen walks the interstate and picks up johns and one night she is parked in the woods with a man who beats her viciously and ties her up. He assaults her with a tire iron until she manages to get free where she finds his pistol in the front seat and kills him with it. She disposes of the body and takes his money and car and when she shows Selby the amount of cash she has and the car this convinces her to stay with Aileen. They rent a rundown house where they live together and after failing to find a normal job Aileen goes back to hooking. Aileen prides herself as the bread winner and in order to keep her and Selby together she ends up murdering many other men.<br/><br/>*****SPOILER ALERT*****<br/><br/>Aileen ends up murdering seven different men and she tells Selby only about the first one which was in self defense. Aileen hates being a hooker and one night she and her friend Thomas (Bruce Dern) both tell each other how life doesn't give you any choices but you do what you have to do in order to survive. One day Selby crashes the car where an elderly couple gets a good look at them and when the police finally figure out that it must be a prostitute committing the murders a composite drawing of the two of them is shown on television and this leads to Aileen's capture.<br/><br/>This film was directed by Patty Jenkins who is making her directorial debut and she does a good job of just allowing the film to focus in on Theron's portrayal. This film doesn't do anything special or stylistic and that's a good thing because it doesn't need to. It shows us a character that really never had much of a chance in life and we do understand her anger and confusion at the world. After a nightmare of a childhood she becomes this pitiful person who is useless to society. The performance of Theron is one that will be talked about for many years to come and its done with an incredible amount of understanding for the characters anger. Not for a second did Theron lose focus as Aileen and she stays in character every moment in the film. I have heard a lot of talk about the make-up that Theron wears for the film and while it is an amazing job her performance is not based from this. Theron's body movement is a big part of the film with the unsteady walk to the wild glare in her dark eyes. The dark eyes that she bares to the screen in certain scenes are ones that show a lifetime of hurt and pain. I was truly mesmerized by the stares of anger and this has nothing to do with make-up. It's a gut wrenching performance that is easily the best of the year and Theron finally has received the role that proves herself as a wonderful actress. Even though Ricci's character could have been written with more depth I still thought she was excellent as the naive lover of Aileen. She plays a person that has been told what to do all of her life and the one time that she decides to think for herself is to help the police incriminate her lover. This film takes an honest look at a sordid character and while its approach is sometimes pedestrian it makes the right decision to allow the actors to pick up the slack.

","""Monster"" is the story of Aileen Wuornos, the infamous prostitute turned serial killer.  With a subject like that, don't expect any light treatment of the story.  This movie is very brutal, but well made.  Much has been said of Charlize Theron's Oscar-nominated performance as Wuornos, not to mention her dramatic transformation.  You can barely recognize her!  As the killer, Theron is an unsettling screen presence.  At times, you almost feel sorry for Aileen Wuornos for becoming the horrible thing she turned out to be. She is shown as somewhere between a woman done wrong, and a walking nightmare.  It took brave people to make such an unflinching look into the mind of such a notorious murderer, and it takes brave people to see it!"

In the film Monster, the plain looking, twenty-something character of Aileen Wronos survives such savage circumstances by turning cheap tricks on a Florida highway.  Lacking decent social skills, or any marketable job skills, Aileen seems dirty and weird even by homeless standards.  Then as soon as she concludes that her future must also add up to zero, fate throws something special her way.  She finds someone to love.<br/><br/>From the outset, director Patty Jenkins immerses the audience in this filthy, stinking world of base depravity, and human brutality.  And through it all, Aileen's love, awakened contrary to her nature, is the one pinpoint of light in all of this darkness.  Her love is her single source of hope and salvation.  Consequently, we become desperate to see her get out of there, and start her life over again with someone to help her.  But, as the newspapers have reported, it doesn't turn out that way.<br/><br/>International beauty Charlize Theron portrays the subject character.  Her physical alteration is legendary in our own time, but her emotional transformation is supernatural.  She doesn't as much perform in front of the camera, as she does slam us on the side of the head, throttle us, and force us to become involved.  People working on this film have reported experiencing the presence of the real Aileen Wronos as they went about her old haunts (no pun intended).  With all due respect to Ms. Theron's acting talents, it seems apparent here, that she got some help from the other side.<br/><br/>This film is powerful.  At times, everyone seems overwhelmed by the ferocity going on around them.  It made me re-evaluate the blessings I have in my life.  I'm fortunate enough to live with someone who loves me.

","It is not just Charlize Theron's deNiro in ""Raging Bull""-like transformation that makes ""Monster"" so mesmerizing, but her total performance.<br/><br/>
Not since Hilary Swank in ""Boys Don't Cry"" has an actress so completely inhabited such an unlikely role, completely overshadowing Nicole's nose, accent, and voice register change in ""The Hours.""<br/><br/>But how on earth did writer/director Patty Jenkins know that Theron could do this? There is zero else in her previous resume by any stretch of the imagination to think that her previous fluff prepared her for this. I understand Theron coming on as producer to convince everyone else and I assume it was her connections that got a first-time director noted character actors for bit male roles by Bruce Dern, Pruitt Taylor Vince, and Lee Tergesen showing what he learned in ""Oz.""<br/><br/>This is not just a tour de force performance but is within a brilliant examination of a truly disturbed yet desperately love-tropic person.  We gradually get inside her traumatized head as she ceases to be able to distinguish between victim and predator due to early and continuing abuse that renders her barely even able to function in the demi-monde let alone mainstream society.  The attention stays on the character study and barely shows the violence and gore, but rather the impact of its aftermath.<br/><br/>
There has been less attention to Christina Ricci's excellent supporting role as her very confused and dependent companion only because she has a history of doing odd-ball indie films alternating with her mainstream Hollywood work.<br/><br/>The score by electronic dance music's BT is excellent, as are the incisive selections of period power pop."

The swagger she effects to hide her lack of self-confidence and self-loathing for not being better than who she was, her vulnerability with Ricci's character, and her raw, naked, feral rage - all are pitch perfect, and displayed in scenes of undeniable power.

","Italo Calvino's 1972 masterpiece, Invisible Cities, beautifully delineates realms of mind: some that counterpoint each other while others falling within the harmonic progressions of existence.  The complexity of being is rarely depicted as successfully as in the film Monster.  The story is not new nor is it fiction: The violation of a young girl essentially ends any chance of her living a normal life and she is thus thrown into a timeless path of degradation and progressive declination.  What is new here is the power in the volume of truth brought to this production by its creators.  <br/><br/>
The well-crafted script enters into levels of truth rarely encountered in the American cinema, especially in today's industry.   Its subtlety is intertwined with ironies and its brutality plays out in both concord and chaos to her final destruction by the blind justice of today's American, Hammurabian society.   <br/><br/>What is also genuinely new here is the astonishing performance of Charlize Theron, an actor originally from South Africa whose past work includes modeling and playing quiet beauties.  Here we are treated to a mounting level of skills in the past secluded by the press of her beauty.   The greatest surprise is that she was able to make the quantum leap from her past profile into the central arena of screen actors with levels of power not seen for decades.   She plays the 1980's female serial killer, Aileen Carol Wuornos, with deftness, fervor and nuance that is agonizing and at the same time wondrous to behold.  She looks, acts and smells like gutter trash. We feel her painful hunger for human contact at the same time the desperate loathing that she has for her victimizers.  In a final, perhaps planned irony, her final victim, perhaps the only innocent one, is played with great pathos by the extraordinary character actor Scott Wilson who long ago mesmerized us as one of the killers in Truman Capote's In Cold Blood. <br/><br/>
It is also important here to bow to the recent newcomer writer-director Patty Jenkins who with this work has also grabbed off the gold ring.  Italo Calvino would smile at this extraordinary, robust and unforgettable film."

","I feel like I am one of very few people that went to see this movie for the story and performances. I've read so many reviews about the makeup effects in this film that I'm beginning to suspect that that was the main motivation for a lot of people to see this flick. In some of the reviews the opinion of this movie seems to hinge fully on the distraction the makeup caused for them. Now, I've had some issues with the poor use of makeup effects in movies also; Spy Game comes to mind. But, the problem I had with that was the lack of effects used. They never aged the actors in that film which made it unbelievable, not unwatchable and certainly not so distracting as to make it a bad film. I liked Spy Game. I just wanted it to be a little more believable. But this review is supposed to be about Monster and is turning out to be more of a commentary on the people that had a problem taking their eyes and minds off the way the two lead actresses looked.<br/><br/>   The film is based on the killer Aileen Wuornos, as I'm sure you're aware. Though I think it's a stretch, she's touted as a serial killer and may very well be the first woman classified as such. That alone makes this an intriguing story. This is the story of a very misguided (or perhaps that would be better stated as unguided), delusional, dangerous woman, who, after years of hard living that leads to occurrences of brutality, snaps and begins a life of killing. Along with that, there is a story of desperate love and hopeless denial.   The performances are nothing less than exceptional; of course most of the kudos go to Charlize Theron. The make up effects help, but she really has become this woman. I have seen TV programs on this case with footage of Aileen and Charlize Theron has simply embodied her.   Another reviewer made a remark that she (Theron) watched footage of Aileen Wuornos and simply copied her mannerisms, voice and look. Hmm, wasn't that her job? And I doubt it was that simple or easy. I have to rely on these trained professionals to try and develop their craft enough to convince me that they are someone else. Mrs. Theron did this for me with out flaw.<br/><br/>  I urge people to go see this movie only if they are interested in the story and/or film in general. If you go just to see a beautiful woman look ugly for a film then you'll most likely miss the great performances and messages this film conveys. And that's sad.   I really don't have the words, or time, to deliver all the feelings this movie brought up in me. I like to believe I got the messages and nuances of this picture and hope that others get it' too.

Though very disturbing in some scenes, I managed to bear through it. Some will argue it was a movie begging sympathy out of us, another chick flick, and it did. But this movie showed me (just like Gia along other sad movies in this genre) is that there are people who hurt like this everyday. We ignore them, pass them off, tip our noses up or turn our heads away from them. Yeah Miss Wournos was wrong for her actions, but she could have been helped. She could have been helped.

"thefan-2","Null","0","0","25 January 2004"," Pity
","This movie is so dominated by Charlize Theron's performance as serial killer Aileen Wuornos that it's easy to overlook the screenplay and the direction, both of which are of a quality to help unveil Theron's towering talent.  But in the end it's that talent that overshadows everything else in the movie. <br/><br/>
Christina Ricci, for example, all but vanishes in the thankless role of Selby, Wuornos' shallow and frightened lover.  There is an innocent but oddly and cruelly calculating quality about Selby, as Ricci plays her, that descends from Nabokov's Lolita herself.  Wuornos never has a chance as long as she's with Selby, as Ricci's performance makes clear.  But in order to see it, you first have to tear your eyes off of Theron.  Good luck with that.  <br/><br/>And where did Theron's talent come from?  Where did *Theron* come from, for that matter?  Up until this movie, my impression of her is of something exquisitely decorative off in the corner of a few movies like Mighty Joe Young, or a highly competent -- but no less decorative -- actor in movies like The Cider House Rules.  The first time you get a glimpse of her in Monster, when Aileen Wuornos ambles into a bar near the start of the movie, a gasp goes up from the audience.  It's an amazing, unbelievable, transformation.  <br/><br/>It's so shocking, in fact, that it almost seems like a stunt in a couple of places.  I suppose that's basically what it is.  But that doesn't matter. Theron deserves all the praise she's been getting for this performance. When an actress of Theron's physical beauty strips down to her underwear for a scene, or appears nude, the last thing she ordinarily wants the audience to feel for her is pity.  But that's what Theron goes for in this movie, and that's what she achieves.  She is a gifted actor, and a very brave woman. <br/><br/>
Highest recommendation."
"Vash2001","7","0","0","24 January 2004"," Difficult to watch, but well made
","SPOILERS AHEAD............<br/><br/>I wanted to see this movie as soon as possible (before the Golden Globes award ceremony) mainly to form my own opinion of the performance of Charlize Theron.  I had heard so many glowing comments about it that I became a bit skeptical.  Physical transformation does not necessarily make a performance, but Theron seems to reach the emotional level needed to portray this character.  It was difficult to watch the movie, and I saw a couple of people walk out, but I sat through it.  I was pleasant surprised to see that the movie did  not suddenly end (with Aileen's capture by the police), and it did not drag either.  Most important, Theron's praise is well deserved and she certainly deserves at least an Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>It is difficult not to feel sorry for her, and it is a tribute to Theron's acting ability, and to the screenplay.  Some may see this as an intent to justify her actions. In my opinion, the story simply tries to explain what may have motivated her to do what she did. I did not see any justification - even remotely- of her actions. At times I wanted to beg her to have mercy on the man she was about to kill.  At other times I wished that she had simply taken up a job to clean peoples' homes.  She was so completely separated from reality that she could not stop dreaming and could not think of such simple ways of making a living. Afterall, she had been a prostitute since age 13. She was now killing for money, which she wanted to use for realizing her dreams, which included goodbye to the life of a hooker, and becoming something wonderful, enjoying life, etc.<br/><br/>I have to admit that I found the physical appearance of Aileen revolting.  I never even saw her pictures and did not know about her until this movie came out.  At times Charlize Theron appeared way too heavy, and 'monstrous', particularly next to the tiny Christina Ricci who played Selby.  I am not sure it was necessary to make her look that way, but may be it was, if the real life Aileen looked that way. The looks did get in the way of the performance, from my perspective at least. That was the only flaw I saw. Otherwise, Theron did a splendid job depicting a very difficult character, and adding complexity to it.<br/><br/>As a movie, I found it difficult to watch, but I would not say it was over the top, considering the horrors committed by the woman.  The characters seem real. I had wondered how anybody could actually create a story for a movie out of such a drab news ('a Florida prostitute killed many men').  The story evolves as the relationship between Aileen and Selby evolves and finally ends.  The movie held my interest throughout, even though I knew how Aileen's life ended. It was a wasted life and one cannot help wondering 'what if she had received some kind of moral education early in her life'. Still, a murder cannot be justified.  Not everyone with a difficult life becomes a murderer. There is a reference to this at one point in the movie, when Selby's guardian lady tells her that having a difficult life is no justification for taking the wrong path.  <br/><br/>I thought Christina Ricci portrayed Selby very well- young, innocent, unaccepted by her family, and vulnerable. However, she knew what buttons to push to get Aileen to do what she wanted. I thought she gave an excellent support to Theron, who really occupies the screen (literally and figuratively).<br/><br/>I would recommend seeing this movie mainly for Charlize Theron's performance, but also to see the terrible suffering in life."

"WWFStern","Null","0","0","11 January 2004"," Aileen Wuornos, Victimizer or Victim: an analysis
","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** Monster<br/><br/>
I have always held firm in believing that the death penalty is a justified, and indeed, necessary, part of our criminal justice system. Similarly, I have always thought of serial killers as ""monsters"" who prey upon the innocent in the dark of night.  Going into Monster, the new film by Patty Jenkins, I expected to get just such a portrait of Aileen Wuornos. After all, Wuornos was dubbed by the media as America's first female serial killer and executed in 2002.  What the film reveals about her, though, is much more unsettling than a soulless beast.  Life has chewed Aileen up, spit her out, and wiped its feet on her remains.  Idealism she desperately clung to in her younger days--clung to in spite of increasingly insurmountable roadblocks to normality--has been forcibly extinguished.<br/><br/>
Charlize Theron gives the best female performance of the year in capturing Aileen both physically and emotionally, in both cases a wreck.  The film opens with a suicidal Aileen sitting in the rain getting ready to snuff out her existence.  Having five dollars left from her last john--her only job since her early teens has been prostitution--she enters, unknowingly, a lesbian bar to have a final drink.  She struts into the place with a gruff and manly persona, an obvious mask to hide the cowering child inside.  A younger and more obviously vulnerable Selby (Christina Ricci) immediately is attracted to her.  Aileen quickly opens herself to Selby and develops perhaps the first real human connection of her life.  Aileen may or may not be gay, but following her experiences, a woman is the only person with whom she can possibly relate.<br/><br/>
Both Aileen and Selby are on the run, Aileen from a job that is killing her every day and Selby from a father who can't accept her as she is. Their relationship is far from perfect, but each represents to the other a hand to hold when the silver lining we are told lies in every cloud turns out to be, in fact, lies.  They have a taste of fairy tale happiness, going roller-skating and then making out behind the rink.  We wish they could be transplanted into a more hopeful situation.  But life comes crashing in, and purity disappears.<br/><br/>
Aileen is brutally raped by a john, and probably saves her life by grabbing a gun from his car and killing him first.  In stealing the rest of his money, Aileen envisions using that seed to grow a life for herself and her new girlfriend.  She springs Selby from the family her father sent her to and they run off to a motel together.  Aileen, searching for any straight job available, tries to wedge herself into a society she's never been part of and that coldly rejects any advances she attempts.  Selby, seeing the idealistic mirage starting to fade, explodes at Aileen one night thereby pushing her onto exactly the wrong path.<br/><br/>
Returning to hooking, Aileen goes out day after day, then returns with a new car and wads of cash.  Selby initially may not see what is happening, but soon becomes an accomplice in enabling Aileen to continue this bloody and tragic method to get a leg-up on life.  But even as the murders continue and sloppiness begins to put the couple at risk, one never loses sight of Aileen's humanity and the underlying motive of her crimes.  She wants enough money to be able to stop selling her body, live an actual life with Selby, and maybe even be accepted by the rest of the planet.  The fact that she has been used her entire life has blinded her to all rationality and sense; she's been trained to believe that the only way to get ahead is to use other people.<br/><br/>
Aileen cannot be forgiven for committing her murders, which should go without saying.  But, at the same time, how much culpability can be placed on the shoulders of a person who never received a moral compass and whose only education was victimization?  If a dog is beaten by its owner in puppy hood and shown no love, can one possibly be surprised when that dog becomes a vicious adult?  If there is nobody willing to guide the victimized back onto the right path, the outrage we rightfully feel when blood is spilled may be tragically misdirected.<br/><br/>

I have never been a huge fan of Ms. Theron's (she was slightly amusing in Curse of the Jade Scorpion and Celebrity), but this isn't Theron per se. Instead, the actress becomes female serial killer Wuornos - an external and internal transformation that is arresting, haunting and beautiful in its art and craft. I can't remember a better performance that continually grabs the audience by the lapels and elicits both shock and sympathy all in the same moment. The supporting performances are fine (Ricci passes in a complex and demanding role). But Theron's turn made me more than once wonder if this were a Hollywood movie or a riveting A&E documentary."

","You may have read a lot about Charlize Theron's astounding performance in ""Monster"" and her amazing transformation from being gorgeous and elegant to being haggard and rough-edged. Those reports have not been exaggerated. If she doesn't at least get an Oscar nomination for her role here (and say, Nicole Kidman does for ""Cold Mountain""), I might not even watch the ceremony.<br/><br/>She plays Aileen Wuornos, the highway prostitute who murdered six clients back in 1988 and was executed last year. Not giving a whole lot in the way of background, the film concentrates only on a short amount of time in Wuornos' life, shortly before the murders, during, and shortly after.<br/><br/>
Though she was not herself a lesbian, she began a relationship just before the murders with a naive, co-dependent lesbian named Selby (Christina Ricci), simply because she was so achingly lonely that she was willing to be with anyone who liked her.<br/><br/>Her first murder was in self-defense, and if it was anything like it's shown here (a extremely brutal beating and rape), it was well justified.<br/><br/>
After that, she tries for a short while to go straight and get a real job, but fails miserably and goes back to hooking, killing some clients for money.<br/><br/>Writer/director Patty Jenkins doesn't shy away from showing all of Wuornos' killings for what they were after that first one: brutal and unnecessary (not self-defense, as the real Wuornos claimed ALL her killing were). But she also takes great strides to humanize the character, giving her genuine feelings and a desperate romance (including a truly romantic roller skating scene set to Journey's ""Don't Stop Believin'"") that arouses feeling of sympathy in us, which is surprising and gives her character (who really is a monster, there's no doubt about that) truly tragic shadings. We despise her for her actions, but feel sad for her about the hand she's been dealt in life.<br/><br/>""Monster"" may not be the feel-good hit of the year, but it's a harsh and powerful film that elicits strong emotional reactions and has one of the best performances to hit screens in years. In other words, highly recommended."

","As with many people, my main draw to this film was the acclaim for Charlize Theron's performance.  Well, that and the physical transformation.  Unlike some, at least, though, that transformation didn't distract me from her performance because both are just so superbly well done.  Charlize the model is so completely removed in sight and psyche that I ceased to think about it.  I simply watched an amazing and, yes, Oscar-worthy performance.  This is a tremendous acting achievement from someone who heretofore had precious little to indicate this level of potential.  As I say, wow.<br/><br/>I can understand where some might find Theron's performance a little over the top, but personally I didn't think so.  Knowing nothing of the real Aileen Wuornos, it struck me as merely the grandiosity of someone whose self has become so stretched beyond the bounds of normal behavior.  I also understand but disagree with the opinion of some that the movie dismisses Wuornos' crimes behind so much PC victimology.  The unfortunate truth is that whereas many killers are in fact born with an evil bone (and I'll brook no arguments that they aren't), some are indeed bred to it by circumstance. This doesn't excuse their behavior, it merely explains its source, which is what I believe Monster does very well.  I think in the scenes where she does feel pity and shows mercy, the movie illustrates that Aileen does indeed know right from wrong, so that later, when she doesn't show that mercy, it's clear she's consciously chosen the wrong, and for the wrong reasons.  I just didn't get from the movie the message that she didn't deserve her punishment.<br/><br/>The only minor negative I found in the movie was Christina Ricci's performance.  That's not to say it wasn't good, but it struck me as merely that.  In retrospect I think she could have occupied the role better. Though in all fairness to her, it may be only that Charlize is so good, Christina by comparison comes off as merely effective.<br/><br/>This is a difficult movie to watch, no doubt about it.  It's one of those I'd usually choose to watch on video at home, due to the almost voyeuristic nature of watching something so intensely personal.  But I didn't want to wait to check out Charlize's performance.  I'd suggest others do the same. The movie is excellent--literally, directorially, musically--but Charlize Theron is outstanding.  Go check her out.  If you can find her."

","The buzz surrounding this film is that of Charlize Theron's physical transformation. However, perhaps people should be talking about her psychological transformation. Because even though she physically pulls off this performance, she nails it in the mentality aspect as well. The story chronicles the life of America's first celebrated serial killer. The focus tends to surround the events and tragedies that helped to transform her into one, instead of focusing on her actual crimes. I suppose law and order types will be upset about that, claiming it is a ""liberal"" movie that attempts to rationalize murder. It is true that the director does play a little fast and loose with the actual killer in question. However, I think the movie is justified. It is easy to say there are bad people out there that should be executed. But many of these people were not born that way. Tragedies beyond their control happen and their lives take on a very different and ugly path.

","I know it seems like a huge gesture to laud anyone with that sort of accolade , but to be quite honest, I'm not sure if I've ever even noticed or seen Charlize Theron in a movie before.  See this movie and you will understand that previously well-respected actors are but pretenders to the crown when it comes to selflessness and dedication to a role.  I was absolutely mesmerized from start to finish by this movie (although I could do without the initial voice-overs).  The only bad thing about this film is that Christina Ricci gives one of her best turns in a supporting role that is largely unsympathetic and will undeservedly be overlooked by everyone that's awestruck and train-wrecked by Theron's Aileen Wuornos.<br/><br/>The fearlessness of this film is unprecedented and long-awaited. I won't sleep well tonight."

","How could I not go see a film where Ebert's review mentions Theron's performance as one of the best(or maybe he said THE best-can't remember) female performances in cinema history? I went, saw it and must say that Ebert is right.<br/><br/>Theron is extraordinary in this. It's NOT just the physical transformation but the overall perfermance in general. If she doesn't get the oscar this year, it would be very much a letdown. As far as the movie goes,the direction is incredible, it captures the time period to a tee, as does the music in the film. I had heard that Theron wrote a personal letter to Journey's Steve Perry requesting the use of ""Don't stop Believing"" in the skating scene. I'm glad it was used as it captures the essense of the scene and time period wonderfully.<br/><br/>I'm not going to wax poetic on everything-first the negatives- this is a VERY VERY difficult film to sit through. It is not for the faint of heart. Certain scenes are so horrific you might have to look away from the screen and you will be shocked and unerved. HOWEVER- If you think you can deal with those things, see this. While I don't think this is the best movie ever made, I do think it is one of the most well acted, and also a fascinating, powerful character study. I would also like to mention as amazing as Theron is, not enough praise has Gone to Christina Ricci, who as Shelby is pretty darn good in her role and I would love her to receive a supporting actress nod, she certainly deserves it. The interaction between the two female leads is fascinating. All the acting is great, not just Theron and Ricci, Bruce dern as well as the various other people including the victims are acted on a leval of pure excellence.  Any major film buff who can appreciate amazing acting and direction will want to see this although as mentioned-it is NOT for the faint of heart. Although I think this movie is very very welldone it'd be hard to sit through it again, although seeing it once, I know now when to ""look away"". One other thing I will mention is this movie doesn't drag-not for one moment-which is in itself kind of rare-And lastly-I hope to see Charlize making the acceptance speech come oscar time."

It's possible to see how circumstances made this woman become ""serial killer Aileen Wuornos,"" and at the same time impossible not to feel for some of the men that she killed and their families. It asks the viewer to evaluate the characteristics of ""good people"" and the qualities of ""bad people"" better than most movies that attempt to examine the internal structures of morality. The overall feeling of the film is dark and isolating...reminiscent of ""Boys Don't Cry."" Charlize Theron's performance is as good as it gets.  She just nails it, no two ways about it.

To me, it was obvious that Wuornos knew as much.  The last killing scene was positively gut wrenching.  I could hardly watch it.  Also, the first murder was one of the most intense things I have ever seen on film.  After that scene I was hooked for the duration.  The motives of Aileen and Selby don't make a lot of sense but I think that's the whole idea.  I find it hard to believe that Theron is being accused of overacting.

","I saw this last night and I have to agree with Greg's comments above. I thought it was powerful and disturbing (it stuck with me today, which films rarely do), but after awhile the makeup job felt a little gimmicky. Despite a great performance, I found myself wondering through most of the movie if the actual makeup was doing the acting (the frowning, downturned expression Wuornos often had), or Ms. Theron was.  It also seemed like the film did very little to explain why Shelby would be attracted to a character disorder like Aileen Wuornos and would continue to live in such obvious denial throughout their relationship.<br/><br/>I saw ""AW: The Selling of a Serial Killer"" several years ago and the real woman struck me as a sociopath with very little insight or remorse for why she killed... she was a complex, tortured personality who appeared to have very little control over her rages and her impulse control.  Was she a victim?  Of course she was... but the film would have been so much more if it had pointed out that she was a woman who wouldn't take responsibility for her past and chose to be destructive.  I think there has been a dangerous trend in American movies for several decades now that emphathizes with criminals by providing a simple, kind of ""tied up in a ribbon"" history that turns them into heroes (or is that anti-heroes?). Personalities (or personality disorders) just aren't put together that simply.  The scene in ""Monster"" where AW rationalizes (""people are killed every day"") her crimes to her partner was probably the most chilling aspect of this film and was so perfectly written that it was frightening (I will tell you that I work with sociopaths in my profession every day, and that scene could have been recorded word-for-word from one of them).<br/><br/>In any case, what I thought was unmistakable about the film was that it took some guts to make it and it didn't apologise, and for that I think it should be congratulated.  I've stopped watching most American movies because they seem as though they've been put together in a factory and don't want to take risks for fear of losing money at the box office.  Despite what I thought were some flaws, this one did take risks and was pretty bold about it."

","This movie kept me glued to the edge of my seat longer than it probably should have. The director probably could've cut about 30 minutes out of the middle without anyone noticing the difference. <br/><br/>Ricci was pretty convincing as Selby--her performance, makeup and camera angles made Selby look a lot shorter and younger than I remembered Ricci. Theron's portrayal of Lee was okay, but a little overdone. Worse, Lee's voice seemed to become Theron's voice at times. The extensive makeup job and the tattered clothes couldn't conceal the starlet underneath. My question is: Why in the world did Theron get this role? While she played it well enough to convince me that she's marginally able to be something other than a softhearted seductress, surely the director could've found someone more convincing and cheaper. Are we so addicted to the clique of top-name actors that we can't recognize a quality movie when we see one?<br/><br/>Still, I liked the movie as a character sketch. As in life, most of the characters were ambiguous. However, I wasn't too impressed with the movie's blanket portrayal of Christians as sexually repressed and emotionally abusive. Surely, at least one of the Christian characters could've been at least a little less warped."

"gregsrants","6","0","0","7 December 2003"," Not a bad film, but Charlize was too distracting
","Usually, when I go see a film where I know that an actor has radically changed their appearance, my interest is peaked another notch.  And for good reason.  Tom Hanks shut down production for almost a full year so that he could lose weight and grow a beard for his role in CastAway and who can forget Robert DeNiro's packing on the pounds for his role as Jake LaMatta in Martin Scorcese's Raging Bull?   So when I first saw the trailers for Patty Jenkins' new film Monster, I was amazed to see the transformation of the lead character played by Charlize Theron.  Sporting fake teeth, no make-up (or so it looks), stringy hair and enough extra weight to make three super-models, Charlize Theron transformed herself into the physical appearance of serial killer Aileen Wuornos.<br/><br/>But the fact that Charlize looks nothing like Charlize is actually a distraction for most of the movie.  Such press has covered her transformation that when you first see Aileen Wuornos, you can't help but try and look for Ms. Theron under all the ugliness.  The best way for me to explain it, is to have you think of Mel Gibson's character in Man Without A Face.  Audiences were turned off or confused by Mel's new look and the movie grossed only $25 million domestically.  We just couldn't get over something so beautiful looking so hideous.<br/><br/>And all this is unfortunate, because Monster is not a bad little indi-film. The movie is based on the true story of Aileen Wuornos who was responsible for the death of seven men, including one police officer, in Southern Florida.   Aileen, we learn, comes from a tragic home life, where she was abused by a friend of the family and beaten by her father.  This leads Aileen into a life of low self-esteem, prostitution and a hate for the male species that continues to deteriorate.<br/><br/>Then, in only a scenario where the planets would have aligned perfectly, Aileen falls in love with Shelby Wall (Christina Ricci) and the two run off together. It is within this relationship where Aileen falls deeper and deeper into her dark self as she resorts to a life of murder and crime to support Shelby's desire to live free and travel the world.    All this comes crashing down when Aileen mistakenly kills a retired police officer and soon her life on the run ends in her capture and eventual death penalty sentence (Aileen was executed in Florida in 2002).<br/><br/>Typical to the indi-film experience, there are few characters in Monster, and that works to the films advantage since the movie was so brilliantly cast.  Charlize towers over the smaller Christina and that helps us understand the power over the big eyed, naïve Shelby Wall.  Where the film fails however, is in its attempt to elicit any emotional attachment between Aileen and the audience.  When Aileen says good-bye to Shelby and puts her on a bus back to Ohio to protect her from the eventual capture for their wrong doings, you are not tugged by any heartstrings or feel anything for a character that so brutally murdered seven helpless males.  Writer/director Patty Jenkins tries too hard to convert the audience into having sympathy for Aileen due to her abusive background and her compassion towards a nervous, first-time john that refuses to have rough sex with her.<br/><br/>
Most of the focus of this film will be on Charlize and her new-found look, but it is Christina Ricci that really holds her own as the innocent lesbian lover that runs away from home and lives by the success and failures of Aileen's crimes.  Christina's adoring stares and adolescent exuberance are a refreshing change of pace from the main characters heavy breathing and mothering tendencies.<br/><br/>So a small thumbs up for Monster.  I just wish I didn't know who Charlize Theron was before the transformation.  Maybe that way I would be more interested in the character and less interested on how much she looked like Jon Voight in drag."

I think they even showed a hacksaw in his car while she was going through it after she killed him. <br/><br/>Also there is the scene where a policeman picks her up in his squad car, a guy who admits he nearly broke her jaw in the past and she climbs over the seat to service him for free. Has this ever been substantiated? I am just curious.<br/><br/>I think this movie is very disrespectful to the victims and their surviving loved ones. Just because a man goes to a prostitute does not make him a rapist or deserving of death. Just because a woman is abused as a child, that does not excuse her atrocious crimes. The message of this movie is that Wuornos is the real victim, victim of evil MEN. What a bunch of baloney. <br/><br/>This movie is OK if you realize it is a work of FICTION, but to peddle this as a true story is so wrong. Like a rape victim who gets ""raped"" again by the system when their sexual history is brought up at trial to prove the victim was asking for it or somehow deserved it - Wuornos' victims have been made responsible for the crimes committed against them- disgusting. The way these men are portrayed is unfair seeing as how this information came from a psychopath who was charged with murder. Let's believe her, she has no reason to lie.<br/><br/>That is my two cents"

","My compliments to the musical tastes of anyone who can place that quote. Hey, you wanna know what I'm getting sick and tired of? I'm sick and tired of hearing the phrase 'America's First Serial Killer,' if only because it's generally a phrase used to promote Monster, the stunningly well-made and effective movie about Aileen Wuornos, who was not in any way a serial killer. Serial killers kill people because of the order that their names appear in the phone book (the Terminator did, anyway), because of their addresses, certain physical or even behavioral characteristics, whatever. Basically they are targeted based upon a quite often arbitrary set of circumstances. Aileen Wuornos killed people because she was so psychologically damaged by the experiences she suffered in her life and because of her desperate attempt to earn (if you could call it earning) something real and pure and happy for herself and her newfound love. If nothing else, the fact that she is motivated by her desire for a better life and to be a better person separates her from the classification of 'serial killers.' Besides that, she was hardly killing off the best people that society had to offer. <br/><br/>Charlize Theron's performance is probably the most famous performance of 2003, although not entirely because of the positive chatter that it generated. The way that she captures and becomes Aileen Wuornos is astonishing, even if you go into the movie looking for Theron under the make-up from the very beginning. It's as if she does not try to justify the amount of work needed to transform her stunning appearance into that of a hardened prostitute, but rather was transformed into that person, through the make-up as well as her own physical transformation. There's nothing more pathetic than people who complain that Theron didn't act, it was the make-up delivering her performance in this movie. PLEASE. On second thought, there are things more pathetic than that, and several of them get killed off in this movie.<br/><br/>The movie does a pretty impressive job of walking the tightrope of the line between depicting how sickening these people are that Aileen kills without leaning toward the appearance of justifying her murders. But the thing that the movie wisely focuses on is the way that Aileen's life led her to what she became, straight from childhood, and the way she tried so hard to become something good and worthwhile. She tried so hard, in fact, that they made a movie about her. <br/><br/>It is an important fact that Aileen's first murder was in self-defense, and that afterwards she found herself with a car and a few dollars in her pocket. It was presumably the only thing she had ever done other than what really can be called nothing but rape or sexual torture from which she profited in any way. And like the first time Charlie Chaplin saw people tossing coins and cheering at him after he ran onstage and sang a song when he was just a little kid, Aileen saw that this was something that she could make enough money from not only to earn a living (as was Chaplin's epiphany), but to get away from prostitution forever. Prostitution has destroyed her sexually, and given her experiences with the first guy she kills, it's not hard to see why she hates it so much. Interestingly, it is not immediately clear in this situation who is the victim of whom.<br/><br/>Christina Ricci delivers a flawless performance of the naïve 18-year-old lesbian who falls in love with Aileen and ultimately wins Aileen's love as well, despite their tense first meeting. Ricci's shy demeanor and disarming cuteness are exactly what are needed to portray a kid getting into something that she really doesn't understand, all the while not noticing (it's hard to pinpoint when exactly she knows what's going on and when exactly she allows herself to believe it) what Aileen is doing in order to get them the life that they are both dreaming about. I would be curious to know what ever became of Selby Wall. The movie doesn't explain that much at the end other than to say that she and Aileen never spoke again. Sad but not entirely surprising. Multiple murders tend to put a damper on short-lived relationships really based mainly on lust and mutual, superficial needs. And by the way, this is probably just me, but Ricci looks exactly like Edward Furlong in this movie. They could be twins.<br/><br/>Except for all that crap about 'America's First Serial Killer,' Monster doesn't take Aileen's story and turn it into an excuse to make a big Hollywood movie, but rather presents a different way to look at someone who has committed the crimes that Aileen has. The movie is about what a capitalist society, and even the very people charged with seeing after the safety of the people in that society ('The police used to watch over the people, now they're WATCHIN' the people,' my compliments again to the musical tastes of anyone who can place THAT quote), can do to create what Aileen Wuornos became. And the important thing to notice is that the movie is able to do that without offering any excuses for her murders. It's not a film about how someone was sentenced to death who didn't really deserve it because what she was wasn't really her fault, it's about what kinds of things can lead a person to such a life. Have you ever heard a story about some heinous crime and wondered how people get like that? Here are some ideas. Dismissing such people as monsters and executing them is a great way to get them off the street and stop their killing, but it's not really going to get us anywhere as far as preventing that behavior from surfacing in someone else."

","Charlize Theron is great in this movie, but her performance is the only good thing about it. It's too bad the rest of the movie is so artificial. First of all, a lot of reviews crow about how truthful the movie is and how it sticks to the facts. How could anyone possibly know what the truth really is unless they were there? Maybe Selby's mother wasn't some straitlaced two-dimensional prude, maybe she was just a protective mother. Think about that for a minute.<br/><br/>My biggest problem with this movie is the pretension of assuming that a woman couldn't be inherently evil, that a woman over the edge must have gotten that way because of a never-ending parade of misdeeds visited upon her by cartoonishly violent or egotistical men. For example, why would any lawyer interview a person without first looking at their resume and THEN invite them for an interview? But no, the lawyer scene doesn't happen in any real context, it's designed so that Aileen can nurse yet another grudge against men, who in the movie are shown, again and again, to contribute to her deteriorating mental state and poor decision making. Aileen doesn't act on her own, you see, it's all those damned men who are making her crazy. She couldn't just simply be an evil person, she has to be manipulated into being evil by evil men. I'm surprised that so many people who like this movie can't see how pretentiously old-fashioned and misogynistic this viewpoint really is. What is this, the 1940s? I've got news for you: no one ever figured out Ted Bundy and no one ever will. Thanks to Florida's zealous legal system, no one will ever figure out Aileen Wuornos either. She was an enigma. Why did she kill seven men? The movie shouldn't have tried to explain Aileen's rampage by showing possible catalysts for her behavior, it should have simply told the unembellished story, and not one that was solely from her point of view."

","This movie is certainly in my top favourites of every movie I have ever seen. It is a phenomenal telling of a serial killer's reign and her hardships therein. Charlize Theron won best actress and deserved it completely. However, I have done extensive research into the life and crimes of Aileen Wuornos, and as Hollywood portrayed it is not how it is. This is what upset me most about the movie. The movie portrays Wuornos as a victim of assault and rape and that is what led to her first killing. This is not true. Aileen was a cold-hearted woman with no emotions nor remorse for her actions. It is only this reason that I did not enjoy the movie. Otherwise, the movie itself was intriguing. Both Theron and Ricci were stellar actresses and played heart-wrenching roles that engaged the viewers. I loved this movie and I would watch it again and again!"

","The filmmaker's avowed intention here was to compensate the media portrayal of Aileen Wuornos - which was supposedly designed to show the public just how evil and worthy of a death sentence she was - by honouring the complexity of a life.<br/><br/>Not what happens. Instead we get a complex life reduced to simplicity through an essentially melodramatic mode of presentation, all designed to justify the filmmaker's sympathetic response to the real courtroom events.<br/><br/>Everyone knows about Theron's performance. But every other element of the film suffers for it, orchestrated, as they are, to place the focus solely on Theron, and distract from what is really going on behind the camera. Without the strutting performance of Theron, this would be a TV movie."

","Charlize did an amazing job of transforming herself into this woman. You didn't see Charlize anymore. You saw this ill-treated and disturbed woman trying to make sense of the life that she's led. You can really see how abusing children can lead to traumatized and dangerous adults. You almost understood her deranged logic for killing johns, but you knew she had to go down, because you already knew the story. I felt sorry for her because it seemed like the woman didn't have a chance. Life just dealt her blow after blow, so it's like, who wouldn't make the choices she did? Was she really a monster? She seemed more like a woman without a childhood or a sense of living beyond herself. Yea, she spoke about wanting to be famous and more than her pitiful beginnings, but she never elevated herself to those lofty ideals. She kept thinking that life owed her something, and let's face it, life doesn't work that way. It appeared to me that that was her tragic flaw: her expectations.<br/><br/>Ricci's adaptation of Selby irked me to no end. Why was she acting like some meek child throughout the whole film? She's usually praised as the ""Indie Movie Princess"", but I found her severely lacking in this film. I was shocked to find that she would continue the entire movie like a 4-yr old child. You never sensed her confusion with defining her sexuality with her Christianity. She was an odd choice to the depth and intensity of Charlize's Aileen. You just felt like Ricci was skipping through her lines waiting to hit the catered food table when the director yelled ""Cut!"". I was really surprised, because I would hate to think that her acting as Wednesday was better than her in this. She was like 11 when she did that. You think she'd have matured in her acting range.<br/><br/>The movie was deep and gritty. It was truly a great movie for Charlize that was worthy of the Oscar. I'd hate to think actresses have to play seedier elements of femininity to win Oscars, but it's a small step."

","'Monster', written and directed by Patty Jenkins is based on the true-life events surrounding the life of Aileen Wuornos, (Charlize Theron) deemed the United States' first serial killer. The film briefly shows her childhood and adolescence, but soon focuses on her adult life, when she became a small-time homeless prostitute. One night she makes her way into a gay bar for a beer and meets Selby, (Christina Ricci) a young, insecure lesbian who spends the night buying Aileen drinks, which begins an intense, dysfunctional and passionate relationship that ends in the murder of seven men and the death of Wuornos in the electric chair.<br/><br/>Theron is really quite good in 'Monster'. In addition to her highly publicized transformation from a gorgeous woman to a fairly ugly one, her acting chops are quite significant. Ricci, who started as such a cute and precocious actress decades ago, is just okay in her role as the naïve and whiny Selby; her performance is nothing better or worse than anything she's done in the last fifteen years. Removing the performances, 'Monster' is just an okay film that leans dangerously toward provoking a feeling of sympathy for Wuornos, a character that really isn't very sympathetic. Therefore, because of this slight bias, I was instantly ambivalent to the film as a whole. Other than this, there isn't anything seriously wrong with the film; it's just 'okay.' <br/><br/>'Monster' certainly wasn't a waste of my time, but by the same token, it's not a film I would seek out again any time soon, nor would I recommend it with any real enthusiasm. 5/10<br/><br/>Shelly"

Some scenes drag on, with boring conversation about things that don't make me feel for or understand the characters more.<br/><br/>Second, if a beautiful Charlize Theron hadn't been uglied up for her part, this movie would have been subjected to the B-Movie bin. The movie looks like it was shot on a shoestring budget, and doesn't have the feel a movie with this subject matter should have. They spent a lot on makeup, not enough on set design and ""setting the mood"". The director could have gone several directions, putting on a darker face for the film (ala Taxi Driver) or they could have played off the contrasts of the bright happiness of Florida versus a dark and cold-blooded murderer. Instead they did nothing, making this film look like a made-for-TV movie.<br/><br/>Third, Charlize plays a convincing enough Aileen, but Ricci's character is downright annoying. It seems like the same mousy character she's played in a dozen movies prior to this.<br/><br/>I wanted to like the movie, as the subject matter is right up my alley, but overall, I was let down."

","Although MONSTER is highly-regarded among epic performances, I couldn't help but be utterly disgusted by this movie. (And not in the effective kind of way...) I found this movie extremely difficult to relate to, as for the fact I'm not a psychotic drunk prostitute, and I assume most of you are not either. I felt the intention of this film was to make the watcher feel one thing: Pity. Yes, Aileen had a terrible life, but this movie doesn't make me feel the least bit sorry for her. Frame after frame all that is presented to you is just another terrible event that builds on the pity towards Aileen. It just didn't work for me. It didn't change my perspective on life, it didn't convince me to feel bad for serial killers because they succumb to human nature that was 'brought on by everyone else but themselves.' No life lessons learned here. Why? Because there is nothing to relate to. This film doesn't show you the Aileen before everything went terribly wrong. This was the fatal mistake of MONSTER.<br/><br/>Charlize Theron is yes, pretty impressive in this film, but it is NOT award-winning material. It is over-the-top and terribly conceived. As for Christina Ricci, the character she plays is overly naive. Exaggerated to the point of absolute mockery. If you want to see a movie that will have an effect on you, see something you can relate to, like In America, or 21 Grams even. As for this film, the only feeling I left with was an extreme wanting to go take a shower to wash all this bad film-making off me."

"MikeHonorama","5","2","6","18 January 2004"," Lifetime movie with extra grit
","Charlize Theron's fine, albeit slightly overrated, performance, centers the movie.  Unfortunately, there's not much surrounding it.  Condensing anyone's life story into a two hour package inevitably involves simplifying details. However, in Monster, the movie didn't just simplify the story -- it eliminated any complexity whatsoever.  While the movie (smartly) doesn't deify Aileen Wuornos, it doesn't provide much insight other than sketching out a brief history of her troubled background and that she wanted to be loved.  Yet the movie seems to fear too many rough edges -- reading reviews of this movie that give it credit for its portrayal of a seedy Florida milieu, I'm struck by the fact that most of these reviewers wouldn't have the slightest clue what that really would have been like.  And that was one area where the movie was most unconvincing.  For all the talk about Theron's make up job, what about Christina Ricci's?  Considering they were broke most of the film, she must have stocked up on the Cover Girl before running away from home.<br/><br/>This isn't just a matter of picking details.  Detachment takes the place of authenticity, which only serves to magnify the lack of context that this movie has.  It's not quite comfortable coming from the point of view of the mad Wuornos.  And Selby is pretty much a blank.  As the movie crawled to its inevitable inevitability, I was left wondering what was point the filmmakers were trying to get across other than it really sucked to be Aileen Wuornos.<br/><br/>The best sequence in the movie is when Wuornos goes out to get a real job. Theron does a great job of conveying both the inflated optimism Wuornos develops in the throes of love, and the quick turnaround when the real world treats the way it always had before.  This is the one part of the movie that actually said something."

","Basic Information: This movie came out in 2003 and it was written and directed by Patty Jenkins. The film stars Charlize Theron as Aileen (Lee) and Christina Ricci as Selby. Monster is based on the real life experiences of prostitute / serial killer, Aileen Wuornos.<br/><br/>Brief Description: ** SPOILER ALERT ** As I said before, this film is based on the real life events of Aileen Wuornos, better known as Lee. Lee is from Florida and was sexually abused by one of her fathers friends when she was eight years old. When she confronted her father about it, he beat her for ""making it up."" Before she knew it, Lee was a homeless prostitute in Florida, selling herself just to make enough money for food and booze. She meets Selby at a bar and after a few drinks they hit it off. Selby moved away from her parents because her father was very religious and wouldn't accept the fact that she was a lesbian. After one of Lee's clients rapes her she kills him out of self defense and it scarred her very seriously. So much so that it sends her on a killing spree of clients who think they are paying for something else. Lee and Selby run away, using cars and money that Lee steals from the men that she murders. As you would imagine, Lee's actions catch up to her and she gets arrested by the police at a bar she frequently went to. Lee is found guilty and is sentenced to death where she would spend 12 years before her execution.<br/><br/>Production Highlights: I think the main production highlight of this movie was how real it felt. As a viewer I felt like I was seeing most of the situations from either Lee or Selby's perspective. I think Jenkins did a really good job in this area.<br/><br/>Recommendation: Personally I would not recommend this film. I realize that it is well written and produced but the whole movie I felt uncomfortable, so I would not recommend it.<br/><br/>Conclusion: Patty Jenkins brings us on Aileen Wuornos's journey from prostitution to serial killer. It is clear that is film is written from a women's perspective and I think Jenkins does a great job capturing the gruesome events that happened to Lee."
"cannonj-20766","6","1","2","11 February 2019"," Entertaining, yet innacurate
","The semi-biographical film Monster directed by Patty Jenkins and starring Charlize Theron is an interesting interpretation of the life of serial killer Aileen Wuornos. What the film lacks in accuracy to the story, it makes up for in story and representation. Aileen ""Lee"" Wuornos is a down-and-out prostitute and graduate of the school of hard knocks. Since her childhood, she had been on the receiving end of unspeakable sexual abuse. The film opens with Wuornos sitting beneath a highway overpass, revolver in her hands. She contemplates suicide, but instead wanders into a local gay bar, where she meets Selby Wall, portrayed by Christina Ricci.
Despite Wuornos's initial insistence that she is straight, the two quickly become infatuated with each other. Wuornos tries to earn some money to treat Selby better. However, her client proceeds to brutally beat and assault her. Aileen kills him in what is undoubtedly self-defense, steals his car, and vows to run off with Selby and go straight. Her past haunts her, though, and she is unable to find honest work. Her frustration and increasing paranoia sends Aileen down a path of murder, littering the Florida highways with the bodies of six other johns. Selby seems to choose a blissful ignorance to Aileen's crimes, or is perhaps excited by them.
Ultimately, Aileen's psyche crumbles. She sends Selby off to her parents in Ohio. Later, she is in one of her favorite old haunts, a biker bar in Daytona, where she is finally arrested. Aileen admits to her crimes to protect Selby and is executed in 2002.
The entertainment value and production value of this film cannot be denied. The transformation of the beautiful Charlize Theron into the weathered and rough-lived Aileen Wuornos. She is practically unrecognizable in this role. Christina Ricci also portrays the troubled Selby Wall excellently, who's naivety leads her to a dangerous life as an accomplice to a number of gruesome murders.
It cannot be overlooked, however, that this film is a major glorification of the life and crimes of Aileen Wuornos. To begin with, it is difficult to accurately portray a woman who many experts have labeled as a pathological liar. Her post-arrest interviews display a scattered sense of ""truth"" and many reinterpretations or justifications for her murder spree.
The character of Selby Wall is herself a fictionalization of Wuornos's girlfriend Tyria
Moore, who likely did not want to be portrayed in the film. In both appearance and temperament, Moore was a very different person than Wall. Moore participated in the rowdy, impulsive antics of her partner, including trashing motel rooms and being disruptive at the various dive bars they frequented.
Personally, I feel that the inaccurate depiction of these events does a disservice to the victims. It is generally agreed upon that the murder of Richard Mallory (fictionalized as Vincent Corey in Monster) was indeed self-defense. However, there is skepticism towards the subsequent deaths. Wuornos has a long history of assault and robbery, reflecting an impulsive and reckless personality. If you are looking for an entertaining and disturbing movie, I would recommend this film. However, keep in mind it is not a true-to-fact depiction, and if you are truly interested in the story of Aileen Wuornos, look elsewhere."

","Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadger<br/><br/> Glamour girl Charlize Theron's breathtaking, heartbreaking transformation into the completely opposite image of Wuornos makes this film an astonishing achievement. The movie does not explain or dive into the mind of Wuornos which is a missed opportunity. The story also focuses to much on the lesbian love story side than on the killings.<br/><br/>What makes the movie a little bit better is Theron's performance, open, vulnerable, tragic, moving, and most of all, honest. Aileen's behavior is contradictory, volatile, and disturbed. She loses control and lashes out irrationally. Theron's portrait of Aileen is sympathetic without pretending that she is more of a victim than the men she killed. <br/><br/>The pacing is very slow and the runtime is overlong.<br/><br/>SPOILER ON NEXT LINE<br/><br/>I really wished we could have heard the testimonial given by Selby. Also I wish we could have seen the execution and Wuornos' last words.<br/><br/>SPOILER OVER<br/><br/>Pro: Interesting story, Theron's performance, and some good killings<br/><br/>Cons: Missed opportunities when it comes to the story (see spoiler line), slow pacing, an overlong runtime, and not enough depth into the mind of Wuornos<br/><br/>Overall Rating: 6.2"

","I can't understand the number of reviewers on this board who feel that the character of Aileen Wuornos was given sympathetic treatment in the picture. Sympathetic? Really? If you didn't get the impression that she was a mentally defective, vicious and sadistic killer, than I don't know what movie one might have been watching. Aileen is all of that, as she slides off the rails of humanity while still believing she's a real good person.<br/><br/>So as far as the story goes, I think the film did a good job of portraying the real Aileen Wuornos, and is perhaps confirmed by reviewer 'piXelpiXelpiXel' commenting on a real life experience with the former prostitute. But in any event, one cannot disregard the stunning portrayal by Charlize Theron of the story's central character. When the picture first came out, and even today, I can't wrap my head around Theron's appearance as Wuornos, with the blotchy face, the weight gain and the dental implants. Her mannerisms and facial tics as well lend an eerie presence to the glamorous actress that I wasn't prepared for back then, and am still mesmerized by today.<br/><br/>As Wournos's friend Selby, Christina Ricci is generally competent, but I just didn't get the attraction between the pair. Then again, I can't imagine anyone being attracted to a figure like Wuornos, who even if she had cleaned up some of her act, would have stood out as something of a hillbilly. As dramatic and nerve wracking as the story was though, I almost cracked up at one point when Selby turns to Aileen and states ""We can be as different as you want to be, but you can't kill people"". It was offered almost like career advice and struck me so oddly that I had to stop the film at that point to ponder what Selby said.<br/><br/>Anyway, this is not a film for entertainment purposes, pretty much the title tells you that much. However it is a provocative film experience that will test your emotions, so be prepared for some unsettling responses to the story."

","Model-turned-actress Charlize Theron leaves her glamorous image behind for this gritty drama,Monster wherein which she plays a disturbed prostitute who becomes a serial killer.This crime drama is about serial killer Aileen Wuornos, a former prostitute who was executed in Florida in 2002 for killing six men in the late 1980s and early 1990's. She was played by Theron, and her fictionalized lover, Selby Wall which was based on Wuornos' real-life companion Tyria Moore, was played by Christina Ricci.Bruce Dern,Lee Tergesen and Annie Corley co-star to play key supporting roles. The film was written and directed by Patty Jenkins and it was inspired by the true story of Wuornos, whose life and death was chronicled in two documentaries by filmmaker Nick Broomfield, Aileen Wuornos: The Selling of a Serial Killer, and Aileen: The Life and Death of a Serial Killer.<br/><br/>Aileen Wuornos was a woman who survived a brutal and abusive childhood in Michigan to become a thick-skinned but emotionally damaged adult. Homeless most of her life, Wuornos subsisted by working as a street prostitute; later, when she was in Florida, down to her last five dollars and pondering suicide, she stopped into a bar for a beer. There, Aileen met Selby Wall, a woman in her early twenties who had been sent to live with relatives after her Christian parents became aware of her lesbian lifestyle. Selby is immediately attracted to Aileen, and while Aileen tells Selby she's never been in a lesbian relationship, she soon finds herself equally infatuated with her. Selby runs away from her family and moves into a cheap hotel with Aileen, who initially pays the bills by hooking. However, as their money runs low and Aileen finds herself unable to land a regular job, tensions mount between the two. One night, after a john attacks her, Aileen pulls a gun and kills the man. Although her first murder can be categorized as self-defense, Aileen's loathing for the men who pay her for sex becomes so extreme that she begins killing her customers regardless of their behavior. Meanwhile, Selby slowly becomes aware of the full extent of her lover's instability and the bloody consequences of her actions.<br/><br/>Charlize Theron gives a searing, deglamorized performance as real life serial killer Aileen Wuornos, an intense, disquieting portrait of a profoundly damaged soul.This remarkable movie finds compassion for Wuornos but unflinchingly faces her brutal crimes; Theron expresses this woman's horrific life history without softening her terrifying, dead- eyed stare. This is a gripping, devastating performance, a physical and psychological transformation comparable to Robert DeNiro's in Raging Bull. The movie's moral and emotional complexity wouldn't succeed without this great performance but succeed it does, and it will stick with you for some time afterward.That is why it deserves the highest rating based on that reasons stated."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","1","2","8 July 2012"," Theron's performance is as powerful as it is intriguing
","Films take on an extra power when they show us something we can't seem to believe. Such is Charlize Theron's performance as ""America's first female serial killer,"" Aileen Wuornos, in ""Monster."" Transformation blows us away, and to see a blond Australian bombshell become a homely bisexual prostitute-turned-murderer reminds us of the power that a performance can have on a film. <br/><br/>Patty Jenkins' drama shouldn't come across as a character study as much as it does, but when your lead performance sucks in such an overwhelming amount of attention, it becomes all about how awestricken the audience is at that transformative turn. At the same time, Theron's performance also inflates the film a great deal, covering up some pacing weaknesses and a love story that never quite makes sense.<br/><br/>It's hard, however, not to be distracted by Aileen, the completely disheartening yet fascinating character Jenkins and Theron have crafted. A hooker ever since she was physically able, Aileen is especially self-sufficient and — even if misguidedly — self-confident. She's unafraid to speak her mind and surprisingly smart on her feet when her brashness lands her in trouble.<br/><br/>But things get extremely complicated when Aileen meets Selby (Christina Ricci), a lesbian loner who takes a liking to Aileen's somewhat masculine demeanor. When Aileen starts to reciprocate those feelings, her life begins to change, and it does even more so when she's forced to kill a man who picked her up and attempted to rape her. <br/><br/>Jenkins provides a number of intriguing psychological insights into Aileen. As she discovers the added benefits of killing the men she solicits sex to (revenge, a sense of fulfillment, money and the ability to try and forge a future for herself and Selby), we get an even greater sense of who she was, and more importantly, what motivated her. It's enough to understand exactly why she did it, even though her actions are nearly impossible to condone.<br/><br/>The construction of this psychological profile takes a good deal away from the journey of Aileen and Selby's relationship, which should come across more as the core of the story considering how big of a role it plays in forcing Aileen into this spiral that she can't undo despite her conscience. <br/><br/>A lot of that comes from Selby's end, as the attention on Aileen makes it harder to understand Selby's motivations for climbing in with Aileen as deep as she does. Ricci gives an honest and likable performance; we believe that she's just naive enough to run away with Aileen but smart enough to know she needs to be a bit cautious. As things hit the fan for Aileen, however, we seem to lose that access to Selby, which is the character we are expected to identify with more.<br/><br/>With Theron, the complete disguise of the makeup job certainly inflates the extent to which we believe she is giving us an incredible performance, but as you start to adjust to the brown contacts, nasty teeth and 30 extra pounds, you see Theron's brilliance comes from within. She shows a true commitment to the psychological disaster that her character had to have been in order to do what she did. Although the character is written brilliantly, this is not the kind of Oscar-winning performance in which the role won the award instead of the actor. Not just anyone could've done it.<br/><br/>As a whole, ""Monster"" gets a bit dicey. The scene writing is quite powerful. Given the nature of Aileen as a character and Theron's execution of it, you feel as if at any moment something of serious dramatic consequence might occur and it usually does. Jenkins really captures the emotions of each scene too, whether its love, fear, hate, etc. <br/><br/>The struggle comes from the whole, as ""Monster"" drags at times. There's a ""Thelma & Louise"" nature to the story, yet constantly we come across reminders that the action of the story is static. These women aren't actually on the run — they're just hiding frantically. The plot kind of goes in cycles with each new cycle bringing us closer and closer to their likely demise. We feel those stakes and Aileen and Selby have natural (albeit agitating) reactions to when things go awry, but it's tough to stay engaged when their actions will have such obvious consequences.<br/><br/>But that's kind of the point. There's never a concerted effort on Aileen's end to lie or get away with anything. She is nothing if not honest, and we respect the hell out of her for it. We want to scream at her when she says that she never had a choice to become who she became, but we understand why she feels so powerless, and that unlikely sense of empathy makes ""Monster"" a strong film.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

","Roger Ebert in his review of Monster said "" this is one of the greatest performances in cinema history."" After watching this film, I can say while that statement's a little much, Charlize Theron has provided us with the most amazing transformation in movie history. I've seen others like Heath Ledger's extraordinary portrayal of the Joker and Anthony Hopkins' all-time horror show as Dr. Hannibal Lecter. However neither film had me feeling hurt for the villain, in the way Theron portrayed Aileen Wuornos. she didn't kill for the thrill of it like the Joker and Lecter, but she killed because she felt she was protecting other people from suffering like she had at the hands of society. Theron fiercely and passionately shows us Wuornos' actions as a repurcussion for society's blissful ignorance of her need for help and acceptance as a person not as a trophy men can win and forget about in a day's time. Theron and Ricci give amazing performances and I can't believe Ricci or Toni G. the make-up artist didn't get Oscar nods in their own right. But it's Theron who makes the movie what it is and she deserves all the credit for creating the most amazing transformation in cinematic history."
"eytand94","10","1","2","4 June 2011"," A Monstrously Powerful Movie
","In the late 80's and early 90's, roadside prostitute Aileen Wuornos killed seven men before going to trial and being executed in 2002. We have seen our share of ""Lifetime"" TV dramas and biopics about serial killers, but this story is a particularly hard one to tell. Patty Jenkins and leading lady Charlize Theron have done that with ""Monster."" <br/><br/>On the verge of suicide and left with only 5 dollars in her pocket, Aileen walks into a saloon, which she quickly registers as a lesbian bar. Along comes the shy Selby Wall, a lesbian who is living with relatives who hope to cure her of her change in sexuality. Soon enough, Aileen has found her soul mate in Selby.<br/><br/>On a night out turning tricks, Aileen is raped and beaten by a man, but then shoots him to death and takes his money. From then forth, she has sealed her fate and goes on to kill more men.<br/><br/>First time director Patty Jenkins wrote and directed ""Monster"" not as a study of a murderer, but as a tragic look into the mind of a woman who has found no hope for herself in life. At times, we feel sympathy for Aileen, especially the first time she kills someone. But as her victims grow more innocent (even when her last victim tries to help her but is killed anyway), we don't know what to feel. Maybe we aren't supposed to feel anything for Aileen, but just to know who she is and what she's done allows us to connect with her. She is a monster, as the film's title tells us, but also a broken creature who has suffered enough in life to the point where she can't love and can only respond with anger and violence.<br/><br/>There's no argument about it. Charlize Theron has given the performance of her career. As great an actress as she is, this is the role people will remember her most for. It's not just the makeup transformation Theron goes through (I didn't even recognize her in the film). She becomes Aileen Wuornos. Her body language, her twitching eyes, the way she brushes her hair back, the way she holds a cigarette...Theron is gone and Wuornos is ever prevalent throughout the film. This was an Oscar well-deserved, and no one will ever be able to match Theron's portrayal.<br/><br/>Christina Ricci's performance as Selby tends to be the one thing people don't agree with about the film. This isn't bad acting that Ricci gives us, but a rather accurate portrayal of this girl. Selby's naivety and shyness is broadcast nicely by Ricci, no matter what the critics may say.<br/><br/>This movie could have taken the easy way out and simply studied Aileen Wuornos as the so-called ""first female serial killer."" But when you are able to make a movie that observes such material as a love story and an account of a brutally damaged soul, then that is a triumph. Thanks to Theron and Jenkins, ""Monster"" is that kind of triumph, a film that will stay monstrously powerful for a long time."
"alkari-1","10","1","2","15 September 2008"," Monster
","This film is the best of its year. Patty Jenkins is an awesome filmmaker.It makes Aileen Wornos look like a hero. Although there are some sexual parts that are not needed, it's still a great movie. The music effects are brilliantly made by composer BT. His music effects complete the movie. The ending is just phenomenal. It brings tears to your eyes the way you see Alieen(Chalize Theron) look at selby(Christina Ricci)and cry at her betrayal and love for her is just so heartbreaking. Charlize Theron's performance is outstanding. It is one of her best films. The makeup is done so well it's like the real Aileen Wornos is in the film. This film should be in the top 250 movies. It is and will be a great independent film of all time. I could watch this movie everyday. It's a must see film."
"cathie454","9","1","2","2 July 2007"," Great movie, and I'll never watch it again.
","Charlize Theron deserved her Oscar, maybe more than any other actress who's ever won it. I had no idea what she actually looks like before I saw this movie, and when I did see her, at the Academy Awards, I absolutely couldn't believe it was the same person. Incredible make-up, as well as her acting, went in to the most incredible characterization I've ever seen. But this movie was horribly depressing; what a terrible life that woman lived, and while you can understand why she did what she did, you can never condone it. Directing, cinematography, acting, screenplay... all great, but to me, this is not ""entertainment."" A documentary, or a book, about this woman is understandable, but not a movie meant for entertainment."
"The_Void","6","1","2","11 July 2006"," Great performances in an off-centre film
","Films about real life serial killers aren't exactly rare, but the story of Aileen Wuornos stands out from many others because it turns the common serial killer story on its head. It's well known that most serial killers are white males aged between twenty five and forty; so the fact that this killer was a woman is notable, as is the fact that Aileen Wuornos was a prostitute who killed men, when it is more commonly the other way around. Wuornos' story is well worth telling, therefore, and the fact that this film was an Oscar contender means that it received good handling and is bolstered by a pair of truly great performances from two top actresses; yet somehow, Monster isn't a great film and falls short of the high standard that many other biopics have set. The plot revolves around prostitute Aileen Wuornos' meeting with Selby; a young lesbian hanging out in a gay bar. We follow the pair as they skip from motel to motel, and we find out what drove Aileen Wuornos to a series of horrible crimes, in which she killed potential clients for their money without having to have sex with them.<br/><br/>The main reason why this film fails is because of the perspective. In any real-life serial killer biopic, no matter what reasons there were for the crimes, the killer has to be the antagonist. However, director Patty Jenkins has seen fit to make Aileen out to be a victim, and while it's evident that she had a bad life; her crimes were horrible nonetheless, and the happy 'feel good' tone of the film is abysmal in the way that it offsets the seriousness of the killer's crimes. The plot plays out like a serial killer flick fused with a romance movie, in the way that it portrays its central pair, and it's obvious that the director wanted us to feel for the plight of the lead character. Credit where credit is due, however; Patty Jenkins gets great performances out of both of her stars. The usually glamorous Charlize Theron is unrecognisable as the 'monster', and gives a brutal and realistic portrayal of the character. Christina Ricci hasn't made a lot of good films recently; but her performance here is faultless, as she brilliantly delivers a performance that takes in all the insecurities and naiveté's of her character. Overall, this film is worth seeing for the lead performances and for the basic plot line, which is interesting; but it's a shame that it wasn't given better handling."
"zoetrope-x","7","1","2","16 October 2005"," Sympathy for the Devil
","This is a tough movie. Which is good, because it should be tough. In fact, movies like this should be almost unwatchable. We watch these films though, because we are human, and we are interested. Things we don't understand fascinate us. People in situations we have never been in, people doing things we cannot imagine ourselves doing - we watch and we wonder - what would i do here? Could i ever act like that give the right circumstances? Would i sell my body if it was the only way to survive? Could i kill a man who attacked me? Could i fall into a gay relationship? And i suppose the most compelling thing is that, thank God - most of us never have to find out, so we begin to enjoy the drama and the unknown of what we are watching. And this is a dramatic and gripping movie. There is no doubt in my mind that it is a movie made with care and made well. I was glued as i'm sure millions were. And i think again, that this is all fine and good and healthy. The problem i have with movies about real life people who do terrible things is this... I found myself being so unbelievably impressed by the performance given by Charlize Theron, that i soon forgot about the real Aileen Wuornos, the woman i'd watched in the documentary 'Life and Death of a Serial Killer' who stayed with me for days after watching, images of her and bits of things she had said were trapped in my head. She terrified me and yet i found her story heartbreaking. Ahe appalled me and yet i wanted to understand her and look within myself to see reason for the things she did. But i could not - not by looking inward - I have never been abused, i have never been raped, i have not suffered even a tiny extent of the things she did. I cannot understand a woman like that - i can feel for her and i can be angered and shocked by the things she experienced, but it would be ignorant and foolish to say 'i understand'. Charlize Theron's portrayal of Aileen is so good that after watching Monster, i found things began to get muddy. I felt like i did understand. I could look within myself and see why things happened the way they did. I felt that i now understood Aileen better, that i knew her now, i could see what sort of person she was and i could now feel sympathy for her, perhaps even empathy. But now, on reflection, i suspect that this is not really the case. I was, in all honesty, seeing Theron. She plays this part so well that it is almost impossible to see where Aileen ends and Charleze begins which from a dramatic and cinematic perspective is quite an achievement, but although the character is made real, and believable and has been carefully studied, it is not real. Aileen Wuornos is not an 'impressive' woman. Be impressed by Theron, by all means, but before casting opinions of right and wrong, see the real woman. And then try to decide how you feel."
"jasonbourneagain","8","1","2","9 August 2005"," Tough to put into words how this movie makes you feel.
","I just finished watching Monster and was emotionally blocked by it.<br/><br/>The movie is easy enough to explain. A woman who has had a terrible childhood and life of parental abuse and drugs is ready to kill herself with a gun on a rain soaked highway. She became a child prostitute at 13 in order to survive and get away from her pain.<br/><br/>Now an adult, life has brought her to Florida. Her childhood dream was to become a movie star or somebody rich and beautiful like the women on TV, but suddenly that dream has stopped. She feels that she has nothing left, but to spend the last $5 she ""earned"" before desperately ending it all.<br/><br/>But before she can complete her tragic deed, her prayers are answered as faith steps in. At a bar, she meets Selby, a young girl of 18 trying to deal with her coming lesbianism. As the main character, Aileen narrates her personal story up to this point. She says of their first meeting: ""By the time I met Selby Wall. Sh*t all I wanted was a beer."" As human beings, we are all looking for love and want to be wanted. Aileen isn't any different. She needs to raise money right away in order to be with Selby, and resumes her hooking. This time with newfound purpose the viewer can observe. However, she ends up in an unfortunate, brutal encounter with a rapist and killer. She survives by killing her attacker, but afterward the strong emotions carry her away like an ocean tide. The drama builds.<br/><br/>Charlize Theron's portrayal of Aileen is such that you want her to get a break somewhere; To get her life moving in the right direction. Invigorated by Selby, she wants to taste some sweet success in her life. She is happy that she met Selby, and discovered something in herself that she was lacking -- love. But try as she might, she experiences difficulties trying to get a decent job and fulfilling dreams of a normal life. Frustrated, she lets her emotions get the better of her and slips back into the darkness.<br/><br/>Aileen goes back to earning a living as a hooker servicing the needs and desires of men on a highway. But after her justified killing incident, she is changed forever. Aileen becomes a killer and robber trying to motivate herself by remembering the first time. This transformation is disturbing and makes the viewer squirm in their seat.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie focuses on Aileen and her girl friend Selby. They are happy and go on dates. The roller skating scene is sweet and memorable. As they become familiar with each other, they fight and argue. Selby's father and step mother put pressure on her to stop seeing her ""prostitute"" friend and go work for her father. Struggling to accept her sexuality and adulthood, Selby rebels and decides Aileen will help her discover herself. The viewer is put through a gamut of emotions putting themselves in the character's shoes and remembering the experiences they've themselves had growing up.<br/><br/>Aileen continues her new way to ""earn"" money so both could survive. They go out and have adventures, one which involves an accident in a dead man's car that Aileen has stolen. Selby make new friends and Aileen worries. They lie, cheat and hurt each other. They love and make love. The characters make you feel each moment of their lives. The killing of a good Samaritan by Aileen is poignant and very sad. Aileen doesn't want to do this killing, but knows she has to or else the victim will report her to the police. Aileen's adrenaline pumping killing spree finally catches up with her and Selby. The police have gotten a sketch of the pair (from the car accident) and both are scared of capture and worried. Selby is sent away by Aileen. It is a tearful goodbye at the bus station as they may never see each other again if one or both are captured. Aileen should ready herself to finally leave Florida, but she ends up at a bar trying to get a moment's relief from her pain. Aileen is caught by undercover police in a trap they've set, sent to jail and tried.<br/><br/>In the end, I wasn't sad that Aileen was sentenced to die, but was moved that something wasn't done to help her earlier. Aileen gets frustrated and bashed by events as she has been most of her life. Thus, she makes the unfortunate choice of a life of crime and evading capture. Even Aileen's last phone conversation with Selby is fraught with doubt and we see that she is indeed being set up. At the trial, we end up seeing Aileen has discovered and experienced love, but found betrayal at the same time.<br/><br/>Monster, based on true story, ends as a tragedy as Aileen plaintively states: ""Love conquers all. Every cloud has a silver lining. Faith can move mountains. Love will always find a way. Everything happens for a reason. Where there is life, there is hope."" (laughs) ""Oh, well... They gotta tell you something."""

","I think I don't have to tell you that the critics all loved this movie. It won some important prizes and for some of them that's already enough to praise it into the heavens. However, the only problem that I have with such movies is that I start expecting the impossible. Believing that this will be a movie like I've never seen before, I regularly end up being very disappointed in it. That's also the main reason why I waited a couple of years after the release before seeing this movie.<br/><br/>""Monster"" has been based on the life of Aileen Wuornos, a prostitute who became one of America's first female serial killers. After having suffered from abuse and a drug addiction as a thirteen year old child, she has started to work as a highway prostitute. When she decides that it is time to end her life, she meets a young lesbian named Selby, with whom she starts a relationship. At first all seems to get better, but than she starts murdering her clients so she doesn't need to have sex with them in order to gain some money. For nine months everything seems to go smooth, but than she is arrested and convicted...<br/><br/>I have to admit that Charlize Theron did a very nice job and I'm convinced that her performance was worth the Oscar, but personally I think Christina Ricci was very good as well. Perhaps not everybody takes her very serious since her role in movies like the ""Adams Family"", but in ""Monster"" she proves to be a very fine actress. But some good acting isn't enough to save the entire movie of course, it needs a good story as well. Normally you could expect a very preachy and dramatic TV-movie like script, you know the kind that will only attempt to make you cry your eyes out. Not this time. This one has been written by someone who knew what she was doing. It doesn't judge and doesn't force you to swallow the opinion of the writer / director. It leaves you enough room to think and judge for yourself and I really appreciated that in this movie. All in all this is a very nice movie that certainly deserves to be watched. It's perhaps not the masterpiece some critics will make of it, but it certainly deserves a 7.5/10, perhaps even an 8/10."
"gftbiloxi","8","1","2","1 April 2005"," Extremely Well Done But Extremely Unsavory
","In 1992 Aileen Wuornos (1956-2002) stood trial for the murder of Richard Mallory in Florida. Clearly dangerous and disturbed, Wuornos was an extremely belligerent, aggressive personality, and her frequent outbursts and several bizarre circumstances turned the trial into a media circus. Convicted of Mallory's death, Wuornos also confessed to the murders of six others and remains a suspect in at least two unsolved homicides. She was executed in 2002.<br/><br/>But for all the drama of the 1992 trial, MONSTER sidesteps this aspect of the Wuornos story. It instead focuses on Wuornos herself and her relationship with lover Selby (in real life Tyria J. Moore, the name change likely due to legal issues.) And while it plays fast and loose with the facts--particularly re the Selby character--it offers a relentlessly fearsome portrait of an incredibly damaged woman whose rage twists into a vicious killing spree.<br/><br/>Charlize Theron, previously better known for good looks than acting skill, gives an inspired performance as Wuornos, seeming to inhabit the character; it is truly frightening to watch her. Although the script's Selby is hardly in the same league with real-life Tyria J. Moore, Ricci too is quite fine--a mixture of innocence and soullessness that is often quite as disturbing as Theron's more flamboyant performance. The supporting cast is also very good, with Bruce Dern notable as a biker friend and Scott Wilson particularly memorable as Wuornos' final victim.<br/><br/>When I saw the film in theatrical release I found quite a few audience members walked out on the film in disgust. And for all the power of the performances and the great artistry of the film, this is likely to be a real issue for any one who sees MONSTER. The film does an extraordinary job of making us see Wuornos and Selby as human beings--and as pitiful human beings whose lives were largely warped and twisted by circumstance rather than personal choice. Even so, both characters are dangerous, mean, manipulative, and vicious in different ways, and our pity for them will not stretch far enough to cover that.<br/><br/>In the final analysis, I do recommend the film. But before you rush to see it simply because it picked up a well-deserved Academy Award for Theron, you might do well to ask yourself: do I really want to know these people? And if you are unsure, you'd probably do better to give it a miss--for you might well be one of the people walking out midway through.<br/><br/>Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer"

","After having seen an actual documentary on Aileen Wuornos (dir. Nick Broomfield), I had to see what all the fuss was about Monster. And, to be honest, I've never been a fan of Charlize Theron. I give her full credit--his was her role, she stole the show. Theron truly embodies Wuornos, she transcends most acting performances on the big screen. <br/><br/>As for the rest of the film--it was most satisfying overall, excepting Christina Ricci's portrayal. Unfortunately (or fortunately) for her, she's just too pretty for the role. If you watch Broomfield's doc you'll see what I mean. In the manner of accuracy, she didn't seem to add much to the film. Make sure to check out the doc and Monster to get the most out of it all."

","Aileen Wuornos was an obnoxious character. A highway prostitute by profession, she was ugly and foul-mouthed. She is considered to be the first female serial killer in the US. In this movie one of the most beautiful women in the world, Charlize Theron played this character and how. Hers is perhaps the most powerful acting performance by an actress I have ever seen (Hilary Swank in 'Boys don't cry' comes close). The make-up effect was extra-ordinary. How can one not mention those eyebrow-less large eyes and that flabby pimpled face, totally different from Charlize's own? And she just defined the character. She put on weight, brought out that small-town accent, that careless gait. Her Oscar win was totally obvious, now I see. And the other female character, Aileen's teenage lesbian friend Selby, was also totally awesome. This is Christina Ricci's best too. She perhaps deserved a nomination.<br/><br/>Apart from acting, the movie is disturbing. I beg to differ from the common opinion. I think the movie is not brilliantly made. I've seen enough movies with disturbing and controversial basic theme but many of them are so superbly made that watching them never becomes tiresome. Here I got bored in the middle. Had it been not Charlize Theron, I would have probably change the channel. All the tortures on Aileen or all the murder scenes somehow lack art. This is not a movie I would watch a second time. Only because of acting and its superior screenplay I'd give it 4/5."

But all the wonderment at her uglifying herself for this role overshadows the performance by Christina Ricci, who turned in an excellent piece of work herself. She must be taken seriously as a dramatic actress now. Patty Jenkins' direction was good inasmuch as she never called attention to herself. Kudos also to Annie Corley in a small role.<br/><br/>A word about Aileen Wuornos. It is too bad that she had such a terrible life. But lots of people have terrible lives and yet do not go on killing sprees.

","Anyone who can not see the performance Charlize gave in this movie as outstanding has been watching too many Jennifer Lopez movies. I compare this movie to Taxi Driver for its social commentary. Both movies give perfect examples of how the evil of this world can push someone who already lives on the edge of reality over it. To say the only reason anyone gave this movie any attention is because of the makeover of Charlize should really consider removing Gigli and Glitter from their DVD collection.<br/><br/>I am glad they are coming out with a new version as the original extras were disappointing. Who cares how they integrated the DTS sound? I wanted more on Alieen, something along the lines of American Justice is what is needed because at the end of the movie you find yourself wanting to understand more about Alieen."

","As an abused child, now a woman, and as a woman who has been raped many times by my husband, this movie was a moment of truth for me, if I stay and accept this ""reality"" then I am no better than Aileen who chose to do this for love, which was joined EQUALLY by the other person. As a theater/directing major, this movie was amazing, especially what Charlize went through to be able to portray Aileen, it was to the point of why Aileen did what she did, unfortunately, many people who have been abused or raped try to hide. I am personally surprised that Charlize won an award for this film, for the ONLY reason that society does not respond well to people who have been abused or raped."

A hooker trying to survive in a world that (metaphorically) had killed her long before she gets executed. I don't know how closely this movie follows the real story, but it's riveting.<br/><br/>Now, this is not the type of movie that I plan on seeing again anytime soon. But I did buy the DVD because it's worth watching several times. I just think that I need a year between viewings to catch my breath! The acting by the rest of the cast is pretty darn good too.

"naughtibutnice","10","1","2","21 December 2004"," Powerful and beautiful story.
","I watched Monster, shortly after watching the documentary on Aileen Wurnos and its version of events not only sticks to the documentary's version, but it delivers Aileen's story from her side of the fence, it concentrates on her loss and deprivation of love. Her determination to find someone, anyone who could love her, how she truly deserved to be loved. The film does not focus on her childhood, skipping briefly through and it and engaging more on the events surrounding the murders, but it does depict the emotions and feelings she still has from her past, in the actions and thoughts she has later on in the movie. Throughout we get a sense that we have missed something, somewhere along the way and not knowing what it is, is more of a comfort than an annoyance. It adds to the texture of the film and only makes the viewer more inquisitive to continue watching.<br/><br/>At the start of the movie we see her on the brink of suicide, desperate to be released from her hooking and the cold backlash of society. She then goes to a gay bar (unintentionally) and meets Selby, a lost confused girl whose parents have sent her away due to her feelings towards girls. Even in this first encounter with Aileen we see her anger and hatred buried deep beneath the surface at first but emerging, recklessly and powerfully. As her relationship with Selby grows, so does she as a person. But as she gains love and other joys, which she has been so accustomed to live without, the harshness and reality of the world slap her in the face. We wonder whether the murders are a reflection of her search to conquer her hate. As she has the love that she longed so much for.<br/><br/>The first murder is portrayed completely and utterly honestly and shockingly. When I first saw this scene I actually felt myself crying, but more with anger and frustration than anything else. We see Aileen being beaten and raped, a shell with nothing inside, just a hooker. It shows us as an audience the way that most men view her. She isn't a person; she is a hooker, a piece of meat. The scene was well acted scripted and filmed. The shock and horror in Aileen's eyes when he pours the petrol over her is so terrifying to watch it's almost unbearable. <br/><br/>The other murders that follow are not particularly motivated by anything other than her need for money and hatred of men. But I believe that in some respects she felt attacked by the other men as well. She had been raped since the age of 8. The male authority figures in her life beat her and raped her. Even when she is older we see a policeman ""helping her out"" it is so awful and it opens peoples eyes to events which do take place within society even today. The authority figures we look to for help and advice can be those who turn against us and become like everyday criminals.<br/><br/>I think the film is beautiful, not only in its message but in the sad life of Aileen. I respect her, I respected her in the documentary. I think if she had been given just some chance, some hope from anyone then it might have altered her actions, but in a way she did prove a point and people will remember her for along time to come. The film shows a woman who society condemned without even giving her the chance. We shut out people because of skin colour, jobs, and religion and yet we do not even identify the problems within ourselves. Aileen was like any other woman trying to survive in the world and yet we blame her for murdering the people who in society today are still raping and beating and hurting innocent girls who turn to prostitution as the only way out. I loved this film so much and I loved Aileen I truly felt for her. Whilst not excusing her actions nor condoning them I understood them. I felt I understood her as a person and felt that she was so unjustly mistreated throughout her whole life.<br/><br/>Charlize does an amazing job at portraying Aileen, in every possible way. Her mannerisms, her voice, her actions, her laugh, her personality. Everything was polished to perfection in this outstanding performance. I was not as impressed with Christina Ricci and thought that an actress more suitable would be somebody like Juliette Lewis who is an amazing actress also. I thought Ricci looked the part but her acting has never been anything above average. Charlize really took my breath away and I was not only amazed but shocked at how similar she looked and behaved in comparison to the real Aileen Wurnos. This film I think is not to be taken lightly. It is a highly impressive, true story, which is responsible in my opinion for, opening societies eyes and impressing the reality of life for some people in the world on us all. I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to be touched and impressed. 10/10 easily."
"hidel_51","10","1","2","27 November 2004"," A powerful movie, tremendous acting, not ""Pretty Woman"" in the least.
","A riveting portrayal of pathetic yet tragic ""lost soul"" who is impossibly isolated, deluded, and kicked adrift from the rigid constraints and safety of ""normal"" life (yet all the while yearning for some form of acceptance and normalcy). Theron is amazing in the lead role, and Ricci shines as the misfit lesbian. If you've never taken the time to be thankful for what you have, this movie will make you stop and realize it could be worse, a lot worse. The acting is gritty and totally believable. Theron alternately captures the fear, frustration, and utter helplessness of the down-and-out prostitute's situation - a dreamer, a loser, full of suppressed self-loathing and flash-point anger. The movie may be a little too sympathetic in it's portrayal of a killer, and manipulative in the use of some stinging (some would say stereotyped) social commentary, but it resounds with a sense of reality, truth, and even remorse. A tremendously powerful movie that should cause you to reflect - this is not ""Pretty Woman""."
"dec11","Null","1","2","18 October 2004"," Is this film fair to men?
","Monster is an excellent film portrayed effectively by Theron. However can we justify the portrayal of Aileen? If this had a been a male serial killer who had suffered a similar abusive childhood as Aileen would we feel any sympathy towards him? I doubt so.<br/><br/>This case was so unique, Aileen was often described as the first female serial killer, it seems her abusive childhood has overshadowed what she actually did. She killed numerous men in cold blood and ONE in self defence, if this had been a man killing women in cold blood we would agree that he should be put to death. In a society where equality for women is a sensitive issue, why do we sympathies with Aileen? Her first murder was done purely out of self defence, but the subsequent killings where done purely for money, these men never threatened to rape or kill her. In her final killing a man begs for his life and yet she still kills him in cold blood for doing nothing other than offering her a lift. Can we really say an abusive childhood is an excuse for the violent acts carried out by either men or women?"
"sleino2","Null","1","2","25 September 2004"," about Aileen
","I am completely disgusted and appalled by what's been said here about Aileen. Sure, she did horrible choices and mistakes in her life but she was very much a victim herself. How can anyone be so daft to claim otherwise?<br/><br/>I can totally understand how someone with her history ends up disgusted by men and becomes a murderer. Can't people understand that even murderers are humans? I just do not believe that people are born killers, born bad, born without a conscience. Not everyone of us are strong enough to be able to function by the society's rules. It is hypocrisy to put all the blame on people like Wuornos and not look at the circumstances and the faults in the society. That's exactly what is brilliant about this film- it shows us more than just the surface. On top of all, men who sleep with hookers get no sympathy whatsoever from me, but of course that does not mean they should all be killed. But just think about it; what reason did Aileen have not to kill, to hope for a better future, to love and feel sympathy for people? None, whatsoever.<br/><br/>The film was extremely difficult to watch, but brilliant."
"CuriosityKilledShawn","6","1","2","31 July 2004"," Sympathy for the devil
","Though this film is brutally honest about Aileen 'Lee' Wuornos' crimes it does provoke some sympathy for her. Yes, she does kill many people (all men) but when you consider how many men battered her and raped her all through her life, even as a child, it's no surprise she became so psychotic.<br/><br/>And I don't think it's exactly fair that she got the death penalty. Surely it would have been best to help a woman who lived her entire existence in the dregs of society (which is surely to blame for sending her mad) than executing her. <br/><br/>Focusing entirely on Lee instead of the police investigations following her (there is a TV movie from the mid-90s that does exactly this if you're more interested), we see her straggle from thinking about suicide, hooking up with lonely, naive Selby (Christina Ricci), killing in self-defense and finally killing for revenge/money.<br/><br/>Charlize Theron completely vanishes as she brings her take on Lee (her full name is never mentioned in the film) to the screen. She sure deserved her Academy Award and Christina Ricca (who is very cute here) is also very good. However, for a lesbian couple I just didn't see any real feeling between them. It annoyed me how fast the film moved and there are not really many quiet moments for these two characters to bond in any way. Yes, they proclaim their love for each other but I just didn't see it. There was too much shouting and screaming.<br/><br/>There are no surprises in the film, as we all know how it ends anyway. But some of Lee's killings are harsh, compelling and even ironic. The overall effect of the film isn't so long-lasting on me though.<br/><br/>It's shot and lit like a TV movie and Lee's heavy judgment at the end of the film is played down. For a film that is slightly biased to her point of view it's annoying that her unfair trial and life are not exploited just a little bit more for us to gain a little extra insight into the making of a 'monster'.<br/><br/>Keep a lookout for Kane Hodder as an undercover cop near the end.<br/><br/>The DVD is in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen with Dolby/DTS 5.1 sound and some slight extras."
"angelathome","Null","1","2","23 July 2004"," Spoiler, Rated 10; totally devastating, a MUST SEE
","""Monster"" is based on a true story of (allegedly) the ""First Female Serial Killer"". My first thought while the credits were still running was ""there but for the grace of God go I"". Everything about the movie, including the stated intentions of those who made the movie, is not to take a position to judge or vindicate the crimes Lee Wuornos committed. Rather the purpose of the movie is to portray the truth, as much as possible, about a world most people never experience and don't want to know about, yet are intensely fascinated with.<br/><br/>The movie left me with a desire to know more facts about Ms. Wuornos' life. For those who are as curious as I, there is an excellent Law Report by Phyllis Chesler, Ph.D., titled ""Sexual Violence Against Women and a Woman's Right to Self-Defense: The Case of Aileen Carol Wuornos"", dated October 9, 1993 (Search for Aileen Wuornos). Some of the facts garnered from Dr. Chesler's report are these: Lee was 33 when she committed her first murder on November 30, 1989; composite sketches appeared on the News in December of 1990; she was arrested January 9, 1991 and confessed to killing five ""johns"" over the course of the intervening 13 months; her trial lasted 13 days, from January 13, to January 30, 1992; the jury deliberated 91 minutes before finding her guilty, with an additional hour and 48 minutes to recommend the death penalty. She then spent nearly 11 more years on death row before being executed by the State of Florida on October 9, 2002 at the age of 46. Her lover's name was Tyria Moore, who was 18 when she met Lee. And, here is a bizarre coincidence: her second public defender attorney's name was Tish Jenkins; the movie ""Monster"" was written and directed by Patty Jenkins.<br/><br/>It is my personal belief that movies are meant, as all art is meant, to be experienced for the value of what the viewer can learn; lessons in life, sugarcoated by a good dramatic story to hold the interest of the audience. FOR THIS REASON ALONE, I GIVE ""MONSTER"" A 10.<br/><br/>Whatever your personal opinion of the subject matter may be, you will get a chance to exercise your gray matter, to perhaps come away from the movie sadder and wiser.<br/><br/>The movie takes its title from a ferris-wheel, called the ""Monster"" that Lee rode as a young child. The writer/director uses letters written by Lee to her lifelong hometown friend to recreate the thoughts and experiences of this tragic woman's life story. As a former hooker myself, I can personally validate Lee's thoughts, as she watches her young lover's gaiety at Fun World: People look down their noses at hookers, but they have no idea the guts it takes to be one; everyone thinks hookers take the ""easy way out"". Lee recalls her experience on the Monster Ferris Wheel; how she thought it looked so cool, but the experience of it made her vomit; she recalls this sardonic juxtaposition as she showers off the blood of one of her victims. Later, as she rides the ferris-wheel at Fun World with her young, naive lover, you can see her gorge rise and you realize Lee is afraid of heights, but is riding the ferris-wheel because her young love is thrilled by it. When her girlfriend notices the discomfort in Lee's expression and asks Lee if she is OK, Lee swallows her fear and reassures the girl she is fine. For me, that is the ""core moment"" of this tragic story.<br/><br/>How often do we face our fears for the sake of the innocents we love? Lee doesn't enjoy hooking, in fact she fears it, and endures that fear for her life's and loves' sake. We learn in the movie that Lee was sexually raped/molested by her dad's best friend from the age of 8, and that her dad physically beat Lee, blaming her and not his ""friend"". Lee endured pregnancy as a result of rape at age 13, giving the baby up for adoption. After that her father killed himself (we never find out anything about Lee's mother in the film), and her brothers and sisters were taken in by neighbors with the condition that Lee doesn't hang around them, leaving a homeless and ""ruined"" Lee to support herself by prostitution. Lee gives her siblings money for ""clothes and stuff""; money she earned by selling her body; when someone at a party publicly declares Lee ""slept"" with some guy, she is ejected forcibly by her embarrassed siblings into the snow. After this final abandonment, Lee leaves town, ending up in Florida, where the film opens; she has been a hooker for 20 more weary years of plying her trade as a ""street whore"", working mostly truck stops and living as a homeless and hopeless alcoholic, beaten and battered by the men in her life, and only an unspent 5 dollar bill keeps her from putting a bullet in her head. As her ""only"" friend, Thomas, tells her ""I know you didn't dial up your life on a telephone, but because you had to live; what you are feeling now is the guilt that me and other vets felt after the war; it is circumstance, and no one who hasn't been there will ever understand that"".<br/><br/>Prostitution is ""the second oldest profession""; soldiering is the oldest. As Lee says to ""her girl"" , ""People kill each other every day, for religion or politics. It's just the way the world is"".<br/><br/>Like I said, this movie will make you think."

They meet at a gay bar at a time when Eileen has given up on love and life. The one thing that she has been looking for her whole life is love. The killing spree is secondary to the core plot.

","""Monster"" is a film written and directed by Patty Jenkins. It is based on a true story of a Florida serial killer named Aileen Wournos. Charlize Theron stars as Aileen while Christina Ricci plays her helpless girlfriend Selby. Aileen opens the movie attempting suicide. The prostitute decides to spend her last five dollars she performed oral sex for, at the nearest bar with the intentions of not wasting her hard earned money. If God has a plan for her, now would be His last opportunity. After she gets a beer, she is approached by a young lesbian. She makes it clear that she is by no means gay, then becomes friends with the girl. They end up staying the night together and Aileen falls in love. Aileen asks the girl to run away with her. They live in a hotel off the earnings Aileen has made from whoring. One of her customers ends up raping her and attempts to kill her, but she ends up freeing herself and killing him. From then on, she decides to take her customer's money and lives, rather than to perform sexual favors for them, that is until the point when the faces of Aileen and Selby appear as wanted on the television. The critical intention of the movie is monitoring a woman crossing over from good to evil. It attempts to portray Aileen's last attempt to love someone or be loved by someone.<br/><br/>An aspect of the movie that amazed me was the costume and make-up. The artists took one of the most beautiful women in Hollywood and turned her into a street hooker. I find it amazing that Charlize gained thirty pounds for the film. She really grasps the character of the movie. I also enjoyed the movie because it was based on a true story. I like watching or reading something that has actually happened because I feel like I can more relate to it. Something I didn't like about the movie was the vulgar language used. I thought it also concentrated on the love life between the two rather than the actual murders that Aileen committed. I think that the movie should have concentrated more on the murders because it is the significant part of Aileen's life. If the viewer enjoys crime and dramas, this movie might appeal to them, but the plot lagged and the ending was abrupt. This is not a movie I would recommend."
"Cheesedemon28","Null","1","2","5 June 2004"," ""They Gotta Tell You Something...""
","I just want to start off by saying that it's a shame that people focus solely on Charlize Theron's performance in this movie. Not that it's a poor performance, no, quite the contrary. But she alone does not carry this film. Great acting, a touching story, wonderful cinematography, and superb direction (especially for a first movie!), make this one of the best movies of last year.<br/><br/>Yes, it's hard to feel sympathy for Wuornos after the fourth or fifth john she kills, and about 3/4 through the movie the ""I did it all for you"" excuse seems a little half-assed. But writer/director Patty Jenkins isn't looking for sympathy for Aileen ""Lee' Wuornos. This is one of those movies that isn't one way or another. Like most great films, it just is. <br/><br/>Theron's performance is good, definitely Oscar-caliber, whatever that means,<br/><br/>but still WAY overhyped. She's still a young actress who isn't at her best yet, but she's definitely showing signs of great skill. Christina Ricci also does a fine job.<br/><br/>I totally did not expect the romantic plot involved in Monster. I expected a pretty much straight-up biopic, but I got a somewhat tender homosexual romance that, very tragically, goes awry. It's a very sad movie. If you're looking for an upper, stick to Amelie or some feel-good title along those lines. This is very depressing.<br/><br/>Also, don't take your kids to see this. The cursing is through the roof, but there's a very violent rape scene as well as some very violent killings. Most of it is deserving of an R, but the rape scene in particular borders on an X.<br/><br/>Patty Jenkins is one of the two big new directors of last year, the other being Sofia Coppola.

"oneflewovertheapocalypse","Null","1","2","3 May 2004"," Powerful and Unsettling
","I haven't seen a more powerful film since Bully.   All powerful films I count as the best are anything by Larry Clark till I saw Monster.   I know the story as I saw the fantastic documentary by Nick Bloomfield about Aileen Wuormos on Death Row, but when seeing the film it looked or the more real and disturbing.    However we don't really know the truth do what actually happened.  All we know is what she said and that's it.   I am not saying what happened to her was right because it is anything and everything but that but we have to look at all the directions of this story to know what really is the truth.    Nick Bloomfield said she was `mad' when talking to the press in his documentary and I think he clearer to the truth than we are ever going to get.  Her childhood was never the best and obviously scared her for life and made her think that there was no way out even when trying to find one.   The scene where she has tried to get a job and told that there would only be factory work for her and causes a stir and a policeman picks her up and just uses her in the same way other men do and that is treating her like a whore.   So in that respect she never could trust anyone because they were all the same to her even in the eyes of the law.<br/><br/>
The film is just not about her killing spree but her friendship that she made with a young lesbian girl named Shelby.  Shelby played by Christina Ricci is a loner and lives in a very strict religious family that tries to cure her from being a homosexual.   This is how Shelby and Aileen meet in a bar where Shelby is sitting on her till she sees Aileen.   At first they are not the best of friends but the friendship blossoms  and before you know they are the best of friends but are still unaware of their sexuality towards each other.   The chemistry between them is electric and there is always scenes where you think this and that is going to happen.   The story flows nicely without any boring scenes happening and I believed that Naomi Watts was more deserving of the Oscar but after seeing Monster I do now believe that Charlize Theron was better off to get it.   De Niro set the standard for male actor's when getting into character for like he did in Raging Bull and Theron has done it for female leads as she really did look like a true monster in the film.   Not being bias or anything it's just when you look at her in The Devil's Advocate and The Italian Job you think `Hello' but in Monster it's more like `Right!!!'.  Well that's what I think but fair do's to Theron for pulling that off and an amazing performance to go with it which is why she deserves her praise.<br/><br/>The shock factor of the film is higher than usual especially when she meets her first victim in which an object is used on her in the most horrific and terrifying scene I have seen for a long time and with Theron's excellent performance it pulls it off to make you feel really uneasy about this film. It's such a tragic story of somebody who could not be saved from her downfall but it's uplifting to see that she always believed in what she told the world and she was not afraid to admit to what she did but people didn't see it from her point of view.   Because there are truth's and lies about what really happened I would have preferred to have not seen any of her killing's.   I would have liked to have seen instead her in the situation with the men that she was with and then for the scene to finish for it to go back after it has all happened so you have to make your own mind up whether she was just a cold blooded killer or a damsel in distress and just defended her rights and did what she had to do.<br/><br/>This is a great directorial debut from Patty Jenkins and if she approaches her films to come the way she with Monster then we have a lot to look forward to.   As for the movie it is a very powerful portrayal of Aileen Wuornos and the amazing story that made her being officially none as the first female serial killer but we are not Hannibal Lector here but a more real to life and truthful story of struggle and normality."

","A film which will be remembered primarily for the physical transformation of Charlize Theron into Aileen Wuornos, the female serial killer who was executed in 2002. I appreciated the bravura acting of Ms. Theron, but it seems to me to be another product of what I call the Rainman Syndrome.someone who takes physical mannerisms and gross caricature in the service of a socially marginalized character (be they mentally or physically handicapped or suffer from some form of psychosis) and builds a performance primarily out of those elements. Throw in some Austin Powers teeth and feathered hair, and you've got the Oscar wrapped up. I also felt the real heart of the story was that of Selby. Here is the true tragedy.a shy young woman who gradually accepts her homosexuality and fights a running battle with her family and peers. She sees the strength and fighting spirit in Wuornos,  and begins to assert herself because of it.  She is marginalized, but she is not a sociopath. Fortunately for her, she comes to realize the depths of Wuornos mental illness and her crimes. She is saved by her social conscience, but Wuornos is not. It is also a tragedy that such a clearly ill woman is executed, but this is only dealt with in a throwaway manner in the film's ultimate scene. I think Ricci's performance is in some ways more touching and heartfelt, subtle and therefore unsung. To me, Wuornos clearly had no chance from the get-go. Although her defiance and desperation were palpable, she really had no where to go once the inciting incident (the first murder) occurred. One annoyance: the rock soundtrack used to underscore the blossoming sexual energy between Theron and Ricci. I felt it was inappropriate to employ the kind of crass manipulative technique which would be more at home in a Joe Eszterhas movie, rather than in a sober portrayal of a real life serial killer."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","1","2","29 February 2004"," Vigilante or murderer?
","Spoiler <br/><br/>As Monster has not yet been shown in Hong Kong, I was particularly happy to catch it in Singapore before the Oscar results were out. Much have been said about Charlize Theron's top-notch performance, and her Oscar is indisputably deserved, after a deserving but somewhat controversial Nichole Kidman last year and an absolutely undeserving Halle Berry two years ago. My vote from the heart, however, goes to Keisha Castle-Hughes. <br/><br/>Turning from Charlis Theron to Aileen Wuornos, the questions become whether the audience will accept the sympathetic portrayal, regardless of how brilliant is has been artistically. Here, I plead complete ignorance to the actual case, and rely on what the film depicts. Despite what Aileen said to Selby (Christina Ricci), that people gets murdered every day out there in the real world, murder is certainly beyond the realm of experience of an average person. While the film does not belabour the horrible childhood that Wuornos went through, the message is clear enough: that she is more of a victim than a criminal. But then, there is also a vigilante aspect, which reminds me of Charles Bronson's Death Wish (1974) which made the strongest statement in that regard. In both cases, some of the people murdered by the vigilante probably deserved to be killed. Death Wish is too long ago for me to remember the details. Wuornos' killings, however, are clearly not all vigilante. On the other hand, the film has taken care to show that Wuornos is not a psychopathic murderer turned loose, in the scene where she has the most rough-looking john. It seems that she is starting to lose control of herself, when the guy turns out to be milder than a pussycat, declaring that it's his first time. Looking disgusted, but also without a trace of sympathy, she satisfied him in the simplest and quickest way. When it's over, he whimpers an almost inaudible 'thank you' and her equally subdued 'you're welcome' might have been the only funny moment in the entire film. Yet it's also making a point, that Wuornos does not appear to be a completely mindless serial murderer.<br/><br/>As I said, murder is something that is beyond the personal experience of most people and I am certainly thankful that I did not happen to be one of the people in the jury box in Wuornos' trial. To smaller, daily things, however, an average person can relate at closer range. Consider two similar scenes in a restaurant outburst in two movies: Wuornos when asked to put out a cigarette in a no-smoking restaurant and the character played by Jack Nicholson in 5 Easy Pieces (1970) at an obnoxious waitress. While we are prepared to cheer for the latter, it is not quite as easy to forgive the former. <br/><br/>While Therons dominates the entire movie, Ricci holds her own in the portrayal of Selby, first in her wild-eye innocence, then subtly evolving as the relationship turns and twists. Although not quite Oscar calibre, Ricci's performance effectively complements Therons'. Ricci is also an actress with a unique air about her, blending beautifully into a movie like Sleepy Hollow (1999)."

","Theron did a good job playing the role of a broken and confused soul desperately trying to find a reason to live in another, and Christina Ricci plays a rather subtle introverted lesbian kid trying to find acceptance in a puzzle-like world she perceives beyond her.  Storyline is mostly slack free but do get syrupy/message-oriented on occasion - if you like that then fine.<br/><br/>Finally, for playing the broken messed up women role, my present favorite is still Emily Watson in ""Breaking the Waves"", but that's a whole different story."

","Charlize Theron did an excellent job in the movie Monster and in my opinion deserves to be awarded the best actress award. My problem with the movie is that the majority of the focus of the movie was portraying her as the victim in a love relationship with another female. Sprinkled in the film was Charlize's character killing men as a prostitute for a few dollars. This was a movie based on a true story where Charlize's character was executed in Florida for all of her murders. In my opinion, whomever directed and produced this movie was trying to show the human side of murder and that she did not deserve the death penalty.  I realize that this was NOT a documentary, but it could have enhanced the real trial proceedings instead of covering it up with soft music."

Roger Ebert's ""This is one of the greatest performances in the history of the cinema"" statement is impressive considering who it's coming from...  I have no reason to dispute it, since I can't recall a more comprehensive embodiment of a character as Charlize did of Aileen Wuornos.

","Love and life can be cruel and down right hellish. This is a stark bio of Aileen Wuornos(Charlize Theron)who grew up in Michigan and was forced to deal with abuse, drugs and after becoming a prostitute having a child by the age 13. Wuornos would eventually move to Florida and take her anger out on men she ""serviced"" along the highway. She would enter into a lesbian relationship with a shy younger woman Selby(Christina Ricci)more than likely looking for acceptance. During a nine month period in 1989 and 1990 Wuornos would murder seven of her ""Johns"" to avenge being raped and beaten.<br/><br/>
Theron is excellent and her hard work has earned her an Oscar nomination. Ricci is believable as the young lover. Bruce Dern plays the part of an old man who befriends the highway prostitute. Vivid foul language, sexual content and brutal violence makes this a strong R.  The lesbian love making is urgent and eye popping. Believe it or not the title MONSTER is not in reference to Wuornos."

"jdesando","Null","1","2","16 January 2004"," Two superlatives apply to writer/director Patty Jenkins' `Monster': best actress and grimmest film of 2003.
","Two superlatives apply to writer/director Patty Jenkins' `Monster': best actress and grimmest film of 2003. Charlize Theron (`The Italian Job') transformed physically (30 pounds and prominent prosthetic teeth) and mentally (Theron not for a second leaves her character) into serial killer Aileen Wuornos.  Theron is every reason to see this account of an abused, disturbed hooker turned murderer (convicted in 1992 of at least 6 murders, one probably in self defense); nothing else in the film is unusual storytelling or acting, not even graphically as compelling as this sure Oscar nominee. She embodies Brendan Francis's description of prostitutes as `women of action. Talk is not their stock in trade.'<br/><br/>The grimness of the film comes directly out of the subject matter: a story about a prostitute without Julia Roberts in the lead or a benign twist just won't keep an American audience's attention, especially if there is more graphic display in a current teenage slasher flick. So the audience for `Monster' is likely to squirm at the least or be revolted at Aileen's rough persona and meaningless life, filmed in dark tones with little color, not even much red blood. The intellectual satisfaction of understanding how this murderer got into a violent mess cannot mitigate the desire to leave the theater the way you would leave a smoky bar because you were stuck next to a sweaty biker dude with garish tattoos and a foul mouth.<br/><br/>Christina Ricci (`The Ice Storm') plays Aileen's 18-year-old Ohio lesbian friend, Selby, in such a mysterious way as to make it uncertain if she is acting well or not at all. Selby eventually testifies against Aileen, but even during their most passionate moments as lovers, where Aileen acts out the male, protective role, Selby's motivation for her attraction to Aileen is unclear and hardly believable given the physical, social, and emotional distance between the two.<br/><br/>Theron trumps easily last year's Oscar winner Nicole Kidman in `The Hours,' where her nose could hardly compete with Theron's entire body.  Kidman's understated Virginia Woolf required much less range than Theron's sneering, fleshy, manic Aileen Wuornos. Closest to Theron's triumph is Hillary Swank's 1999 Oscar winning performance as Teena Brandon turned Brandon Teena in `Boys Don't Cry, ` another tragic story of a sexual misfit and murder. Though Swank's performance required a more refined protagonist than Theron's, both actresses made the bizarre believable.<br/><br/>Naomi Watts in `21 grams' and Patricia Clarkson in `Station Agent' and `Pieces of April' are worthy of 2003 Oscar nominations. They will have to wait, however, until another year, for this one belongs to Charlize Theron, an actress so attractive in `Cider House Rules' that I thought she would never compromise her blonde, cherry-lipped supremacy.  She did, and she will win for that surrender."

","Monster is a deeply affecting film based on the unbelievably sad life of Aileen Wuornos, whose tragic story is done justice here by writer/director Patty Jenkins and Charlize Theron, who portrays Wuornos (known as ""Lee"" in the film) with dazzlingly fearless abandon. I have always been a fan of Theron's, and I'm very pleased to see her getting such fantastic praise for this performance. Surely she will at least receive an Oscar nomination, and Christina Ricci is equally deserving; she nails her character Selby (based on the real-life Tyria Moore) brilliantly as well. <br/><br/>The thing that makes this movie more than just another ""based on a true story"" melodrama is the rawness and truth of its emotional core - here we have a woman, raped and abused from childhood on who sees no other options for herself but to become a hooker, brutally marginalized by society, whose life is just one long series of bewildered confusion (although she believes she sees things very clearly in her deluded state), who meets someone (Tyria/Selby) that needs HER, someone she believes she can invest all her love in (and she does have a lot of love to give). Unfortunately her mind is far too warped by this point, and it doesn't help that Selby (in the film) is a complete emotional cripple, a virtual black hole of need, and this is what eventually undoes the situation. <br/><br/>-=- POSSIBLE SPOILERS -=- Ironically, Selby ultimately betrays Lee in what she believes to be an act of survival, which is what, if nothing else, she has learned from Lee, and even more ironic is the fact that Lee, the ultimate survivor (living through abuse, rape, brutality of every kind, years of prostitution and more) is not able to survive love."

We get a glimpse of her teen years when she so desperately wanted someone to take a liking to her, but she simply lacked the social skills to allow this to happen. Charlize Theron is mesmerizing and unrecognizable as Wournos.  The combination of weight gain, make-up and mannerisms bring Wournos to life - she becomes this messed up human being longing for companionship.

"lothos-370-690020","4","2","7","5 June 2017"," Hit and miss
","Well acted and heart wrenching but totally inaccurate. <br/><br/>One thing that stood out to me was the almost apologetic portrayal of Therons character. Quite seemingly brave to attempt this, until you realise it was completely fabricated. Not once in all the films made about real male serial killers has Hollywood attempted to make them sympathetic characters, and with good reason, they were monsters, and so was Wuornos. None of the films made about male serial killers showed lengthy scenes involving their abusive parents or upbringing. The horrible acts committed against them never put centre stage. When portraying the stories of John Gasey or Ted Bundy I don't remember a violent beating or rape, despite many of the most notorious male serial killers having been abused themselves.<br/><br/>To concentrate on this to make the audience sympathetic does a severe disservice to the memory of her victims, and this demonstrates the stark contrast to so many films of a similar nature. Reversing the gender of the killer speaks to a dishonesty and political bias within mainstream media to portray women as victims and men as attackers.<br/><br/>Jenkins took the time to include the phrase based on true events but distorted the truth to suit her own agenda. While the film is well made, it is hard to ignore these biases, especially in an age when feminism has done it's best to create a war between the sexes under the facade of equality."
"redsandro","4","2","7","13 May 2007"," This movie kind of sucked
","They actually did quite a good job portraying a situation here.. using heavy makeup to make Aileen look like she's had a though life. She manages to do good face-acting. But 109 minutes of overdone mouth-corners forced downwards while smiling become really annoying, it gives me a sense of irrealism even if she's had a though life. And the annoyances continue.<br/><br/>The movie would be somewhat more successful if I could identify with one of the characters. But Aileen snaps too quick and Selby puts up with that and too much else to the point where it becomes lame. They are both pretty annoying people and the drama they get themselves into is pretty self inflicted in a way that prevents any compassion from the audience's point of view. Selby's cute (and innocent) face does affect this in a good way though, but that's overshadowed by annoyance and heavy predictability. What should have been a powerful aspect of the movie that would make you more tolerant to all the annoyances, namely their love for each other, is shown far too meagerly to make up for anything.<br/><br/>Finally there's voice over by Aileen, being a bit cool and it could make the movie more powerful, but it turns out she isn't narrating the story at all. It's like she randomly remembers to say something. Carefully written, this could be far more powerful.<br/><br/>Love, compassion, narration and predictability all have failed in this movie, making it close to a waste of time to watch. Although the last one isn't very flexible when photographing a true story."

","I'm sorry, but I neglect to see what's so great about this movie.<br/><br/>Acting: we all know how great Charlize Theron is in her Oscar-Winning role, so I need not add further comment in risk of sounding redundant. But her character Aileen is so flawed, we don't see her as a three-dimensional serial killer, which would've been the logical thing to do, but instead all we see is a foul-mouthed bi-polar piece of trash...who killed people. Christina Ricci as Selby was also extremely difficult to relate to, let alone sympathize with. She was just an annoying brat who went with Aileen for no apparent reason.<br/><br/>Writing: The writing is TERRIBLE! The script is mind-numbingly bad, wallowing in a pool of mediocrity. I've seen eight year olds who have written better (Literally). The screenplay makes Plan 9 From Outer Space look like Network in comparison. Characters act and react with no apparent reasoning, and it is utterly incapable in holding a narrative story, instead we have a cut and pasted collage of scenes that are just excuses for Aileen and Selby to scream and vomit foul language at each other. The story could've been a ""Buring Bed"" type of feminist liberation story, which would've been sensible, but instead chooses to focus on the relationship between Aileen and Selby, which sounds good now, but the final-product of just focusing on their relationship makes the film extraordinarily drawn-out.<br/><br/>Direction: In attempts to create a suitably bleak atmosphere, director Patty Jenkins shoots in very simplistic ways, instead of having a lot of fancy camera movement, etc. However, the end product doesn't look artistically bleak like intended, just boring. Albeit, yes, I will admit that the rape scene was played appropriately, well, disturbing and gruesome, but it doesn't compensate for the rest of the movie, which is bland, and doesn't hold our interest in any way.<br/><br/>Final Comment: Save yourself from wasting money on this film, and instead jam forks in your eye-sockets, which doesn't sound so bad after seeing this film."

The movie doesn't glorify her by any stretch, but it doesn't demonize her either. It's overall a look at how we are all products of our upbringings. As Wuornos, Theron is almost unrecognizable: she plays a character as unglamorous as can be, with sunburned skin, and girth practically unseen on actresses these days.

"MOscarbradley","8","1","3","29 May 2004"," An exercise in the art of 'acting'
","What Charlize Theron does in ""Monster"" is called acting. That she does it brilliantly is certainly to her credit; that she deserved her Oscar is probably without dispute; that she has never shown the slightest signs that she could 'act' this brilliantly in the past is also without dispute. I stress this point because Theron's acting is the visible product of what she is doing; you are aware of how well she is doing her job, not because her transformation into Arleen Wuornos is so all encompassing (which it is) but because you know Charlize Theron; you've seen what she is capable of doing in other films. It may even be great acting, (I think it certainly comes close), in the theatrical style. Watching her I thought of other 'great' performances by women (Bette Davis in several films; Vivien Leigh in ""Streetcar"") but the performance is not transcendental. <br/><br/>She never crosses the line where the divide between performer and character becomes a blissful irrelevancy, where acting is raised to such a level that you cease to be aware of it (Finney in ""Saturday Night and Sunday Morning"", Jane Fonda in ""Klute"", Monica Vitti in ""L'Avventurra"") As for the film which encompasses this astonishingly empathetic piece of acting I have to say writer/director Patty Jenkins has done a remarkable job. She has made Wuornos not only sympathetic, (ok, Theron has played her part in this, too), but with compassion and not just the angry politics of feminism she has argued a case for a woman's right to kill; at first in self-defence (she is horribly raped) but later in symbolic vengeance for what Wuornos and women have suffered at the hands of men. However wrong-footed you think she's being, it's a persuasive argument. <br/><br/>The film concentrates on the time Wuornos meets Selby, her dim little tease of a lesbian lover (played too blandly for my liking by Christina Ricci) and commits her first murder up to her capture. Her trial, 12 year incarceration and subsequent execution are dealt with in the final minutes (and have already been the subject of two remarkable documentaries by Nick Broomfield). On route to this there are several quite extraordinary scenes, mostly with Wuornos and her victims, but also between Wuornos and Selby and between Selby and the church-going woman with whose family she boarded with, in which Jenkins manifesto is subdued by the trivia and banality of the everyday. I don't think you need to know anything about Wuornos' history to be moved by the tragedy of a woman whose life would never amount to anything other than one blow after another. There is one other performance in the film that merits mention. As Wuornos' final victim, a good man whom she kills almost because she can hardly help herself, an almost unrecognizably middle-aged and portly Scott Wilson, with very little dialogue and only a few minutes of screen time, creates a wholly rounded, believable character in whom we can empathize and who is the antithesis of Wuornos herself (and most of the other men in the film). This is acting of a different kind from Theron's. This is the transcendental kind, where the line between acting and reality is blurred beyond recognition."

","Based on the true story of Highway Prostitute/serial killer Aileen Wuornos and staring Charlize Theron, in the role that earned her an Oscar and the title of the best performance in the history of Cinema. Wuornos is one of life's damaged people. Disillusioned about life and the men who pick her up on the highways of Florida for sex, she's suicidal when she meets Selby Wall, (Christina Ricci), a young woman who's been sent to stay with her aunt in Miami in a vain attempt to cure her homosexuality. After a rocky start the two connect, it's a relationship that will have a profound impact on Wuornos' life. Although she tries to get a real job Wuornos is forced back on the road as a prostitute to get money. When one of the johns who picks her up becomes violent she kills him, and then it starts to become a habit. Charlize Theron gives a totally convincing performance which is transcendently great, genuine and entirely astonishing. Her transformation from super beautiful to super ugly is amazing. It is not just a matter of make-up but a totally psychological embodiment. She truly gets into the psyche of Wuornos (she defiantly deserved her Oscar!) Charlize's performance is one that will be talked about for many years to come and it's done with an incredible amount of understanding of Wuornos' sentiment. Also full credit to first time Writer/ Director, Patty Jenkins for intelligently and Non-sensationally directing this dark and beautiful film. An entirely impressive film with an incredible lead performance. I love this film. 5/5"

","I'm baffled at some of the bad reviews for Charlize Theron's new movie Monster because Charlize Theron IS a revelation! Charlize is not playing Aileen, Charlize IS Aileen and I believed that from beginning to end. The guy who ran the Last Resort Biker bar, the hangout where Aileen frequented got the opportunity to work with Charlize and Patty Jenkins the first time(!) director of Monster. He knew Aileen and knew her mannerisms etc and he was astonished at Charlize's portrayal of Lee and I am too. Those who say Charlize was awakward in the role are missing the point especially about Lee and Selby. Their scene in the roller rink and outside of the roller rink is one of the greatest love scenes in my recent memory. The enthuiastic kissing is refreshing when compared to standard hollywood love scenes where people act like what is expected of them instead of how real people act when the excitement/arousal for each other hits them square between the eyes. When Lee and Selby eventually are intimate, their clinging to one another(clawing even) are extremely believable.<br/><br/>Ms. Theron is so incredible in Monster, I dare say she might not be able to ever match it again. I feel that some might be expecting her too which would be unfair. I never knew she had this inside her, the talent to really lose herself in a role but she has proved that in spades with Monster. I only wish the movie had been longer and I was disappointed in the courtroom scenes..why on earth wasn't this focused on more? Despite this I highly recommend Monster to anyone who is even mildly curious, see it at a matinee if you must. I also recommend Nick Bloomfield's documentary about Aileen called ""Aileen:Life and Death of a Serial Killer"" which is playing in select cities including New York. The docu is a revisiting from over 10 years ago when Nick first made Lee the subject of a documentary called ""Selling of a Serial Killer"" which is available to buy on VHS.<br/><br/>If you think you might not like the movie or might not be able to stomach, I still ask you see it for Charlize's potrayal alone. It is worth it despite what others think."

This was another case of a female director attempting to make a heroine out of a completely worthless individual.  Creating a feminist heroine out of a vicious murderer is no mean feat and Patty Jenkins fails miserably. comparing this film to say, Bonnie and Clyde, is worthwhile. We get to see Clyde and Bonnie as the people they are, warts and all, and yet somehow get swept up in the story. The supporting roles are all ably handled and given enough flesh to make sense. Monster does nothing of the kind. The supporting roles are mere devices to move the story. The victims' personalities are paper thin. I have to search hard in memory to find a more unsatisfactory film experience. Given that I must say that Charlize Theron does an amazing job within the limitations of a hackneyed script and confused storyline."

Most importantly in no way I can feel anything for Aileen Wuornos, however terrible her childhood and adult life were, however hard she were hit by society. And I understand that some may consider this view to be a snobbish perspective of a well-to-do suburb dweller who steers clear from what he terms as 'low-life'.

Allow me to summarize this film in one word: ""boring"". Here's the basic premise of the film. A hideously ugly woman that is supposedly Charlize Theron plays a white trash Florida prostitute who meets an innocent and naive lesbian played by Christina Ricci. Charlize tries to straighten up after a bad incident with a John, but can't because she has no skills to get a job. That's as deep as I want to get, because I would be giving away the movie. This really wouldn't be a bad idea though, because watching the movie is torture. Charlize Theron does a remarkable job of acting, unfortunately, she picked a bad movie to decide to do that in. She's got quite the mouth on her. I've heard sailors that didn't curse like she does in this film. Christina Ricci is her typical self. She's the same character she is in every film. The biggest problem is that this film just drags along. It takes forever to get started. When it does, it doesn't go anywhere else for a long time.

"Michael_Elliott","Null","1","4","14 June 2012"," Powerful Film with Haunting Performances
","Monster (2003) <br/><br/>*** 1/2 (out of 4) <br/><br/>Charlize Theron won the Best Actress Oscar for her performance of Aileen Wuornos, a prostitute turned serial killer. In our film we start off seeing Aileen as she's struggling to make it and finally sees a way to a happy life when she meets a confused gay girl named Selby (Christina Ricci). The two eventually fall in love but in order to keep the money flow coming in Aileen continues to be a hooker but soon she's also killing the men. MONSTER is a pretty depressing and powerful movie that features some of the best performances you're going to see in this type of film. If you're looking for something uplifting or something that's going to end with a high note then it's best that you stay away from this film. While it's often hard to watch there's no denying that it has some power, is extremely well-made and also features some terrific performances. Director Patty Jenkins really did a terrific job at telling this story and she also brought a certain atmosphere to the picture that just made it so realistic that it really did feel as if you were watching a documentary. You certainly have to give the director credit for never trying to spin a happy note on the picture because there's simply no way around this type of subject matter and thankfully the director went for the truth and not some phony pretty stuff. Ricci turns in a remarkably confined and powerful performance as the rather naive girl who gets pulled along in this mess simply because she's gay, comes from a small town and has no friends. I thought the actress did a very good job in the role and sold it ever step of the way. Bruce Dern, Scott Wilson and Pruitt Taylor Vince also turn in strong work in smaller roles. Then there's Theron who turns in a remarkable performance and you could easily and rightfully say one of the best that you're ever going to see. The make-up work is incredible because to turn such a beautiful women into this person was remarkable but even without this the performance stands on its own. Not for a single second do you ever see or feel a beautiful woman uglying herself down to do a part. Instead you see and feel this character who is so multi-layered and tortured that you can't help but be scared of her. Theron really gives it her all and she's quite creepy and sad at the same time. The performance just contains so much raw energy and passion that you forget you're watching a movie. The one negative thing about the film is that there are a few too many times where I think they showed the character as a victim. There are moments where it appears they want you to feel sorry for what has happened to her and you can to a point. However, there are many people who have the same stuff happen to them and they don't go on a killing rampage. With that said, there's no question that MONSTER is quite powerful and the performances alone make it a must see."
"JamesHitchcock","5","1","4","18 April 2008"," Not even the best drummer in the Beatles
","The story is told about John Lennon that he was once asked whether he thought that Ringo Starr was the best drummer in the world. ""Best drummer in the world?"" replied John. ""He's not even the best drummer in the Beatles"".<br/><br/>I have similar views about Charlize Theron's Oscar for this film. Best actress in the world? She wasn't even the best actress in ""Monster"". Christina Ricci was better by far, but wasn't even nominated either as ""Best Actress"" or ""Best Supporting Actress"".<br/><br/>The film is based on the life of the serial killer Aileen Wuornos (called Lee in the film), who murdered seven men while working as a prostitute in Florida in 1989 and 1990. Wuornos was notably unattractive, so the beautiful lads'-mag pinup Theron was hardly the most obvious choice to play her. Nevertheless, the make-up artists managed, with the help of freckles, false teeth and some seriously bad hair, to make Theron look reasonably like the individual she was portraying, although still more attractive than any picture of Wuornos I have ever seen. At one stage she strips down to her underwear, not in order to titillate male viewers but to show the world how much weight she has put on since she last posed, in a similar state of undress, for ""FHM"" or ""Esquire"".<br/><br/>Theron is not the first actress to play a notorious murderess; in the fifties Susan Hayward won her only Oscar as Barbara Graham in ""I Want to Live"" and Diana Dors gave her greatest performance in ""Yield to the Night"". Dors' character in that film was fictitious, but was loosely based upon the real-life killer Ruth Ellis, whom Dors had known. Ellis herself was played by Miranda Richardson in a more recent film, ""Dance with a Stranger"".<br/><br/>Although they were playing criminals, Hayward, Dors and Richardson all succeeded in evoking sympathy for their characters. In the film, Graham was portrayed as the innocent victim of a miscarriage of justice (although in real life ""Bloody Babs"" was probably guilty of the crime for which she was executed). Ellis (like her fictional counterpart Mary Hilton) was the victim of a legal system which failed to take account of extenuating circumstances which should have saved her from the gallows.<br/><br/>""Monster"" was clearly aimed at evoking sympathy for Wuornos, but this was a difficult aim to achieve and in my view Theron never really brings it off. Unlike Ellis, who shot her lover in a crime of passion, Wuornos was a cold-blooded serial killer whose real motives are unlikely ever to be known, not least because she kept changing her story. Her one chance of avoiding the death penalty was to persuade the Court that she was mentally unbalanced at the time of the killings, but she rejected this option, sacking her defence lawyers and insisting that she was sane. She originally alleged that she shot all seven of her victims in self-defence, but later retracted this story. In the film Wuornos does indeed kill her first victim in self-defence when he beats her up and attempts to rape her, but kills the others for purely mercenary motives, to steal their money and cars. Her final victim is not even a customer, but a kindly old man who is trying to help her.<br/><br/>Ricci plays Wuornos's lesbian lover, called Tyria Moore in real life but Selby Wall in this film. Selby is a naive teenager, struggling to come to terms with her sexuality, who has been rejected by her conservative, religious parents who regard homosexuality as sinful. They have sent her to Florida to stay with relatives and be ""cured"" of her lesbianism. Instead, Selby meets Wuornos in a bar and becomes her lover, probably because Wuornos is the only person ever to have shown her affection.<br/><br/>Before ""Monster"" I had mostly regarded Theron as an actress whose main function was to provide the glamour in bland family films like ""Mighty Joe Young"" or second-rate thrillers like ""Reindeer Games"" or ""Trapped"". Her ventures into more intellectual (or pseudo-intellectual) fare like ""The Astronaut's Wife"" or ""The Cider-House Rules"" were not convincing. ""Monster"" represented a quite deliberate attempt to show the world that she is not just a pretty blonde bimbo but a serious artist who is prepared to suffer for her art- even to suffer the ultimate indignity of looking fat and unglamorous. This is the sort of thing which always impresses the Academy, but I found it unimpressive. I found Ricci's portrayal of the tormented Selby a touching one, but Theron never succeeded in convincing me that Wuornos was anything other than cold, hard, heartless and vindictive. If anyone deserved an Oscar it was her make-up artist. 5/10"
"Coventry","5","1","4","21 April 2006"," Blonds don't have more fun
","Personally, I'm not a big fan of multi-hyped and large budgeted Hollywood productions, but you can always wake me up for accurate and unsentimental portraits of serial killers! Despite the big names and promotional campaigns that were involved, Patty Jenkins' ""Monster"" easily could have been such a truthful portrait. Aileen Wuornos' story is certainly one worth telling, as she was one of the first  and definitely the most famous  female serial killer in recent American history. And yes, the screenplay is fairly accurate in telling her evolution from neglected teenager into male-hating and remorseless murderess, but of course it totally isn't unsentimental and that's why ""Monster"" is never at one point as powerful as cult movie classics such as ""Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer"" (about Henry Lee Lucas) or ""Deranged, Confessions of a Necrophile"" (about Wisconsin killer Ed Gein). The production values were better, naturally, and the acting performances truly are perplexing, yet this film soon begins to obtrude sentiments of sympathy and compassion and eventually it's Patty Jenkins who decides for us what to think of Aileen. Daytona Beach prostitute Aileen Wuornos is suicidal when she hooks up with young lesbian Selby in a sober gay bar. She convinces the naive girl to run away with her as they can easily live on the money she makes selling her body to customers she refers to as ""Johns"". Aileen is very afraid when she impulsively kills a guy after an attempted rape and it even brings her closer to Selby. The next murders she commits, however, can never be justified and both girls are doomed to run from one lousy motel room to the next. Charlize Theron is terrific, as you've heard, but Christina Ricci's performance is equally impressive and the least she deserved was to be nominated for an Oscar as well. The narration is unnecessary and the film becomes rather dull and repetitive after an hour. The ending was a bit of a letdown as well, as it comes rather abrupt. Overall, ""Monster"" is a shockingly mediocre film."

","I don't have the same negative opinion of the way the theme of love between the two women was handled as some others I know, but this was a difficult movie to watch. I had to skip a many scenes and fast-forward through more, unable to stomach all the aimless underclass squalor. Bleagh!<br/><br/>Charlize Theron was wa-a-ay too one-dimensional, having learned a single defiant stance and holding it through the entire film. This made her characterization stultifying and boring. If you've seen interviews with the real Aileen Wournos, she could be quiet and earnest, but always psychotically intense. Given to outbursts of rage, of course, she displayed a dynamic range lacking in this portrayal. Theron is always weaving back and forth or bobbing up and down. Wournos could sit quietly with Manson lamps and scare the drizzle out of you.<br/><br/>Ricci was fabulous in her wonderful performance as Wournos's lover and companion. She played it with just the right balance of understanding, possessive mania and codependency, and appropriately reacted to the well-presented backstory of her parental abuse. Unfortunately, the director chose to focus more on Wournos's crimes than the affair, which puts Monster in the class of average films, not ground breakers. Had the unspeakable violence Wournos gave and got served as the stratum upon which the remarkable lesbian love affair was precariously balanced, the movie would have been truly remarkable. And this may have rescued Theron from her one-dimensional characterization as well.<br/><br/>The deterioration of that affair after the capture of Wournos was not portrayed. The movie effectively ends with her capture. We don't see the betrayal by Ricci or Theron's loyal forgiveness. We see nothing of the court battle and media coverage. Nor do we explore the rare female serial killer mentality. By focusing so heavily on crime and milieu, Monster misses much of the guts of the Wournos story. Compare this film to In Cold Blood or The Boston Strangler, where the police investigation and court trial play a role. Here, they are ignored.<br/><br/>One last thing about Theron. Why the weight gain? There were only a couple of brief scenes where she was nearly nekky, and she certainly could have just used Hollywood technology for those. It wasn't worth the build-up just to see her with cellulite. It did nothing for Stallone in the forgettable Cop Land, and does nothing for Theron here. The real Ricci character was an overweight woman with missing teeth. Why didn't they go for realism with her as well? For one thing, nobody would be interested in watching two frumpy people in a murderous love story. But why keep Ricci attractive, and make Wournos look so god-awful?"

","Aileen Wouris was indeed a ""monster"". Anyone who so callously takes the lives of five individuals in cold blood cannot be described any other way. I mention cold blood only in relation to five of the murders as Wouris' defence for the first murder she committed was based on self defence. The movie then worked very hard to find the reason which she CHOSE to continue killing. I become very suspicious when perpetrators of violent crimes reflect on certain incidents in their life that may have led them to that point and seek redemption and maybe even a certain amount of empathy and compassion from the general populous for their actions. I am not saying that Aileen Wouris herself was looking for sympathy but there is no doubt that director of Monster, Patty Jenkins certainly decided to portray the character of Wouris almost to the point where she was being portrayed as a victim. That is what I found most offensive about this movie. Life is largely about making CHOICES. I recognize and appreciate that Wouris had a tortured upbringing but that doesn't justify ANY of her actions: a point of view obviously not shared with Jenkins who, as well as directing, also wrote the screenplay after having some correspondence with Wouris herself. Why did I choose to watch this film in the first place? The answer is quite simple.I had read the reviews and was aware of the film's content. I wanted to see for myself what I had heard was a breathtaking performance from Charlize Theron. I have scored this unpleasant film higher than I may have otherwise simply on the back of Theron's performance which was simply masterly. I will ponder for some time the effort made by this actress to put herself quite literally in the mind (and body) of a deranged individual who, apparently all because of her sad and sorry upbringing, CHOSE to take the lives of different men in a cold and calculated manner. We all make CHOICES in our lives and a lot of us have to deal with terrible difficulties and tumultuous emotional and physical upheaveals whilst growing up. Not all of us turn into monsters!"

"Tweekums","9","0","1","14 November 2019"," A sympathetic portrayal of a serial killer
","This film, based on real events, tells the story of Aileen Wuornos; a prostitute in Daytona Beach, Florida who went on to become America's first female serial killer. She is down to her last five dollars and contemplating suicide when she decides she might as well spend it on cheap beer in a local bar. Here she is approached by Selby Wall, a naïve young lesbian; the two get drinking and form an unlikely friendship. Unable to get regular work and needing money she returns to prostitution; a client attacks her and would probably have killed her if she didn't have a gun... instead he ended up dead. She takes his car and his money and hits the road with Selby. It isn't long before she kills again.<br/><br/>Usually serial killers are rightfully portrayed as monsters, if based on real people, or somewhat charismatic if fictional; the portrayal of Aileen avoids both stereotypes. We see that her life is pretty terrible and her first victim is shown as fairly clear self-defence. As she progresses she behaves in a way that is clearly not justified but by then that degree of sympathy has already been evoked. The violence is shown in a fairly matter of fact way and in no way glamorised or made exciting. The relationship between Aileen and Selby feels real as does the way Selby naively accepts Aileen's version of how she got her money and 'borrowed' cars. Interestingly the story is centred on Aileen and Selby; we never learn about the police investigation apart from what our protagonists see on the news. Charlize Theron is on brilliant form as Aileen, it is little wonder she picked up an Oscar for her performance. Cristina Ricci also impresses as Selby making it easy to believe in her characters naivety. Writer/director Patty Jenkins did a fine job creating a feeling of desperation without making the film too depressing to enjoy. Overall I'd say that this film is definitely worth watching."

","I've just watched this film with my husband, after fancying a thriller. It's a film that's cropped up in my searches for films over the years and I remember lots of hype at the time of release, particularly around Therons make up. The make up, I thought, was excellent and Theron did look very similar to Aileen. I've rated this film 5/10, as I just don't know what to think. From things I've read about Aileen, she was a cold blooded killer, yet from the film, she was portrayed as somewhat likeable (by way of feeling sorry for her) and she had feelings of love, remorse and friendship. Was this real? Who was the real Aileen, as I don't believe this interpretation was factual. The film, I did find to be a little slow paced and lacked much violence for someone who is a serial killer.

As a true story this is almost documentary-like in feel, bolstered by Charlize Theron's excellent (and unrecognisable) performance as Wuornos, for which she deservedly won the Oscar.

","Not much that hasn't already been said about Monster - Charlize Theron bagged a (deserved) Oscar for her performance as lesbian serial killer and hooker-hitchhiker 'Aileen' and Christina Ricci played her part too (she was great, but there was only ever going to be one winner out of the two).<br/><br/>As reported in the press at the time, Theron gained plenty of weight to make herself look almost indistinguishable from her normal (Aeon Flux catsuit-wearing) self, but it wasn't just the weightgain that scooped her the prize. She plays a killer - traditionally someone audiences would find it hard to root for. And, rightly so, the majority of people knew that she was in the wrong. However, Theron plays the part to show why she became the way she was. She wasn't born bad, but she had a hell of a nasty upbringing. At first, some (Charles Bronson fans) might even say her killings were justified, putting her in the 'anti-hero' category. However, like similar anti-hero Carter (Michael Caine in Get Carter) she pushed her luck and crossed the line from doing bad to bad people to doing bad regardless. Therefore Aileen must face the consequences for her actions.<br/><br/>If you haven't already seen it, you really should. If you need any more recommendations, check out the DVD to buy on Amazon. It's one of those rare films that (as of the time of this review) hasn't received a single 'One Star' rating.<br/><br/>Just watch out the next time you see a hitchhiker (unless it's Charlize Theron looking like her normal self - most guys wouldn't drive by then).<br/><br/>http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/"

","What a tortured life this woman led; a life of inferiority, confusion, violence, victimisation, prostitution, anger and ultimately, murder. Charlize Theron's utter transformation is what drives this film, her performance and physical emulation perfectly conveying the desperate pain and impetuous anger of her character. I think the Oscars are not much more than a smug festival of self-celebration, but this performance deserved commendation. <br/><br/>'Monster' is the story of Aileen Wuornos, a prostitute from Florida who murdered seven men between 1989 and 1990. One might think that the film's title would suggest otherwise, but the film gives a very human representation of Wuornos. She was indeed a 'monster' in her final years, but the film's emphasis on the brutal, relentless path that led to her first killing shows the architecture of such a creation. But not for a second, I hasten to add, does the film condone her violence, she isn't glorified and she isn't vilified either, the film is so very downbeat and visceral that it would be impossible for anyone to be allured by it. 'Monster' is by no means the tale of one woman standing up against chauvinist pigs; her tale of nature, nurture and the consequences of violence is impartially told. <br/><br/>The film reflects on Wurnos' childhood, a time of sexual favours, inadequacy, rape and beatings. A narrative gap, which misses a dubious failed marriage and numerous arrests, presents the viewer with a sorry picture, a woman who washes in petrol station toilets, a woman who is desperately trying to survive. She then meets a companion, the vulnerable Selby Moore. It's at this point that the film strays from the facts; 'Selby Moore' is a fictional character, very loosely based, especially in appearance, to Tyria Moore, Wuornos' lover until her execution. <br/><br/>The pair, who have moved in together, live off Wuornos' prostitution wage until their relationship is complicated by Moore's discovery of Wuornos' taste for violence. The film depicts the first murder as Wuornos described it -self defence. Her first victim was Richard Mallory, a convicted rapist. Aileen stated that he raped and savaged her, so she shot him. I think her claim has credibility; it's quite possible that Mallory thought Wuornos was expendable social underclass, an easy thrill without consequence. I respect that the scene was orchestrated in this manner. <br/><br/>Monster is a stark and balanced insight into the frankly miserable life of Aileen Wuornos. You may not like her and all the violence will most likely strain your empathy, but I think you'll leave the film having a greater understanding of her.<br/><br/>www.hawkensian.com"

"valadas","7","0","1","13 January 2012"," The Human Soul is an Abyss
","So the great Portuguese poet Fernando Pessoa wrote in one of his poems. And this is true. Besides that the society where we live now creates these monsters like this movie clearly shows. Two young women (one of them much younger than the other) coming from quite opposite social and living poles meet one another by chance, fell in love with one another and start a tragic life together. The eldest had thrown herself into prostitution at the age of 13 after (like she herself tells at a given moment) having been continuously raped by a friend of her father. After having killed a client in self-defence, she takes hold of his gun and becomes a serial killer in part because she needs the money she takes from the victims after killing them, to support herself and her girlfriend but also because she hates them and herself and the life she leads. In the abyss of her soul good and evil live side by side and weave tragically together. On the good side there is also still the love she maintains by her companion who is a fragile person and much weaker than her and raising a few problems to her. Both characters are well depicted psychologically in words, manners and behaviour though Charlise Theron (Aileen the prostitute) has maybe too many facial and corporal ticks and twitches but maybe also the real woman (this is supposed to be a veracious story) was also like that. Anyway the performance of both actresses is good enough though not particularly brilliant. Summing it up although this is not exactly a masterpiece (even because the story is simple enough) but certainly a rather good movie."

","I've seen Monster a couple of times now before reviewing it and I think I can safely say that this is one of the darkest most twisted films I've ever seen. The big reason behind that is because this IS real life. This is a real woman, who not so long ago killed people and was in the media. It is fascinating to watch and truly deeply disturbing. True Crime fans should eat this film up because the performances of the two lead actresses are simply stunning. Both women give award worthy performances, and the direction of the film is so well done. It would be hard to call a movie like this 'entertaining' but fascinating and captivating describes it excellently.<br/><br/>Charlize Theron goes through unheard of lengths to become the twisted and disturbed Aileen. She is literally unrecognizable and considering she is one of the most beautiful women in the world, his transformation is even more stunning. But that isn't just what makes her performance outstanding...she gives such an incredible performance you will be blown away but what she does. Christina Ricci holds her own against Theron in level of performance because she also is excellent as the often victimized, quiet, and easily abused Selby. Ricci and Theron's chemistry opposite each other is absolutely perfect and the two of them light up the screen.<br/><br/>Director and writer Patty Jenkins must have spent so much time studying the facts behind this case because it feels and looks real and you will believe that you are right on the forefront of this killer's mind. The ingenious part of Monster is that this isn't about the case, or her trial or even the crimes themselves. This is a film about the mind of a serial killer. What made her who she was and her very fast downward spiral into insanity. Please see this movie because there is few like it and few films will get under your skin and really disturb you and fascinate you all at the same time. 9/10"

","Well, I discovered this film in a kinda funny way. I had a week of hard job interviews and I was very stressed, so I told my brother and my sister-in-law that I wish I would never have an interview again. Then she told me that the film ""Monster"" has a scene where the main girl tries to work in a law firm, and once she's rejected, she scolds and says she didn't even want the job. I found that VERY funny, since that was my real will-- just because I was truly stressed, not that I'm rude or anything.<br/><br/>So, ""Monster""'s main girl is called Aileen and she probably has bipolarity. Sometimes she's very sweet to her girlfriend, but other times she's killing random men mercilessly. She varies from insane to wise in many scenes, so you never know what to think about her. Acting is a thing to be congratulated in here, specially Charlize Theron's; she really looks like a crazy girl (or woman). The film's biggest accomplishment is that people aren't perfect; while in most Hollywood movies they show perfect people doing perfect things, ""Monster"" concerns in showing people as they really are. A self-interested girlfriend (Selby), an insane woman (Aileen), people paying for having sex, girl lying to be shopping when actually she's in a bar with other people, etc. ""Monster"" gets really believable and real once they don't glamor people and life. It's just a shame that the ending isn't a tearjerker, otherwise I would've rated it around 9. Watch this big piece of entertainment and reality!"
"ferbs54","Null","0","1","17 October 2011"," Who Needs A Radioactive Brontosaurus?
","Despite its title, 2003's ""Monster"" is a shocking picture with no zombies, no aliens and no slime creatures, vampires, sentient blobs, dinosaurs, werewolves or mutants. Rather, it is a film dealing with a much more human kind of monster, specifically Aileen Wuornos, the Michigan-born prostitute turned serial killer who was convicted in Florida in 1992 for the murders of six men (she was never prosecuted for the murder of a seventh, whose body was never found), served over a decade on Death Row, and was ultimately put to death by lethal injection in 2002. The film, masterfully written and directed by Patty Jenkins, only glancingly mentions Aileen's sexual molestations as a child, her prostitution at age 12 and her pregnancy at age 14, and never mentions the criminal career (charges for DUI, disorderly conduct, armed robbery, grand theft auto, resisting arrest, jail time, etc.) she indulged in before the events depicted. In the film, we first encounter a suicidal Aileen in 1989, right before she meets the fictitious Selby Wall, a character based on real-life bar maid Tyria Moore. As happened in actuality, the two meet in a gay bar, their initially platonic relationship soon turning physical, and Aileen begins hooking with a vengeance--and killing with a vengeance, too--to support her young girl ""in style."" ""You'll never meet someone like me again,"" Aileen tells Selby as they run away together; a good thing for Selby, too, as things turn out!<br/><br/>Anyway, at this point, going on a full decade after ""Monster""'s release, you surely don't need ME to tell you how brilliant South African actress Charlize Theron is in the lead role--the Oscar, Golden Globe, SAG award and more than a dozen other honors that she deservedly garnered for her work here should tell you something about her courageous performance. I will say, however, that she really does completely immerse herself in the character, and that the 30 pounds she reportedly gained for the role, plus some remarkable makeup work and those ghastly prosthetic teeth, make her look uncannily like the real deal. Christina Ricci (currently flying high on TV's ""Pan Am"") as Selby, one of her early adult roles, is also excellent; the two make for one unlikely yet touching pair, and the desperate love that Aileen feels for this young waif allows us to actually sympathize with her, despite her murderous acts. As to those murders, we see four of the seven, and the initial one almost seems justified on Aileen's part; a clear case of self-defense. Her later homicides are far less defensible, however; indeed, the final two shown are quite horrific, fully validating the film's title. Jenkins wisely chose to shoot her film on the actual locations where events occurred, lending her film a seedy verisimilitude, and the young director does a terrific job; one can only wonder how she will fare on the upcoming ""Thor 2""! Her script, as I mentioned, excises the earlier segment of Aileen's life and concentrates on the touching relationship between the two gals, turning the film, almost, into a tragic love story; why Tyria Moore was turned into the fictional Selby is anybody's guess. Legal reasons, perhaps? Regardless, Jenkins' script allows us to peek into this notorious killer's mind, and manages to make the monster altogether human, recognizable and (hard to believe) almost admirable. I would be remiss if I did not mention the terrific, original musical score by the composer only known as BT (middle name Larry, I wonder?); it greatly complements the sometimes sweet, oftentimes appalling events on screen, and makes inspired use of the 1968 Tommy James and the Shondells hit ""Crimson and Clover."" All told, ""Monster"" is a truly accomplished, ultimately saddening piece of work. Indeed, who needs to be shocked by a giant crab monster or radioactive brontosaurus when we have the spectre and the memory of Aileen Wuornos?"

","Having spent much of my youth in the presence of losers and the disenfranchised, this movie really hit home. There's no question that the Academy Award went to the correct person. The combination of rage and despair are so admirably presented a character as complex as the creases on her expressive face. It's the ultimate vicious circle. We tend to vilify someone like this because we only see the surface. But inside is that good heart that would love to become whole, but the past has too many tentacles and there are too many bruises that would need to be treated. She has no defenses. Even acting to save herself, she starts the ball rolling toward her destruction. We forget this is actually a love story, but the cards are stacked to the heavens. Great performances by Theron and Ricci. The latter brings a knowing innocence and we wonder if she will have an opportunity. Not comfortable to watch, but we need to see it."

I don't say those things in a negative manner, because those attributes were intentional, and help tell the story in the realistic way that (writer and director) Patty Jenkins was aiming for. <br/><br/>I usually have little interest in movies like this, but there were two reasons why it ended up being somewhat worthwhile for me. First, Jenkins tries to show the circumstances of the life and crimes Aileen Wuornos without condemning or excusing her. She was a woman who had lived a life of horrible events and circumstances, and that context helps the movie be more interesting than your average flick about serial killers. <br/><br/>The second reason was the performances of the two lead actresses. Both Christina Ricci and Charlize Theron were amazing, but Theron really gave one of those ""once in a lifetime"" performances. She completely disappeared into her character in a way that's incredibly difficult to do for a mega-famous actor or actress. And it took quite a toll on her during filming, which you can see if you check out the special features included with the DVD.<br/><br/>As I said, this isn't the kind of movie I usually go for, but it was obvious even to me that Monster is a cut above most movies in the genre.

","Though it's easy to wag fingers and tut tut about the wrongs and rights of today's society, at least Patty Jenkin's portrayal of Aileen Wuornos shows us, in difficult, often frighteningly graphic detail, what happened, when - and maybe why.<br/><br/>We know the outcome, so, thankfully, we're spared all the legal court cases and all that. We're allowed, or offered to make up our own minds and ultimately, judgements. How many of us who might have witnessed that bad behaviour and then tut tutted and cursed 'society' and then gone back into our own world? Rarely, though, do we think of the causes, or the indeed, the outcomes of such. This film, at least for two hours redresses that.<br/><br/>Incredibly well cast, Theron, obviously, but also Christine Ricci. She must have been considerably older than the innocent teen who gets sucked in by Wuornos, but who is brilliantly believable too. As the emotionally mixed-up, parent-pressured youth who just wants to break away and looks for any means in which to do just that. We all know of someone close to each of us who may have been in that vulnerable position. <br/><br/>As for Charlize Theron, who, helped by big-brand beauty ads, is one of the most glamorous actresses in Hollywood. Breaking away from that 'bimbo' stereotype, maybe, but putting on the extra pounds, and a truly believable state of non- make-up, might have been just too risky for many of her A-lister colleagues.<br/><br/>Though Wuornos, or the character portrayed as her by Theron seldom displays tenderness you certainly feel that wrath when the inner hatred explodes from within - and obviously outwards.<br/><br/>I've yet to see the other biopic of the same woman 'Aileen - Life and Death of a Serial Killer' directed Nick Broomfield and released the same year. It's a documentary so wouldn't have the Oscar-winning performance but in a large way, I have no wish to.

","It's not that there's not the occasional film about unattractive women, or average-looking without magic cheekbones, with enough body fat to feasibly menstruate. It's that they'll hire statuesque, ideal blondes who'll gain artistic weight, sit for three hours of makeup to facilitate the appearance of a simple human being like the rest of us. Should a film about a real person be in competition for a Best Makeup Oscar? Nevertheless, all the same, what Theron pulls off isn't a performance but an incarnation. With audacity, craft and humanity, she purely draws us into Aileen Wuornos' final frantic attempt to be a better person than her luck proposed. Her performance is so concentrated and forceful that it becomes a reality for us. There's no trace of negligence in her eyes as she directly imparts what she's feeling and thinking. There's the eerie impression that she's forgotten the camera and script, candidly focusing her notions of Wuornos.<br/><br/>Watching this, I've no awareness of makeup procedure. I simply watch one of the realest people on the screen. The movie opens with Aileen telling God she's down to her last $5, that if God doesn't lead her to spend it right she'll end it all. She walks into what happens to be a lesbian bar and meets the 18-year-old Selby, who's been sent to live with Florida relatives and be ""cured."" Aileen's steadfast that she's had no lesbian encounters, and to be sure her rundown life as a bottom-rung hooker's left her with no predilection for sex at all. Selby's own sexuality works effectively as a way to offend her fundamentalist parents and indulge her longing to be wanted. There's a striking scene when the two bond with unrefined sexual vigor, but in time sex is irrelevant judged against distraction, watching TV, and acting out their personal soap in second-rate curb motels.<br/><br/>Monster's partially derived from the real Wuornos' prison letters to an associate recounting her life and her despairing relationship with Selby Wall, but you can't help but wonder how can we bank on what she says about herself? How can we be sure about those letters' truth or sentiments? Certainly, there'd be truthfulness to be found in them, detecting hidden meaning, analyzing, deciphering, but Monster plays so directly that there are no angles to contemplate, no veils we might be on the brink of peeling away. However, that's the irony of telling the story not as an omniscient investigative report but as a subjective dramatization: Aileen was an wild, unrestrained personality behind a face aged before its time, devastated by sun, booze and all varieties of cruelty. Psychotic, maybe. Beset with rage, unquestionably. Not a sound woman at all, whether or not she'd never killed.<br/><br/>Aileen's proudly the guardian and bread-winner, also bringing back cars that Selby doesn't ask too many questions about. Does she know that Aileen has begun snuffing her customers? She does and doesn't. Aileen's murder binge becomes considerable long before Selby focuses on it. The crimes themselves are set off by Aileen's hatred for prostitution, a lifetime's disgust for how men have treated her since she was a child. She's but one male friend, a devastated Vietnam vet and fellow drunk. Although she first kills in self-defense, she's also lashing out against her past. Her encounter of love with Selby brings revolt disentangling from her memories. The most disturbing scene is the death of a good man who truly wants to help her, but has appeared so late in her life that the only way he can help is to be gotten rid of. Aileen tells her story, and her voice, both narrating and on-screen, seems from some angle to be the vehicle for the story, if not its whole reason for being. But each character within it speaks with their own voice.<br/><br/>Aileen's body language is startling and captivating. She doesn't know how to inhabit her body. Theron spends a range of small arm straightening, physical adjustments, head tosses, hair touchings, as she apprehensively attempts to shake out her anxiety and look composed. She handles her cigarettes with the insecure bluster of a 13-year-old trying to make an impact on a kid. There's but one moment in Monster when she appears comfortable, content with herself. The scene will account for itself.<br/><br/>Christina Ricci finds perfect pitch for Selby, so persuasive some take it for bad acting, when actually she's very moving in her rendering of a poor actor. She plays Selby as naive, weak, in over her head, picking up signals moment-to-moment, paving her actions out of ideas sponged from bad movies, old songs, barroom romances. Selby must've walked into a gay bar for the first time just a few weeks ago, and looked anxiously to fathom how to present herself. Selby and Aileen frequently try to extemporize the next line they imagine the other wants to hear.<br/><br/>Despite questions outside the material itself, Monster declines to objectify Wuornos and her acts of violence, to take advantage of her legend in the disparaging approach of true-crime sensationalism, persevering in seeing her as a fully dimensional person entitled to our consideration. She's been so viciously misshapen by life that she seems incapable of decency, yet when she loves for the first time, she's moved to strive to be a better person.<br/><br/>She's tragically unfit for this mêlée, and doesn't have the assistance of cleverness and reason. She's empty of normal honorable principles. She's brash, uncontrolled, outraged. There's no justification for what she does, but there are causes. The aim of the movie's to bring them to the fore. If life had given her anything whatsoever to use, it'd be a much different story."

","'Monster' is a riveting true-story, Based on the life and death serial killer Aileen Wuornos, a former prostitute who was executed in 2002 for killing seven men in the late 1980s and early 1990's, comes a film that gives in too soon.<br/><br/>'Monster' is a mind-blowing watch... Patty Jenkins executes a difficult, disturbing biopic with enthusiasm. As a writer, he writes each dialog from the gallery, thus, making each word sound brash. In terms of direction, he creates the fear/frustration and love in you for Aileen and Selby. Some true-stories leave you haunted, 'Monster' is one of those haunted and memorable films! A special mention to Steven Bernstein's eye-catching Cinematography! <br/><br/>'Monster' is a winner due to 1 more major reason, Charlize Theron. What Charlize Theron achieves in her performance as Aileen Wuornos, is what an actor lives to be. To put it simply - The Sexiest Woman becomes The Ugliest Woman. As far as Christina Ricci, she's pitted against Theron, and leaves no impact whatsoever! <br/><br/>'Monster' is a must watch. It's amongst the best films of of the decade gone-by. This film has already gone down in History, due to... Charlize Theron's earth-shaking performance! Two Big Thumbs Up!"

","Aileen Wuornos was probably the most notorious serial killers of the past few decades, certainly the most notable female killer. This film brings her story to the forefront, to the attention of the mainstream American audience, who may not otherwise be acquainted with serial killer minutiae.<br/><br/>For those watching ""Monster"" as a horror film, it may be a bit of a disappointment. There's precious little blood and gore, and even the violence is not the primary focus. It is not one of those low budget, exploitative serial killer flicks. This comes off as more of a drama, and even though Charlize Theron presents Aileen as a ""monster"", we have her presented from an angle where we can see her tortured logic, and almost even identify... on at least one occasion, the homicide seems justified.<br/><br/>What drew me to this was the inclusion of my love, Christina Ricci, in the supporting actress role. While it is not one of my favorite roles she's played (for those, see ""Addams Family"" or ""Casper"" or many others), she does it well. She comes off as the naive lesbian girl just wanting to be loved, perhaps too much so. For all the protection Aileen can offer, is it worth the cost? This is a well made film. It's gritty, grim but still watchable. Theron and Ricci give good performances, as does just about everyone else. What makes this film difficult to rate highly is it's inability to be categorized. Not really horror, but a bit dark for a drama... more like a film you'd find on the Lifetime network, only actually decent. If you want a cinematic account of Wuornos' life, this is the one you want... otherwise I don't know who to recommend this one to."

","This film is based on a true story although some of it may not be factual, it's about serial killer Aileen Wuornos was convicted and then executed 12 years ago in Florida. Wuornos was a prostitute who hitchhiked across central Florida to find customers. And society just shuts her down, making it difficult for her to succeed at anything cause she is deprived of the opportunities. The highlight of this movie is Charlize Theron cause she did a pretty good performance and she really sacrificed a lot for this role especially her figure by gaining a lot of extra pounds. The plot and direction of the film wasn't that great though, I just wish they had taken a more ambiguous approach cause this wasn't as dark as I thought it would be, but yes it was depressing in a good way. What I thought was good about the film though is that it's something a lot of girls and some guys can relate with, cause in the real world appearances mean everything, sad but true and people will accept you in the future for job and other tasks you may dream of doing just by your looks alone, so a lot of women out there with a butter face can relate with this film. I don't know how much of it was factual, but it wasn't gripping as I hoped it to be and forgetful. Oh and Christina Ricci was annoying as always, even if it's her character in this film and work well with it. Aileen played by Charlize Theron wasn't a character I could sympathize with even if some may disagree, her killing sprees just start to make you lose interest after a while although the scenario maybe a bit different. I give the film a 7.5 out of 10 cause it was based on a true story and that makes it more intriguing than it really is.<br/><br/>7.5/10"

","Hollywood certainly got it right by awarding Charlize Theron the Best Actress Oscar but they should have gone one better by giving Christina Ricci Best Supporting Actress. The youthful innocence of her character magnified the monstrosity of the serial-killer prostitute. But now it is confession time. Though it was released five years ago, I just watched MONSTER–moments ago–on Video on Demand and was spellbound.<br/><br/>However, I had never seen Charlize Theron before and anxiously awaited the ending so I could google the ugly actress who portrayed a serial killer. I looked at photos of Ms. Theron and swore that the stunning beauty was the not the same actress from MONSTER. The best precedent for this character transformation was when Robert DeNiro gained fifty pounds to become a bloated Jake Lamotta in ""Raging Bull."" But at least he ended up looking like a fat debauched version of Robert DeNiro. <br/><br/>Another great thing about MONSTER was the continuously effective V.O. Most movies use a voice over to introduce a movie and then, if you hear it again at all, it is merely an afterthought. But for Cherlize Theron's character, the intermittent V.O commentary was like an internal vomit check."

","Charlize Theron's performance of a Florida serial killer won an Oscar but one wonders why a movie studio would invest the time, talent and money to film the life of a dysfunctional loser like Aileen Wuornos. Her life was one of neglect, abuse and failure, certainly not a blueprint for success in life. The picture follows Theron's portrayal of Wuornos as she stumbles from one episode after another in a pitiful attempt to put her life into some kind of perspective. Wournos undoubtedly hated men but didn't seem to mind earning cash for services rendered along Florida's highways, at truck stops and in trailer trash bars. After she killed her first john, Wournos reached the point of no return and began to plot and execute her victims without conscience. Theron's portrayal of the unattractive, uneducated and unrefined murderess is exactly why she won the industry's most coveted prize."

","Monster is the bleak story of Aileen Wuornos, a prostitute and one of America's most notorious female serial killers. Based around facts of her life and death, the film primarily focuses on the last year of her freedom. Where after entering into a strange lesbian relationship with Selby Wall, Wuornos, fed up of being a abused by men, starts killing those calling on her services.<br/><br/>Sad and potent is Patty Jenkins' first full length directorial effort. Though perhaps a touch guilty of pandering to Wuornos' own self created ""monster"" image, the film none the less has the right blend of sympathy and revulsion to make it a fascinating, if uneasy, experience. Former model Charlize Theron goes through a major transformation to become Wuornos, so much so she's practically unrecognisable. Bulked up in weight and with beaten down make up withering her face, Theron goes on to give a towering performance as the troubled, on the edge killer.<br/><br/>Without any thrills or hints of histrionics, Theron is uncompromising throughout the picture. To garner empathy with such an abrasive character is quite a trick, then to switch to monstrosity with conviction seconds later? Well that's almost magical in itself. Theron is backed up well by Christina Ricci as Selby. Selby Wall, an immature young lady oblivious to the dark path she is walking down, is given a great portrayal from Ricci. In light of the powerhouse show from Theron, it's much credit to Ricci that she enhances the film with her own delicate characteristics. Helping to emphasise the strangeness of the union in the process.<br/><br/>It's a tough film for sure, and come the final credits one is left with a feeling of sympathy towards Wuornos and the life she lived. If that be right or wrong is of course up to the individual viewer. Or if that was even Jenkins' intention is probably up for debate. But Monster exists and survives as a bitter character study of a desperate woman, which through the medium of cinema, makes us the viewers privy to something very edgy indeed. 7.5/10"

","I just finished watching this film with director's commentary and Theron's commentary. I saw it at the cinema on it's release and once in between then and now, and I just don't know where to begin....<br/><br/>This film got a lot of attention because of Theron's performance, and it is possibly one of the most richly deserved Oscars in Oscar history (along with Meryl Streep in Sophie's choice and Robert De Niro in Raging Bull), but it should not be viewed as a stage for her performance alone, it is a film of astonishing power, I don't believe I have ever felt so drained after watching a film. The story of this woman's incredibly unfortunate life unfolds with more compassion than perhaps some would think she deserves, and question marks must remain over how much artistic license was taken in making it (the director herself says that Wuornos was a great animal lover but to include that in the film would have been a logistical nightmare), but as this film washes over you all is forgiven.<br/><br/>Theron's performance is nothing short of extraordinary, she uses her entire body to convey emotions in ways I have never seen, she asked the director to move a prop so she could lean on it (you'll know when, people comment on the scene). Roger Ebert said 'This is one of the greatest performances in the history of cinema' and he is right. Theron seems to have transcended every other method ever known to actors and created a technique not ever seen before, you will have to see it to believe.<br/><br/>And I repeat myself, for which I apologize, but this should not be seen just for Theron's performance, this is a film of incredible emotional power, Christina Ricci should not go unmentioned for her performance, although against Theron's it must surely be overshadowed.<br/><br/>I have seen both documentaries on the subject of Aileen Wuornos, and this film captures her anger at what life threw at her, her confusion at why she had to do the things she felt she had to do, her complexities, her rage, her agonizing hope.........<br/><br/>If you have not availed yourself of this wonderful film, I urge you to see it, you will not be sorry, it is a true masterpiece."
"sddavis63","9","0","1","18 April 2009"," Superb Performance By Charlize Theron
","Generally speaking, I've always enjoyed both the work and the movies of Charlize Theron, and even on occasion when I've not particularly enjoyed the movie, Theron's performances have impressed me. Having said that, everything else she's done pales in comparison to this superb performance as Aileen Wuornos - the real-life prostitute/murderess, who killed several johns in 1989-90 before being arrested and ultimately executed. I would never have thought of Theron - who is a very beautiful woman - being able to pull off this part as a run-down, ""weather beaten"" street hooker, and yet she did it brilliantly.<br/><br/>The portrayal of Wuornos was surprisingly sympathetic, I thought, given the circumstances. Although there was nothing portrayed of her childhood, the stories she shares make the point that it was pretty tough, and the portrayal of the initial murder makes clear that it was self-defense, but it began a spiral downward, which was accelerated by her growing lesbian relationship with Selby (Christina Ricci), which seemed sincere enough, and which made the need for money to support both of them more desperate. That relationship itself adds to the sympathy felt for the two, as both are clearly troubled women in need of some love and tenderness who, at least for a time, find both with each other.<br/><br/>The story seems reasonably accurate, although ""Selby"" was not the actual name of Aileen's lover. Theron and Ricci had good on-screen chemistry together, and the story itself is quite riveting and, given the circumstances and what could have been done with it, not as graphic as it could have been - and I say that in a positive way. 9/10"
"morbius82000","9","0","1","11 April 2009"," a love story gone bad
","I think the essence of this film is that it is a tortured love story. I have become fascinated with this subject and I have watched this movie and the documentary ""Aileen: life and death of a serial killer"" several times. Even though Patty Jenkins did an admirable job of showing the real desperation and hunger for love that Aileen had, the movie still does manage to slightly glamorize the situation. I guess you have to give film makers some liberties, after all it is not a documentary, it is an piece of art that is trying to move people, which requires moving certain facts around and changing characters (for instance whereas Theron was spot on as Aileen, Ricci was much much cuter that the real life butchy looking Tyria Moore). I think the reason I watched this movie so many times is because of the famous Oscar winning performance by Theron. She really does seem to channel an entirely different person, it's astounding to watch, especially since this woman grew up in South Africa and only learned English when she was 17. I think her accent is a little off, if you watch the documentary Aileen has more of a mid-west accent rather than a southern one, but everything else is amazing to watch.<br/><br/>The love story that unfolds is beautiful, if perhaps unrealistic (Tyria Moore said Aileen was more like a sister than a lover). It seems to natural because Aileen/Theron is so masculine and physically imposing compared to the tiny Ricci that it doesn't even seem like a lesbian romance. I think Jenkins and Robinson were both interested, as I was, in finding the truth. Were the murders in self defense or not? Perhaps nobody will ever know. The documentary has a section where Aileen contradicts her testimony and says it was all about robbery, but it's important to realize that she only saying this because she was going in insane on death row and wanted to end her life as quickly as possible and stop the appeals. Since Jenkins read her letters I have to assume that she injected as much truth as she could. I think her version seems the most likely, that it was a mixture of self defense and opportunism. It is like the Somali pirates of today, once you reach bottom, suddenly you will consider any action to get out of your predicament. It seems Jenkins was pushing the love motivation, which, along with fear, is an incredibly strong motivational factor. As Aileen points out in the movie, people murder for love and fear every day. Of course it doesn't make it right, but Jenkins tries to at least show that the world is a complicated place and it's only simple minded people who come up with simple answers to horrible situations. (I read the same thing on message boards about the Somali pirates today, ""blow them up, nuke 'em"" etc.)<br/><br/>Anyone truly fascinated with this person and subject should get the 2 DVD special edition, the commentary is interesting, Jenkins gives little tidbits about Aileen based on the letters she wrote while on death row that reveal even more abuse and bad luck then I previously knew about, which was a lot. I think the ultimate lesson from all of this is that if you beat a dog long enough, eventually it's going to bite."

"Woodyanders","9","0","2","1 January 2009"," Charlize Theron is amazing as the notorious Aileen Wournous in this hard-hitting film
","Charlize Theron, barely recognizable with blotchy sunburned skin, stringy unwashed hair, a dumpy figure, smoldering near black eyes, and dentures, delivers a remarkable Oscar-winning portrayal of Aileen Wournous, a bitter, disaffected and down-trodden prostitute who hitchhikes in order to pick up customers and eventually resorts to murder so she can support both herself and her naive lesbian companion Shelby (well played by Christina Ricci). Writer/director Patty Jenkins and Theron do a commendable job of making Wournos a pitiable figure without ever glamorizing her and her infamous exploits. Jenkins offers a fascinatingly stark, bleak and gritty look at the seedy underbelly of America's lower class while pointing out how Aileen's lack of a proper education and past history of abuse made her ineligible for regular employment (the scenes where Wournos makes fumbling attempts at gaining a legitimate job are both funny and heartbreaking in equal measure). Theron holds the picture together with her bravura intense and riveting acting as Aileen; she astutely nails the burning rage and underlying despair Wournos feels about her lowly and miserable station in life. Moreover, there's a poignant doomed love story between Wournos and Shelby amidst all the harshness. While Theron clearly dominates the movie with her powerhouse work as Wournos, the bang-up supporting cast also deserve kudos for their praiseworthy contributions: the always reliable Bruce Dern is typically fine as Aileen's scruffy, sympathetic Vietnam veteran friend Thomas, Lee Tergesen makes a chilling impression as brutal john Vincent Corey, Pruit Taylor Vince has a touching cameo as another stuttering john, and Scott Wilson has a small, but memorable part as Wournos' nice guy last victim Horton. Steve Bernstein's bright, polished cinematography comes through with several striking images. BT's spare, melodic score likewise does the trick. While it's every bit as grim, seamy and depressing as one would expect, this movie is still worth seeing just for Charlize Theron's first-rate mesmerizing performance as one seriously troubled and damaged soul alone."

","""Monster"" is the true story of Aileen Wuornos (played phenomenally by Charlize Theron), a Florida prostitute who led a troubled, abuse-ridden life since her early years. Set in the 1980s, Aileen finds love in a shy, sweet young woman named Selby Wall (Christina Ricci). She has hopes and dreams of escaping and living a ""normal"" life with Selby. But after she is raped, beaten, and nearly murdered by one of her ""customers"", she spirals on a descent into madness and insanity, in which she begins murdering random men (all of them being her clientèle) along the Daytona Beach highways. <br/><br/>I don't exactly know where to begin here, besides to say that this is one of the most powerful movies I have ever seen. It's complex, heartbreaking, shocking, disturbing- and ultimately an all around tragedy. Not to mention the fact that it is a true story, and did in fact happen - this brings it into even a stronger scope of intensity, when taking in mind that all these things did happen. Director/writer Patty Jenkins does a wonderful job here, and it's evident through the script that she put some hard work into making this film - the details are all there, the events and scripting are all impressive and done with flair, and everything is in place as it should be. The murder scenes are realistic and unsettling (the shot of Aileen, standing there in the woods, smoking a cigarette as she stares at the body of her second victim is harrowing), and really make the viewer uncomfortable (as does the horrendous rape scene that sets Wuornos off in the beginning).<br/><br/>Now, with the gritty acting details, I have to point out Theron. She has given one of the greatest female performances of all time here, if not just greatest performances of all time. If you should see this film for one reason, it should be solely for her performance, because it's one of the strongest I've ever seen. She is absolutely brilliant - every single detail of her character is spot on. Her dialect, mannerisms, physical demeanor, absolutely everything. Charlize Theron doesn't just ""play"" the character here - she IS the character. I was continually impressed by her, from the opening scene of the film to the closing credits. Her performance is riveting, and she well deserved all the praise she received for it, because she truly did a magnificent job. Not only that, but she actually looks so close to the real Aileen that it is almost scary - her transformation from a gorgeous, tall blonde to a rugged prostitute (mentally and physically) is sheerly impressive. Christina Ricci is also great as always in her role as Aileen's naive, good-hearted love interest - but really, Theron does out-shine everybody.<br/><br/>I'd also like to take in the fact of the real Aileen Wuornos herself. The presentation of her in this film is fairly accurate as are the events. But rather than play on Wuornos' wretched childhood and horrible life-long abuse as an excuse for her actions, it simply presents them as they are. Yes, Aileen Wuornos did have a horrible life. Yes, she was horribly abused and psychologically damaged because of it. And yes, she was in fact guilty of murdering several men, and all but one of them is somewhat excusable. But despite all of her awful history and brutal actions, she was in fact a person. She had emotions, hopes, dreams, and was endlessly looking for real love, which she found in Selby. In the end, though, she had to pay the price for her actions.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Monster"" is an incredible film. It does a magnificent job of capturing the time, the events, and the characters in this gut-wrenching true story, to the point that the audience almost feels as if they are right there. Magnificent performances (most notably Theron) really make this film stand out, but it's a powerful and horrific story nonetheless- tragic, compelling, and at times hard to watch. It gives deep insight into an incredibly damaged woman that found herself on an inexcusable path of violence, murder, and destruction that she couldn't seem to escape. 10/10."

","Aileen Wuornos shattered the glass ceiling on female mass murderers, killing seven men she lured into compromising situations in order to support herself and her lesbian lover. Trust Hollywood to celebrate the lesbian and downplay the murders.<br/><br/>Charlize Theron certainly deserved her Best Actress Oscar, playing Wuornos as a dopey but empathetic human sponge unable to process the pain life throws at her, only absorb it. It was a total departure from her glamour-girl image that reads like stunt casting but totally sells you long before the film's end. Her brown eyes burn into you like lit cigarettes.<br/><br/>I'm less sold on the film itself. It doesn't glorify Wuornos, and in fact strains at credibility to make all but one of her victims not only sympathetic but, occasionally, noble. But the film never really explains why Wuornos killed, except that the seediness of turning tricks on the interstate finally got to her, especially when she found love, represented here by the fictional character Selby Wall (Christina Ricci).<br/><br/>Wuornos is the crux of the story, but Selby's the hinge on which the plot must turn, and it's here the film struggles most. Is she an innocent waif, misunderstood by her straight kith and kin? Or is she an enabler and instigator of Wuornos' crimes? Writer-director Patty Jenkins can't seem to decide, and Ricci alternates between interpretations.<br/><br/>One minute she is Wuornos' lonely, loyal buddy, gently, doggedly trying to talk sense to her: ""We can be as different as you want to be, but we can't kill people!"" Later she's basically telling her to hurry up and kill someone so they can get a ride out of town. ""This is YOUR plan,"" she whines.<br/><br/>On the plus side, other than Theron centering things, is a nice attention to lower-class consumer culture, with ugly t-shirts and corporate rock predominating. ""I love this song"", Wuornos says as Journey's ""Don't Stop Believin'"" plays from the roller rink speakers where she and Selby are enjoying a date. The irony, which Jenkins sets up well, is that believing is just another luxury Wuornos could not afford.<br/><br/>I like the opening of the film, too, setting up the despondent mood before Theron even arrives, images of a young girl continually abused until the narration abruptly stops (on the word ""stopped"") to show Wuornos under a bridge right after her last killing. The actors playing the various men Wuornos picks up all bring something unique and interesting to the proceedings.<br/><br/>But there was a lot that felt thrown up for effect, like an odd pal played by Bruce Dern ranting about ""circumstance"" and a Christian woman looking after Selby who is played in the typical narrow-minded Hollywood manner. Like I said, the film is divided in its loyalties. That may be understandable, but it reduces what could have been a more effective and complex movie to little more than a stage for Theron. Thanks to Theron, it makes for a decent bargain all the same."

","Monster (2003)<br/><br/>Top 5 - 2003<br/><br/>Before I start there is one thing I need to say. Bravo to Charlize Theron not only for embodying troubled and disturbed prostitute Aileen Wuornos but also agreeing to do a major film role where she was made to look plain ugly. It was a bold move and it paid off.<br/><br/>This film is the real life story of Daytona Beach prostitute Aileen Wuornos, a troubled, beaten down woman (both physically and mentally) whose unfortunate life drove her to this horrific path of selling her body to survive from the age of 13. The message this film gets across so poignantly is that most of these people who are prostitutes do not go into it as a choice but are forced to be humiliated in order to survive. This is what Monster is all about and much more.<br/><br/>As Wuornos narrates in flashbacks how she was raped at an age of 8 and her struggles as a young kid squeezing her into a corner with no other choice, you start to feel sorry about this unfortunate character.<br/><br/>After a man brutally attacked her after a pick up, Wuornos escapes, shoots him and steals his stuff and car. This is her new way of surviving. She doesn't want to 'hook' anymore she wants a normal life with her naive lesbian friend Shelby an 18 year old girl who ran away from her normal life to be with Wuornos. Ultimately it is Shelby who gives her friend to the police.<br/><br/>Theron's performance is one of the best I have ever seen, deserving of every accolade she received for this honest, physically demanding and unsettling performance. Ricci's performance is also a strong one.<br/><br/>I guess this film wants to say that why we may frown upon prostitution, we should sometimes try to understand the motives behind it and how millions of poor souls result to this tragic fate in order to survive. It is not that Aileen Wuornos, sensationalised by the media as 'America's first serial killer' was really a bad person, it was the environment that made her do the things she did. While I am not excusing the woman's actions I understand to an extent her sheer desperation (from what the film showed me).<br/><br/>An excellent, but depressing film.

"sheepmaria","10","0","2","16 July 2008"," Abused as a child, Aileen Wuornos becomes a prostitute at age 13 and begins murdering her clients for revenge.
","Released in 2003, Monster is based on the true story of Aileen Wuornos (Charlize Theron), a serial killer who was executed in Florida in 2002, for murdering seven men (directed and written by Patty Jenkins). Abused as a child, Aileen becomes a prostitute at age 13 and begins murdering her clients for revenge. Monster shows convincingly how a person who is brought up in an environment of abuse, without love or parental direction, will have an extremely hard time breaking free from the vicious cycle. The abused can become the abuser and can possibly never find the true meaning of love. Aileen experiences a combination of horrendous circumstances, including repeated abuse, parental neglect, and even abandonment. Such abuse can make anybody grow up to be a ""monstrous"" individual, especially if no one believes in or gives her a chance. Aileen's life is a vivid and morbid illustration of this cycle.<br/><br/>The transition from abused to abuser occurs when Aileen murders a client who has tortured her. After enduring sadistic and inhuman treatment, Aileen is finally able to retrieve her gun and kill her tormentor. When she realizes she has shot all of her bullets, she then beats the rapist with her gun in a rage. After she realizes he is dead, she begins screaming wildly, throws herself on the ground, and beats the ground with her hands. Theron's performance is riveting because she is so into her character that we believe she actually is Aileen having a meltdown. Having been raped as a child repeatedly by her father's best friend, Aileen had built up a wall of defense against reality. Her father did not believe her story and beat her for telling him about it. The absence of love and positive role models drove her to become a prostitute by the age of 13. She naively sought love through sexual contact with men who treated her with contempt.<br/><br/>This scene uses selective rack focus, in which the camera continually switches back and forth between Aileen and the rapist. The rapist is not shown as Aileen shoots and empties the gun on him; instead, the selective rack shot focuses on her. It then switches back to the abuser, now dead. This technique serves to juxtapose the abused and the abuser. The low key lighting represents impending doom, which also reinforces the importance of this scene as a turning point. The scene is extremely disturbing and shows Aileen becoming trapped in the vicious cycle. It is also one of the most dramatically effective, because Aileen Wuornos' anger, hate, and despair are cold-heartedly and realistically displayed.<br/><br/>While Aileen's first murder was justified for self-defense, her second murder was premeditated. This second scene marks the beginning of her deliberate killing spree. Aileen's first, unexpected murder has given her the courage to keep killing because she decides ahead of time to kill her very next client. After her second victim is dead, she smokes a cigarette and looks at him sadistically as he lies on the ground. Aileen perhaps feels nothing for the man she has just murdered, and this lack of empathy will enable her to keep on killing.<br/><br/>Aileen shoots her second victim at brutally close range, which underlines her lack of empathy. The camera then shows a close-up of her smoking a cigarette calmly as though nothing has happened. The close-up shot in this scene emphasizes both Aileen's cold-heartiness and magnifies her transformation from the prey to the hunter. The selective shot, flashing between Aileen and her victim, illustrates Aileen's position of power over her victim, which most abusers feel. Afterwards, the smoke from her cigarette forms a cloud over her face, making her appear disturbed and ""monstrous."" As Aileen drives away from the murder scene in her victim's car, her intense demeanor reflects the ""grim reaper."" She is turning into a killing machine.<br/><br/>In A Simple Plan, directed and written by Scott B. Smith, the character Hank Mitchell (Bill Paxton) also gets caught in a cycle of murders and tries to cover up his tracks. Whereas Aileen kills out of revenge for prior abuses and to feed her hatred for men, Hank murders people to keep the money he and his accomplices have found, as well as to cover up previous murders. Aileen may not have acquired the moral understanding to change the malicious course she is on; however, Hank may be morally aware of his situation, yet the cycle becomes too strong for him to break free.<br/><br/>Monster shows how people like Aileen, who grew up with a history of abuse, find it hard to break free from the brutal cycle, because breaking free begins with the realization and acknowledge there is a problem; especially,this is why Aileen becomes a cold, rigid, impulsive,killer of men. In the end, she kills a kind and innocent man who only wanted to help her. She feels forced into killing him after he accidentally sees her gun. Aileen does not want leave any loose ties or witnesses. For the first time she realizes she cannot break free from her ""monstrous"" cycle. When Aileen hears the ghastly screams of a good man pleading for his life, she screams simultaneously out and heart-breaking because of the innocent blood on her hands and her conscience, which she has not shown until this scene. This scene shows the overwhelming odds stacked against her; and after this scene her deeds finally caught up with her and just like her start in life, Aileen's life ends tragically. The movie ends with Aileen being executed.<br/><br/>Monster is a learning experience for people who might see dysfunctional people but not the path of life they're taken. It is important to know the reason why these people are failures and not write them off. Monster is a phenomenal movie to see with, Charlize Theron giving the performance of a lifetime."

"Sylviastel","9","0","1","11 March 2008"," A Depressing Story of Aileen Wuornos!
","I don't know why Aileen Wuornos, American female serial killer, gets more attention than others like Sante Kimes and Karla Homolka. She has a terrible childhood which included abuse of all kinds including sexual, physical, and psychological. Aileen is a tragic figure of society while Charlize Theron plays her quite brilliantly as a sad, tragic figure also a murderer. Most serial killers like Gacy and Bundy are remorseless and refuse to admit any wrong doing but not Aileen who finally confesses to murdering her johns but the motives are vague and unclear. She was probably threatened psychologically from childhood trauma. Unlike most serial killers, she was a detached killer who shot and robbed her victims who were mostly men. The film shows the men in a sympathetic light which is right in this case. The victims deserve sympathy while I feel sympathy for Aileen who I had trouble watching this film because she is so tragic and humanized by Theron's performance. In the end, she faces her fate while most killers sentenced to death fight all the way. Aileen stops the appeals because she wants to face her penalty. Even her relationship with SHelby whose named was changed shows that Aileen did have a conscience and the ability to love that few serial killers or sociopaths are capable of to do at all."
"RJBurke1942","8","0","1","8 March 2008"," A harrowing tale of a prostitute's life in hell.
","I'm puzzled why this story and film has the title it has. Properly defined, monster means, among other things, a person who generates horror through the commission of wicked or evil deeds. Hence, that title sounds misplaced, I think, when considering the actual life and times of the prostitute, Aileen Wuornos (Charlize Theron), who went about the Florida freeways killing her tricks, before being arrested in 1990. Granted, she did commit heinous crimes, but so did Ted Bundy and many other male serial killers who were much worse than anything Aileen did.<br/><br/>According to the narrative, her first murder was in self-defense; the obnoxious and dangerous trick who picked her up was apparently intent on killing her. She found his gun and popped him, thus saving her own life. Aileen, however, was no sociopath, the true monsters in our societies; after the deed, she felt relief, anger, a touch of remorse and not a little fear of being caught. At that point, there was no thought of repeating her effort.<br/><br/>A stronger personality and intelligence would have stopped there, taken stock of her situation, and decide to fade away as quickly and as far as possible. Unhappily for Aileen  and additional unsuspecting johns  she had neither the personality, nor intelligence nor money to change her mode of living: she'd been ground down since the age of thirteen and worked as a freeway hustler for years. Quite simply, the culture in which she lived helped to create and maintain the person she became...<br/><br/>It's the oldest profession, of course, so I'm not saying that it wasn't her fault, especially the final heart-rending murder of an old guy (Scott Wilson) who just wanted to help her. Having seen her face, however, she had to kill him to survive and Theron's performance at this point is beyond comparison. I'd have given her the Oscar just for those few minutes. But, she was astounding throughout the entire film.<br/><br/>Her unraveling begins, however, when she meets Selby (Christina Ricci) and the two become infatuated with each other, sexually and emotionally. Aileen, of course, has been loveless for most of her adult life, so the interest Selby shows in her is a new and exciting experience. So, when Aileen killed her first john in self-defense, she wanted to quit hooking and try to lead a normal life: get a real job, do it right, live with her new love in 'married' bliss. Hence, she tries: applying for all sorts of jobs for which she is totally unqualified. Her quest for respectability is totally crushed, however, when she's forced to return a favor to a corrupt cop.<br/><br/>So, when she finally needed more money to feed herself, Selby and their life together, she took the easy way out: instead of getting paid for sex, she decided to kill the messenger. All of them. After the first murder, the second is always easier, so it is said. Hence, from that point on, she approaches, but doesn't encompass, the essence of the film's title.<br/><br/>It's a sad story, of course, for many reasons. The saddest part, from my perspective, is that there are other Aileen Wuornoses out there, in just about every country in the world. And, it only needs a trigger to set another in motion again on a self-destructive and murderous path.<br/><br/>It's a superb production, although somewhat hasty in its cuts and scene changes, I thought. However, it was shot over twenty-eight days, with multiple scenes on some days, so it must have been hectic trying to collapse the last nine months of Aileen's life on the road into just over a hundred minutes of film.<br/><br/>Not recommended for children, of course. But recommended for all adults who aren't afraid to see the sordid face of all societies."

","Thanx to Sydney Channel 7 in Sydney who started the broadcast at 22:10 when it was programmed at 22:30, it saved me a tinny bit of agony, not much really as they are more and more generous with their commercials! I picked up the story just before the roller skating scene. Yes I thought it was ugly. What an incredible piece of acting, I watched the new ""italian Job"" only a few night before and could not believe I was looking at the same person. I'm not sure I'm comfortable with horror and horrible stories. Yes I'd prefer the Brady Bunch. Sometimes I wonder if we are really trying to make this world better when we continuously glorifying evil. If all this had no affect on us, why are we bombarded with adds/commercials (I hear the French government want to get rid of it on free TV, it will be interesting to see how far it'll go...money is not something to disregard!) But OK let's be mature, if I disregard what I have just said, I'll have to agree with most of the reviews I read. It's very sad, very well acted, and very touching. I too felt some sympathy for the character, quite a lot of sympathy actually. And I think she's got it right when she says that people do die all the time for the reason she quotes which is not way out, neither the right reasons. When one looks at misery it can make one biased, we almost forget the victims. I also remember experiencing similar ambivalent feelings with ""the accused"" (jody foster) the situation was quite different yet there was in it something I was not comfortable with, that kind of message that's OK to do what you want but others should not take advantage of it. Yep you should have the right to be in the wrong place doing the wrong thing without being in trouble at all. Yep it should be a unique privilege that does not extend to others. Here we're dealing with a story I believe closely following a real event. But how much reality do we need these days. I guess I'll have to cling onto what I have heard very recently. It's the sin that is very ugly, not the sinner. And why it takes 14 years for capital punishment?"
"BA_Harrison","6","0","3","28 December 2007"," A rather skewed account of a killer hookerwatchable thanks to Theron and Ricci.
","Based on the true story of Aileen Wuornos, man-hating hooker and serial killer, this film is intended to show how society, through lack of care and compassion, can create a monster.<br/><br/>Sexually abused as a child, and treated badly by nearly all men ever since, Aileen (Charlize Theron, almost unrecognisable with lank greasy hair, buck teeth and carrying a little extra weight all over) is a prostitute whose hopes and dreams of a normal life have long since been crushed. However, after meeting Selby, a lonely lesbian (Christina Ricci), she develops her first meaningful relationship, and begins to make plans for the future: to quit whoring, get a job, and settle down.<br/><br/>But since Aileen's only qualification is a degree in giving head from the University of Life, getting a real job is next to impossible, and pretty soon, she goes back to walking the streets for a living.<br/><br/>Then, after one particularly nasty john gets rough, her pent-up anger finally boils over and she shoots the man. Finding his wallet loaded with cash, she realises that she now has a way to get her hands on enough money to enable her and Selby to afford a decent life: all she has to do is kill a few more loathsome customers.<br/><br/>Although the film has been lauded by many critics, I found Monster to be a rather unexceptional film, being rather dreary, with an over-long running time, and a script that is seemingly economic with the truth in order to suit its own agenda (from what I have read, Wuornos was far less deserving of pity than is shown in the film, having never actually acted in self defence).<br/><br/>However, thanks to a solid central performance from Theron (for which she won an Oscar), and good support from Ricci, who makes a believable dyke, Monster is still worth a watch. Theron's transformation from screen goddess to white trash is truly incredible, and the actress effortlessly manipulates her audience, allowing them to feel sympathy towards her character (we understand her plight and can even forgive her for her actionsat least until she begins to blow away less 'deserving' victims).<br/><br/>It is also probably our only chance to get to witness a prolonged tongue session between Theron and Ricci (although both actresses are unfortunately looking far from their best)."
"johnnyboyz","8","0","1","19 November 2007"," What if Thelma & Louise was based on a true story?
","Monster is a film about self discovery; it's about friendship and the gruelling reality of life and how it can hit those when they least expect it. Aileen (Theron) doesn't start out a serial killer in Monster but due to unforeseen events, sort of becomes one; Selby (Ricci) doesn't start out a girl in a large, wide world full of life experience but due to unforeseen events, you bet she is by the end of the film through realising food doesn't put itself on the table and money doesn't grow on trees and this forms the basis of the film Monster; a film directed by a woman, about women and about finding out who or what certain people really are.<br/><br/>It's probably been noticed before I'm saying it here but Monster really reminded me of Ridley Scott's 1991 film Thelma & Louise; a film in itself an entertaining and unpredictable one about self discovery and 'dates with destiny'. One outlining problem I had with that film was its lack of commitment towards its content; it should have been a dark film revolving around dark matter but it remained light and upbeat thanks to the constant innocence of its leads and the friendly county music that popped up every now and again. In Monster, I have found the film I wanted Thelma & Louise to be  a darker tale about two women on the run.<br/><br/>I would go so far as to say that Monster actually feels like a remake of Thelma & Louise. Firstly, you have the two leads who are complete binary opposites: Aileen is the lead, almost hard bodied, character who is a trickster, a liar and a prostitute whereas Selby is the angelic sidekick who lives at home and still has other kids as friends: there is also a sweet camera shot where Selby looks into a mirror and smiles at herself which although quick is by no means insignificant - if Selby is Thelma then Aileen is Louise. Secondly, it's Selby who runs away against her family's wish just as Thelma did in the other film but this time instead of running away from a domineering husband she is attempting to, perhaps wrongfully to some, escape her mother and father. Thirdly, the initial incident that sparks the film into life is an attempted rape on one of the girls; funnily enough it's the Aileen/Louise character and Aileen reacts in the exact same way Louise did. The difference here is that in Monster, she is actually raped whilst being bound in the car's front seat with the repercussions of her rape evident later on in the film when she showers but Thelma & Louise, being not as dark, was a lot more straightforward and a lot less bloodthirsty.<br/><br/>Another thing that Monster does in a much more detailed and analytical manner is its study of the characters. Thelma and Louise were both relatively recognisable characters whom instead of starting out 'bad', merely progressed to that stage. We aren't told of Thelma's 'past incidents' but in Monster, we not only know what Aileen does but we get to see her do it, ie; being picked up at various points and discussing types of sex and costs. What disturbed me here and what made it clearly identifiable over Thelma & Louise was that Monster makes Aileen out to be rather masculine or at least gives her masculine traits. I already mentioned she is hard bodied but she is very unattractive, talks and acts like man and doesn't dress particularly glamorously  this twinned with the fact she is a lesbian means that she would go for girls if faced with the chance, something the male subconscious apparently thinks about every dozen seconds or so. There is also the matter relating to the cast on Selby's arm. Although seemingly random and insignificant; whenever the cast remains on, arguments and disagreements are never far away  to me, it felt like a part of home was still attached to Selby but what's interesting is that as soon as the cast comes off; Selby and Aileen have sex: she is now free and has 'cast off' any lingering feelings of doubt about the situation. No, it's not a coincidence her arm heals by the time Selby and Aileen reach that stage of their relationship.<br/><br/>Amongst all the analysis of gender and comparisons to Thelma & Louise, Monster remains a dark and bleak film with a captivating story and two very, very fine pieces of acting. There is a definite atmosphere of chance; a hopeless feeling that eventually, everything will not be alright. The film's dark approach and dark subject matter is not tampered with like in Scott's 1991 road movie and it was pleasing to have such a film that didn't have many 'laughs' or secondary characters to sometimes cut to whenever the film felt like it. Monster is clever and interesting film-making that although relies on previous efforts, still manages to feel fresh."

","I thoroughly enjoyed this film. It was a refreshing change from the typical teen serial killer movies - this was real life. Theron done an amazing job as Aileen, she changed her whole appearance, her posture, her voice, everything that could be changed. She definitely deserved that Oscar.<br/><br/>The creators of the movie done a brilliant job at exploring Aileen's life and the killings. My only gripe with the film is that Christina Ricci's character, Selby, looks a tad too young to play her lesbian lover and her naivety reminds me of the kids/teen films she started off in, such as Casper.<br/><br/>Apart from that, Monster is possibly one of the best films in the past decade. Shocking, moving, traumatising are just some of the words I'd use to describe Monster. Don't miss it."

","I knew this was about a serial killer who killed other people. I knew that this was going to have a sad ending, which i usually don't like in films. I knew that there was going to be some pain involved in the characters lives. Yet I still watched it. A few hours later, I couldn't stop thinking about it.....<br/><br/>Charlize Theron is absolutely spellbounding in this role as Aileen, who killed seven men as a prostitute. Though I don't approve of anyone killing people, you can't help but feel sympathetic to Aileen, due to the troubles in her life. I often wonder why the world works sometimes, why we're born into the lives that we have. This film is about trying to find purpose, despite of who you are; whether your gay, blind or whatever life gives you. All the performances are great, and Ricci is very good as a vulnerable and sensitive lover of Aileen. The ending really has you feeling gutted inside, especially the final words shown 'Selby and Aileen never spoke again.' The film is a love story in a dark world, showing how the judgements we make are usually the worst, but we never get to know someone inside...because we never look close enough.<br/><br/>This isn't a film to watch if you don't want to feel overwhelmingly dead inside, but for those who do, the experience can open your eyes in many ways you couldn't imagine. Recommended absolutely!"

","This is a pretty good drama based on a true story, and the leading actress, who is usually gorgeous looking (face and body), is very convincing. Basically Aileen Wuornos (Oscar and Golden Globe winning, and BAFTA nominated, and purposely not completely attractive, Charlize Theron) is a prostitute who one night has her transport break down, and finds herself at a gay bar. There she meets, and will eventually fall in love with, naive Selby (Sleepy Hollow's Christina Ricci). As they get closer to each other, they try to create a better life away from Selby's faithful family and possibly away from ""hooking"". Aileen is only good at prostitution though, and because she can't get a real job she secretly carries on with it. One night, one ""customer"" paid her, but tried to rape her, and she ended up shooting/killing him. This film is meant to be about Aileen being one of the first female serial killer in America, you really only see four deaths out of her seven in real life, it's more like a doomed lesbian romance story. In the end they are both caught by the cops, they never saw each other again after the court case, and years later Aileen (on death row) was executed by the state of Florida (lethal injection). Also starring Bruce Dern as Thomas, Lee Tergesen as Vincent Corey, Annie Corley as Donna, Pruitt Taylor Vince as Gene/Stuttering ""John"", Marco St. John as Evan/Undercover ""John"", Marc Macaulay as Will/Daddy ""John"" and Scott Wilson as Horton/Last ""John"".

Only some radical feminists as Kyle's mom from ""South Park"" may like this. We see an extraordinarily ugly prostitute who kills her clients after she has served them, and sometimes even before doing the work. With her cap, she looks just like some guy who works in a car repairing workshop. She is a nervous wreck and there is no explanation for that. Charlize Theron got an Oscar for her role. True, she plays well. She is beautiful actually but she has been made ugly in the film. It is a big mystery to me though, why does she have to be so ugly. I do not think that any man, however desperate, would even glance at a woman like her. We should not pity her. Killing a man is unjustified. If there is a moral in this film, it might be as follows: never talk to an ugly woman, especially when she is a prostitute."

"sweper74","6","0","1","19 August 2005"," remarkable resemblance by Theron!!
","I saw this movie 2 days ago on DVD and i like it. The acting by Theron is the best part. I recently watched a documentary about the serial killer Aileen and I must say that Charlize Theron looks so much like Aileen in this movie that you can sometimes believe (almost) that it is her (The eyes, the gestures... ). However, by comparing the authentic story on the documentary with this movie, there are some things that differs. First of all i am thinking about the fictitious person Selby. In the real life doc. there is no Selby, but there is a woman called Thyria. I probably guess the makers of the movie didn't have the legal rights to use the name Thyria in this movie (?), so they created 'Selby'. The second thing is that the first killing in this movie was motivated by a brutal rape of Aileen. It might have been that way in real life, but in the documentary it never occurred that it was a rape. At least there were no evidence of that. The last thing i was thinking of was that in the end on the trial when Selby was called to witness, she looked at Aileen at one time. In the doc. it was stated that Thyria (Selby) never looked into Aileens eyes. If i remember right I don't think she looked at her at all. My final judgment is that it is a good movie with good acting but a little bit fictitious story for some parts (maybe too much fictitious). I grade it a 6 out of 10."

The actors were so good, I couldn't even detach them from their characters when I tried, and who knew that Charlize Theron, the pretty woman in ""Sweet November"" could look so hideous with any amount of makeup? LOL. Anyway, the story is very disturbing and this is what makes the movie disturbing as well. However, it is definitely a good documentary to see.

","This movie is based on the tragic life of prostitute and serial killer Aileen Wuornos, played by Charlize Theron. What makes this movie worth watching is the acting, but I'll be honest with you. I always find it hard to agree with the Academy when they give the Oscar for playing such a person as Aileen Wuornos. Charlize Theron absolutely gave an excellent performance, but the fact that she actually won the Academy Award gave me a strange feeling. I had the same feeling when Bobby De Niro won for ""Raging Bull"". Amazing performance as well, but what bothers me is the fact that I didn't feel any sympathy for the person ""Jake La Motta"". Do you know what I mean? When i see an acting performance, I'll like it when I'm touched and moved, when I want to see the whole movie all over again just for the acting.<br/><br/>Like I already mentioned, I had the same feeling here as with ""Raging Bull"". Aileen Wuornos isn't a good person at all. She's horrible and incredibly bad. She's a typical low class hooker. But of course, the Academy Award is given for the best acting performance, not for playing the most beautiful role. So was Charlize Theron's performance Oscar-worthy? Absolutely, just look at who she became to play the role. She gained a lot of weight and other changes in order to become Aileen Wuornos.<br/><br/>7/10"

This process must have taken place with the two principle actors Charlize Theron and Christina Ricci as well, because they are brilliant! I am definite going to look up their early work.

","Honestly, I've never had too high of an opinion of Charlize Theron.. Flat in The Astronaut's Wife and Cider House Rules (which is a great movie nevertheless), I was apprehensive to see this, even though I saw this just recently, nearly a year and a half after she won the Academy Award for it. Playing with the ""The more makeup the better"" approach to getting her award, Theron nevertheless plays Aileen Wounds, a prostitute-turned-killer who was profiled in the great Nick Bantock doc, ""Aileen Wournos, The Selling Of A Serial Killer"". Theron plays her to a T here, getting the mannerisms quite awesomely, to the point where it's almost scary. Her special ""friend"", Selby, played brilliantly here by Christina Ricci, is broken whether to stand by her, or run, when the money starts getting low. This is a consequential decision, something that makes her as guilty as Wournos in my opinion. Both of them play off of each other so well, and it's a shame that Christina Ricci (who I've always liked) didn't get a nom as well."

","I would have to say at first I crinkled my nose at the DVD box that my wife brought home. Heh. I had heard of the movie but unfortunately missed the end of the Oscars. I tossed the box to the side until we had time to watch it. So I didn't know Aileen's story or the ending.<br/><br/>I have watched it several times since. I have been enlightened to the cruelty of society, myself and others included. One chance, one person who looked beyond themselves could have made this a story of a person who fell in love, pulled themselves from the depths of despair only to find the touch, the love, the tenderness that had been lacking for so long. <br/><br/>I've read the reviews all over the Net. Film critics seemed divided on one web site. Making fun of Charlize Theron, calling Aileen despicable, faulting the film for not fitting cookie cutter models. I feel that some people, maybe most, just don't get it. Of course she murdered, and that cannot be forgiven and she paid the price society dealt. Which brings me back to society. It most certainly didn't help. <br/><br/>We all need to open our eyes and try a little harder in our hectic, busy, ""I don't have time"" lives to every once in a while provide support to those that may need our help. Sometimes, like Aileen, they even ask for help. I'm not perfect, I work downtown and see plenty of people that need and ask for help. I can recognize that some are schemers. I intend to help those I can from now on, and not only by giving them some change, but by offering some words of encouragement. Yes maybe its too small to help much. But what if we all had this attitude, and helped even a little. <br/><br/>Some may still fall through the system, but as a society, can we not evolve to saving and helping all? Aileen was on the edge and because of her mental health problem, fell over the edge. The victims are many and I feel for the seven men and if I may say so, pray for all of us so that this may never happen again.<br/><br/>Gee if you read this comment, thank you. I guess I'd have to say that this film Monster has forever changed me and I am still dealing with the meanings of this film.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time."

","When movies are based upon true stories, they grab my attention. As the saying goes, ""truth is stranger than fiction"" and that surely is the case here. The story was about Aileen Wuornos (Theron) a prostitute who snaps after she is brutally raped and beaten. She takes the mission of killing ""johns"" as her new way of life. It is also the way she supports her lover, Selby Wall (Ricci). Before long things escalate further out of control until Aileen is arrested for her killing spree.<br/><br/>If the movie accurately portrays Aileen Wuornos, then sure I feel some sympathy for her. Don't get me wrong, she was a murderer and for that she got what she deserved. The first person she killed deserved to die. She probably wouldn't have lived if she didn't kill him. The problem is she didn't stop there. She was on a mission to kill men. She had a messed up childhood and life. The people she killed after certainly were not looking to harm her. She only spared one man. The last person she killed was actually trying to help her. He wasn't even a ""john"". She killed a Good Samaritan. She was arrested and her former lover ratted her out. She was put to death 12 years after she was convicted.<br/><br/>This was a really good movie. Charlize Theron was marvelous. She really portrayed the ""Monster"" very well. I would recommend checking this movie out. You have great acting and a real life story line. There is many disturbing scenes, but one would expect that in a movie called, ""Monster."""

","It is easy to see that Charlize Theron has a pretty face, and it was also pretty easy to see that she was an accomplished actress. I first saw her in the newest version of ""Mighty Joe Young"", and afterwards several other roles. I have become a fan of hers. But her performance here as the Florida prostitute Aileen Wuornos, is nothing short of amazing. She put on a few pounds, she wore appropriate makeup, and she is so good that one easily forgets that it is Theron we are watching. The way she ""channels"" the real Wournos is eerie.<br/><br/>The story itself is not pleasant. We have a lady who had a very difficult childhood and, while she appears to have been intelligent, had a very shaky concept of reality. She had remembered hearing someone say, years earlier, that you can be anything you want to be. So, when she decides to go straight and make an honest living, she figured all she had to do was dress nicely, interview, and get a nice job. It just doesn't work that way.<br/><br/>SPOILERS. Abused from a very young age, ""Lee"" learned early that she could get money and favors via sex. She really hoped someone would ""discover"" her and she would become another Marilyn Monroe. (Actual photos of her show she wan't really that attractive.) As an adult, prostitution was the only trade she knew. At a gay bar one night she meets up with Selby (Christina Ricci), a closet lesbian still living at home in a garage apartment. Initially repulsed, Lee takes to Selby and they start living together in cheap motels. One 'john' gets rough with Lee, ties her up, she gets loose, grabs a gun, and shoots and kills him. Having a tough time keeping Selby happy, she decides killing and robbing more would not be any worse, and becomes a serial killer of sorts. Finally ID'd then jailed, Selby is persuaded to testify against Lee, who was executed in Florida in the early 1990s."

","I saw Monster for the first time in January 2005. I never knew what all the sensation was with Charlize Theron. Actually, I had seen her in movies but didn't really know who she was, but I must say did she ever make a lasting impression on me. This movie hasn't left my thoughts.<br/><br/>I know what it's like to be mentally abused and taken advantaged of by people, and when I saw this movie, it all came flooding back. This movie showcased what our country has done for the abused, battered, and pushed aside child: Nothing.<br/><br/>We all know that Aileen Wuornos never had a chance, but this movie gives hope to the hopeless. I believe that somewhere out there a life will be saved by the love and caring that went into bringing this tragedy to the big screen. <br/><br/>We can all say, ""I would never kill"", but how do we know what we would do unless we find ourselves on the edge between reality and despair. Each and every one of us has the ability to make choices, but we must remember what circumstances we are facing when these choices must be made. For Aileen, most of her choices were due to survival, for the most part of her life, but when she found someone that was willing to love her she fought for it to the end. It's unfortunate that Aileen lived such a horrible life and when love found her, she couldn't hold on to it. The saddest and most ironic thing was that Selby was no different to Aileen than the rest of the world had been. The one person that Aileen loved, cared for, and let her guard for turned on her. Can you imagine what Aileen felt inside when she heard these tapes played in court? I'm sure that no judge had to impose the death sentence on her because her girlfriend did it for her. At that moment, all Aileen had lived for those past four years was gone. Granted she murdered and she had to pay the price. She had taken some innocent lives for the most part, but no one ever paid the price for taking her life so many years ago, and here was Selby putting the final nail in Aileen's coffin.<br/><br/>Where was the justice for Aileen Wuornos? Who fought for her when the world was caving in on her? Why did her girlfriend get nothing more than a slap on the wrist? There is a fine line between good and evil, and once you've crossed it there's no turning back.<br/><br/>This movie rates a 10 in my book. It gave us the opportunity to see the broken spirit behind the Monster."
"mhajs","10","0","1","28 March 2005"," I hate drama movies. This one, I loved.
","**** out of **** <br/><br/>After having a fight with one of my best friends (or maybe the best), to watch a drama movie was the last thing I had in mind. When I rented ""Monster"", I already knew that Charlize Theron (whose beauty I have only seen in magazines, Oscar festivals and website photographs) have won the Oscar. I knew that also the cast included Christina Ricci, an actress who I haven't seen in a movie in a long time. I have watched the trailer, thought of the movie as a crime thriller, with drama ingredients, but only watching ""Monster"", I have realized it was an intense (very) intense drama. I don't like drama movies at all, but this is a rare exception.<br/><br/>As the movie opens, we see scenes of the narration of Charlize's character, Aillen (who in real life was a hooker) and we think of her as a person who just wants to succeed in life. Actually, she tries in the movie, but the way she tries, well, that's something you'll check better while you watch it. What happens in ""Monster"" is that one day Aillen meets a girl in a bar called Selby (played by Christina). They become friends, Aillen sleeps in Selby's house and one day when they go out together, they kiss each other in a dance floor. That's when they start having relations with each other, like they're a couple. The feeling called love starts to take place. Aillen and Selby move to a house together, as Selby escapes from her home against her parent's will. Before moving on to the rest of the plot, there's something I'd like to say. I remember Roger Ebert's review of Back To The Future - Part II (1989), where he says that the movie is goofy, screwy and an exercise in goofiness. He probably didn't enjoy Part II to its full because the movie was the way he described. But in my opinion, when a movie is screwy, it catches our attention like we're paralyzed or something. We get so curious to know what's going to happen, we think ""but what if that happens"" and so on. Tarantino's movies (whose birthday was yesterday, I'm writing this review one day after his birthday) are all screwy. In Pulp Fiction (1994), in the chapter of the golden watch, we get to see Bruce Willis with his girlfriend in his apartment building room, preparing the bags to leave with her. But when he finds out he's lost his watch, he starts getting mad, yells at his girlfriend, crashes the TV and goes on a quest to find his lost watch. That involves killing John Travolta, crashing a car on the street and... haven't you seen the movie? I won't spoil this! But what's most funny is that almost all scenes begin so innocently, so natural, so quiet, while characters are talking to each other and all, but than suddenly, we start to see madness takes shape.<br/><br/>All right, getting back to the review, Monster is kinda like that. When Aillen and Selby are finally together in their new room, we start to see why ""Monster"" is so like the other screwy movies. At the scene of the first client, when Aillen and him are inside the car, they're talking naturally like nothing's really that important is about to happen. Until we see the rest of the scene. And the rest of the movie. Well, you must watch it in order to really understand what I'm saying.<br/><br/>I definitely wouldn't have enjoying this movie that much if it wasn't based on a true story. Because if it wasn't, the plot and the writing would be much too absurd! I couldn't believe Selby was really enjoying being with that hooker, that street woman, that unknown and stranger. I really could believe because I remembered the movie's opening titles ""Based on a true story."" ""Monster"" is nicely directed by Patty Jenkins, who really made a masterpiece as a director. When you select the DVD's extra features and start watching the making of Monster, you understand why Jenkins is so talented in this movie. She went to all the real locations that the story took place and filmed the movie at the same ones. As she said in the documentary, she really got inside her movie. Charlize also deserved the leading role academy award for her talent as well. I guess that Christina Ricci also made a wonderful job as Selby, it was a very emotional performance. Great! Really great! Both of them! BT's score is also really great! That piano sounds at the roller wheal scene even made me remember Final Fantasy X's score where Tidus goes to Besaid for the first time. Everyone gave everything they could to bring you this drama movie based on a true story. I really suggest even if you do not like drama movies, to watch this one, because it's great! Just don't fight with anyone before watching this movie or you may get sad twice you should be."

There is a lot of moral debate about her right to take the life of other men, or about the right of the state to take her lifer, but frankly speaking I do not buy too much into such debates, and I found the overall story sordid and depressing.

""Monster"" pulls you into the story immediately and never breaks the spell. Patty Jenkins, the writer/director, shows you the world of serial killer Aileen Wuornos through Aileen's eyes. The storytelling is magnificently done, with every detail adding to the effect. All of the acting in the film is first-rate, with believable, realistic people. Charlize Theron, however, delivers one of the finest performances, male or female, ever captured on film. Before seeing the movie, I wondered if her Oscar might be Hollywood politics or just a ""Wow"" vote that someone so beautiful could be made to look so unattractive. Only minutes into the film, however, I completely lost any sense of Charlize Theron and lost any wonder at the artistry of the makeup person. Ms. Theron simply IS Aileen Wuornos. Her mannerisms, her voice -- everything! The effect is of watching a well-made documentary rather than a Hollywood movie. After the film was over, and I reflected on what I had just seen, I knew that Ms. Theron had given one of the finest performances ever. She ""overcame"" her beauty to create someone else who is a totally different person. This is acting at its finest. She is deserving of mention with the very best: Meryl Streep, Dustin Hoffman, Laurence Olivier, and just a few others. The excellent work of Christina Ricci, Bruce Dern, and the other actors should not be minimized, either. The entire film is most notable for the way that it tells its story seamlessly, without ever seeming to be anything other than a documentary of a real life.

See it, just for the lead characters acting and the decent 70's and 80's music and clothes and the hideous appearance that a very pretty actress named Charlize Theron took on to play this part. It's weird how in the last couple of years 2 very pretty actresses( Halley Berry and Charlize Theron) played parts in movies where they had to become sort of unattractive and both movies had the word ""monster"" in them! I also noticed that the part where they crash in the old folks front yard, when Charlize shoves Christina back into the car, she appeared to really smack her head into the car door! It must of hurt!"

","Having seen this movie for the first time recently a few things came through my mind. Firstly the acting performances. Christina Ricci and Bruce Dern were superb in their respective roles but i was disappointed by Charlize Theron's role. OK sure looked like the women and maybe got the killers mannerisms down to a T, but i just felt that it was lacking something.<br/><br/>Also, i thought that the movie was trying to get us, the viewer, to sympathize with Aileen Wuoros plight, playing sad music during killing and in the end, but lets not forgot that the women was a serial killer and thus why should be sympathies with her? We don't care about Charles Manson, Peter Sutcliffe or Dr Harold Shipman(when he was alive) and they were all serial killers? Should they get a big budget movie made about them, then we will all be like ""the system failed them, blah, blah, blah"".<br/><br/>Overall the movie was full of good performances but the attempted sympathy attraction ruined it for me.<br/><br/>I would give it a 3 out of 5"
"guyfromjerzee","Null","0","1","13 August 2004"," A brilliant piece of cinema with a brilliant performance by Charlize Theron!
","I'm sure the list of comments will be split between those who loved the movie and those who felt it was over-hyped and not that special.  Well, if you take it from me, the film deserved all the hype it received!  Theron's performance really is magnificent!  Of course, the heavy makeup does part of the job of making the audience forget we're watching Charlize on screen, but her performance also contributes greatly to that illusion.  I really did feel for her torment and struggle every minute of the film.  Whenever you do a movie that focuses on a serial killer, there's always audiences who complain that the director is trying to condone heinous acts of violence. ""Monster"" is not about condoning the murder of men, but about telling Aileen Wurnoes's real story.  I don't recall hearing about the actual Wurnoes case on the news, but I'm sure the media didn't paint her to be anything more than a cruel, evil person.  This movie shows that although her acts or murder shouldn't be encouraged, there was a method to her madness. Virtually none of the guys she killed were saints.  Many were sleazy guys willing to cough up cash to have sex with, and possibly abuse, a prostitute--unbeknownst to their poor wives and kids.  There's even a touching scene where Theron gets into a car with an obese man (played by Pruitt-Taylor Vince), and spares his life because he's simply an innocent young man who's never had sex with a woman.  Christina Ricci also gives a fine performance, though it doesn't measure up to Theron's.  And veteran actor Bruce Dern does a fine job in the supporting role of the one guy willing to help Aileen in times of need.  ""Monster"" is a powerful film all-around, and never once was there a dull moment.  It's movies like this that prove that millions of bucks are really not required to make a great film.  As a matter of fact, sometimes money can ruin a film.  This is one of the best films I've seen in quite a while, and it truly takes advantage of the masterful medium of cinema.  I'm sure many will check this out simply to see Charlize's groundbreaking transformation from beautiful actress to a grotesque Florida prostitute, but that's not the only reason to check it out.  Plus, the movie contains the great 80's song, ""Don't Stop Believin'."" The use of that song alone gets my vote.  (9 out of 10)"

","I have seen a few transformations in my time, but I can't recall one as shocking as Charlize Theron's in Monster.  The babe most audiences have become accustomed to (The Italian Job, Devil's Advocate, etc.) underwent an enormous physical change as she took on the part of Aileen Wuornos. <br/><br/>
The role of Wuornos is that of older prostitute who has a trailer-park nature about her (no offense intended to trailer parks owners or patrons) and knows nothing other than sex serving as a way to make ends meet.  The portrayal of Wuornos is designed to be a sympathetic one, intended to show the difficulties of ""hooking"" and how such characters develop from a troubled childhood and other crises in life.  <br/><br/>Wuornos ends up meeting a young girl, Selby (Christina Ricci), whose infatuation with her makes Wuornos feel truly loved and cared about for the first time in her life.  Wuornos then attempts to ""hook"" enough money to take her and Selby out of a small Florida town.  But when she is beaten and sodomized by one of her johns, it causes Wuornos to start a killing spree that doesn't end until seven men are dead.<br/><br/>This movie attempts to show us the ugly horrors that some of the considered ""low"" people in life experience.  It shows Wuornos as another human being suffering from some grim realities of life while altogether ignorant of others.  The film also tries to show you a kind side to Wuornos and why she acted as she did in murdering so many people.  But while the plot confronts the hardships and injustices Wuornos suffered, this in no way justifies her murderous actions.<br/><br/>Overall, GREAT acting by Theron and Ricci in what almost seems like  Thelma & Louise at times.  This movie is definitely not intended for a younger audience and the overall nature of the film will probably appear somewhat depressing to most adult viewers."

","Monster is another true story about despair and hopelessness, leading to inevitability. What it also encompasses is a love story in among the tragedy and it does surprisingly well to make the combination of love and destruction compatible, almost conjoined.<br/><br/>Charlize Theron is simply not recognisable (Bar the voice) as Aileen, a prostitute who lost control of herself a long time ago. Condemned to a life of failure on every front, she essentially possesses no dignity and is barely even at the level of trailer trash. This makes Selby's initial fascination with her somewhat unbelievable, but they do say beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Selby is played by Cristina Ricci, and having been brought up in a strictly catholic household she got disowned when a girl accused her of attempting to kiss her. Dispelled into an alien home, she is aching to rebel, but doesn't know how. Cue Aileen who is her polar opposite and a mutual fixation builds up of each other after a chance meeting in a bar. The problem is neither has money or prospects, so fake promises and empty optimism that things will get better are all they have to hold onto, and when Aileen's aggressive nature gets the better of her and she murders a client who tries to rape her, she seems to get a thirst for it - the murder of these scumbag rapists seems justifiable to her. <br/><br/>It goes without saying that Charlize Theron defies belief here - she is 1000% convincing as Aileen, and the makeup is also top notch. If her voice had been in any way altered, you would *not* know it was her. Not only is her acting superb, but her bodily mannerisms are so convincing too - she seems to be a different person entirely.<br/><br/>However, it must be added that Ricci too is outstanding as the naive then foolhardy Selby. Her transformation from submissive to aggressive is completely believable.<br/><br/>In saying all this, the performances can be top notch but if the story ain't that hot then the movie isn't fufilling all that it can. Here, it can't be denied the story is pretty well told. The narrative is kept moving at a good pace, and ultimately we get fairly suckered into the world portrayed.<br/><br/>There are better movies out there but not an awful lot of better performances - this is worth your time for them alone."
"Buddy-51","Null","0","1","5 July 2004"," 3-dimensional portrait of a serial killer
","Despite the harsh judgment implied in the film's title - 'Monster'- Charlize Theron accomplishes the well nigh impossible task of turning a convicted serial killer into a sympathetic figure with whom we can identify and relate. Aileen Wuomos, a hooker in the 1980's, was executed in Florida in 2002 for the premeditated murders of half a dozen or so unsuspecting 'johns' with whom she came in contact. <br/><br/>Writer/director Patty Jenkins sees Aileen more as a victim than as a perpetrator, an individual more sinned against than sinning. We are told, from the outset, that Aileen grew up, like all of us, yearning for the good things in life: stability, love, a bit of fame, fun and fortune if they happened to come her way. Unfortunately, due to an abusive and troubled family life, she ended up selling her body at the tender age of thirteen. When we first encounter her in her 20's, Aileen is a beat up, down-on-her-luck prostitute with barely a penny to her name. Lonely and desperate for companionship, she wanders into a gay bar one night and meets up with a shy young lesbian named Selby who is, herself, just looking for someone to connect with and talk to. Though Aileen claims to be straight, she finds herself drawn to the genuine niceness and warmth emanating from Selby. A tender relationship develops between the two, with Aileen believing she has finally found a person whom she can truly love and who will reciprocate that love. Feeling herself on the road to better things, Aileen even attempts to give up prostitution and get a 'real' job, but the legit world is a far from welcoming place for an untrained, uneducated woman whose social skills leave much to be desired. Desperate to get money to support the two of them, Aileen returns to hooking. When one of her johns rapes her in the woods, Aileen shoots him dead and steals his car. The success of this endeavor leads Aileen to kill a succession of men whom she deems, for the most part, to be morally bankrupt, psychologically abusive scum. It's when Selby discovers what Aileen is up to that the real trouble begins.<br/><br/>Theron won an Oscar for her performance in this film, a complex piece of work that goes far beyond the surface aspects of the much-publicized changed appearance she underwent to approximate the bruised-up look of the actual Aileen. Even without the de-glamorizing makeup job, Theron is in total command of the screen from first moment to last, showing us the multi-faceted nature of this hurting, troubled woman. Christina Ricci, in a much less showy role, is equally impressive as Selby, providing an understated contrast to her far more flamboyant companion. Together, these two fine actresses explore the complexities of both their characters and the relationship between them. In a way, the film is really a love story between two lonely, troubled people who express that love in the only ways they know how. Aileen goes on a murder spree to provide 'her girl' with the comforts and necessities of life, while Selby, though at first disturbed by Aileen's homicidal tendencies, manages to come around to Aileen's way of thinking, knowing full well the grim alternative of a life lived unwanted and unloved. There's an undercurrent of macabre humor flowing through the film as we watch Aileen heading out the door to kill another victim and steal another car every time the girls run a little short on spending money.<br/><br/>The nice thing about 'Monster' is that we can't always sort out our feelings about these two women. They both have characteristics that we simultaneously abhor and admire. Aileen, despite the horrible acts of violence she commits, does appear to have a conscience of sorts, occasionally sparing a potential victim whom she believes doesn't 'deserve' the fate she has mapped out for him. Unlike Hannibal Lecter, Aileen does not murder out of madness, but rather out of practical necessity. This makes her both easier and harder to identify with and understand than the average serial killer. Selby, likewise, is a woman inexperienced in the ways of love who discovers that the person with whom she is trying to forge her first romantic relationship may, indeed, be a bit more than she bargained for. <br/><br/>'Monster,' though it isn't afraid to deal with the complexities of its characters and situations, sometimes feels a bit too one-sided in its presentation, a bit too sanitized and nonjudgmental for its own good. Maybe because Aileen's victims tend to be pretty much ethical scumbags to begin with, it becomes easy for us to detach ourselves from what we are seeing and to overlook the horrendous moral implications of the acts she's committing. Perhaps, Theron is a bit TOO successful at making her character sympathetic, of letting her off the hook a mite too easily. That, in a lot of ways, may be the single most disturbing aspect of the film  that we in the audience don't feel more anger and outrage at the things she's doing. That effect might be the result of either hidden genius or inadequate development on the part of the filmmaker. Who knows, perhaps the title of the film is actually meant to be ironic. I'll leave that up to you to decide."

","Charlize Theron displays a stunning performance in Monster, that has doubtless shocked her fans, more used to her baby doll image in The Devil's Advocate or The Astronaut's Wife. She reveals an exquisite talent as she portrays Aileen Wournos, a prostitute that becomes a serial killer (and though many made this assertion, she is not at all as horrendous as shallowly one might say). Feminists will be pleased - the prostitute falls in love with a young lesbian (a sweet and convincing Christina Ricci) and, furthermore, she reaches the conclusion that she has constantly been raped. But it's more than that - Monster is also a film about love, about loneliness and the need to outcome it. For Aileen, life has always been a fiasco and meeting Selby she has the impression she can still put back the pieces in her life and follow her dream (the American dream, naturally - she even says at one moment that she wanted to become the president of the United States); for Selby, running away with Aileen is a strange Bildungsreise, rather a failure than a success (nonetheless, this is arguable, as it depends on the meaning we give to the terms ""failure"" and ""success""). The reasons that constrain Theron's character to turn into a serial killer are a mixture between the Greek tragedy's Moira and the Macbethian choice of the modern individual. There are moments in life when one is not his/her own master anymore - but who is it then? But the paradox for some may be the fact that among all the crimes and blood and debauchery this film is about love and about the fact that love has nothing to do with our common cleavage of Good and Evil."
"Grifindor","Null","0","1","17 June 2004"," A lazy rendition of a terrifying tale!
","Rather unfortunately for this movie, Nick Broomfield had already brought us the real Aileen Wuornos in his excellent 1992 documentary 'Aileen Wuornos: The Selling of a Serial Killer'. Compounding his excellence and Patty Jenkins' mediocrity, he also released his second documentary on her life (or, should I say, death), 'Aileen: Life and Death of a Serial Killer', in 2003  the year 'Monster' finally reached our screens. With this competition, 'Monster' never really stood much of a chance. Even on this side of the Atlantic, where Aileen is not the celebrity death row inmate she is/was in America and the story should be fresher, it is told by Jenkins in such a hackneyed, clichéd way as to distract the viewer from the true tragedies of her life. It focuses on all the wrong things at all the wrong times, drawing attention with witless abandon away from the main downfall of Aileen's life  her own mind. She is trapped and terrified to such a degree within her own head that it is beyond the capabilities of such a mediocre film maker to comprehend her, let alone display any coherence on screen. <br/><br/>Jenkins' opening sequence is, without mincing words, awful. Flashback and voice-over makes for lazy film-making at it's worst, and dispels any illusions or hope as to who is at the helm. To quote a much better screenwriter, Charlie Kaufman, and his interpretation of virtuoso Robert McKee's view on this 'if you use voice-over in your work. that's flaccid, sloppy writing. Any idiot can write a voice-over narration to explain the thoughts of a character'. Not that Patty Jenkins is all bad  she does give an almost valid woman's perspective on things, but goes overboard with this feeling and almost drowns in salivation at the thought of making Aileen Wuornos a feminist icon through her movie. She does not, and Aileen is not. Where Broomfield succeeded, and where Jenkins failed, is in the depiction of this woman as a pitiable victim. There is no need to go into logistics  what she did was terrible, and punishable  there is no denying that  but the awful incompetence of the United States Judicial System, along with it's Social Welfare net, allowed Aileen to become the woman she was. I won't dwell long on her story, as it's been told a hundred times (exploited by the people she trusted, for monetary gain), but merely wish to point out that Broomfield tells the story as it is, whereas Jenkins tells the story as she thinks it might be. She reduces Aileen's horrific childhood to a few short shots and a voice-over, and makes the rest of the tale into a bastardised 'Bonnie & Clyde' for the alternative lifestyle. Aileen, as we glean from Broomfield's annals, was in love with Selby, her lesbian partner, and Selby seemed to have, at the very least, high regard for Aileen. However, Jenkins' movie celebrates the lesbianism to a degree that this almost becomes a love story  leading the viewer to believe that it all would have turned out OK were it not for those gosh-darned johns laying dead under an overpass. <br/><br/>The truth is, Aileen was manipulated by everyone who knew her, and Selby is not exempt. The implausibility of Christina Ricci, though vaguely attempting 'dyke'-stereotype tom-boyishness, falling in love with the heavy, uncouth and vaguely disgusting hi-way hooker that Charlize Theron (with greedy aplomb) embodies is the most visually arresting of the movies characterisation mistakes. Charlize gives a good performance, and is strikingly similar to Aileen throughout, but she is let down on all sides by B-movie flashes of acting (the usually great Ricci falling flat on her face at every step). She even attempts to bring across to the audience the real tragedy of the events of this woman's life  that all the deaths could have been prevented had Social Welfare stepped in at an early age. She also manages to instill in Aileen shades of the very thing that makes the woman so arresting in documentaries  her obvious mental handicaps. As Nick Broomfield says  'We have to ask ourselves why the American Government sees fit to execute a mentally deficient woman'. But this is a question Jenkins either dares not ask, for fear of box office repercussions, or it is something she does not have the maturity or capacity as a filmmaker to push.<br/><br/>Theron is the only strong point in a mediocre movie with a badly written story; but even her acting skills cannot pull this film from the video-hell to which it will rightly be cast. The growth of character and narrative is stunted throughout by Jenkins' continuous attempts at independent film-making techniques  the 'road more traveled' that she seems to think she is the first to set out upon  and Theron isn't given a chance to shine in any real sense. Kudos to the make-up department, but we always knew Theron was much more than a pretty face, and she almost proves it here. Aileen Wuornos' life deserves much more than this, and though viewable for curiosity, Broomfield by far encapsulates the tale to a much greater effect  'Monster' cannot hope to come close to giving us a pure view. Aileen's story is a sad one, and a terrifying one for our own society and capitalist culture (not withstanding the alternative blinkered views of the American system, plus it's gung-ho, shoot-'em-all-up attitude to executions), and one that gives a stern caution. If we do not stand up for the weak in our society, then their fate becomes ours  a point severely lost in this pitiful attempt at serious film-making. 2/5"

"allan_the_poet","Null","0","1","2 June 2004"," No. No. No....Not more ludicrous liberal propaganda!
","First off, as far as Miss Theron's performance in this film goes, there is no argument. Charlize is simply incredible and although I thought Naomi Watts deserved the Oscar, I can live with the Academy's decision. But awards aside, let's consider the film. The film is a docudrama about the life of Aileen Wuornos, a hitchhiking prostitute who became an infamous highway serial killer. The film was produced by Theron because she wanted no studio interference with the project. Her bravado in this regard is admirable, as is her courage in selecting such a daring part so early in her career. Her honest attempt at portraying Aileen is without question a thing of beauty to behold. What is NOT beautiful, is the message the film attempts to try to get across. Contrary, to Roger Ebert's opinion (incidentally Ebert remains one of my favorite film critics) the film attempts to persuade the viewer that Miss Wuornos was an unloved, desperate, confused and mistreated street hooker who was pushed into her horrid actions by an alienated, uncaring society. Certainly, IF Charlize Theron's Aileen and the real life Aileen are the same person, then yes, I would agree with this. However, having done a good deal of research on the REAL Aileen Wuornos, I realized that the film leaves out important details to manipulate its audience. <br/><br/>Rookie director Patty Jenkins chose to emphasize Aileen's wild and wacky relationship with her lesbian lover, incorrectly called Shelby in the film and portrayed by Christina Ricci. Aileen's real lover's name was Tyria Moore. She was freckled-faced and red headed. The writers have obviously made deliberate changes to avoid a lawsuit since she's still alive! But back to the missed details of the film. The film leaves out the fact that Wuornos often beat her ex-husband with his cane when he wouldn't give her money. It leaves out the fact that she propelled a billiards ball into a bartender's temple when she was in one of her angry moods. It leaves out the fact that she once held up a convenience store at gunpoint while dressed in a bikini. Those are some of the facts the film leaves out. But let's consider what the film covers about Wuornos. The main problem is the overemphasis on Aileen's lesbian lover. The love scenes are long and sometimes unnecessary. <br/><br/>Also, Jenkins shows us only three of the six (possibly seven murders) committed by Wuornos. In two of the three murders, Aileen is shown as defending herself. Actually, she herself claimed that she was only raped and sodomized by Richard Malloy, her first victim. She admitted to cold-bloodedly killing the six others. (Of course she changed her stories between self-defense and murder many times throughout her arrest, trial and incarceration). The biggest flaw of the film is its failure to show any flashbacks about Wuorno's traumatic childhood which was complicated, intriguing and sad. Overall, Ricci and Theron were outstanding performers in the piece and Jenkins certainly is a promising newcomer, but the suggestion of the film that Wuornos was a victim of circumstance is unacceptable. The families of the victims were horrified by this film and if you know a few basic facts about the real Aileen Wuornos, you will be too."

","`Monster' is a film filled to the brim with great performances, but is handicapped by it's slow motion and lackluster cinematography.

There were moments of insight and clarity, but it was too far between them.<br/><br/>Although I cannot expect every film to blow me to the back of my seat with every shot, I was expecting something more considering the fact that the entirety of the subject matter could fill volumes about Eileen's life.<br/><br/>Instead, she was a plain old hooker with a gun. Maybe that's how she really was, but it wasn't quite enough.<br/><br/>Theron's OSCAR notwithstanding, there's really no meat to this film. Surely, she deserved the award; however, I find it sad that she had to win it for this particular piece of cinema.<br/><br/>Really, I can't say that this is a bad film; only that it is not a great film, which is bad enough considering the talent arrayed.<br/><br/>I can only give this a `5' out of `10,' making this just average.  `Monster' is indeed a film filled with great roles, but the wrapping wasn't enough for it."

","Dark true story about prostitute Aileen (Charlize Theron), who in hope for a better life starts going out with young girl Selby (Christina Ricci) and killing/robbing her clients. While we first feel for her (her first 'victim' would have killed her if he had the chance), in the end she loses control completely. The scene where she shoots a guy that is really trying to help her is so hard to take... one of the most powerful and disturbing scenes I've seen in a while.<br/><br/>Powerful probably *is* where the movie's aiming at and it gets the job done. The movie is dark and gives you an idea of how things work at the bottom of society... not a pretty sight for sure. Sometimes it's hard to understand the decisions the characters make, but most of the time you keep on feeling for the Aileen character, how monstrous she might act at times.<br/><br/>One last thing: it seems 'Monster' is all about Charlize Theron, getting ugly and winning an Academy Award for it. But the true star is the amazing Christina Ricci, who is playing the Selby character so well, *she* should have won something for it, but didn't. Let's hope we keep on hearing from her.<br/><br/>Final score: 7/10."

","I have to say that I know nothing of the real life details of the Aileen Wuornos case (which inspired this film) so I'm just going to deal with the film itself and not talk about how accurate or not it is.<br/><br/>The film tells the story of Aileen Wuornos (played by Charlize Theron) and her girlfriend, Selby Wall (Christina Ricci).  Wuornos comes from a hideous background of violence and abuse and now works as a prostitute.  After she kills a client who tries to rape her, Wuornos goes on the run with Selby, killing and robbing to support themselves.<br/><br/>The film is shot in a gritty style, mostly on location.  It's not really a conventional serial killer thriller.  The police investigation is only barely touched upon.  The viewer is with Wuornos and Selby for the whole time.<br/><br/>Charlize Theron is totally unrecognizable under heavy make-up as Wuornos. She turns in a truly superb performance and thoroughly merited her Oscar for her performance in this film.  Christina Ricci is also excellent as the sweet but bratty Selby.  <br/><br/>While the viewer doesn't come to like Wuornos, in the film, it's hard not to feel some sympathy for her, as much as we may hate her crimes. <br/><br/>
The main flaw of the film is the focus is always on Wuornos and Selby.  A bit more balance would have been good, particularly towards the victims.<br/><br/>Worth watching though.  ""Friday the 13th"" fans may like to look out for a brief appearance by Kane Hodder (who played Jason, in a number of those films)."
"camsean","8","0","1","27 March 2004"," Great movie, great acting.
","The story of Aileen Wournes is an horrific one. Brutilised and abused from the time she was born she never really had a chance -  Beaten by her father by reporting sexual abuse at the hands of a family friend. A prostitute from age 13. This doese not excuse the murders she committed (Except,possibly, the first one which was clearly self defense). What is does do is inspire compassion for her and the disasters of life choices she made, or were really made for by a sexist and classist society. The film is a also very clear about the enormous problems of American society. The lack of a genuine social welfare system helped to create her and the situation whereby she felt sex work and robbery were her only choices. A brilliant movie."

","Despite many comments that Theron's performance is great but that there is no story, I disagree heartily. If you are looking for a cops and robbers detective story ending in a trial type of film, then skip this one. Instead, it shows the deterioration of a character in front of your eyes, going from someone starry-eyed and desperately seeking love to trying to live a ""normal"" life without any clue to being a victim  and ending up completely out of touch with reality. Theron plays the perfect tragic character in that Wuornos is fated to be doomed. It may not be true to the historical version (the trial, Wuornos in the limelight), but it is a great character study and one of the most amazing performances I have ever seen on film. It is not uplifting though and may be a real downer for you."

","Patty Jenkins accomplishes the impossible with this film. She has transformed an otherwise gorgeous woman, Charlize Theron, into the monster that was Aileen Wuornos. <br/><br/>What turns a common person into a monster? In the case of Ms Wuornos, we get to know that she was formed by the environment where she comes from. She is the victim of abuse, growing up in a household where she is a burden. She becomes an outcast whose only alternative is to turn into prostitution, since that's the only thing she can do with no other skills to herself.<br/><br/>Supposedly this tragic figure was not gay. At the beginning of the story she walks into a bar that caters to gays, unknown to her. Selby is at the bar and feels an attraction for the rough Aileen, someone completely opposite of her. <br/><br/>Ms. Theron's transformation is incredible. It's probably the role of her career; nothing from now on will compare to this character at all. Christina Ricci's work as Selby is not as flashy, but she holds her own, as she is an accomplished actress who has probably more experience than her co-star. Since the role of Selby pales against the work of Charlize Theron, she was bypassed for a look at the best featured actress.<br/><br/>The other surprise was Bruce Dern, who has nothing to do in the film, but has a key scene in the film.<br/><br/>Ms. Jenkins has worked wonders with this film based in a true story. She has a great future ahead of her."

Yet she was able to immerse herself into the character, both physically (gained 30lbs. for the part) and mentally in an exact portrayal of a woman in Southern United States.

"canadude","10","0","1","7 March 2004"," transformation
","I won't beat around the bush. Charlize Theron's performance in Monster is not just Oscar-worthy. It's the performance of a career and without it the movie would not have worked. Now, I don't mean to imply that the direction, or story in this film are not good - no, they are phenomenal. Still, Theron's transformation from South African model to serial killer/hooker is the uniting factor, the glue that holds it all together. The brilliance of it is transparent in every moment of the film and it must have been exhausting for Theron to disappear as completely as she did into Aileen Wuornos. Her transformation is unbelievable (in a good way): she communicates the almost entirely intangible and inexpressible need to be loved that allows us to understand Aileen's story. She does so with grace, profound subtlety, and impact that never feels overdone or trite. And on the believability of this great performance is hinged the story, that is, despite all accusations, not apologetic, feminist or damning.<br/><br/>
Even though I know little about the actual Aileen, what strikes me about Monster is its honesty. I don't know if it's portrayal is 100% accurate on a factual level, but it is on the level where the absurdity of our existence reveals itself. It is a very sad, grim movie, as is the world it depicts. In a sense, Monster is a story about a terrifying realization of a woman not only at the bottom of what we vaguely call ""the social ladder,"" but also at the bottom of what is accepted and tolerated - and she realizes that she will not survive by climbing to the top. Such a climb is impossible for her - there is a great scene between Charlize Theron and Christina Ricci where Theron's character attempts to explain to Ricci why she does what she does, namely, why she kills. She tries to make Ricci's character understand that the world is not as perfect as it is said to be and that not everyone has the same chances, and that not everyone is equal.<br/><br/>In that scene alone, the character raises some profound questions about the nature of morality, its inevitable subjectivity, and therefore, terrifyingly so, its questionable worth. Monster does not stray from this theme and try to claim that Aileen had the right answers or did the right things. It shows her relationship with Selby, her actions, and their consequences. But, in the process of doing so, it asks a lot of important and pertinent questions that are very hard to answer."

","Saw it, didn't like it. <br/><br/>Monster (IMO), pushed for a correlation between the woman's heinous crime and a telemovie-like blend of freak circumstances and a person's abused past. I place the blame solely on Patty Jenkins. <br/><br/>Despite my not liking it, some of the elements in this flick (most glaringly the performances) are strong enough to over ride my intellectual disagreement. From the saddening emotional neediness of co-dependent relationships to the depths of love which transcends educational background, social status and yes, even the level of intelligence between the affected parties. There are hence many things going for Monsters. But I just cannot accept it as a great film for the reasons already stated.<br/><br/>
Of course, don't take my word for it. Go see it, if only to gawk at the jiggly layer of lard on Charlize's body."

"ragarf","10","0","1","1 March 2004"," A real great movie!
","Without a doubt, this is one of the best movies that I have seen in a long time. Charlize Theron gives one of the most compelling and emotional performances in movie history. I would compare it to Maggie Smith's powerful performance in ""The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie"" (1969) for complete acting by a leading lady. I had to talk my wife into seeing this movie. After viewing it, she has found it difficult to believe that the charactor on the screen is in real live such a beautiful woman. Charlize makes Aileen Wuornos look and feel so real that she forces you, the audience, to understand what drove this woman to kill 7 johns.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Bruce Dern once again plays a screwed-up Viet Nam War Veteran (""Coming Home""). To me, he was too recognizable as an actor, which made it hard for him to be beliveable in this role. They should have used an lesser-known actor to play that part.<br/><br/>Christina Ricci, without ""Addams Family"" makeup was able to look like a fresh face and not a known actor. She gives a good, strong performance and should have received more recognition than she got.<br/><br/>I would highly recommend this movie to anyone with a strong enough stomach to watch the horrible treatment she goes through, but then again every parent with a troubled daughter should see it and imagine what can happen to their daughter if they are lousy parents. Bottom line, that is what put the real Aileen into the depressing life she lived. She deserved better."

","I loved Monster and thought Charlize Theron's performance was the best I'd seen in a film this year. But I wanted to comment on something. Much has been made of Theron's makeover from gorgeous glamour girl to wasted alkie white trash prostitute. True, she and the filmmakers did take a bold chance in transforming her. But they sacrificed a lot of ""realism"" in the casting of sexy Christina Ricci as the young lesbian love interest. I've seen photos of the real ""Selby"" and she resembles the gigantic, one-toothed, pinhearded character Sloth from The Goonies much more than she does the delectable Ricci. Of course seeing a dressed-down Theron and a big ugly goon making out would not be as a big box office draw as Theron and Ricci as lovers.<br/><br/>But it would have made for a much more ""real"" film."

","I thought this was a phenomenal, very moving, very powerful movie! Definitely not for the easily disturbed. Perhaps also uneasy to watch for those (especially women) who are overly sensitive to material dealing with sexual abuse. I was very impressed with Charlize Theron's portrayal of Aileen Wuornos. I had never seen such extraordinary work from Theron, and frankly, had no idea she was capable of it. Although certainly fabricated from the true relationship, I totally bought into Theron and Ricci's relationship and really felt for the characters. After seeing this movie I went into depth researching the real Aileen Wuornos. Though I am not convinced with the accuracy of the movie (though it's important to note that I'd question the accuracy of any movie based on a real life event), I am convinced that this is one of the better films I've seen in quite some time! However, I can totally see where many may disagree with me on this. Because the movie touches such sensitive themes, I feel the movie is really a hit-or-miss. You'll either love it or hate it or be indifferent to it, but I doubt there will be many who just simply ""liked"" or ""disliked"" it. My personal consensus: ""GREAT MOVIE!"""

"johnnysugar","6","0","2","19 January 2004"," An uneven melodrama saved by the hands of Charlize Theron
","A powerful performance by Charlize Theron.  I never in my life though I would ever say those words.  Dancer/model Theron always struck as me as pretty first, actress second.  It didn't help that she was normally cast in dreadfully mediocre films as a woman in peril: ""The Astronaut's Wife"", ""Sweet November"", and so on.  Her work in ""The Italian Job"" hinted at more ability than she led many to believe, but it's her role in ""Monster"" that reveals to the world that without a doubt, Theron is a power to be reckoned with.<br/><br/>Based on the the life of Aileen Wornos, the film begins in the 1980's, when Wornos (Charlize Theron) was a hitch-hiking prostitute.  As the film opens, she's about to kill herself after spending her last money on beer. Unwittingly walking into a gay bar, she meets young, naive Selby (Christina Ricci), who's been sent to live with her aunt in Florida in an effort to cleanse her of her homosexuality.  Aileen, who's never been in a relationship with a woman before, warms up to her.  As their relationship progresses, the two being to believe they're in love, and Aileen resolves to clean her life up and find legitimate work to support them.  After a humiliating series of job interviews, she returns to prostitution.  When one of her johns tries to rape her, Aileen kills him.  This begins a new chapter in her life with Selby, where Selby doesn't ask where Aileen gets her money, and Aileen is filled with a twisted sense of empowerment, killing any john she can in the belief that all of her customers are potential rapists. She went on to become the United States' first female serial killer, and she shot several men before being arrested.<br/><br/>But the story of Wornos and Selby is immaterial, really.  The main attraction to this movie is Theron's performance.  Theron also served as producer on the film, and she studied footage and documents on Wornos extensively (the real Wornos was executed in 2002).  Theron disappears so fully into Wornos that even when you look in her eyes, there's no trace of the actress there.  Much has been made of Theron's physical transformation, and it bears repeating.  Theron's Wornos is someone with a soul so broken that it can't help but physically manifest itself.  Model-beautiful Theron has done much to reflect this, including adding a highly unflattering 30 pounds, allowing her hair to become stringy and greasy, and gaining a hard, leathery skin tone.  Add to this an uncanny duplication of Wornos' speech and mannerisms, and Theron's transformation becomes downright chilling in its accuracy.<br/><br/>This is both the film's greatest asset and its biggest weakness.  Theron's performance is so amazing, it makes the other actors around her seem unprepared.  Christina Ricci tries her best with the innocent, gullible Selby, but she's too kewpie-doll cute and innocent to make you believe she'd ever spend her life with someone as scarred as Wornos.  At the same time, Theron unwittingly spotlights the wavering, uneven tone of writer/director Patty Jenkins' overall film.  Theron is amazing, but Jenkins never knows quite what to do with her.  Jenkins alternates, sometimes within the same scene, between making us feel sympathy for the damaged Wornos (a victim of childhood abuse, teenage pregnancy, and a prostitute since the age of 13) and making us feel repulsed by the levels of cruelty and abuse she herself can descend to.  Jenkins wants to have it both ways, but she never displays enough evidence to leave the decision up to the audience.  Additionally, the scenes exist out of a clear sense of progression.  We're never sure how much time has passed between scenes, and no attempt is ever made to put the movie into a historical context aside from a few song references and hairstyles. This makes the film seem like it's taking place in a different world altogether as opposed to being set in the real one, starring a cast of people based on real humans.<br/><br/>Without the unbridled power and ferocity behind Theron's performance, ""Monster"" would be a highly forgettable, well-intentioned biopic that suffered from a lack of vision.  It's Theron that holds the film together, that serves as its cold heart and its anchor.  Besides being one of the best female performances in a while, it's a revelation of Theron's dedication and ability.  A high recommendation for fans of strong female performances, but for a more coherent story about Wornos, I recommend you check out one of Nick Broomfield's documentaries.  6 out of 10."
