","Who said that they don't make films like they used to? A couple of weeks ago, I declared that ""The Departed"" was the best film of 2006. Last week, I replaced the Scorsese epic with Sofia Coppola's luscious biopic of ""Marie Antoinette"". I never would have guessed that Paul Verhoeven (Yes, the Paul Verhoeven who directed ""Total Recall"", ""Basic Instinct"" & ""Showgirls""!!!) would challenge them both with a gripping, edge-of-your-seat World War II yarn.<br/><br/>I use the old-fashioned term, yarn, because ""Black Book"" is very much a film that feels like it was made decades ago. The lush visuals, orchestral music, European styling, wartime romanticism and cliffhanging chapters all add a certain 1950's charm to the white-knuckle plot. One gets the feeling that the ghosts of Gregory Peck, Hedy Lamarr, Ava Gardner, Spencer Tracy & Jean Harlow are embodying the cast of this classic espionage drama.<br/><br/>The film begins in 1956 with Rachel Steinn, a school teacher at an Israeli kibbutz, being accidentally found by an old acquaintance, who is on vacation with her husband. The meeting brings back painful wartime memories and Rachel heads to a quiet place by the river to recollect our central story.<br/><br/>So back we travel, to occupied Holland, circa 1944, and we see a more youthful Rachel, diligently practicing a bible passage in order to earn a meal from the family who is hiding her from the Germans. She, like many Jews at that time, were surviving by any means necessary in order to outlast the Nazi tyranny. However, one day, while flirting with a young man sailing on the nearby lake, her safe zone is destroyed in one fell swoop by a low flying bomber. Rachel is immediately on the run, aided by her new sailor friend.<br/><br/>So much of this film relies on surprises and shocking twists that it would be unfair of me to detail too many plot threads. And my goodness, there are a tons of them. This is truly a definitive epic, in every cinematic sense of the word. Rachel is crossed and doubled-crossed and triple-crossed, eventually winding up as a member of the famed Resistance. Via cunning and fortunate circumstance, she manages to transform herself into Ellis de Vries, a blond bombshell who infiltrates the German command in the area. She uses a quick wit, a gorgeous voice, some feminine charms and a collection of Queen Wilhelmina stamps to crawl her way into the arms of Herr Müntze (Sebastian Koch).<br/><br/>From deep within the Nazi camp, she is able to strategically plant a microphone and to use tidbits of acquired knowledge in order to provide the Resistance with vital information and plans. While evolving into a brave spy, she must learn how to reconcile her own personal vendettas and her surprising romantic feelings for Müntze.<br/><br/>There are no more exciting themes for me in movies than tragic romance, espionage and escape. I have loved them all with a passion ever since I was a small child. Throw in a magnificent screenplay, marvelous cinematography, a plot that churns along with the efficiency of a Swiss watch, and the added bonus of a gorgeous actress -- the result is sure to be a huge winner for me. ""Black Book"" satisfies everything that I truly want from a film. It is the reason I go to the movies. I was utterly swept away by the intrigue, drama, romance and tragedy. This emotionally weighty film even manages to deliver a few wonderfully witty moments to break the supreme tension of it all.<br/><br/>The cast is immense. Every one of them exudes authenticity. It is one of the best ensembles of the year. However, I struggle to call it an ensemble because it would be ignoring one of the singular performances in recent memory. Carice Van Houten is not a household name to most. She is a Dutch beauty who, if this role is anything to go by, is on the verge of a magnificent career. Her grasp on the emotional turmoil of Rachel/Ellis is of profound proportions. It is a stunning turn that flatly demands award consideration. The range on display in this movie is astonishing. Rarely have I ever been as moved by a character's heroism and charm and guile and wits. She is able to create a sympathetic creature... one that we will root for until the end... one that we trust and believe in.<br/><br/>I cannot leave this review without admitting to my utter admiration for Paul Verhoeven, a director whose films I have often enjoyed and panned in equal measures. This is the work of his lifetime. It is the film he should list above all others on his résumé. This is a thoughtful, poignant and tremendously thrilling adventure. For attentive viewers, the final scenes of the film act as a provocative meditation on the relationships between war and justice, peace and insularity, the actions of the past and the promises of the future. ""Black Book (Zwartboek)"" is not only a riveting WWII adventure, but a superb contrast of morality -vs- reality.<br/><br/>TC Candler IndependentCritics.com"
"larry-411","9","276","325","25 September 2006"," Hold on for an epic thrill ride
","I attended the North American premiere of ""Black Book"" at the Toronto International Film Festival. Although my main interest lies in independent film, and I did see many indies as well as foreign films and documentaries in Toronto, I also saw a few of the ""Gala"" selections. Of those ""big movies"" on my list, the one which impressed me the most was this Dutch production from Paul Verhoeven. Set in Nazi-occupied Holland during World War II, the film centers around a young Jewish woman named Rachel, who changes her name (and hair, and personality, and more) to Ellis and enters an odyssey of determination and sheer luck in an effort to survive what would otherwise be certain death.<br/><br/>Make no mistake about it: this is an epic in the true sense of the word. The visuals are stunning. Everything about the production from the sound to the effects to the score says ""big budget."" The story is chock full of more twists and turns than just about any film I've seen in this genre. And just when you think that, perhaps, Verhoeven is beginning to stretch the bounds of credulity, you realize (at the end credits, if not before) that ""Black Book"" is based on fact.<br/><br/>Most of all, the film's power is due to the magnificent acting of Carice van Houten. Her Rachel/Ellis is a character so unique, so original, that it holds up against the great heroines of contemporary cinema. Combine her marvelous performance with a wonderful story and superb production values and you end up with a thrill ride from start to finish. ""Black Book"" left me breathless."
"adriaan-dekkers056","8","215","268","15 September 2006"," Excellent WWII thriller
","Saw it at Toronto Int. Film Festival with Paul Verhoeven and Carice van Houten on stage. This movie has Verhoeven's trademark stamp all over it. It's evident this film was a more personal project for him. Non stop action and good acting, especially from the lead actress, Carice van Houten. I've seen other films (American and French) about Resistance fighters during WWII, but non of them gripped me by the throat like this one. I admit Verhoeven is at times a bit heavy-handed, especially the sound effects of German machine guns, but the story never sags. It's a ""By the seat of your pants"" type of movie. After you leave the theater, the impact of the story stays with you for days. Go and see it when it comes to your local cinema in North America. I highly recommend it."
"mariekehopman","9","102","130","30 October 2006"," Why there's no exact line between good or bad...
","When I read all the comments about Zwartboek, it becomes clear to me that either you like the movie or you kind of hate it. What is that with good and bad that we want to make an exact line... This whole movie is about not knowing if you can do bad things (kill, betray or whatever) to achieve the good. Or the other way around off course. I must admit that the movie is (again) explicit, but aren't all the Dutch movies? What strikes me most is that some people expect to get a movie in which everything is clear. I think this is a movie which should set us to thinking: what would I do if I were in the same situation. Paul Verhoeven made clear with this movie that in the end, lots of people act for their own prosperity. It's just what you make people around you believe... I think in lots of countries people acted like this, none of the countries however dared to make a movie out of it. To me this movie is again (as Soldaat van Oranje and for instance De Tweeling)a beautiful one about WWII without getting boring. A smart story with two faces. Although some of the actors don't really fit into a masterpiece like this, I give it a great compliment. Get over the explicit name calling (ever seen Pulp Fiction??) and appreciate the scenery and nice camera-work, the great plot change and you'll have a great time and may even reconsider your own ideas about the resistance!"
"Chris_Docker","8","33","40","30 January 2007"," Verhoeven on top form
","Director Paul Verhoeven's self-confessed aim is to combine art and business, appeal to a broad audience, and yet still have some endurance. The fame of films like Basic Instinct and Total Recall is lasting, yet they court criticism with their use of sexuality or by playing to the (easily dismissible) sci-fi genre. Graphic sex and violence are common in his movies and, when you add the occasional major flop such as Showgirls, the work of Verhoeven often fails to be taken seriously. Yet Black Book deserves respect. It is a wartime resistance movie on an epic scale, freed of the conventions of British and American war movies, yet bringing their typically high production values to a uniquely Dutch film.<br/><br/>Israel 1956. A Holy Land Tours bus stops off at a Kibbutz. One of the passengers recognises a teacher there, Rachel, from times they had shared during the war. As her friend leaves, Rachel thinks back to Holland in 1944. She was an accomplished cabaret singer but also Jewish. She was in hiding, waiting for the war to end. But chance misfortune means she has to try to make a getaway with some other Jewish people. They are ambushed, and she is almost shot. A little later she starts working for the resistance ('terrorists' as the Nazis call them) and infiltrates the Gestapo, seducing a high ranking officer called Muntze.<br/><br/>What follows is a frantic game of cat and mouse, espionage and counter-espionage. Rachel (now called Ellis) is torn between the horrors inflicted on her friends close-by and the elaborate deceits she tries to play to save them. Gradually it becomes clear that Muntze, anticipating the end of the war, is risking his neck to try to minimize death and suffering on both sides, and one or more of the resistance fighters is selling out to the Nazis to reap rich profits. Muntze, like Rachel, has had to overcome great losses. Their humanity is a bridge that brings them closer.<br/><br/>Rachel/Ellis is played by Carice van Houten, a leading actress of the Dutch screen. Her presence is luminous and charismatic (for British/American audiences, there is the curious sensation of watching someone unknown who radiates star quality with every breath). Her character has to adapt to many contrasting situations yet there is an underlying determination and fast thinking that shines through and makes such changes seem in character and unscripted. We share her emotional struggle and watch her pit her wits against the Gestapo (who are not exactly stupid). The movie is worth seeing for her performance alone.<br/><br/>On the one hand, the film has been minutely researched, based on actual events and characters; on the other it still has the slightly larger than life gloss we might associate, say, with a James Bond film. The escapes are in the nick of time, the sex scenes are steamy, and the plot twists increase exponentially as we get closer to the end.<br/><br/>Not content to portray the unique conditions of Holland during the occupation, Black Book goes on to catalogue post war atrocities and Rachel's eventual journey to Israel. The style and delivery will not appeal to everyone, but Black Book is Verhoeven on top form, delivering grand entertainment that shows his talents (and those of the remarkable Carice van Houten) at their finest."
"jeff-1875","9","33","41","8 April 2007"," Unexpectedly Good Film
","I seem to be the first in the US to comment on this film after having seen it at a regular theater.<br/><br/>There's no sense in talking about the movie's plot as so many others have already done so.<br/><br/>My fiancée is German and tends to be interested in those artsy foreign films. Tonight she decided we should go see this one. I'm glad we did.<br/><br/>I've seen a number of Paul Verhoeven's films and have found some of them quite entertaining, if a bit tacky and unrealistic. I wasn't expecting much from a Dutch film by a guy known for making big budget, tacky films.<br/><br/>I was pleasantly surprised by this film.<br/><br/>Yes, it most certainly IS a Paul Verhoeven film. Gratuitous nudity and violence seem to be his hallmarks and they're certainly not lacking. Do they detract from the movie? A little, but not enough to lose sight of the message of the film - or to make it any less enjoyable.<br/><br/>We had recently seen ""The Lives of Others"" which starred Sebastian Koch. It made his character oddly familiar. I'm certainly a fan of his after seeing his performance in both of these movies.<br/><br/>As for Carice van Houten... well, one of the marks of a true STAR is that you just can't take your eyes off of him or her. It isn't just beauty; there are plenty of beautiful women in the world who don't possess that same star quality. It isn't just talent, either; there are many very talented actresses out there who just don't draw you in in the same way. Carice van Houten has it all: she's beautiful in a very real way and an amazing talent - and has that something special that makes you look at her every second she's on screen. I hope the directors of the world take note of her because she deserves the stardom she has exhibited in this film.<br/><br/>It is good to see a film that depicts how the hunted can easily turn into the hunter. My fiancée's mother was a young girl during WWII who's family lived in Poland (near Gdansk aka Danzig). Towards the end of the war, they were forced to leave their home in fear for their lives - both from the advancing Russians and the local Poles exacting revenge for what other Germans had done. The film said it in a slightly different sentence, but it is right in bringing across the message that people seem to never learn: that it is NEVER right to hurt others no matter what they might have done in the past.<br/><br/>I wonder if Paul Verhoeven's family is Jewish because he really seems to identify with the never ending succession of attacks against the Jewish people. It saddens me that only ONE other review even mentioned the scene at the end where Rachel's community (in Israel) was being attacked. Part of the film's message is that we seemed doomed to repeat our inhumanity to our fellow man.<br/><br/>Was this a perfect movie? Certainly not. Is it a masterpiece ala ""Schindler's List"" or ""Full Metal Jacket"" or ""Saving Private Ryan?"" Probably not. But I'll say that in the several hours since I've seen it, I can't stop thinking about it. And I certainly enjoyed every minute of that 2-1/2 hour film while watching it. I'd watch it again if I had it on DVD."
"laurentboutonnat","10","190","266","16 September 2006"," A real masterpiece by Paul Verhoeven.
","This is definitely one of the best films ever made in Holland. Paul Verhoeven has created a real masterpiece. In my opinion, even if you dislike WW2 movies, you really should see Zwartboek, this movie is about so much more than just the war.<br/><br/>A very philosofical sentence in the movie is 'Does is never ends?'. Men could say it illustrates the writer's longing for worldwide peace, also regarding the end of the movie which illustrates the Middle East conflict.<br/><br/>Carice van Houten and Sebastian Koch are simply great in this movie. Without them Paul Verhoeven couldn't have done this with such a magnitude. I'm sure that we will hear more from this two actors in the future, maybe in a Hollywood production? They really deserve it."
"raven22-2","8","115","158","14 September 2006"," The best dutch production in 20-30 years
","I have been eagerly waiting to see 'Zwartboek' the past months. Finally it premiered in Holland today and i immediately rushed to cinema to be one of the first to see it. Beforehand i didn't watch any trailer nor read any review so i went in completely not knowing what to expect.<br/><br/>The movie starts a bit messy. Not knowing what it wants and where it wants to go. But as soon as things are set the roller-coaster ride begins. Carice and Sebastian are simply outstanding. Together they really carry the movie. The story however is predictable at times, but the awesome production quality (for dutch standards) and fast paced action really make up for it.<br/><br/>The overall message (which i will not give away) is something to think about. See the movie and judge for yourself.<br/><br/>I have heard this will be sent in for the Oscars. As much as i would want Paul to win i don't think it will happen. There will be other movies with a story less predictable and more surprising. However, my heart would want him to win this and walk out with a big figurative finger pointed at all them critics.<br/><br/>Zwartboek is in my opinion the best dutch production in 20-30 years, maybe even the best dutch movie since Soldier of Orange. It doesn't disappoint, it doesn't bore and it will give you a ride which you won't forget. It is also the breakthrough of Carice van Houten. Rave reviews from Venice compare her to Scarlett Johansson, but even better. Future will tell...<br/><br/>For now, go see this! And for Paul: please stay in Holland and make dutch cinema proud again."
"mm-versteegh","9","110","151","14 September 2006"," Impressive and heuristic
","It took me about an hour after having seen the film to find any enthusiasm to write this review. The film Black Book, or Zwartboek in Dutch, is very impressive, with an excellent feeling for the complexity of inter-human relationships.<br/><br/>The story is about a Jewish girl that finds herself in a powerless situation in a war that tends to bring out the worst in all, 'good' or 'bad'. So much for what we know without seeing the film for ourselves. The film starts out rather typical, informing us with what we already new about the war: people where poor, hungry and trying to survive. However, the second part of the film shows a less well known part of Dutch resistance history: that the war brings out the worst in everybody. Without losing sight of the importance of the resistance against the foreign repression, Paul Verhoeven confuses his audience by visualizing how ones own well-being seems to go at the cost of the well-being of another. No black and white, no bad or good, but only the individual choice, that is tormented by the will to survive and a feeling for morality.<br/><br/>The film is daring for showing the dark side of the Dutch national history. However, the most valuable of the film is that it captivates its audience and sensitizes its audience for the misery of the historical event of World War II, but also the contemporary difficulties that affects human beings rather than countries. A must see, even though it makes you feel miserable."
"sbonator","9","112","159","17 September 2006"," A fresh look about WWII
","I must admit that I don't like to watch dutch movies that much. Most of the time the acting is pretty bad and if they use some kind of cgi in the movies its one from the 1980's.<br/><br/>This movie really surprised me. Quite good acting from most of the actors. And the general view of the Alliance is good and the Germans are bad isn't presented. The movie shows both sides, the good the bad (and the ugly) behaviors of the people during the war.<br/><br/>Although he didn't have a very big budget to make this movie (between 16-20 million dollars) which is nothing for Hollywood matters, he'd made quite a good movie from it.<br/><br/>If you want to watch a movie about WWII that isn't like most of the movies made about this war, go and watch this one. You wont be bored for the next 2,5 hours."
"myosotis75","10","24","31","3 December 2006"," a must see !
","I just saw the movie and I loved it, the actors are fantastic, especially Carice Van Houten, who really carries the movie. I'd never seen her in a movie before and she is quite a revelation, I really hope to see more of her.<br/><br/>As for Verhoeven, his come-back to the Netherlands paid off. The production is flawless, the action scenes are very well done, and he brings out the best of his cast. The movie captures perfectly the madness of the time, you can't tell the good guys from the bad guys,there is nothing manipulative or Manichean in this movie,everything is not black and white. Not all Germans are monsters, the resist ants can be assholes and heroes lonely people who just try to survive."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","12","14","28 April 2007"," Diary of a survivor
","Coming from the director of ""Robocop"", ""Total recall"", ""Basic instinct"" and ""Hollow man"", this movie has more of the hallmark of a spy thriller than a holocaust epic. While billed as ""based on true events"", an assertion that is so vague that invites unabashed overuse, this movie comes with such a proliferation of twists that it epitomizes the cliché ""truth is stranger than fiction"". Still, the basic plot is quite simple, and as universal as ""Star wars""  good against evil. The good is the Dutch underground resistance during Nazi occupation. The evil is a loose organization that rounds up and kills Jews, where racial motivation is only secondary, if at all. They don't kill any Jew, but only rich Jews, for obvious reasons. The tantalizing suspense is in the guessing and then revelation of the villains, one after another.<br/><br/>Those who remember ""Basic instinct"" (and who wouldn't?) will know of course that suspense is not director Paul Verhoeven's only trump card. At 68, he can still deliver the sensual lure you expect, through the protagonist Rachel, a ""Greta Garbo"" of a young Jewish singer who, after her rich family was killed by the villains mentioned above, joins the underground resistance  ready, willing and able to ""go all the way"" in vindication. Fresh-looking, mesmerizing young Dutch actress Carice van Houten has both the physical endowment and emotion acting range to give a memorable performance. Playing opposite her, as a Nazi officer who still has a heart, is Sebasitan Koch, who is equally memorable, not in this movie, but in his recent appearance in the Oscar winning German movie ""The live of others"".<br/><br/>Watching ""Black book"" will not give you the sense of artistic elation you get after watching ""Schindler's list"" (and even that one some consider to be too commercialized), but is nevertheless 145 minutes of good entertainment."
"Aarkangel","8","85","125","25 October 2006"," Europe meets America
","A really interesting mix of American movie - driven by a strong narrative, complete with car chases and tense thriller moments - and European film - multilingual, with strong sense of historical moment and complex characterisation. The lead performance by Carice van Houten is compelling and charismatic. Overall the film does not amount to a big emotional experience - the centre of the emotion, however, is subtle and focused on the scenes of Ellis (the Jewish heroine, undercover among the Nazis) and Muntze (the German officer) in bed together. A complex and believable love develops between them which is the heart of the film. Great to see Verhoeven back in Europe on a project of passion, bringing back some American know-how to a fairly large scale film, albeit for a pretty modest budget (c$20M I believe)."
"willembaars","9","62","90","29 August 2006"," impressive
","The first movie of Paul Verhoeven since more than 20 years could only turn out to be a disappointment. But fortunately it is not. It is a very impressive and exciting and dramatic story of a Jewish girl that gets involved in the Resistance-movement in World War 2. When she wants to escape the Germans she finds her family killed in front of her eyes. She is rescued and becomes an important member of the Dutch Resistance. She has to act like a spy at the headquarters of the SD and even has to sleep with the head of the SD, who happens to turn out to be the only good German in the movie. I won't tell you what happens, but the movie gives a very good impression of the terrors of war, what people do in these circumstances, the thin line between good and bad and betrayal. The movie was beautifully shot and Carice van Houten is incredible in this movie. Zwartboek is a typical Paul Verhoeven-movie with some nudity and heavy in your face-scenes and provocative and unexpected things that happen. Zwartboek could be the winner of the Oscars for foreign movies next year as far as I am concerned. Also a special credit for the German actor who plays general Franken. Go and see Zwartboek (Black Book): it's a movie that will keep you thinking for quite some while"
"dl-24","10","20","26","9 July 2007"," So Compellingly Good I Saw It Twice in a Week
","It's hard to overstate what a superb film ""Black Book"" is. Thanks to the excellent reviews the Chicago papers gave it, I sauntered off to see it without my wife who foolishly dismissed it as ""another Holocaust film"" (that's as off-base as calling ""Freedom Writers"" ""another school teacher inspirational film). After being blown away by ""Black Book,"" it was easy to persuade my wife to see it a week later -- and she too was blown away. You're best off not knowing much of the plot -- this film takes twists and turns that amaze and astound. The less you know about it, the better. Let's just say that the writing, plotting, direction, and acting are all top notch -- better than any other film I've seen all year. No scene is wasted. ""Black Book"" is one of those films where something that happens early on comes back as an important plot point later in the film. So while you're enjoying this wild roller-coaster emotional ride, pay attention to the details and what people say -- because not a word is wasted.<br/><br/>""Black Book"" is simply film making at its best. There are some darn good reasons that ""Black Book"" is still playing in several Chicago theaters nearly 4 months after its release."
"Quinoa1984","7","19","25","29 April 2007"," lots of Nazi resistance-fighting intrigue, an ideal cast, good but bulky thriller
","Paul Verhoven isn't ever known so much for subtlety as a director, and Black Book doesn't really make any big steps to change that. It is, unlike his films from the past dozen or so years, not intentionally sleazy or overridden with lots of gruesome carnage. There's even a sense that he's probably quite passionate about making a film loaded with gripping history and lots of 'cinematic' characters (not totally real, not totally fake either). But it's also one where melodrama reigns over real incisive dramatic skills, and unlike the recently re-released Army of Shadows there's almost an exhausting quality to the twists and turns, the core being more about direct audience manipulation as opposed to more subdued theatrics. Not that this is the worst thing a director like Verhoven can do, and Black Book is loaded with the kind of entertaining goodies that other directors would shy away from. That it's not a great film- like it might think it is- is hard to ignore.<br/><br/>Carice Van Houten puts in a breakthrough performance (breakthrough in that it calls for some greater things for her in Hollywood) as a Jewish woman who loses her family during a shooting via the Nazis. She joins up with the resistance, and her part in it will be, primarily, to sleep with enemy to get information. A little implausible? Not quite, as it's supposedly based on true events (whether it was a Jewish woman sleeping with the enemy or just in the little details of the Dutch resistance is up for argument), and soon the story unfolds in double-crosses and criss-crosses where you're never too sure after a while (and after the war ends) who's really a good guy or not, as for the most part few are. In general, Verhoven puts these double crosses- which end up making the film slightly bulkier than it needs to be- as a cynical but poignant point about loss of trust and all morals in times of war coming to a head. Rachel ""Ellis"" Stein (Van Houten) also falls into what the script entails, of her falling in love with the main commanding officer she has to sleep with, which is rather circumspect in logical terms.<br/><br/>But then again, after a while, looking at Black Book, ironically for it's veneer being that of an old-fashioned good versus evil story, things become subversive for a reason. The resistance itself, for example, is quite corruptible even with its higher ideals of eradicating all of the Nazis (the ugly side of which personified in the character of the portly Franken, who originally killed Rachel's family), and even have a double side to dealing with the Jewish people; does one value a Dutchman over a Jew becomes one of the central questions for the resistance fighters. And throughout Verhoven is on top of his game directing scenes strongly, with just what is needed for each scene, however convoluted, and the performances usually right on the money (The Lives of Others' Sebastian Koch is a believable Nazi turncoat). It is, more often than not, a satisfying entry in the filmmaker's career, and even a return to form after running out of steam with his big Hollywood sci-fi productions. That it's also quite shallow, and with more than one or two really ridiculous scenes (one scenes subtext might be 'is that a gun popping under the bed, or are you just happy to see me?'), is maybe to be expected considering the track record of the filmmaker."
"Seamus2829","10","14","18","29 April 2007"," Verhoeven Is Back In Form
","I just saw this film earlier today & was blown out of my shoes by it. Black Book (or Zwartboek,as it's called in Europe)is directed & co written by Paul Verhoeven (with Gerard Soetman,who collaborated with Verhoeven on many screenplays for films in his native Holland). If you've ever seen their earlier film 'Soldier Of Orange', you'll know what I mean. Like 'Orange', the film clocks in at near two & a half hours, but there's not a dull moment in store. This makes up for the load of Hollywood crap that Verhoeven has been responsible for since he drifted over here (even his last European film, 'Flesh & Blood',left a lot to be desired for). The film deals with a young Dutch woman of Jewish background that joins the resistance to fight the Nazi's. I would have to say that this is a film well worth seeking out (provided you have no problem with two plus hours of dialog in Dutch,German & even Hebrew with subtitles)."
"santegeezhe","6","117","204","14 September 2006"," Definitely worth seeing
","I saw this film last night at the Toronto International Film Festival and enjoyed it quite a bit. I wouldn't describe it as excellent, but it's definitely entertaining, and my interest never waned despite the nearly 2.5 hour length.<br/><br/>The film concerns one young Jewish woman's attempt to stay alive during WWII by any means necessary. Through a series of allegiances which shift with dizzying speed, she does whatever she has to do to survive.<br/><br/>Without giving away any plot details, I'll briefly describe my impressions of the film. The lead actress was great - not only is she stunningly beautiful, but she completely made the movie for me. She's very easy on the eyes, and proves to be a remarkable actress, completely believable and sympathetic.<br/><br/>The plot moved along swiftly and never lost momentum, although the ever-shifting loyalties and allegiances became overwhelming after a while. Having said that however, the plot did seem a bit predictable and obvious to me, a sort of paint-by-numbers approach to script writing. I didn't find it very suspenseful, although our heroine is such a sympathetic character that I found myself rooting for her throughout, wondering how she'd make it through (since the film is one long flashback, one already knows she'll make it).<br/><br/>For a European film it was surprisingly Hollywoodesque, with lots of gratuitous violence and nudity - although I didn't mind the nudity. There were a few scenes which seemed particularly gratuitous and unnecessary: two words - ""shit bucket"". But luckily these didn't distract too much from the plot.<br/><br/>All in all it was an above average movie and well worth seeing if you're a fan of WWII films and don't mind watching a beautiful young woman light up the screen for two hours or so."
"Maciste_Brother","2","26","42","7 May 2008"," What a hunk of cheese!
","Leave it to Paul ""Subtle as a sledgehammer on the head"" Verhoeven to come up with a WW2 film that is very cheesy and insulting at the same time. After being basically cast out of Hollywood after making a string of several awful movies, Verhoeven said he returned to his ""roots"" when he decided to shoot this film. Well, BLACK BOOK is even cheesier than any of his Hollywood films.<br/><br/>The whole thing is like a standard murder thriller set against the German occupation of Holland. An entire Jewish family is slaughtered while trying to escape the country. Only a young plucky woman, who's already part of the resistance, escapes from the massacre and decides to infiltrate the German occupation and seek those who murdered her family. There isn't a cliché in the book, black or not, that's not used here to tell this overly elaborate and often unintentionally funny spy tale.<br/><br/>What's so bad about it? The convoluted murder/mystery/spy story that's propelled forward not because there's anything remotely interesting or compelling about it but because the script demands it? The monotonous tone of the film or the main actress who's as expressive as Robocop? The truly unintentionally funny moments that belie the serious intentions of the director? The typically gratuitous Verhoeven touches regarding violence and nudity? The TV-movie feel of the whole project? The complete implausibilities of the story that wouldn't even cut it in a 1930s serial? <br/><br/>Stand-out scenes like when they try to chloroform a man who suddenly starts pummeling the clumsy members of the resistance, Verhoeven reveling in every kick and punches the bad guy was inflicting on the poor saps, made me laugh out loud. This overdone scene totally derailed the movie. But things only got worse after that. And worse, and worse. The symbolic ending with the hearse and coffin made my eyes roll.<br/><br/>This brings me to another point about every Paul Verhoeven film: there's always an unsettling amount of gratuitous violence in them, and BLACK BOOK is no exception. You can't make a serious film about WW2 if you revel in violence. Almost the entire cast of BLACK BOOK is eviscerated in one gory fashion or another. This is not shocking to me, since this is from the same director of TOTAL RECALL (or TOTAL WRECK-ALL) but I've honestly given up on Paul Verhoeven. He could have easily redeemed himself here with this film and yet it only reinforces the dire qualities of his previous stink bombs, like SHOWGIRLS, that Verhoeven is only interested in the crude and sensational, nothing about the human experience or even the craft of film-making."
"ciebie750","9","9","12","28 October 2006"," The definitive dutch war movie?
","Apparently you either admire or hate this movie. For me, it was better than i dared to expect. The fact that the cinema remained completely silent for several minutes when it was finished told me that I was not the only one deeply touched by it -especially during the second part. <br/><br/>The movie tells you the story of a young Jewish woman (excellent role Carice van Houten) during the final months of World War II in occupied Holland. She loses everything again and again and gets rescued but also betrayed again and again - many times by her savior at first sight. Rest assured, she survives, but only to witness a new war. (""houdt het dan nooit op"" - will it never end) But it also shows you unscrupulous people surrounding her making good money and/or having a good life during (and after) the war by exploiting other peoples misery. <br/><br/>I disagree with those who state that it displays the Dutch as courageous heroes - in fact the opposite is true. The members of the resistance don't hide their dislike en distrust of the Jews. And they are betrayed by their fellow countrymen. Our heroin has to quote flawless citations from the Bible and accept their opinion (Jews being the cause of all their misery) - or she won't get any food from the people where she's hiding. It also shows Dutch people -after the war- acting in the same brutal and humiliating way as the Nazi's. (some VERY explicit, but sadly enough true, scenery) And it also shows you former collaborators becoming heroes after the war - and vice versa. Our heroin makes a very narrow escape from being remembered as a traitor and ""moffenhoer"" (= ""whore for the Krauts"")- many people weren't that lucky after the war. And many former Nazi and collaborators became wealthy and respected community-members after that war.... The movie indeed shows many black pages(!) from the Dutch WWII history - some pages having been taboo for many years.<br/><br/>But most of all it is a very human story, making it understandable why people act as thy do - sometimes absolutely selfless and heroic, sometimes totally illogical like falling in love with your enemy, sometimes utterly disgusting. The latter sometimes being quite profitable, the first turning out rather deadly. <br/><br/>It's no ""Schindlers List"" (but who can ever match that one?!) but if you want an impression of the Dutch WWII story, go and see Zwartboek. Most likely it will catch you and leave you speechless. However, be aware that you may the one who will be very disappointed."
"WriterDave","8","16","24","23 April 2007"," A Triumph of the ""Performance"" over the ""Act.""
","Paul Verhoeven is a strange breed. He's responsible for three of the most gleefully violent, fascist, and wildly imaginative sci-fi thrillers of a now bygone era (""Robocop,"" ""Total Recall,"" and ""Starship Troopers""). He's also directed the only commercially successful erotic thriller of the past twenty years (""Basic Instinct"") and what is arguably one of the worst films ever made (the highly un-erotic and campy ""Showgirls""). With ""Black Book"" he digs back into his Dutch roots and delivers a thrilling, though flawed, WWII flick anchored by an amazing lead performance from Carice Van Houten.<br/><br/>The first thirty minutes play like a crackerjack version of a ""surviving the Holocaust"" epic. Imagine what Hitchcock might have done had he ever tackled the genre and you'll get an idea of just how splendidly Verhoeven starts the film. He begins with the plucky and beguiling Jewish singer Rachel Stein (Carice Van Houten) hiding out in the Netherlands from the Nazis, traversing tragedy after tragedy and escaping by the skin of her teeth due to her own innate will to survive until she becomes embroiled with a terrorist Dutch resistance group plotting against the German occupation. The first third of the film is full of suggestive dark humor, crisply shot action set pieces, and a luminous Van Houten who throws her whole body into her acting and could melt (or kill) a man with her smile.<br/><br/>The middle portion where Rachel Stein becomes Ellis de Vries and infiltrates the Nazi regime is a stark contrast to its excellent build up. All suggestion is thrown out the door for a crass, misogynistic take on the spy genre. It's fun to watch, but leaves a bad taste in your mouth. It's also the type of crude sadism that is likely to offend the typical audience for this type of historical drama. Van Houten once again throws her whole body into the role, and it's often naked and glowing in this portion of the film. She's immensely watchable as she becomes a pawn in the games of these fascist men hell bent on mutual annihilation. Once driven by her own wits, she now must be rescued time and again by the amoral men who have fallen under her spell.<br/><br/>All changes when the Allied Forces march into the Netherlands triumphant, returning sovereign rule to the bitter Dutch, and striking up deals with the crumbling Nazi infrastructure. The fall out from the multiple double-crossings in the middle portion of the film turn the last third into a pulsating and memorable revenge saga.<br/><br/>Ultimately, justice is in the eye of the beholder, and Verhoeven seems to be saying that all men are capable of evil deeds when their freedom has been taken away and their lives threatened. In his view of war there are no heroes. The only character with any virtue and good sense is a woman, and her inherent ""weakness"" often leads to pain, tragedy, and humiliation. It's a troublesome and often fractured view of the world (which leads to the film's fracturing into three distinct parts), but it's miraculously held together by Carice Van Houten's galvanizing performance that emotionally and physically upstages the worst of what Verhoeven can deliver thematically and visually on any given day."
"timbermisc","9","17","26","22 April 2007"," Tight Romantic Thriller
","If you like ""Casablanca"", you will like ""Black Book"".<br/><br/>If you are interested in WWII movies, you will be pleased with ""Black Book"". Subtitles do not distract from your understanding of this movie. Yes, violence is present.<br/><br/>Immediately I fell into this movie although I was 20 minutes late for it. I certainly reminded me of Hollywood movies of the 1940s sans the out of focus halos around the heroine. Colors are rich and sharp here compared to Hollywood's black and white versions of WWII events. And you may wonder how they found these derelict buildings seen in the film.<br/><br/>I think that some comparison to ""The Pianist"" is fair. We are viewing survival methods of a women who is also a spy. We follow her inner conflicts and loyalties during WWII as she represents ""the resistance"". Sex play is contained therein as she manipulates the right people.<br/><br/>If I sound cool, you're right. But this is a film loaded with action, conflict, comparisons to Greta Garbo, violence, romantic style, and vulgar displays of human incarceration. This may be called a romantic thriller. And strangely, we feel a little empathy for a Guestoppo who manages to submit to the lures of the leading romantic lady who is also a Heb and a spy. (spoiler) The violence is ""normal"" Nazi machine gunning and two people get a hatchet in the face in the last days of the war. And do those Nazi's look real.(end of spoiler) After 2.5 hours, I felt satisfied, never bored. And I felt as if I had learned more of history. I appreciated the sacrifices of the ""Resistance Fighters"" during WWII. Based upon a true story."
"antargas","2","23","37","27 November 2009"," Very disappointing
","I decided to watch this film because of the high IMDb rating and was very disappointed. Having recently re-watched ""The Pianist"", the contrast left ""Black Book"" looking very amateur and unconvincing. In the DVD extras, Paul Verhoeven claims to want to show wartime Holland and the resistance as it really was (supposedly he knows because he was 6 years old then), and to show the dilemmas between right and wrong on both sides. In fact, the shallow acting, pointless nudity and quite unrealistic story-line make this impossible. <br/><br/>For example, although there is a well-documented incident of the Germans executing two of their own deserters in a Canadian-run PoW camp in liberated Holland, the acting of a similar incident in ""Black Book"" is very shallow. The sight of the senior SS officer (Käutner) slamming the phone onto the Canadian's colonel's desk and daring him to phone his General to challenge the execution order is just laughable.<br/><br/>There are so many unconvincing moments in the film it is hard to know where to start. Here are just a couple:<br/><br/><ul><li>why would Müntze be so naive as to go directly with Käutner to challenge Franken about the stolen Jewish valuables without first doing a proper investigation? Any senior officer worth his salt would have thought of that.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>the emotional turmoil that someone like Rachel would feel while supposedly falling in love with an SS officer is hardly dealt with at all</li></ul><br/><br/>Anyone looking for really worthwhile and historically accurate drama about the wartime resistance would do much better with the BBC TV series ""Secret Army"". This had a much lower budget but much better acting - especially the 3rd series, which includes exactly the themes which ""Black Book"" tries to handle (Belgian woman in love with a Gestapo officer; that same officer has a ""good"" German executed in a PoW camp)"
"Boba_Fett1138","8","31","52","15 September 2006"," Paul Verhoeven back to his roots.
","More than 20 years after his last Dutch movie, Verhoeven returns to his native country with the movie ""Zwartboek"". Of course expectations were high and people from both the Netherlands and those outside of it, who are familiar with his earlier Dutch movies, eagerly awaited this movie, probably expecting a new ""Soldaat van Oranje"". With all those high anticipations, which also must have putted lots of pressure on Verhoeven's shoulders, the movie could only disappoint, like unfortunately too often is the case by 'hyped' and highly anticipated movies. To most professional Dutch movie critics this movie was a slight disappointment, probably expecting way too much of it. Granted that ""Zwartboek"" does have its flaws but overall this movie surpassed my expectations, mainly since the movie is a well balanced mix of Verhoeven's earlier Dutch work and his later Hollywood works. It provides the movie with an unique and straight-forward as ever style with lots of spectacular and entertaining moments and some fine acting. Make sure not to expect a new ""Soldaat van Oranje"" like movie and you'll be able to enjoy and be impressed by the movie for what it is.<br/><br/>To be honest the movie didn't started off well. The beginning is messy, with way too much happening on screen in a too short amount of time. It's unclear were the movie is heading to and what for a kind of movie it is going to be. There isn't a main plot line which doesn't help to make the movie interesting or easy to watch. Luckily the second halve is much better and completely blew me away. I really didn't expected to see so much action and tense and spectacular moments. The movie starts of as a typical Dutch WW II drama but quickly turns into a spectacular action/thriller with moments that really impress.<br/><br/>I like Paul Verhoeven movies, both his Dutch as his Hollywood movies, for several reasons. One of them is that he can always tell a dramatic and powerful story in a heavy impressive but yet also always entertaining way. His movies always have one or multiple messages in it but they are disguised so well into the story (also kudos to Gerard Soeteman for that of course) that is doesn't ever get distracting or feels overdone and preachy but still it works unconsciously effective and powerful nevertheless. Another reason why I love Verhoeven movies is that he's never afraid to show the dark side of people. ""Zwartboek"" teaches us that nothing in this world is completely black and white and not everything and everyone is completely right or wrong, good or bad.<br/><br/>Despite the movie its beginning, the movie is well written with some good and interesting characters in it. The story takes some great thriller kind of twists and turns, which also both helps the drama and action moments work out. It has some misses but overall it has way more hits, which makes ""Zwartboek"" probably not the best Dutch movie since years but certainly the most interesting and surprising one. The fact that the story is completely told from a woman's point of view makes the movie all the more powerful and believable, as well as unique and interesting.<br/><br/>Had Verhoeven not worked in America for several years, this movie would had had a completely different look and style. Verhoeven his 'Hollywood' style can be found back in this movie. Mainly of course in its action but also mostly in its professionalism in terms of directing style, camera-work and pacing. ""Zwarttboek"" probably is more 'Hollywood' than 'European' in terms of style and storytelling, which should mean that persons who aren't familiar with European movies should be able to enjoy this movie as well. Also still Verhoeven's own unique distinctive style in this movie is notable, meaning lots of nudity, sex and graphic violence but it all serves a purpose and therefor doesn't feel overdone or unneeded.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie is top-class, from both the Dutch actors as well as the Germans. Every well known and respected Dutch actor stood in line to work with Verhoeven on his first Dutch movie since several decades. Verhoeven gratefully took advantage of this and the movie is filled with some of the best Dutch actors around at the moment. People from the Netherlands already knew it but now the rest of the world also knows that Carice van Houten is one great actress, with a great charisma and look. She carries the movie for most of its time and does this in an highly convincing and impressive way. This movie surely means her internationally breakthrough, at least if she is up for that. She further more has a great chemistry with basically every of her fellow actors in this movie, especially with Sebastian Koch and Halina Reijn. Actors in this movie who were also really good were Thom Hoffman and Derek de Lint and German actors Waldemar Kobus and Christian Berkel. Johnny de Mol however feels out of place and he plays an highly unconvincing character that only works distracting.<br/><br/>The movie is really professional and good looking, despite its very low-budget (even though its the most expensive Dutch movie ever made). The great cinematography by Karl Walter Lindenlaub gives the movie its own identity and great look. The movie looks especially professional with its action. For some reason action and shoot sequences never look convincing in Dutch movies but this movie is a glorious exception.<br/><br/>Will ""Zwartboek"" win an Oscar for best foreign film? As much as I want to see Verhoeven finally win an Oscar and get some recognition, I don't think it will win. ""Zwartboek"" is probably too spectacular and 'Hollywood' for that. I think that the academy would prefer a more heavy drama with a more serious told story, that is more powerful than entertaining.<br/><br/>More entertaining and impressive than powerful but a fine sweet surprise nevertheless that honestly surpassed my expectations.<br/><br/>8/10"

","This a Total Recall kind of plot twisting thriller set against the background of ww2. The two and a half hour lasting movie doesn't contain any dull moment. The acting is top notch, like all technical parts of the movie. I would have loved the movie even more if it had had an open ending so we would never know who was good or wrong (The main theme of the film) , but it is still entertaining as hell and most people probably like it better if everything is clear for them.<br/><br/>So this is a great homecoming of Paul Verhoeven and I think it will be a big hit in Holland and internationally. certainly one of the best ww2 thrillers ever made."
"Buddy-51","6","14","21","29 January 2008"," entertaining but often preposterous war movie
","""Black Book"" may be based on a true story, but it often plays more like a corny wartime melodrama than a serious film about war. Suffice it to say, it has a lot of beautiful and glamorous people running around doing a lot of cloak-and-dagger espionage stuff - all while changing the course of history. That's not to say it isn't an enjoyable and entertaining picture, just that it doesn't rank up there in artistry and truth with the great European films about the Fascist era, classics like ""Open City,"" ""Forbidden Games,"" ""The Shop on Main Street,"" ""Das Boot,"" etc. When you boil it down to the bare essentials, the theme of ""Black Book"" seems to be that there's nothing like a little hair coloring and a bar of chocolate to help an attractive young girl survive the horrors of war.<br/><br/>Rachel Stein is a beautiful Jewish singer whose entire family is mowed down by the Nazis as they are fleeing occupied Holland (Rachel and her family are Germans currently hiding out in the Netherlands). As the sole survivor of the attack, Rachel quickly becomes active in the Dutch resistance, her assignment being to cozy up to a high-ranking Gestapo officer who has taken a liking to her. Soon she finds herself not only in bed with the Nazi but quite possibly in love with him as well.<br/><br/>Paul Verhoeven has directed the film much in the style of his big-scale Hollywood productions (""Robocop,"" ""Total Recall"") - that is to say with a great deal of energy but not a lot of emotion. The convoluted storyline often becomes muddled and difficult to follow, but Verhoeven compensates for this weakness by keeping the proceedings moving at a breakneck pace (which is a good thing since the film takes an exhausting two hours and twenty-five minutes to tell its story). Unfortunately, the movie has been fitted with a musical score that sounds as if it has been lifted from some third-rate espionage thriller from the 1960's. Carice van Houten has brio and spunk as the movie's heroine, running around from one dire predicament and hairbreadth escape to another - she's almost like a Dutch version of the perpetually imperiled Pauline - but most of the other actors simply get lost in the shuffle. And if you've ever doubted that chocolate is, indeed, the answer to all of life's problems, you will never do so again after seeing this movie.<br/><br/>I must say that, even though I enjoyed the film immensely, ""Black Book"" is probably the first serious film about Nazis that actually had me chuckling at wholly inappropriate places (some of the actors even hold their guns in a funny way). ""Black Book"" may be a Dutch film by rights, but it's strictly from Hollywood in its silliness and corn."

","Forget the English sub- titles for this Dutch language film. Fast paced, dramatic, twisting and edgy, this is a marvellous revamp of the traditional ""Resistance"" genre, easily the best film I have seen in ages.<br/><br/>The Director Paul Verhoeven has a distinguished English language film career behind him, the best of which is echoed and reworked to great effect. From the ""Hollow Man"" we have the sense of emptiness and isolation of the main character. From ""Starship Troopers"", ""Total Recall"" and ""Robocop"" we have tremendous all action set pieces bursting onto the screen like firecrackers. From ""Showgirls"" and ""Basic Instinct"" we have the salacious sexiness of some pleasingly gratuitous sequences.<br/><br/>The Wartime period is lovingly recreated as the lack of goofs and trivia comments testify ! The tale is essentially that of a wartime Jewess, Rachel Ellis - brilliantly performed by Carice Van Houten - her hiding, and her journey into the hands of the Dutch Resistance to avenge her tragic experiences.<br/><br/>Distance provides perspective and the Dutch Resistance and liberation is not played in straight patriotic mode. Political, personal and conscientious differences are all shown between the fighters with greed and self preservation knowing no National boundaries ! Indeed one of the most sympathetically drawn characters is the SS Commander, Muntze - carefully played by Sebastian Koch. A philatelist and pragmatist, he emerges with more dignity than most amidst a twisting, swirling plot. When Ellis has to seduce Muntze there is a preceding ""Basic Instinct"" moment when she is seen not only dying her hair, but her pubic hair. She remonstrates with a fellow Resistance fighter not to look - but you cant help! Traditionally this type of film as practised in the forties, fifties, and sixties was slow and laconic. This whips along, totally carrying it's two and a half hour running time. The plot is dense, thus making a second viewing very rewarding, but hey, you have to see it for the first time, and that is exactly what you should do !"
"aharmas","10","7","9","25 March 2007"," Really Amazing Movie!!!
","Carice Van Houten comes in with a performance that will leave a mark this and any other year. Her work in ""Black Book"" succeeds because this actress is capable of conveying a variety of emotions that range from tenderness to incredulity, anger to immense sadness. Her heroine in ""Black Book"" is not a character that grows because of the special circumstances that she must confront, but she a resourceful survivor who must do what is necessary to help herself and others. She is also incredibly lucky.<br/><br/>Rachel lived in Holland and from early on we learn she is willing to do what is necessary to achieve her goals. If this means becoming a spy and infiltrating the very core of the Gestapo, she does it. Amazingly, she encounters a kindred soul in the middle of this hell, and she eventually learns that the lines of good and evil blur at some point.<br/><br/>The film's production is impeccable, and it moves very well, considering how much is packed in its nearly 2:30 hours. It's got a circular structure, and although we know its resolution, we can't help being drawn by its thrilling narrative and very charismatic star. The rest of the cast supports Ms. Houten very well, each one playing his/her respective part with conviction.<br/><br/>When I saw the film, I was particularly impressed by the fact that it never lags, the way most American films do nowadays. Its structure is very simple and straightforward, but it weaves the themes of horror, bravery, and survival into a very exciting movie. The assured direction of Mr. Verhoeven succeeds because he seems to understand and respect his sources. This time, he leaves out some of the reverence that bogs down many of these period films. This time we are shown a side of WWII that rarely makes it to the screen: the underground fighters that risked their lives to lessen the impact of the evil forces in Europe.<br/><br/>Overall, the film will touch you and teach you how we should learn from the past, look at ourselves and see how life is more complex than just black and white."

","This movie is running in Amsterdam from last 16 weeks and it had to be on my list of movies. It is a multi-lingual movie with Dutch, German and English dialogues used  the common link is the Dutch sub-title. The movie is made by Dutch director with mostly Dutch cast.<br/><br/>The story is said to be based on true events. The movie is about a Jewish girl staying in Netherlands during the Second World War  when the Germans attack and occupy Netherlands. The girl's home is bombarded and most of her friends and relatives killed by Germans. The story is about her survival and the help she provides to the anti-Nazi militia force to fight the Germans  by secretly working in a German's army base.<br/><br/>The movie is well made. The main protagonist  the girl  Carice van Houten has done an excellent job. This movie seems a big break for Carice, and she would surely be a forerunner in winning best actress awards  at least in European region. Like all the WWII movies some events shown are quite disturbing and nauseating. There are explicit sex scenes shown to depict how a girl can survive by using her beauty and body and being smart. The movie also shows the type of corruption that went on within the Dutch society during WWII, were some people assembled treasures from deceased Jews family.<br/><br/>It is a long movie that satisfies you totally with the width of events that it provides like an epic. It also presents the movie in a commercial format  with all spices added at appropriate points to keep the interest alive and kicking throughout the movie. At the end of the movie you as audience feel happy. For me it was difficult to understand the dialogues, but I felt happy seeing the movie. I can imagine how happy and proud Dutch people would feel by seeing such a well made Dutch movie."

","BLACK BOOK has a lot going for it: outstanding production values, some fine performances, and lots of action. Action galore- and then, even more. And that's what's at the heart of what's wrong with this movie: it never pauses long enough, at any point, to build some much-needed suspense. Everything happens in a much too quick ""and-then-she-joined-the-resistance-and-they-got-ratted-out"" manner; the storytelling isn't carefully measured, it's rushed, as if getting as many shots in the can as quick as possible was the director's overriding concern. The fact that the camera almost never stops moving suggests as much (it's a common practice in low budget film-making). To cite but one example: the scene where the son of the leader of the resistance is being tortured. There's absolutely no suspense whatsoever in this scene (a pivotal moment in such a film, one would think). Had this one been pared down to a handful of essential scenes and had those scenes been thoroughly thought out and presented, BLACK BOOK might've felt a little less like a rush job. And that's no rush to judgement, either."
"dragonshield","8","8","11","9 July 2007"," Visually stunning, hanging on Carice van Houten's beauty
","OK so I saw this film a while ago, but I never had the time to review it, but now I do. This was probably the first Dutch film I've ever seen and to be honest I was quite pleased with it as well. I also like the language a lot, it kind of fascinates me. To me it was sort of German and English blended together and I enjoyed hearing it. It's very easy for your ears. Anyway, the movie itself tells about a Jewish woman, Rachel Stein, who during the World War II hides from the Nazis in The Netherlands. By different circumstances and accidents she joins a dutch resistance group and under a false name Ellis de Vries she becomes a spy at a German headquarters.<br/><br/>The story is all in all very interesting and the screenplay is very good. It includes so much plot twists that the movie is an exciting experience throughout. The story is very original too as it's not just another story about WW2. An interesting way of coming up with a plot based on WW2 and that is what also makes it so fascinating. Though there are some battle scenes the main focus isn't on them, it's totally on the story which also has enough depth in it to keep the viewer far away from bored. Directing is also very enjoyable, directed by Paul Verhoeven, it definitely compliments the story by being accurate and precise, having this good tempo and a great way of describing or showing things. There are probably a couple of unnecessary scenes included and although for example the nude scenes are supposed to be realistic the nudity is also pretty useless and it doesn't wake up any emotions in the viewer, being basically just unnecessary.<br/><br/>The best thing this movie has to offer is undeniably the role performance of Carice van Houten who plays the role of Rachel Stein aka Ellis de Vries. The movie pretty much hangs in the hands of van Houten, the role performance is simply superb and she just shines with her beauty. She is just so beautiful in the film that it makes the viewer adore her, probably even worship her. Being so real and so true she keeps the movie on its feet, being simply the definite glaze of the movie. Another role performance worth mentioning is the role performance done by Sebastian Koch, who plays the role of Ludwig Müntze, an SS-officer who meets Rachel at a train smuggling weapons. The meeting comes more important than Rachel thought, as when she becomes the spy at the German headquarters the headquarters is actually lead by Müntze. Koch is just so brilliant in the role. I thought he was more enjoyable in ""Das Leben der Anderen"" though, but there's nothing to complain about him in ""Zwartboek"" either.<br/><br/>What catches your eyes besides the beauty of Carice van Houten is how visually stunning the movie is. The use of colours is just magnificent and all the other visual sides are all in all an incredible achievement. I have to raise my hat for the whole art department and also the department responsible for the costume design, as that was also a pleasure for your eyes as well. The glaze of Carice van Houten actually makes me think of older movies and the first one coming up to my mind is ""Casablanca"" where Ingrid Bergman did pretty much the same thing, although these two movies can not be compared together, even when it comes to the beauty of van Houten and Bergman. Bergman's beauty is just so classic, when van Houten's represents the world today, although it is probably also going to be a classic after 50 years. At the moment comparing is just out of question. The music used in the film is very old fashioned and it just fits with the them so well, well it's based on WW2 after all. Composed by Anne Dudley it gives more of that realistic edge for the movie and by beautiful and gloomy compositions it's more than important, it's necessary. And it's brilliant.<br/><br/>""Zwartboek"" is all in all a good movie. It had the chance of being much more than that, but it somehow goes wrong in some part. Not actually wrong, but it kind of looses it's flow, although it somehow is interesting throughout. Hard to explain really, but that's how it is. The movie is definitely worth watching though it isn't phenomenal. It doesn't have to be, as when being good a movie is always worth watching. If you want to recall the old times when movies were made with style and with a lead female actor who melted the hearts of men then this movie is definitely for you, though I could describe it as a modernized version. A good movie, a good achievement from Verhoeven."

","The film credits say that the film was based on a ""true story."" But I'm sure that the plural -- ""stories"" -- is more accurate. The coalescing, condensation of actual events onto a few central characters -- while the events are no doubt true -- is almost more than anyone could endure.<br/><br/>The film operates at 2 levels.<br/><br/>On the first, there's an action film as compelling as anything with Indiana Jones, which propels you through the 148 minutes as on a roller coaster. I had to ask my companions shortly after we saw it, ""did this have subtitles?"" because the velocity was so high I wasn't sure.<br/><br/>On the second level, there's a profound commentary on the human race.<br/><br/>I'm sure Americans are not alone in tending to polarize views between the good guys and the bad guys; those who are good are ALL good, those who are bad are ALL bad.<br/><br/>The film presents some as holding tightly to their principles and ideals, some as fudging just a little as needed to insure survival, some as looking to take personal advantage of situations. People come in all sorts and wartime conditions display that variety (and this film captures that).<br/><br/>I don't doubt that Americans are very similar to the people portrayed in this film. But I do doubt that such a critically perceptive film could be made in the USA about the American people. Kudos to those Dutch who have accepted and applauded this film.<br/><br/>I thought the casting and acting was superb.

"rowmorg","3","14","22","12 September 2009"," A women's film devoid of emotional impact
","Black Book is a women's film, about a rich young Jewess, formerly a pop singer, trying to survive in Nazi-occupied Holland. Sadly, director Paul Verhoeven does not understand women and nor does he know how to convey emotion. A glance at his Hollywood CV would have warned the producers. The result is an empty depiction of events, in which the heroine Rachel (Carice Van Houten) acts like Robocop (an earlier Verhoeven effort). Along the way, we get some lingering shots of her tits and a few seconds of her bare bottom. Neither views suit a women's film, a signal that something is very wrong. The motivation of Verhoeven's heroine is contorted, as her family and lover are wiped out before her eyes and she makes a narrow blood-spattered escape, yet does not for a moment shed a tear for them, nor suspect the people who sent them to their fate. Instead, she has unmotivated sex with a resistance member before going into the Nazi headquarters and seducing the Gestapo chief, whom she treats with bizarrely sudden love and affection. Her ostensible purpose is to save three resistance men from torture. Instead, she places a microphone in the torturer's office, and she and her colleagues listen to him having noisy sex. Her motive fades even further into the background as Verhoeven makes a meal of the Nazi setting, presumably to appeal to his German market. This is a thoroughly unpleasant film made by a very cynical and sociopathic film-maker, and it deserves to be blasted into oblivion by the idiotic ""Inglourious Basterds"", which has the merit of being sheer fantasy and frank wish-fulfilment."
"Superunknovvn","6","9","13","4 November 2007"," Not as good as it's made out to be
","I had absolutely no problem with ""Black Book"" as a trashy, but entertaining little spy movie that is set during WWII. It is not a quality movie, though, and really doesn't deserve the high rating it has gathered on IMDb.<br/><br/>Although the story is supposedly based on ""true events"" it never seems very realistic on screen. The dialog is so rushed, it's laughable at times. At one point the characters are basically saying the following lines to each other without even pausing to breathe:<br/><br/>Character 1: When you break into the German prison, I want you to free my Nazi friend along with our comrades.<br/><br/>Character 2: No way.<br/><br/>Character 1: Then you'll have to do the whole thing without me.<br/><br/>Character 3: Well, we don't have a choice then, do we? Get the guy out of prison.<br/><br/>I don't know who's to blame for this. Verhoeven as a director, the screenwriters who wrote such crap, the actors who stumble through their lines either without any emotion at all or with totally exaggerated expressions on their faces, but this scene (and many more) just seemed plain silly.<br/><br/>Speaking of the actors: none of them is very good, especially leading lady Carice van Houten hands in a rather mediocre performance.<br/><br/>The main problem probably lies with Verhoeven, though. The man has never been a great director. Mind you, he's made some great movies, but then for every good one he's made he also produced a turkey. The thing is that even Verhoeven's good movies seem a bit trashy. If they fitted the story, if they served as some kind of media criticism, these trashy elements actually enriched the movie (as was the case in ""RoboCop"", ""Total Recall"" or ""Starship Troopers""). And then there were movies that had a storyline so trashy that Verhoeven's style helped to ham them up even more and drive the whole project against the wall (""Basic Instinct"", ""Showgirls"", ""Hollow Man"").<br/><br/>Now, for a story like ""Black Book"" none of Verhoeven's antics were needed, but he still hams up the movie by pacing it up too much, showing nudity every 5 minutes, making characters act and react unbelievably and adding silly twists and turns. The ""Black Book"" that lends the movie its title isn't mentioned until late into the movie and even though it's supposed to play a huge role in the final outcome, we never learn how it actually served as a key to the ongoings anyway and quite frankly, we couldn't give a damn about this book.<br/><br/>So, even though ""Black Book"" is entertaining enough for as long as it's running, its flaws already become apparent during the first viewing. This should definitely not be considered high quality cinema."

"phiggins","4","27","48","26 October 2006"," All surface, no feeling
","Shout it from the roof-tops: after years spent churning out enjoyable action movies (Total Recall, Robocop), iconic ""erotic thrillers"" (Basic Instinct) and utter, utter tripe (Showgirls, Hollow Man, Starship Troopers), Paul Verhoeven has turned Serious. Out go the overwrought action sequences, the gratuitous nudity and the obsession with bodily fluids. In come the sensitivity, the subtlety, the delicate touch that a film about Jews and Nazis in WWII surely require. Just kidding. Verhoven couldn't be subtle if his life depended on it. Sensitivity? Get real. Delicate touch? This is war. And what a curious war it is. People  even the most downtrodden  wear immaculate, brand-new clothes straight out of the wardrobe department. Our heroine gets shot in the head, and her charming little scar lasts almost two entire scenes before it is dispensed with altogether. Most ludicrously of all, when a man takes a bullet in the shoulder he is advised not to worry  ""it's just a flesh wound"". Ah yes, the old flesh wound routine. Cue close-up of pincers extracting said bullet from said flesh. Seconds later, the fortunate victim is up and about and back to his usual self. Wonderful things, flesh wounds. Verhoeven has obviously seen the same recent war films that everyone else has. Unfortunately he has not learned anything from them. He is still labouring under the impression that nudity, obscenity, and endless violence are the hallmarks of seriousness and profundity. Anyone who might disagree with him just doesn't get it. Don't you know the man is an Artist? Don't you know that nothing can compromise his unyielding vision? What Spielberg and Polanski understood instinctively when it was their turn to tackle WWII was that while the horror demanded to be shown, there had to be more than that. Humanity was what they brought to the table, and their audiences left the cinema reeling because they had seen something recognisable and terrible. Verhoeven doesn't seem to care about humanity at all. Perhaps he prefers robots, and guns, and Michael Douglas. He seems unaware of what actually happens to a person when they go through violence and torment and abuse. His doll-like heroine starts the film as she ends it  unaffected by the vile events that have occurred. But if she is unaffected, what about us? If none of these things seem to actually matter, then what are we doing sitting through them? I can imagine well enough, thank you, what it might look like when you pour a vat of faeces over a half-naked actress. But how does it feel? What effect will it have on the character? None, apparently: the sh*t happens, and in the very next scene she is back to her old self  blonde and bubbly and perfect. So, that's alright then. She sees her entire family wiped out by Nazis  an event that supposedly drives her to seek revenge - but she doesn't seem particularly to miss them or care about them once they are gone. So why should we? Clearly, Verhoeven wants to make his own Schindler, his own Pianist. What he has created instead is a shrill mish-mash of grotesquery and camp. He will, I am sure, condemn anyone who has the gall to laugh at inappropriate moments during his very important movie. My favourite such moment came early on when the Comedy Nazi, looking down on the grisly results of his handiwork, said, in close-up, one simple word: ""Excellent"". My laughter was a genuine, human response to a terrible event rendered banal by a bad artist. When Verhoeven sticks to action-packed blockbusters he is on safe ground. As soon as he tries to be Important he is doomed. No doubt he will say of his detractors that they just don't understand what he is doing. On the contrary, I understand perfectly well  I just wish he would stop doing it. The Black Book is all surface, no feeling. Nothing hurts, nothing matters: it's just a flesh wound.<br/><br/>Update, April 2007. I wrote the above after seeing the film at the London Film Festival in October 2006. It is reassuring to see that my favourite film critic, Anthony Lane, would seem to agree with many of the points I made back then. (April 9th, 2007 issue of the New Yorker)"
"petra_ste","6","10","15","10 August 2008"," Slick but unexceptional
","I am no Paul Verhoeven fan, but I notice he is one of those rare directors liked both by the lowbrow and the highbrow critic; the former enjoys his penchant for nudity and violence, the latter appreciates the self-consciously campy, ""wink-wink"" quality of his movies.<br/><br/>Zwartboek is compelling. Pacing is tight and Carice van Houten gives a powerful performance in the main role. The rest of the cast is solid, but van Houten owns the movie with her nuanced portrayal.<br/><br/>But Verhoeven, known for being daring, chickened out. Rachel, a young Jewish woman whose family was murdered by Nazis, joins the Dutch resistance and becomes a Mata Hari-like spy. However, Muntze (Sebastian Koch), the German officer she sleeps with to gather informations, happens to be a decent, charming fellow who refuses to kill POWs and civilians and yearns for peace and love - so much, in fact, that she falls in love with him. Two days after meeting Rachel, Muntze finds out she is a spy and, unbelievably, it doesn't bother him. Instead of having her arrested and executed, they have an earnest chat and continue their relationship. Wait, what?<br/><br/>The problem is, making him so squeaky-clean robs the movie of any sense of moral conflict on Rachel's side. The character of Muntze should have had more of an edge.<br/><br/>Likewise, Rachel's duties as she pretends to work with the Nazis are quite anodyne and neutral - she has to copy reports and decorate rooms with Nazi flags. You never get from this cooperation the feeling of dreadful moral compromise which would have given the heroine more depth and self-loathing.<br/><br/>Given the premise, Zwartboek is surprisingly tame. Sure, van Houten spends so much time bare-breasted that she probably caught a cold but, for a war movie about a Mata Hari kind of spy, the result is almost bland and pulls too many punches - with some exceptions, like a painful scene of humiliation ending with a shower of manure.<br/><br/>Zwartboek lacks subtlety in terms of characterization: not a surprise if you know Verhoeven. There isn't any depth to these people; yes, we get the final twist, but it isn't as earth-shattering as Verhoeven seems to believe: not all German officers were monsters and not all resistance members were saints. Duh. Hardly a revelation.<br/><br/>This is competent film-making with good performances, nothing more.<br/><br/>6,5/10"
"Lmiklowitz","7","11","17","7 May 2007"," Sex and violence aren't enough for a film without meaning
","No question, this is one gripping film. It was hard to believe 2:25 hours had passed, in contrast to the several glances of the watch in about the same amount of time during Spiderman, wishing it would be over.<br/><br/>There are high production values. Many millions of Euros or dollars went into blowing up things and make-up for bullet wounds, not to mention the large hanging vat of human feces. Now why would they have suspended it to the ceiling other than for the dramatic value in the script? The suspended scheisse is a metaphor for the plausibility of most of the movie. Good fiction makes sense. Having a strong cast won't carry a shaky script. Director/screenwriter Paul Verhoeven has good command for the sensational, potboiler (Robocop, Showgirls, Basic Instinct), but he is out of his element when he tries to make a definitive statement on the cooperation of Holland's citizens with the Nazis. The reality in Holland as in France as is in the U.S. when power changes from one major political party to the other, some people can land on their feet and get along and go along.<br/><br/>We think that of Rachel/Ellis a few times, but she shows her true feelings at least twice: when she throws up in the beginning of her deception and later when she threatens to quit the Resistance if a betraying Dutch police inspector isn't removed from his office. Carice van Houten is eye-grabbing as the endangered Jewish gamine, Rachel Weiss, who later gives herself an all-over hair bleaching to look Teutonic. She has wonderful chemistry with the affable local Gestapo chief Sebastian Koch, who doesn't even raise his voice. The two live together in real life. <br/><br/>The double and triple crosses are worthy of Hitchcock, but near the end there are several accusations made, and they are not all resolved, particularly one against the Resistance leader Gerben Kuiypers, whose son Timothy was captured.<br/><br/>So many plot points were not worthy of belief: How could a bullet coming from the front just graze Rachel/Ellis forehead and then heal so quickly without a scar? <br/><br/>How did Rachel/Ellis get so good a command of German? There are several good incidents of plot foreshadowing, but this isn't one of them. If Muntze is that suspicious of Ellis why doesn't he have her followed when she goes ""home"" to get clothes? How could so great a guy as Muntze rise to head to Gestapo in Holland after operations in Poland and France? <br/><br/>How could Resistance member and doctor Hans Akkermans (Thom Hoffman)survive so many fire fights even though he shoots without cover, certainly rank-and-file Gestapo couldn't have been trusted with the knowledge? <br/><br/>How could Muntze after presumably hearing a full confession from Ellis trust her to continue to work in a sensitive position in Gestapo headquarters? How could Hans have become so silent so quickly when he had been so forceful, heart attack for a man presumably in his late 30s to 40? <br/><br/>Whose side was Ronnie on in arranging the final jail break, of Muntze and Ellis? How does Ronnie keep from getting her head shaved by the mob as a Nazi whore? <br/><br/>Why would attorney Smaal keep such detailed records in his black book, which could have been a ticket to execution for him and his wife if it had fallen in Nazi hands? And why doesn't Verhoeven ever put a gun in Ellis'/Rachel's hand when she is in mortal danger? <br/><br/>Sex and violence makes the time of the movie go quickly, but leave the viewer unsatisfied after its over. There needs to be meaning, too."

","A cartoon-strip conflation of half a dozen true stories, Black Book is Showgirls meets James Bond with a bucket of faeces thrown in for good measure.<br/><br/>As it was bound to be: although ageing director Paul Verhoeven did, once upon a time, have something to say, and something to contribute to world cinema, nowadays he's not so much the fiction as the pulp itself.<br/><br/>Crying out for Nestle sponsorship in its testament to the life-saving power of chocolate, Black Book is wartime and post-wartime Netherlands as it never was and Mata Hari as even she could never have been.<br/><br/>That it's brain-dead comes as no surprise given Verhoeven's provenance, though it is surprising that the Netherlands itself seemed so proud of this risible junk it tried to nominate it as a Best Film.<br/><br/>Best of what? Exploitation? Well, yup. Crassness? Definitely a winner there. Utter unreality? Ten out of ten. Immaturity? In a field of its own. Best Netherlands Musical? Very probably: the set-piece of a gallery of screaming crones tipping down a bucket of ordure is like a deranged out-take of a Verhoeven trial-run at Les Miserables.<br/><br/>Though it's sad that something as dire as this should get such high ratings here, IMDb reflects mass audience dumbing down; it doesn't cause it. So those who think it's more masterpiece than masturbatory are entitled to their view and Verhoeven is free to proceed with yet more and bigger buckets of shite to draw in the punters.<br/><br/>Hopefully, actress Carice van Houten won't have anything to do with it.<br/><br/>No brighter international star can surely have been born in such dismal circumstances: the lady has a talent and a screen presence that having survived Verhoeven will survive anything.<br/><br/>Rating: 1 out of 10 thanks to van Houten's performance. Without it, Black Book merits minus 9.<br/><br/>Recommendation: ""The Night Porter"". It's a movie. That alone distinguishes it from Verhoeven's work."

","Verhoeven has had hits and misses 'Starship Troopers', 'Robocop' and 'Basic Instinct', Showgirls' for an example of both. But Black Book is a definite hit. His first Dutch film in over twenty years see him in fine form and he finds an absolute star in Van Houten as she makes her transition from stage to screen. Set during the Nazi occupation of Europe the story is a traditional one of good vs. bad, double crosses and desperate times. With only a minor few quibbles the films strength is its pacing and plot twists and the fact that Van Houten is so mesmerising when on screen. At over two hours its quite a journey but not only is it at times harsh it is also funny and the characters are all very well rounded that you tend to like them regardless of which side they are on. As with most Verhoeven action the sound is turned up full and the music can be a little irritating but looking past that and adding together all the things that are great about the film you get probably Verhoeven's best for years and in a world swamped with films involving or surrounding the Nazi years you come away with something that feels fresh and different. Quite an achievement in terms of cinema. Unnoticeably long but so gripping to watch Black Book should make people see Verhoeven as a director to watch out for again because with this film he has proved himself and fended of the critics to come away with an engaging film that most would have thought not possible. You should never judge a book by its cover or indeed director. A brilliantly enjoyable effort all round. Let's hope for some more from Verhoeven and especially Van Houten as both here have shined."

"slash83_mus","9","13","21","16 September 2006"," Netherlands goes international - finally
","Not knowing what to expect, I went to see this movie in theaters yesterday. Being a long-time World War 2-buff and fan of Verhoeven's early Dutch work (Floris, Turks Fruit, Soldaat van Oranje) and some of his Hollywood-projects (Robocop, Total Recall, Basic Instinct) I was pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>First off, this is clearly Verhoeven. Some nudity is somehow unmissable in all of his movies, so we get to see some. Verhoeven is also known to put mind-boggling plot-twists in the story, and again he left this trademark of his. I'm glad he did.<br/><br/>The movie tells us the story of a young Israeli teacher in a '50s Kibbutz. Triggered by the unexpected visit of an old friend, she thinks back about what happened during the last months of the war in Europe.<br/><br/>We see a young Jewish girl getting into trouble after her hide-out was accidentally bombed by a chased Allied bomber. She has nowhere to go and, with some help, decides to flee to the already liberated lower south of the Netherlands. The transport however is intercepted and wiped out before they reach the safe side. Being the sole survivor she suddenly finds herself in increasingly threatening situations. She is picked up by a small Dutch resistance-group and offers her services as a spy. She infiltrates the headquarters of the Sicherheitsdienst (German Intelligence Agency) but unexpectedly finds herself facing the deeper aspect of war and occupation: Not all Germans were monsters. Facing increasingly difficult situations she tries to survive the war against all odds.<br/><br/>Verhoeven does a great job telling the story in the emotional, colorful, humorous and utterly thrilling way he is so good at. He does what he did with 'Soldaat van Oranje' (Soldier of Orange) and adds his Hollywood-experience and an even greater budget to realize his visions.<br/><br/>The story is absolutely lifted to an even higher level by van Houten. She is impressive and convincing throughout the movie and the chemistry with Koch, Hoffman and Reijn never looses grip. Koch does a great job, probably partly due to his earlier roles of 'humane nazi' such as Claus Graf Schenk v. Stauffenberg (""Stauffenberg"") and Albert Speer (""Speer und er""). He (finally) gives the German occupier a more humane face, a big relief compared to the black/white way Germans are portrayed in most WW2 movies even today. Kobus is very convincing in his role as the frustrated, treacherous and non-stop drinking first Lieutenant and Hoffman does a great job portraying the resistance 'hero'. It is also nice to see Derek de Lint again in his role as resistance leader, the exact opposite of his role as Dutch voluntary SS-man in 'Soldier of Orange'.<br/><br/>The only character that felt out of place was that of Theo (Johnny de Mol). Not only is de Mol very unconvincing and clearly not up to roles beyond soap-opera's, his character is an unnecessary addition to the otherwise convincing group of resistance-fighters.<br/><br/>Verhoeven is back - and how. Go see this one, it will, one way or another, grip you by the throat and won't let you go until well after the movie has ended. <br/><br/>9/10"

","I already knew Paul Verhoeven is not the greatest of directors, but was still curious about this 'most expensive Dutch movie ever'. The film disappoints from the first moment on. One doesn't have the feeling to be back in the 1940's: unlike Schindler's List, Blackbook lacks the right atmosphere and tension. Although the actors wear the right clothes, I felt like watching 2006 scenes - not war scenes. Even if there is serious action, like shootouts, bombardments or German soldiers attacking, there is a stunning lack of tension. Maybe the camera work has to do with it: amateurish and with a strong low budget feeling. Verhoeven was either to lazy or is just too incompetent to think about how to film a scene in a proper way. The style of camera work is cheap, outdated and boring. Photography is clumsy and uninteresting. To be honest, it was difficult to watch this film to the end. I feel ashamed to be Dutch, since there are people that call Paul Verhoeven the greatest of Dutch directors. And I'm afraid they are actually right..."

If you want to see a war movie with lots of battles and a very clear idea of who's right and who's wrong, this is not the movie for you. We arrived early at the cinema and on hindsight I'm really glad about it, because it meant that I finished my Ben & Jerry's before the movie. When the movie started I just forgot to eat my popcorn. I've been crying for at least half of the movie. Mind you, it was not some romantic girly movie. With romantic girly movies I don't forget to eat.

The story is fascinating, intricate, and the characters realistic and well played. The only significant flaw is the score, which sounds like something Bernard Hermann would have written for Alfred Hitchcock or Brian DePalma (""Obsession"" comes to mind). Perhaps that was the intention, as the film does bear some resemblance to Hitchcock's ""The Thirty-nine Steps."" If so, it just did not work for me because the pace of the images on the screen did not match the pace of the music, the former being clipped and the latter meandering.<br/><br/>The acting was simply excellent. I couldn't get over Carice van Houten's resemblance to Debbie Reynolds. At times she would turn her head a certain way and, wow! Astonishing! Good work by hair and makeup!<br/><br/>It was also kind of fun (sounds odd, I know) to watch a new World War II spy film. I think it would have worked as a film during the 40s, too, removing the ""R"" scenes and shooting it in black-and-white.<br/><br/>Anyway, I give the film a 7.75 rating. It makes for a nice afternoon at the movies. Enjoy!"
"Galina_movie_fan","4","11","18","25 January 2008"," ""We will kill that girl! However, wherever, whenever.""
","After having read great amount of high praised reviews and comments about Paul Verhoeven's historic WWII Drama /Spy/Thriller, ""Black Book"" which he made in Netherlands, I was exited to see it. I am a fan of Verhoeven's early films set in his native country. I've seen ""Turkish Delight"" (1973) and ""the Fourth Man"" (1983) and I found them both excellent. Joe Ezsterhaus who worked with Verhoeven said about him: ""The guy is like his movies: brilliant, mercurial, very daring, perverse, a wonderful series of paradoxes and contradictions..."" Both, ""Turkish Delight"", Verhoeven's variation of Hollywood ""Love story"" and ""The Fourth Man"" which reminds ""Basic Instinct"" but with much more class, style, and humor, match Esterhaus' description perfectly. As for ""Black Book"", it was a disappointment. Don't get me wrong, Verhoeven's attempt to make a film which takes place during the dark times in the Holland's and European history is watchable and entertaining. Beautifully filmed and moving along quite fast, ""Black Book"" is the story of a Dutch Jewish girl who tries to survive the war and the Nazi occupation in Holland. After the failed attempt of her family and dozens others Jews to escape on the boat to the liberated south which left her the sole survivor, she was able to join the Dutch Resistance, to infiltrate the regional Gestapo headquarters and to become the mistress of the Gestapo high rank officer, Ludwig Müntze (Sebastian Koch of ""The Lives of Others""). Verhoeven's gets a fine performance out of his young star. Carice van Houten, as Rachel/Ellis carries the movie mostly by herself. She is beautiful, talented, brave, and convincing in every scene. I personally don't mind the scenes of graphic sexuality and violence - anyone who is familiar with at least few of Paul Verhoeven's films, should be prepared for raw sensuality, aggressive movie-making, and more than one revolting scene. The problem of the movie, IMO, is that it tries too hard to combine many different stories and many genres but makes too many obvious and deliberate historical errors for the entertainment purposes and ends up as the unrealistic, exploitive, over-wrought melodrama with the poorly developed key characters (above mentioned Muntze, for example) and too many unbelievable thus ridiculous plot twists. If you are interested in not just entertaining but more serious and subtle films exploring Holocausts, I'd recommend Agnieszka Holland's ""Europe, Europe"" (1990), Joseph Losey's ""Mr. Klein"" (1976), and certainly, Roman Polanski's ""The Pianist"". If you want to see a film about disturbing relationship between a Nazi officer and a Jewish girl, two people who had met at the most horrifying circumstances but were not able to forget each other, see Liliana Cavani's controversial ""The Night Porter"" (1974) which is much classier than Verhoeven's movie."
"imdb-17435","6","4","5","17 February 2007"," entertaining, but a little overdone
","slick, expertly shot adventure in occupied Holland, typical Verhoeven style. Good acting. But, the script is a little over the top, and it rattles. All the events in the film (well, most) happened in Holland during these five years, and some events more than once, but not to one or two people and not within a few months. Difficult to accept that the chief of the SD does not really know or care what kind of torture is going on three floors below his office every day and can still be a nice guy that you can easily fall in love with as a Jew girl. And there are more of these ""constructed twists"".<br/><br/>And to be fair, OliverFranks, if you read up on your history the Dutch in WW II were really not that different from people in other occupied countries. Collaborators, some, people earning a few (or more) guilders by dealing with the Germans, some, people trying to get by without getting into trouble (most) and people resisting actively (some)or passively (many). The scene where executed resistance workers are being dug up in the sand dunes near the Hague are not really Verhoeven's imagination. Dutch people turned Jews in for a reward of a few guilders, and they also hid them risking their lives. Dutch policemen actively helped the Germans find resistance workers and other Dutch policemen risked their lives helping resistance workers with uniforms, guns or by active support. Verhoeven tries to demonstrate that history is not black and white, and overshoots, as is his style. The Dutch were not ""good"", and they were not ""bad"". They were a people in extraordinary circumstances, that cannot be judged collectively, as we should not judge the Germans, or the English or the Jews collectively, but by their individual deeds. Verhoeven ""fault"" is not inventing heroes of scoundrels, it's squeezing so many of them into one persons life. Just think of this film as entertainment, nothing more. It helps."

","I thought the film was brilliant in its portrayal of ordinary people caught up in an extraordinary situation. The subject of Blackbook is certainly controversial as it is until the end rather unclear who the bad guys really are. We would all like to think that the war was black or white, either you were a hero as a resistance fighter or you were a traitor and a collaborator, of course the Nazi's are always the bad guys. This film challenges that view. As a Dutch person living in Britain, with one side of the family who resisted and the step family who collaborated I could not resist this film, but it is uncomfortable watching in some places. Full marks to Sebastian Koch and Clarice van Houten for their portrayal of the main characters.

"daves1412","10","5","7","6 February 2007"," Very strong film with classy acting performances and action to keep your attention
","Although Paul Verhoeven became somewhat discredited in his later years in Hollywood, his work has always contained a touch - or more - of irony. In some cases this seemingly extended to attempting reverse psychology on Republican supporters - as in Starship Troopers and Robo Cop. Of course, it didn't work.<br/><br/>So for his return to the Netherlands, this film was a surprise. Its lasting sensation is one of melancholy: how can a species which creates such beauty and love also create so much sadness and horror? Irony is in there, yes. But it's used with a much more delicate touch as a tool to search for something deeper.<br/><br/>Through tracing the best and worst of what people can do in a period in which everything is apparently senseless, Paul V and his scriptwriter are trying to look for the core of what it to be human. For that, I think it is a good film. This, not Babel, should be a candidate for the Best Film Academy Award - at least best foreign language film.<br/><br/>The acting is strong, too. In particular the heroine is not only breathtaking in her beauty and charm, she has also put together what I believe is one of the best acting performances I have seen for a long, long time. No artificially puckered brow, no 'actoooor' persona, just straight communication of emotion and more. The other players are also solid - all the main Dutch and German characters are well played, with particular credit going to the lawyer - a wonderfully ambiguous performance.<br/><br/>It works on many levels, too. For the more superficially inclined there is plenty of (well shot) action, pulling few punches. There is also plenty of intrigue for whodunnit lovers. And of course, there are some very attractive actors who clearly enjoy expressing their sensuality on (and I gather, off) screen."
"KiltedGreen","8","5","7","5 February 2007"," Black, white and grey
","I thought this was a really good film - although I was born after the war from what I've seen in footage of war since it captures well the horror, violence and senseless death that war entails.<br/><br/>We use a sense of good/bad (crudely speaking) to frame what goes on around us and this show what happens to that moral compass in times when daily life simply pulls the rug of normality right out from under our feet. People don't know who to trust - enemies seems like friends, friends become enemies, one death becomes less important than another, one life not as valuable, love can seem cruel. All these conflicting situations are superbly portrayed here, in the pressure cooker of the Resistance hideaway where everything is on permanent tenterhooks and certainties become a grey fog at times.<br/><br/>The acting is very believable, and Carice van Houten is superb in the lead role being vulnerable, single-minded, alluring and strong. Someone else felt that she seemed unconcerned by the death around her, but I feel that the pace of the film doesn't allow time to show that, although she shows clearly at one point the release of the horror and disgust she's been keeping the lid on. In a time of war, it must be hard to find a balance between being compassionate and yet not letting your emotions rule all your judgements so that you become ineffective.<br/><br/>Although it looks like a true 50s film in its depiction of the period, it's bang up to date in the way it's filmed - the bombs dropping are frightening, the gunshots sickening and the randomness of death in wartime brought horribly to life. This is a modern 21st century production and it shows, which makes it all the more gripping. I was amazed to find when I left the cinema that it had been such a long film as I'd been grabbed by it from the start.<br/><br/>Well worth seeing."
"R-J-M-Nijman","4","22","44","22 October 2006"," Verhoeven should not have come back to Holland for this
","Dutch director Paul Verhoeven left the Netherlands some 25 odd years ago because him and his movies were perceived as 'perverse' and 'dirty'. At least that's what his reasons were according to his '95 Razzie-acceptance speech, the award he was given for Showgirls. As far as Zwartboek goes, I think he should have stayed in the States, concentrating on what he does best: Verhoeven-style SF like Robocop, Total Recall and most notably -in my opinion- Starship Troopers, for awarding this movie with an average of '8' at the IMDb-votes is a flat-out insult for other movie(maker)s.<br/><br/>Zwartboek claims to be a -somewhat politically incorrect- World War II story about a Jewish girl whose hiding address gets bombed, joins the Dutch resistance, stoops a few German officers to spy at the Nazi HQ in Amsterdam and saves the f-ing day. A fictional story, but Verhoeven nonetheless makes it seem this is what Holland looks like in 1944, post D-day. A country where a Jewish girl can apparently walk about town as if no war was going on and no Jews were (still) being deported to Nazi death camps. Where a Jewish girl can show her (beautiful) legs when passing German Soldiers. Where a Jewish girl can walk into a notary's office, show a picture of her rich parents and walk out with some 50.000 guilders 'spendingmoney'(roughly equals 30.000 US dollars or 200 grand in 2006-currency). Where a Jewish girl not only can infiltrate a Nazi Headquarters, but also sleep with a high SD Officer, sing at Hitler's birthday party and have access to all kinds of information regarding her imprisoned and soon to be executed resistance buddies. Likely? Not very.<br/><br/>Zwartboek won several 'Golden Calfs' (Dutch Oscars) at the Dutch Film Festival in Utrecht, including 'Best Picture' and 'Best actress in a leading role' (Awards that should have gone to Warmerdam's ""Ober"", by the way). Carice van Houten plays her part wonderfully, no comment there, just not very convincing. That lies in the plot however, not in her acting (with a bit of luck she might be landing an important role in a major motion picture in Hollywood some time in the near future). It's just that she does not stop smiling and singing in this movie. Consider a Jewish girl whose cover has been blown, whose parents and brother are subsequently killed, whose newfound buddies are in extreme peril (being captured by German soldiers and all..), that sleeps with a SD officer, sings and dances with the Nazi pig (as he is portrayed) that killed her family and is betrayed by those same newfound buddies. And then picture a beautiful young girl that does not stop smiling..<br/><br/>Verhoeven's (partly self-written) picture, however fictional, tries to create a factual image of almost postwar (excusez Le badly chosen mot) of late '44 Holland in an Jewish-heroin-war story, but ends up as a highly unnecessary sensational popcorn-epic that misses every convincing aspect. I shall not go into detail, but about every 4 minutes of this 145 minute feature contains very unlikely events, effectively ruining the conscious movie-goers viewing pleasure. An insult to the WWII movie archives."
"ira_onderwater","8","9","15","30 September 2006"," Verhoeven sets things straight
","I saw 'Zwartboek' last week and I was actually pleasantly surprised. The Dutch review I had read wasn't really good and I'm not particularly a fan of Paul Verhoeven. I don't think his 'Soldier of Orange' is that good since has so many stereo-types, the good Dutch fighters and the bad Germans. But 'Zwartboek' is Verhoeven's way of settings things straight. In the Netherlands we've been long aware of the fact that more people were collaborating with the Germans than people were resisting them and now Verhoeven has shown that in a movie as well. It's clearly a movie that makes you understand that no one is all right or all wrong, it's always grey and never black and white. Someone suggested that Verhoeven was influenced by the current war on terrorism and the war in Iraq because a German officer in this movie talks about the Dutch resistance fighters as being 'terrorists' but this is in fact actually what the Dutch resistance was called by the Germans. It just shows that the word 'terrorist' is never objective. The acting in this movie is really good, especially Carice van Houten, who has received praise for her performance everywhere. However it really is a 'Hollywood-movie' which is not really surprising since Verhoeven has spent the last 20 years in Hollywood and this movie had the largest budget ever for a Dutch movie. But don't let that keep you from seeing this movie 'cause it's still a very moving picture that shows the true horrors of the Second World War whilst at the same time it makes you understand the difficulties of right and wrong in the war."
"gunneman-1","9","8","13","20 October 2006"," Verhoeven is back with this great WWII thriller
","In Holland this film is hyped, just because it's the first of Verhoeven since returning to this country. If you judge this film by it's content, the hype is completely justified. It's an action packed, thrilling ride where the plot twists and turns where you don't expect it. Star of the movie is Carice van Houten, who blows you away in every shot. Although some scenes might seem a bit far fetched (but hey, it's a movie), the power lies in the scenario. It stays away from the easy good vs evil, resistance vs nazi's stereotypes. On both sides there are good and bad guys making good or bad decisions. Go see it if you have the chance, it's different from anything you've seen before."

I hesitated to give this movie an 8, but I disliked the scene with Theo Maessen, Marcel Musters and a crowd of carnivals people. (why suddenly throw a pile of well-known actors in one scene ?). The scene ( copied from the Brian DE Palma movie ""Carrie"" ) was totally unbelievable, misplaced and overdone. The misbehaving people were punished and discharged immediately by a Canadian officer that walked in exactly at the right moment. Is this for the American market ? All the bad people were punished. The last scene in the Kibboets was also unbelievable. As far as i know there never has been attacked a kibbutz. <br/><br/>Nevertheless I liked the film but was not really touched by it."
"mentalcritic","10","6","9","21 July 2007"," I have seen the best film that will ever be set in World War II...
","and it is called Zwartboek. Rather than recap the plot and point out a few details that make it so great, I will simply focus on the things it does better than others. I am an extreme fan of Paul Verhoeven, of course, so the man can almost do no wrong in my eyes. However, for the sake of understanding why Zwartboek moved me to tears at times whilst other World War II films had me stone-faced and unimpressed, one must contrast it with not only other films of the genre, but other films in general. First, however, let me get the most gushing praise out of the way. I knew Zwartboek was going to be a good film for Verhoeven, being that it seems to show him learning from all the mistakes of the past twenty years while purging the demons that drove him to make them. What I was not expecting was the best film I have seen since RoboCop. Where one shows a younger Verhoeven adjusting to the quirks and idiosyncrasies of a very different film industry, the other shows him as a master fully in control of his art.<br/><br/>Now, onto the reasons why Zwartboek is the best thing I have seen in twenty years. There are a few films that have attempted to use diabetes as a plot device in the past. Thy Neighbour's Wife and Memento are easily two of the worst recent examples. Zwartboek avoids their mistakes by bearing in mind that killing someone with insulin requires that someone's trust, even if it is gained through deceit. It also requires a larger amount of insulin than shown in most films where this device is used. Zwartboek shows a bit of a hint at just how much (five milliliters might be fatal, by comparison the largest standard syringe used for the purpose of injecting insulin has a capacity of one milliliter). About the only place where Zwartboek departs from reality is the rapid onset of hypoglycemic symptoms and how little our heroine eats to counter the attack, but these points can be explained away by complex factors. Verhoeven has shown the right way to portray diabetes in Zwartboek.<br/><br/>Another problem with the vast majority of World War II films is that the good guys are shown as so very good and the bad guys so very, very bad. Zwartboek, like Soldaat Van Oranje, shows that there were good Dutchmen as well as bad Dutchmen before taking the bold step of showing that there were also good Nazis and bad Nazis. Sebastian Koch shines in his portrayal of what we see at first as a very bad Nazi until understanding of the situation and political backstabbing motivate him to take up the cause of good. But it is a scene in a prison for accused collaborators after the war is over that will be burned into my memory forever. For the most part, Verhoeven has shown us heroic Dutchmen who resisted the occupation in any way they can, but then he turns our perceptions right on their head by showing how they celebrate their victory. Carice Van Houten acts with a grace and dignity throughout the film, but it is when her character's own countrymen are dumping the camp's filth upon her that Houten really shines.<br/><br/>In contrast to most of Verhoeven's films, Zwartboek is mostly told in flashback. But it is the scenes set over a decade after the end of the war that really seal the deal. When we are first shown Rachel, she is an ageing teacher in a school within a camp located in what the audience would presume to be the Israel of the 1950s. We are given some hints that the war has caused her to grow old well before her time, but it is not until we see her again at the end of the film that we fully understand. As she leads her family back into the camp to the sounds of sirens, and we see soldiers lining up behind wire fences, we see Verhoeven's most subtle and effective use of symbolism ever. Yes, Leonard Maltin, Verhoeven knows WHEN to be subtle. What one takes from this scene depends a lot on what they take in before they see it, but to me, it symbolises the fact that no matter where Rachel goes from now on, she will always be in some way stuck in the Netherlands of 1944.<br/><br/>Like all Verhoeven films, Zwartboek is bloody and graphic. People are shot, stabbed, beaten, tortured, and sometimes all of the above. Paul Verhoeven has said previously that his goal is to be completely open in how he films a story, and Zwartboek is one of his most open films to date. Without the MPAA or American political system breathing down his neck, the honesty Verhoeven brings to Zwartboek reinforces the tragic nature of the story. The film also contains what would have to be the single most *subtle* death Verhoeven has ever portrayed on film. Yet, in the mind of the intelligent audience that he is catering to, it comes across as also being one of the most gruesome. In this day when directors attempt to shock us by severing ears without giving us a context (or a realistic amount of blood for that matter), Verhoeven's honesty and educated approach is king. In a way, the symbolic scene I just mentioned also symbolises how Verhoeven apparently remembers World War II, and he is utterly unflinching in demonstrating how that affects him to this day.<br/><br/>Zwartboek is the epitome of a ten out of ten film. Once, I told a relative that if I were offered a dollar to let Verhoeven adapt one of my writings into a film, or a billion to let Peter Jackson do the same, I would choose Verhoeven every time. Zwartboek is a perfect demonstration of why."

","Greetings again from the darkness. Just a wonderful film with enormous amounts of energy, suspense and intrigue. Director Paul Verhoeven has had his career ups and downs - ""Basic Instinct"", ""RoboCop"", ""Showgirls"" - but here he is at his absolute best in creating tension in so many scenes.<br/><br/>The script is brilliant (supposedly based on actual events) and takes us on a wild ride and proof again that power is dangerous, causes strange bedfellows and most of all, breeds distrust ... even amongst those on the same side.<br/><br/>Set at the end of WWII, the film feels real and the sets and props are outstanding. Even the violence and scenes of torture are painful to watch. Carice van Houten is brilliant as Rachel/Ellis, the Dutch lady who joins the resistance in order to seek revenge on those responsible for her family's brutal massacre. Ms. van Houten has a real spirit and fully captures the intricacies of the role. Sebastian Koch (Muntze) and Thom Hoffman (Akkermans) are both excellent ... the latter reminds of the intensity of the ""old"" Russell Crowe.<br/><br/>It is a rare film that combines an emotional roller coaster with a spy thriller. ""Black Book"" succeeds on many levels and is truly superb film-making."
"oneloveall","6","7","11","21 September 2007"," EuroWood
","Decadently indulgent when romanticizing it's entertainment factor, Paul Verhoeven comes back from the abyss to present this mini-epic, showcasing an action-packed, erotically-charged, plot-twisting ride packaged as an adult spy thriller, taking place during the holocaust in Holland. As escapist entertainment the film should work wonders, especially for the adult female demographic that should particularly appreciate an intricate spy-thriller fused with a heated romanticism. Anyone trying to take this elaborate (for dutch standards) production for more then the classy popcorn muncher it is may have a hard time holding back the laughs however. In a demanding lead, Carice van Houten certainly does not bomb, though definitely lacks the charisma and depth to portray the elaborate characterization as it was written. Instead, (as the wise pairing of Verhoeven would suggest) Black Book becomes premier fluff; the rare semi-classy, though devoid of sincerity, mainstream entertainment which can be a guilty pleasure even for some film cynics. Of course such well constructed glossiness would be imported, despite America's death-grip on the form."

","Let's play a game: you're a well-known Nazi commander hiding out in the Netherlands, 1945. The country is free and the other Nazis are fleeing the ship like a pack of hydrophobic rats. You're in uniform, and you're carrying a gun, and I guess we accept the fact that you're stupid enough to walk into the middle of a parade of Dutch nationals championing the overthrow of everything you stood for, because you've renounced Nazism and you're trying to save a Jewish woman from harm, and maybe you're naïve enough to think that everyone in the street is magically aware of this. Suddenly, a faceless someone tries to assassinate you and escapes into the throng. What do you do? A. let the guy escape, on the grounds that any attempt to pursue him will invite the attention of thousands of people who want you dead, or B., decide it's a good idea to fire your gun in the air, hoping to clear a path through the crowd, and apparently forgetting that doing so will make you the center of attention of every single person in the square.<br/><br/>Those who picked A are part of that sad minority of moviegoers that expects this film to make a modicum of sense. Sorry to say, you'll be a trifle disappointed.<br/><br/>Rachel Stein (Carice van Houten) is a young Jewish darling living in the Netherlands during the Second World War. After falling in with a wing of the Dutch Resistance, she uses her fair skin and blonde hair to pass herself off as a gentile. Under the direction of Hans Akkermans (Thom Hoffman), a charismatic resistance leader with secrets of his own, she sleeps her way into the favor of Ludwig Müntze (Sebastian Koch), an oxymoronic Nazi-with-a-heart, whom she intends to assassinate, but eventually adores.<br/><br/>When the movie isn't hitting you overhead with a plot that's shoddy enough for a baby to attack, it's bombarding you with nudity and stylized violence at a level that redefines gratuitous, and if my opening citation is the most offensive example of the story's stupidity, there are plenty of others to go with it.<br/><br/>Take the ill-fated escape of Akkermans, the not-so-surprising villain. The whole plan rests on his ability to successfully play dead in a closed coffin, which strikes me as something of a no-brainer, but is apparently too tricky for the party in question. Akkermans panics at the first sign of trouble, bangs on the roof of the coffin, and shouts, ""what's going on up there?"" loud enough for the whole vengeful world to hear. And we're supposed to believe this guy? Give me a freaking break.<br/><br/>Speaking more generally, I'm sick and tired of how rarely we encounter movies where the female spy-character relies on some other method beyond sexual seduction. Ang Lee's Lust, Caution was a much better film, but did nothing to break the pattern. Again and again, in spy movies, detective movies, and stories of espionage, male characters rely on their wits and fortitude while the women whore themselves off to gullible sex fiends who frequently steal their hearts. Are we really so backward that even our most respected directors must continually commodify the woman as we know her? And is our situation really so entrenched that I can't even raise these kinds of question without feeling like I'm mowing over finely cut grass? ""Yes"" to both 1 and 2, and a resounding thumbs down to the movie in question.<br/><br/>Or maybe not quite.<br/><br/>In the last four or five minutes, the film gets unexpectedly mature, perhaps the only reason why I rated it as highly as I did. Had Verhoeven handled the ending the way he'd handled the rest of the movie, Rachel would have shot all her enemies to pieces and walked naked into the sunset, but somehow or other, the filmmakers came to their senses and took the realistic outing. The heroes get their revenge . . . and they're left with nothing but bitterness. There's no sense of redemption, no closure of any kind. This is precisely the kind of ending a war movie needs.<br/><br/>On an added note, The Black Book wisely avoids a tenet all too common in Holocaust films: the assumption that anti-Semitism magically disappeared with the fall of the Third Reich. In Verhoeven's film, the war ends and the hatred keeps thriving. Rachel trades in Nazi persecution for persecution by the gentile Dutch. Like any victim of war, her suffering is timeless, universal. Much like this movie might have been if Verhoeven directed from somewhere above the waist."

When you know that the man character is shown a decade after the story line how dramatic are the life and death situations she finds herself? How many coincidences can you introduce into a plot line, apparently quite a few. Too many of the characters seem to be weak caricatures. Would a Jew who had had everyone she knew killed by the Nazis fall in love with one? I love it when the they use the old ""All we need to sneak into the enemy's headquarters are floor plans, a set of their uniforms, and someone to leave an unattended door unlocked. I did not find the Canadian Col.'s submission to the demands of the SS general/POW at the end believable at all. I love it when the bad guys put off the execution until the next day instead of just killing them on the spot. Did the Nazis always follow the rules of execution so strictly? Who would have known? By the way, chocolate and insulin don't work that way. And why not put the main Nazi hero in the correct uniform? Wasn't it amazing that both sides always seemed to know about plans of the other side? I like nudity as well as the next person but didn't the director seem to be a bit pandering? How do you figure they decide when to have another nude scene in a movie like this? What was the reason for making the Dutch farmer so mean to the main character he was risking his life and his family to hide. That was pointless. I hate the ""old hero having to evade the bad guys on the train"" plot line. Been there done that. Did anyone notice the hero attempting to escape the perusers by running upstairs in a two story house bit? How about the missing microphone cable about one minute into the movie. Watch how they deal with the cable when the bus speeds off. Amazing how you find a treasure trove of jewelry and the very item that your father had given you conveniently appears on the top of the pile. Sure women in winter coats and shoes can swim underwater and evade capture by soldiers shooting at close distance. Wow, I was really worried that she would not be able to attach the secret microphone in time as the bad guy telegraphed his entry.I loved how there were lots of people out in the streets only when the war was over, a they were all skipping with flags no less. How smart of the main character to dye her pubic hair but somehow forget to retouch the dark hair roots on her head. Boy what bad packers those Brits were. They just dropped guns and insulin and microphones out of planes with hardly any concern for breakage potential. Did you notice the cheesy part at the end where the Israelis were rushing to the kibbutz fence to defend it from some threat? Very nice."

Cheap escapes every 10 minutes and sequences of actions with absolutely lack of self-consistent. Trying to be complex on the human aspect (the bad could be not so bad and good guys could be the bad) but so poorly carried that almost all the characters became in a caricature. If you want to see a movie of the kind that this one want to be please see ""Army of Shadows "" from Jean-Pierre Melville. Or if you like big productions see The Pianist from Polanski. If you want a fashion romance war movie start with Casablanca and continue through all the classics. Even you can see the English Patient but this one. Is really strange the over-rating."

","Paul Verhoeven is a great and experienced director. Although this movie had a modest budget camera, music, lighting and acting; it's all excellent. Also the screenplay is well thought out and there is plenty of sex and violence, so it's all very entertaining and exiting. The movie takes two and a half hour and that maybe a bit long for this type of movie, since it keeps up a very high pace. Furthermore Paul Verhoeven has tried to throw in some links to the present day political situation which perhaps he shouldn't have, in my opinion the movie didn't need it. Also in the movie there is a farmer who gives shelter to a Jewish girl and he is portrayed as a very rigid, cranky man, while in reality farmers saved many, many people during the war and weren't that moody. Still an excellent WW2 movie."

","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>A boatload of wealthy Jews are slaughtered without mercy while making a secret journey to safety escaping the Nazis. What's special about this atrocity is that their valuables are stolen from them by an unknown German commander. One of the survivors is Rachel Stein (Carice van Houten) who witnessed the slaughter of her parents. Now hellbent on finding the guilty party and bringing them down, she joins forces with fellow resistance member Hoffman (Hans Akkermans) to infiltrate the Nazis after gaining the attention of Commander Muntze (Sebastian Koch) where she learns the man behind her parents death is higher up the ranks than she thought.<br/><br/>Plenty of older directors still hack away in Hollywood, but Paul Verhoeven seemed to have disappeared off the face of the earth after 2000's Hollow Man. But out of nowhere he reappeared with this smaller scale, more independent offering set during World War II.<br/><br/>It has an unusual feel for a Verhoeven film. Gone are his trademark uses of excessive/gratuitous sex/violence/language used to punctuate an intelligent and observant story and instead we have a standard wartime thriller that could have been done by Stephen Spielberg with twice the budget. It has a more mature feel to most of his other stuff and stands out for it. You get the feeling this may even be more of a personal film to him, maybe. It's a gripping and suspenseful thriller with plenty of neat twists and turns to keep you riveted to the end. Plenty of films deal with wartime persecution from the Nazis to the Jews, but this casts a light on a different idea, that that some may have been killed and robbed, with those pretending to be resistance sympathizers setting them up for a very nasty fall.<br/><br/>Performances wise, in the lead role, van Houten carries the film strongly as the bereaved/vengeful Stein and her undercover personality Ellis De Veres. She has a great double act with Hoffman as her male partner and James Gandolfini lookalike Waldemar Kobus has presence as the burly officer behind her parent's death. Koch, who I recognized from the brilliant The Lives of Others, delivers an equally solid performance as Muntze, the commander with a tough exterior that hides a sensitive and sympathetic nature that gets him to see the evil of his cause.<br/><br/>The strangest Verhoeven film you'll ever see, but also a solid and compelling wartime thriller that perfectly justifies the lengthy running time. ****"
"Argemaluco","10","5","8","30 April 2007"," A great film
","After a great career of almost 25 years making low budget films with a lot of fascinating ideas(like Spetters or Soldier of Orange)in his natal Netherlands,director Paul Verhoeven moved to USA in 1987.I consider his career in USA also excellent (with the exception of Hollow Man).He made fascinating films with an extraordinary energy and with excellent scripts.The films were very economically successful but the people in general could not understand the satire Verhoeven put to that films.The films I'm talking about are Robocop,Basic Instinct and Starship Troopers.But,after the economic and critic failures of the criminally underrated Showgirls(I still defend this film)and the mediocre Hollow Man,Verhoeven backed to Netherlands maybe,to escape the pressure Hollywood gave him and to go back to his land.And,Black Book is the spectacular result of that decision.Black Book is a magnificent film.This film is a perfect combination between the traditional war films of the 50s with the sensibility of the modern epic films.This film took the classic formulas and it gave them new life.Obviously,Verhoeven did not want to do a typical war film where the Nazis are the villains who are defeated by the hero.His intention was to show the analysis of a real situation in which,sometimes,the villains show more humanity than the hero.Black Book is a lot more than a very fun adventure during the World War 2.The difficult decisions and the questionable ethic of the characters make of Black Book a complex and fascinating film.Black Book is a great film:it's enormously fun,it has excellent ideas,it does not have the solemnity this kind of movies have,it's complex,fascinating and,the best thing of all,it leaves the spectator thinking.All movies should be like this one."
"dominic_alderson","10","5","8","24 January 2007"," A fantastic, authentic glimse into the constant fight for human survival.
","Paul Verhoven has created a masterpiece - The actress in the leading role was stunning and her performance completely captivated me mind and soul. The language, the sets, the costumes - everything came together to make a excellent portrayal of life under Nazi rule during WW2. Constantly we're asked to question whom we can trust, who may in fact be a traitor, we are are forced to see how vulnerable humans can be and at the same time how cruel and wicked we can be. The sexual nature of the movie also helps to reinforce this, and make us as an audience feel guilt and shame - plus it certainly intensifies the mood. The film is unbiased and doesn't follow stereotypes - after the nasty work of the Nazis, we are treated to a scene of the dutch and other allies mis-treating those deemed traitors - it beckons the question, are we all the same at heart?. The film shows us that no matter what the cause there are good and bad people in all walks of life. A good German officer, and a poor one - a good spy, and an evil selfish resistance fighter. We are also treated to what in my view seemed like a political statement on Verhoven's behalf... after everything war goes on and the cycle turns again - in this case its the scene at the end - Palestinian/Israeli war. A nice edition! Paul has made an excellent movie and I will definitely be there for his next! It's also nice to see a movie about the dutch resistance during ww2 for a change! If Verhoven has left Hollywood for this kind of material - then more directors should follow! - Freedom to the artist only proves how fantastic cinema can truly be."

","By definition all Resistance movies have things in common. Almost invariably there will be a set-piece in which the Resistance in question break into the local Nazi stronghold to rescue anything from one to half a dozen prisoners, then there'll be an account of the day-to-day life in an Occupied country, arrests, beatings, torture, etc. Black Book throws in another wrinkle more at home in cop/gangster movies - it is, in fact, being played out right now in 'The Bill' a long-running cop show on British TV - the one where someone goes undercover, infiltrates the enemy camp and falls for the 'target'. Black Book is a fine example of the genre but we have to ask ourselves is it possible for a film about the Resistance to eclipse Jean-Pierre Melville's definitive 'L'Armee des ombres' and the answer is, of course, no, but that didn't stop, for example, Lucie Aubrac, which ran Armee a close second - and both titles featured Resistance members penetrating Nazi headquarters to rescue comrades. On the other hand if we MUST have another Resistance saga then this is as good as anything that ISN'T L'Armee des ombres; if you can get over the slightly unbelievable charmed life of the heroine played by Carice Van Houten as a sort of Candide without the innocence who, time and time again and against all the odds survives intact whilst all around her are being slaughtered then you're almost certain to enjoy this lengthy saga. Van Houten has, somewhat ludicrously, been compared to Scarlett Johannson but leaves Johannson dead in the water both as a beauty and an actress and Sebastian Koch is equally able as Nazi turned love object. There are twists throughout so that several times you assume it's over only for yet one more turn of the screw. So long as no one mentions it in the same breath as L'Armee des ombres this is highly entertaining."

","It's one of those movies I expected the least and surprised me the most, and it's always such a delight when it happened. This is one of the best movies I've seen in 2007. I didn't realize it's in Dutch till later (I thought it was a German movie because I recognized one of the actors from 'the lives of others', another favorite of mine in 2007). With no familiar faces in the movies, it has the look and feel of old classics. It's almost a pitch perfect movie except I personally felt the last 30 minutes could be a bit more taut. I have been avoiding Nazi/Jews movies in the past few years because I've seen so many and am tired of that kind of depressing stories, but the human conditions and emotions in this movies are so universal and relevant it drew me in. It's depressing, thrilling, and uplifting at the same time. There is no black and white morality in it and it is respectful to viewers' intelligence. It has the most memorable and lively and strong female character I haven't seen in movies for years. Many people compared this movie to 'Lust, Caution', I haven't seen it but already know it can't be better than this one, even I'm a big fan of Ang Lee. I wish people could pay more attention to good film like this, instead of honoring pretentious and melodramatic craps like 'atonement' that sort."
"hristodoulou","8","3","4","12 July 2007"," Highly Entertaining!!
","Holland 1944. The Second World War is in it's final years and Rachel Stein (Carice Van Houten), once a famed Hollywood Jewish songstress, now finds herself hiding in Holland from the Gestapo. After a gruesome massacre of her family and friends, she endeavours on a route as a resistance fighter and spy for the Dutch, eventually falling in love with head Gestapo of the time, Ludwig Muntze (Sebastian Koch). This affair brings out frightening truths within the German and Dutch camps that Stein and Muntze must now face.<br/><br/>Paul Verhoeven's first film back home in Holland after 20 years in America, sees him making a film that many have considered 'a return to important film making'. After all, this is the same director that brought you Basic Instinct, Robocop and Starship Troopers. Taking into account the topics that are introduced (I mean come on, a Jewish girl falling in love with the head honcho Gestapo of Holland ouch!) he always maintains it as 'exciting entertainment' and that's the brilliant thing; this film could have easily been bogged down in political correctness and the pretentious fabeling of a romanticised war period. Instead Verhoeven delivers a fast paced war thriller that never runs out of steam in its two and half hour trip.<br/><br/>All the actors are fantastic but Carice Van Houten is scorchingly brilliant as Stein. She brings an honest, sexy and tragic portrayal that should see her in many more non-Dutch films in the future. The production values are all top notch (especially for a Dutch film) and it's refreshing to see a war period piece which isn't aligning itself with modern day hyperactive editing that has become common place. <br/><br/>I would have liked to see more of the relationship between Stein and Mutze but this really is only a minor flaw in an otherwise great entertainer. All in all, if you're after an important, stroke your goatee in ever consuming thought kind of movie, this isn't for you. If you want complete escapism from a war movie WHILST munching on those crisps, then give this a whirl!"
"okrim37","8","3","4","25 June 2007"," welcome back, Paul!!!
","I always admired Paul Verhoeven's movies. He has been one of the most prominent dutch directors; during the seventies and the eighties thanks to his films the Holland gained a lot of attention in the movie scene. In 1987 he directed ROBOCOP, his first movie produced by Hollywood studios. The success of the feature encouraged him to stay in USA. He spent almost 13 years in America, where he directed some very famous, controversial and successful movies, such as TOTAL RECALL, BASIC INSTINCT and STARSHIP TROOPERS. With his cleverness and boldness he showed us it was possible for a director to work in the Hollywood system without renouncing to his own visions and to his own favorite themes; his movies speak about the violence and the conflicts in modern society. After THE HOLLOW MAN (2000), a rather lucky and kinky updating of the classic THE INVISIBLE MAN, Verhoeven decided to stop with the Hollywood blockbusters. In fact the movie, despite great special effects and a riveting music score by Jerry Goldsmith, didn't satisfied his director. During the years he cherished a lot of project, but he also took the main decision to leave the United States and to come back working in Neatherland, resolute to accomplish movies that were nearer to his own poetics. The first result of the new period in his career is BLACK BOOK (ZWARTBOEK), a movie he wrote with his longtime collaborator Gerard Soeteman, in which he tackles a quite delicate matter: the Nazi occupation of Holland during the Second World War. The director said he thought about to make this film for many years, so it's definitely meaningful that in the end it became the movie of his return in the native country. A very successful return indeed, if we consider BLACK BOOK was in competition at the last Venice Film Festival, it received good reviews, it was almost nominated for the Oscar in the best foreign language film category and in Holland it attracted crowds of people in the cinemas. The story, like many times in Verhoeven's career, provides a female heroine, confirming the interest of the director in featuring strong women portraits (even if he quite often has been accused to be sexist and misogynous!) and it's about a Jewish girl, Ellies/Rachel (the sexy, pretty and talented Carice Van Houten, a dutch actress much appreciated in her country, who deservedly could have her international breakthrough thanks to this film), who lost her family while they were leaving Neatherlands to save their own life. After that tragedy Ellies decides to join the resistance fighters, the main mission that they entrust her is to become the lover of a German officer (Sebastian Koch that you can see also in the much awarded THE LIVES OF THE OTHERS), to extort as much informations as possible. But the girl falls in love with him, who is not a bad person at all, in spite of being a member of Nazi army. In the meantime she discovers that the truth concerning her family's tragic death is connected to the title black book, and she'll see it's not an easy task to understand to whom she can trust...even because in wartime people who wants to survive is disposed to do everything, even to change opinions (symbolic in this way the role of Rachel's friend, played by Halina Reijn) and to betray, no matter what... Choosing a Jewish person as leading character, Verhoeven reminds us the tragedies the Hebraic people lived during the first half of twentieth century (at the beginning of the film we see Ellies hiding herself in a garret, just like Anne Frank), but the director fairly isn't interested in easy dogmatism's: he doesn't want to distinguish between good and evil, or murderers and victims. That's because he thinks the matter is much more complex and you mustn't indulge in generalizations when you speak about the war. His detractors said he's a revisionist, but it will be more apt to recognize the sprightliness of a man, able to give us an ethical lesson about history and the way to deal with it. The fact he teaches us following the rules of the classic movie masters (the influences of Hitchcock and Aldrich are noteworthy) is a kinda value, and the spectator can't do without notice Verhoeven didn't lose the skills to use the suspense (let see the sequence in which the girl is trying to put a microphone in the enemy's office, wonderful display of space and rhythm by the director). And I'm quite happy to realize he didn't stop to be a scoundrel guy either (try to see the scene where the girl dyes her pubic hairs admonishing his friend, and the public with him, to not peer at her, not before to showing us the operation in full frontal). However it's not sufficient to say BLACK BOOK is a great film about history, because Verhoeven doesn't lose the occasion to speak also about the present: when Rachel is tortured you can think about Abu Grahib's prison and also riveting is the last sequence, set in an Israeli kibbutz, built with the money recovered from the Nazi. We see the protagonist, now married and with a child, we can think she's happy now, but the alarms show us a different reality that tears aside the image of apparent serenity. There's no peace yet for the Jewish people: another time, another place, but again the tragedy of war, and again Verhoeven doesn't want to say who is good or evil, who is guilty or innocence. For this and many other reasons: well come back, Paul!"
"ipekbay","8","3","4","30 May 2007"," tremendous!
","This movie should be placed among the cults related to tragedy of Jewish people during the WWII like ""Schindler's list"", ""Pianist"" and ""Life is beautiful"". It presents the Dutch perspective from the angle of the Jews and the resistance fighters, also accompanied conflicts of interest between them from time to time. There is love, hate, revenge, betrayal, courage, fight, adventure, everything about war, but the most important thing is the scale of the events is not too large to grasp, and you can easily establish empathy with the woman character. Carice Von Houten is a beauty; I can never think a replacement for her. Highly recommend this movie. It will nail you down. The movie can be distinguished from the other black-white-grey war films by its colorful nature and very few scenes over humiliation of the Jews whereas the drama expressed by all means."
"Desertman84","10","4","6","7 December 2011"," Black Book Deserves To Be Called Greatest Dutch Film
","Filmmaker Paul Verhoeven returned to the Netherlands after more than twenty years of success in Hollywood.This time,he directed this epic- scale war drama based on a true story entitled,Black Book.It is a World War II film about a young Jewish woman in the Netherlands who becomes a spy for the resistance after tragedy befalls her in an encounter with the Nazis.It stars Carice van Houten, Sebastian Koch, Thom Hoffman and Halina Reijn. Apparently,the movie was co-written by Gerard Soeteman together with Verhoeven.<br/><br/>The plot revolves around Rachel Steinn.She is a beautiful Jewish woman living in German-occupied Holland during late 1944. Her family members - who have been falsely promised safe passage to Belgium are instead robbed and slaughtered by the Germans on a premeditated basis as Rachel herself manages to escape by diving into the water and swimming away. She narrowly avoids capture, then joins the local resistance movement. With her hair dyed blonde, she can easily pass for Aryan, and when the leader of the Dutch resistance movement learns his son has been captured by Axis forces, Rachel is asked to use her feminine charms to persuade a German commander to arrange for the boy's release. She soon finds herself caught up in a dangerous double life as she becomes a sexual plaything for the Nazis while attempting to bring down their evil empire as a spy. <br/><br/>Blackbook is one film that is hard-core with raw violence, intense action, graphic sexuality and a twisting plot that offers a series of surprises.Despite of that,it remains one entertaining melodrama.Verhoeven's film is out of character considering it is tasteful and artistic as based from his previous work.But nevertheless,he manages to pull through as he was able to provide intriguing characters that are morally complex and ambiguous like Stein,who are ordinary people were forced to do extraordinary and even awful for the sake of good of the world and change in the course of history.It also presents a tale of courage and determination in a espionage thriller.Aside from Verhoeven,credit also should be given to Carice van Houten for her excellent performance as Rachel Stein.She was able to provide an intriguing character that was a human being who has her own moral strengths and weaknesses that the viewer could empathize and relate to for she is far from being a heroine figure-types that are expected in these genres of films.It was stated that this Black Book was considered the greatest Dutch film ever made.There is no doubt in my mind that it not pure hype and it truly deserves this credit."

(Well perhaps Gunter Franken is a bit the stereotype, but even he plays piano and sings) Some characters are more transparent than others, but so it is in life. One will doubtlessly figure out some of the twists in advance, but somehow that only makes the others more impressive.<br/><br/>Even our heroine has a bit of a dark side, one that she doesn't fully understand.

At many scenes you will be wondering what is going on. Exciting and thrilling are keywords. But don't expect a real thriller or suspense with amazing twists. The twists and turns that are in the movie are not that original but the way Verhoeven brought it to the screen does make you wonder a lot of which direction it is heading. But the main attraction of this war movie has to be Carice van Houten. This actress manages to pull you in the story. She brings an intensity to the screen that only a few actors and actresses are able to do. You will love her and care for her.

Anyway, I'm glad I took the plunge.<br/><br/>Much has been made of the constantly twisting plot, so I'll try not to go into to much except to say that it's nice to watch a film where, you have to think while you watch. Much has also been made of the scene in which Rachel/Ellis dyes her pubic hair. Some say that it is over the top and unnecessary, while I agree that it is over the top, I think that it is a necessary scene because it shows the lengths Rachel must go to just keep her 'head above water'. The acting is universally superb, and as such I found myself being totally immersed in film which would have normally left me cold.<br/><br/>Overall this is a brilliant film which bravely tackles a very difficult subject in a complex, yet subtle and thought proving manner.

"Andy-296","8","4","6","19 June 2007"," Very entertaining film from Verhoeven
","Director Paul Verhoeven returns to his native Holland after more than 20 years (his last film there was 1983's The Fourth Man) and the result is a cinematic treat, probably his best film since Robocop. Both outrageous and exhilarating, Black Book tells the story of a Jewish singer (the excellent Carice Van Houten) and her improbable travails in occupied Holland during World War II. After spending a great part of the occupation hidden by some anti-Semitic farmers, her hiding place is bombed by the British towards the end of the war. She decides it's time to reunite with her family and escape with the help of some dubious people to allied-liberated Belgium. But there is an obvious betrayal during the escape and her whole family (along with other refugees) are killed by the Germans (she escapes miraculously by jumping into the water,007-style). After that, she joins the resistance, and a series of improbable situations occurs. When the son of one of the resistance leader is arrested, she is encouraged to seduce the German SS bigwig (whom she had met earlier on a train) so as to install a microphone inside the Nazi headquarters and help the resistance liberate the young man (the idea of a Jew becoming a lover of a high Nazi officer is, of course, highly offensive to many; the Nazi, by the way, is played by the fine actor who was the playwright in The Lives of Others). Many improbable things happen after wards, with incredible turns of events to the story happening at about every ten minutes, punctuated by deadly shootings between the Nazis and the Dutch resistance. The movie is 2hours and 25 minutes long, probably half an hour too much (it should have ended when Holland is liberated and she receives a less than stellar reception). It's impossible to take the movie very seriously (the movie claims to be based in true events, but this is almost certainly not true), but is extremely entertaining, and it shows Verhoeven at the top of his game."

","Rachel is a young Jewish woman in Holland during the World War II occupation. She is in hiding with a farm family, hoping to avoid being sent to a concentration camp. However, the farm is bombed and she loses her hiding place. Knowing of a lawyer who is helping Jews in desperate need, she goes to him for money and advice. He tells her of a midnight barge that shuttles Jewish people to a safe territory. Late at night, Rachel meets up with the others, including her parents and brother, to escape to better circumstances. It is a trap. Everyone is ambushed and killed, with only Rachel making it out alive, by diving into the water. Finding and joining a group of resistance fighters, Rachel dyes her hair blonde and changes her name to Ellis. Her first assignment? Get ""close"" to one of the SS officers and use her influence to end the executions of captured resistance fighters. In danger at every moment, Ellis tries her best. But, what other turmoil lies ahead? This is a fine movie but hardly an easy watch. Based on fact, the story of the Dutch resistance is one of hope amidst chaos and death. Rachel/Ellis showed tremendous courage in the face of evil and the actress playing her part is wonderful. The other cast members are equally fine, with special mention for the gentleman playing the SS officer. The sets, costumes, and production values are high, re-creating the wartime atmosphere with attentiveness. Be warned, however. Although it is not excessive, this is a harrowing tale of survival, with torture and death around every corner. Also, many resistance fighters were compelled to kill the enemy, making for painful and guilt-ridden memories. For those who are faint of heart, the film may be too much. Yet, if you want to experience history as it was, and LEARN from it, this is a great movie. If only it could be shown to those in war rooms across the globe. Surely, anyone who witnesses this account of man's inhumanity to man would seek peace straight away."

","Like The Lives of Others, the absorbing European war thriller Black Book again certifies that massive FX need not be the major ingredient of a popular filmHollywood take notice.<br/><br/>""So good is his re-creation that he forgot to infuse his leads with enough character to make me care. In fact, so intent is the director on re-creation that he forgot creation is the essence of successful art."" That's what I said about Steven Soderberg's Good German starring George Clooney and Cate Blanchette. I say just the opposite about Paul Verhoeven's Black Book, a similar WWII story about nasty Nazis but set at the beginning of the end of the war, 1944 rather than 1945. Verhoeven's set-design recreation is faultless, but unlike Soderberg's, this one's in the service of well-developed characterization and a humdinger of a plot.<br/><br/>Although Blanchette could be remembered as a wily woman surviving to get out of Berlin in Good German, the Dutch Carice van Houten simply cannot be forgotten as a Dutch Jewish singer, Rachel/Elis, trying to escape German-occupied Holland, a serious resistance fighter willing to sacrifice her body to stop the Holocaust. Along with her is the memorable Sebastian Koch from Lives of Others as Ludwig Muntze, a leading Nazi with a conscience. The ensemble reminds me of Casablanca's stellar quality in every character, major or minor.<br/><br/>The weaknesses of the film cannot overshadow its strengths: Plot twists are overripe, although I suspect people on both sides of the betrayal game trying to save themselves were not uncommon in 1944. Ellis's uncanny ability to survive in all the lurid carnage is surpassed only by Mata Hari, WWI's exotic dancer spy.<br/><br/>Black Book satisfies an audience's interest in a tumultuous past, its thirst for engaging intrigue, and its search for acting of the first order.

The two moments that are most discussed are the full-frontal genitalia shot and the bucket of shite scene. Both are shown graphically when they could have been implied through reaction shots. Verhoeven claims to be following in a tradition of Dutch realism, but it seems to me he should be making documentaries. Why create a fiction and then puncture it with heavy-handed shock tactics? The naked shot would have been sexier if blocked around the male actor's reactions. The shite shot would have been more appalling if we only heard rather than saw what happened. Our minds can imagine more extreme emotion that filmmakers can compel. Verhoeven standing with a megaphone shouting: ""Go! Be aroused!"" or ""Go! Be disgusted!"" does not do it for me.<br/><br/>The plot twists and turns and is over-cooked, the acting is above average, the score is overdone and intrusive. People arguing about historical accuracy is laughable: Anyone who decides to bone up on the Dutch resistance by watching a Hollywood movie shouldn't be let out alone.<br/><br/>All in all, the in-your-face OTT style that works so well for the director in Total Recall is ungainly in this setting. If you want sex, intrigue and Nazis mixed in the perfect blend, check out Gloomy Sunday."
"Chris Knipp","7","6","11","15 April 2007"," Schlockmeister goes home and redoes WWII
","Verhoeven apparently means The Black Book/Zwartboek as a reply to his 1977 film about the Dutch resistance, Soldier of Orange, which he now considers too heroic and unironic. He says this time he was trying to show ""Your enemy can be better than you think and your friends can be much worse than you think;"" but this generalization shows the level of subtlety he achieves in this movie isn't very high. A real black book is supposed to have existed but not been found. It was a record of collaboration with the Germans by some elements of the Dutch resistance. The title also apparently refers to the dark side of the resistance that Verhoeven thinks he's conveyed; but pretty early on his film turns into a glitzy, episodic adventure movie that seems like a pastiche of many other war movies we've seen before but with a perky, sexy young Jewish woman playing Mata Hari added in.<br/><br/>The Black Book doesn't reduce the Holocaust to lightweight comedy the way the blithe and clueless Roberto Benigni did in his Life Is Beautiful. But it does something just as bad: it makes Nazi persecution of the Jews and European resistance into a carnival of sex, explosions and betrayals. That this is an elaborate and expensive production doesn't keep it from being carelessly conceived and ultimately uninvolving. Verhoeven's heroine, Rachel Stein/Ellis de Vries (Carice van Houten), isn't someone who grimly survives as a wraithlike shadow living in a dark, war-torn world, like Wladyslaw Szpilman, the real-life character Adrien Brody plays in Polanski's moody, harrowing The Pianist. Rachel's more like Solomon Perel, the youth (also a real person) played by Marco Hofschneider in Agnieszka Holland's Europa Europa. Solomon was a Polish Jew in Germany whom we see escape a Nazi pogrom and stay alive through a series of deceptions that include joining the Komosol in Russia and later becoming a member of the Hitler Youth. Europa Europa is a breathless adventure that thrills with the way its hero barely escapes danger. It makes sense as a movie because it's the story of a boy young enough to seem free of responsibility. He's an appealing picaresque Jewish hero (cp. Jerszy Kosinski's faked autobiography, The Painted Bird).<br/><br/>But Rachel is grown up, and it's surprising how blank she is as a character. Rachel is even bolder than Solomon, but as an adult, she never stops to question what she's doing, though at some point she must seem as confused and mistaken as the boy collaborator in Louis Malle's Lacombe Lucien. Verhoeven, who became an expatriate schlockmeister in Hollywood in the Eighties and Nineties, has made Rachel's story not so much a personal odyssey as the basis for a veritable carnival of surprises and double-crosses involving German officers and Dutch resistance fighters, the two major ones all-too-similarly resulting in the mowing down of a little mob of ostensible good guys -- first a boatload of Jews escaping the country, then a group of resistance fighters who break into a Gestapo prison to free their brothers and find out they were expected . Escaping past German soldiers early on in an emblematic shot, Rachel bares her legs to them; to escape detection a little later, she enters the train compartment of a high-ranking Gestapo officer and charms him by admiring his stamp collection. A singer before the war, she is all show business and sexual favors. Her Gestapo boyfriend realizes she's Jewish the first time they have sex even though as we're ostentatiously shown, she's bleached her pubic hair to fake blondeness. Somehow she manages to stay at headquarters and sing at a party for Hitler's birthday. This boyfriend, SD officer Ludwig Müntze, is played by the charismatic German actor Sebastian Koch, who was the admirable, but politically conformist, playwright in the East German spy story The Lives of Others. Koch has some of the looks and easy machismo of a Gregory Peck, and his Gestapo man is never seen doing anything but make love to Ellis and try to prevent the execution of captured resistance fighters. Müntze is certainly a new revisionist conception: Nazi officer as adorable hunk. The Gestapo bad boy duties are entirely taken over by two other officers, the shaven-headed opportunist General Kaütner (Christian Berkel) and Günther Franken (Waldemar Kobus, my favorite actor in the movie), who is in charge when the boatload of Jews get mowed down and is a delightfully confident villain who's also a good whistler. Later the members of the resistance who are evil are duly (and dully) revealed; the main one was quite obvious all along because he had such a nice face and such a key position.<br/><br/>As Nathan Thrall wrote in The Jerusalem Post, The Black Book ""manages to be simultaneously cloying and relentlessly sadistic. Its bombastic, brass-heavy score and glossy production clash with the somber message Verhoeven aims to convey. But above all, it is the film's tireless Hollywood pacing that makes it feel less like a suspenseful World War II film than a World War II thriller."" Verhoeven claims that his Hollywood years gave him a stronger narrative sense that informed this new European-made movie, but the shadow of Robocop, Basic Instinct, and Showgirls hovers; and ""narrative sense"" means shallow characters and fake atmosphere backed up by corny movie music. Black Book has this much in its favor that's non-Hollywood: it features a host of competent European actors speaking the appropriate languages (mainly Flemish and German). The movie is conventional and shallow even in the poor execution of its hasty bookending that depicts Rachel teaching in a kibbutz and visited by one of her collaborator girlfriends in 1956 at two moments that hover ambiguously between a romanticized image of idyllic settlers and a final shot, evidently signaling the Suez crisis, when the kibbutz is seen surrounded by guard towers like a prison yard. Yes, as one viewer said, ""the story never sags."" But the thinking never rises to an adult level."
"jzappa","9","7","14","18 April 2007"," One of the Greatest Films I've Ever Seen
","Carice Van Houten, an actress I've never seen before in a film, delivers one of the finest performances I've ever seen. One of the most beautiful creatures and most fascinatingly deep actresses I've ever watched, she as the heroine practically makes the movie what it is. Her character is very well-developed in the film's writing, to what I imagine is a highly personal extent, and to see her keep her feelings constantly in check, act under great pressure, show such self-reliance, and feel so heavily at once, not to mention sing so beautifully, is riveting to see.<br/><br/>Paul Verhoeven is a director whose films have always interested me on account of the inextricable edge, something he cannot help but give all of his movies, even those he's made in the American mainstream like RoboCop and Basic Instinct. He is an artful director, but does not thumb his nose at bald representations of immorality, evil, ruthless violence, and also completely casual exposure to sex and genitalia. This does not make him self-indulgent or partial to shock value as many would think and as many directors are. What this makes him is a director who does what artists must do, and that is take chances. He is an unflinchingly bold filmmaker.<br/><br/>The window into Verhoeven remains fogged. After 35 years and over a dozen films, the analytical outlook on the Dutch filmmaker should've by now congealed somehow or other, nevertheless, as with fellow agitator Brian De Palma, to mention him in cinephile crowds is still a capricious thing. Arguing masterpiece or monumental bomb for Showgirls and Starship Troopers is just the corner piece of Verhoeven's discordance. What keeps Basic Instinct and RoboCop from being acknowledged by so many ""serious"" critics as the crackerjack works they are, on the other hand, isn't so much their standing as Hollywood thriller aerobics as their unapologetically turbulent manner, the persistent madness on the screen pushing us into wondering if he's for real. Yes, Verhoeven is for real, and never more so than when confronting religion. The visualizations of rapture and hellfire in The Fourth Man are too animal to be deconstructed into a crafty gag, while beneath the medieval raping, looting, and salivating of Flesh + Blood are eruptions of Christian images.<br/><br/>What I shouldn't do here is beat around the bush about the cinematic style and how well-made the movie is, which I tend to do a lot because I happen to find production values and a story with depth and weight very important. What I should do is simply state that this film happens to have a lot of things that I always, without fail, enjoy seeing. The plot is loaded with revenge, intricate plots, sneakiness, impostors, and other such relative things. The screenplay is wonderful overall and, despite how much I know that American audiences will enjoy it, I believe that America could hardly produce a film so founded upon characters that are truly unpredictable in their stances as good or evil. The movie itself is of course anti-war, and the heroine is a woman even Satan could sympathize with. However, it also relies on a lack of conservative scrupulous judgment on the viewer's part. Sebastian Koch plays an SS officer whom Carice Van Houten's character must seduce in order to infiltrate the group of Nazis that have massacred her family and other Jewish refugees. But can the audience feel sorry for him? Can we recognize that there is a true individual beneath his politically horrendous exterior? Black Book scores as high as a movie possibly could in all of its departments, because the filmmakers have an honest, naked perspective on humanity and the truth about good, evil and that which is in between. And because of this, its characters are completely real and intensely affecting, its surprises are genuine to our intelligence, and we are fully engrossed. It's one of the greatest films I've ever seen."

As the story starts she finds herself on the run, in the need of finding new shelter.<br/><br/>From there the film keeps rolling. For 2.5 hours, without ever stopping for a pause. Its grim nature doing the work very well, keeping one locked to the screen until after the ending credits roll by. A film that is filled with all the prime emotions - light and dark. And a film that with that works out very well.<br/><br/>Acting is superb, characters are likable and dis-likable enough to make the watcher a part of the story - and one that wants to see certain people live and certain people die.

"pfgpowell","4","6","12","21 January 2008"," Undemanding, lazy potboiler for undemanding, lazy people
","I came across Black Book after reading somewhere that after his post Robocop and Basic Instinct decline into absurdity, Black Book marked a glorious return to form for Paul Verhoeven, And needing a DVD to watch and coming across Black Book at £3 in an Asda (the UK's Wall-Mart) bargain bin, I thought 'why not?' Well, I should, perhaps, also have asked myself just what a movie - the most expensive Dutch movie ever made, no less - was doing languishing in the bargain bins less than 10 months after its release. I suspect you know where this is going. I had, in fact, only ever seen Robocop of Verhoeven's earlier films and had rather liked it's satirical touches, although on reflection it hadn't quite been the satire I had thought it to have been. Black Book made me ask myself: when we watch a movie, exactly what is it we want? Simple entertainment or something greater? Well, often, of course, it's simple entertainment. Despite all the 'auteurs' and the 'homage' we 'serious' film fans are supposed to pay 'auteurs', there also has to be time out when we can set aside the quest to investigate the human condition for an hour or two, grab the popcorn and settle down to watch a little undemanding nonsense. And why not? Yet when a movie chooses to deal with what was one of the most shocking and tragic periods of recent European history and which, furthermore, directly acknowledges the most horrific aspect of that time, the wholesale slaughter of millions of Jews, quite apart from also touching upon such ultra-sensitive areas as the degree and methods of the Dutch resistance and the collaboration of other Dutch with the Nazis, including the betrayal of fellow citizens for venal gain, it is surely fair to expect that movie to rise a little above the status and ambitions of 'undemanding nonsense'. But, to his shame, Paul Verhoeven never even tries to. He is quite content to churn out a large-scale potboiler, and one, furthermore, whose script is surprisingly lazily put together for a movie with this kind of budget and apparent aims. It would be tedious and boring for both you, the reader, and me, the writer, to list the script's many, many flaws and inconsistencies. I'll simply remark that Verhoeven and his co-writer were not in the slightest concerned with producing a truthful and honest tale. All they wanted to do was to make sure 'the action' roared ahead at breakneck speed and that you and I were given no opportunity at all to question the plot's many twists and turns. So: if 'undemanding nonsense' is your thing, packaged with a spurious mystery and a little, tho' not much, trademark Verhoeven soft porn, this is the film for you, available at your nearest supermarket bargain bin. If, given Black Book's painful and tragic subject matter, you want a movie which takes both you and itself seriously, forget it."

"David_Frames","5","7","15","16 May 2007"," Schindler's Fist
","It's the counter factual rambling of movie loving drunk; what if Paul Verhoven, the dutch director of such big-budget exploitation fare as Robocop and Showgirls, and not Hollywood master Steven Spielberg, had abandoned his commercial comfort zone to make Schindler's list  his personal war project? Though such a thing may seem more Verboten that Verhoven, it is nevertheless now a reality. The man who would have put an invisible rape into cinemas if the MPAA hadn't stopped him has returned to his homeland to front a $40M exploration of the Netherlands under Nazi occupation and if we're surprised that the result is so straight-laced, fans should know that the old pervert isn't going to let something as undignified as the conduct of the Dutch under occupation put the brakes on his pet obsessions of sex, nudity, bodily fluids and gratuitous violence.<br/><br/>This, at least in the mind of the director, is the Basic Instinct helmer's think piece. You can rationalize this as the surrender to inverted snobbery. After all, Robocop is a thoughtful piece of work  no really  plenty to say about what being human actually means, the bleed of corrupt corporations into national institutions, etc.. but you don't win many plaudits for melting a man in a toxic waste dump or shooting a rapist in the groin. What gets you credibility, particularly if you're Paul Verhoven  the only man to collect his Razzie, is something a bit more worthy and that means historical drama with European backers.<br/><br/>The return to Holland was rationalized by PV as essential for the film's dramatic and tonal authenticity  a European cast adding a polyglot polish to a impressively mounted recreation of the occupied territory and to begin with it's a sober, carefully paced affair, detailing Carice van Houten's plight as a hidden Jew living with a Dutch family under an assumed identity. When the barn where she spends most of her time is bombed, her I.D card is discovered by the Germans and she accepts an offer for her and family to escape by boat to Belgium. Unfortunately, in the first of some pornographically realized sequences, the Germans are waiting for them and slaughter the family with close up machine gun fire, the girl narrowly escaping and subsequently joining the Dutch resistance to gain revenge on the Nazis.<br/><br/>As it goes on however, Black Book's tone starts to feel a touch confused, the cinematic equivalent of a beaten wife trying to reconcile her love for her abusive husband. The script, co-written by Verhoven with Gerad Soeteman, is content to paint its plot in very broad strokes. It relies on a fair amount of contrivance and unusually for a film that has pretensions of seriousness, airport lounge novel plotting  the kind you'd expect in a Hollywood thriller but not in a film that has one beady eye on the non-English speaking European market. PVs time in the US has certainly given him ample opportunity to indulge in his love of excess and his time in America has left an indelible signature on his method. A certain amount of Hollywood blowback is evident here, so during some sequences, for example the scene in which the resistance attempt to free their captured comrades from a German base, it's almost like watching a Nazi version of Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves only not quite as much fun.<br/><br/>It's a strange fugue; yes that's right fugue, of continental fastidiousness and old fashioned pulp espionage plotting with the overall package not entirely satisfactory for either the Dutch destroyer's audience of gore whores and masturbators, or the subtitled set that might have expected something more subtle and less predictable.<br/><br/>As befits a Verhoven picture, it's confidently realized and well staged stuff but as you might have expected, as subtle as a naked man in a girl's school. The Dutchman is no Spielberg and can't reign in his penchant for breasts and blood. It's widely known that squib making families eat for a year when Verhoven is in town and true to form the violence, through sporadic, is graphic and abruptly rendered. The sex too is vintage Verhoven, painted pubic hair, fondled mammaries and a great riff on the 'is that a gun in your pocket are you just happy to see me' line. None of this adds much to the story of course and only serves to highlight its lack of depth and the simplistic take on wartime morality and its complexities  the good German solider and the bad Dutch resistance fighter. There's probably a myriad of fascinating stories about such things but Verhoven may not be the man to tell them.<br/><br/>They'll be letting James Cameron make a film about the Titanic disaster next!"

","""I don't believe that people should spend their time flying on dragons."" – Paul Verhoeven (on Avatar)<br/><br/>Here's a bit of trivia. Whilst preparing ""Eyes Wide Shut"", Stanley Kubrick had several long telephone calls with Paul Verhoeven, asking for advice on how to shoot nudity. Kubrick considered Verhoeven to be one of the few directors who shot nudity well, and valued Verhoeven's advice.<br/><br/>On the flip side, Steven Spielberg convinced George Lucas to let Verhoeven shoot ""Return of the Jedi"" based on Verhoeven's film ""Soldier of Orange"". But Spielberg quickly backtracked his decision when he saw ""Turks Fruit"" and ""Spleeters"", saying that he found all the casual nudity repulsive. ""They probably thought I'd have the Jedi fking!"" Verhoeven laughed in an interview.<br/><br/>The point is, different people respond to Verhoeven's sensibilities in different ways. You're either in tune with what he does, or cringe at how trashy he can be.<br/><br/>In any case, whether you like it or not, three things leap out at you whilst watching ""Black Book"". The first is the acting by Carice van Houten. Capturing a weird mixture of fragility and assertiveness, she essentially plays a Jewish girl who must sleep with Nazis in order to save her countrymen. <br/><br/>The second notable thing is the sheer pace of Verhoeven's film. The film isn't taut, so much as it's blunt. Things happen at a feverish pace, as is common in commercial film-making, but they're garish and extreme things, pushed almost to the point of ridiculousness<br/><br/>The third interesting thing is director Paul Verhoeven himself. ""Black Book"" has a sexuality and frankness that Verhoeven seems to revel in. Close ups of genitals, abrupt violence, toilets, feces, nudity and dark humour...it's all very refreshing in todays PG-13 climate.<br/><br/>In lesser hands, this vulgarity might seem exploitative, but Verhoeven's ""nastiness"" for once feels entirely justified; his frequent outbursts of horror and filth seem to suit what is really a tale of deplorable and base human beings.<br/><br/>Like most Verhoeven films, ""Black Book"" is also unashamedly melodramatic. Yes, Verhoeven isn't one for subtlety, but here his characters are all morally complex. There's the Jew who falls in love with a Nazi, a Nazi who bargains with Dutch resistance fighters in order to lessen bloodshed, a fiendish plot to rob wealthy Jews, a resistance fighter who fights for himself and not his country, and an ironic twist in which the newly liberated Dutch resort to the kind of barbarism displayed by the very Nazis they despised.<br/><br/>8.5/10 - ""Book"" works as a romance, spy thriller, action movie, epic, character study and message movie. The film also ends with a brilliant shot which recalls the WTC shot at the end of Spielberg's ""Munich"". It's an elegant shot, filled with a genuine sense of darkness. While Spielberg simply says ""an eye for an eye makes everyone blind"", Verhoeven's coda is far more dour. Our hero's troubles aren't over and never will be. The sudden shift from World War 2 Europe to the deserts of the Middle East is also hugely poetic, raising all kinds of political overtones. One only wishes that Verhoeven held this shot a few seconds longer.<br/><br/>Worth two viewings."

I wanted to see it mainly because of Sebastian Koch who did a great performance in The Lives of Others. Extreme disappointment.

Some scenes of the movie I could not even take serious, which they were supposed to be (like the scene when a man called 'Van Geis' get killed by some guys from the Dutch resistance; the guy is finally shot down by a pacifistic boy who went nuts because Van Geis is making bad names of the by the boy beloved god....and this is just one of the many booze-gumping scenes).<br/><br/>In the Netherlands (yeah, I'm a Dutch guy) too much money get invested in horrible movies like Blackbook. Quality movies wont make it to the cinema because they don't get subsidized and promoted at all. We should take Germany as an better example of how to create quality movies which are also well promoted in other parts of the world. In doing so, go to the record shop and try to find the German produced Stalingrad (1993) (from the same producer of Das Boot). This movie gives a much better and realistic impression of the most horrible war in human history. Then you will see that this war was nothing more then a cumulation of the most gruesome things human kinds have done to each other; a war where was no place for romantic love situations as are shown in Blackbook."

","It seems clear to me that this is another Verhoeven film where people have totally missed the point. They have taken it as a simple WWII romance thriller.<br/><br/>On this level there were significant problems with Black Book, the cliché that the war is over but the atrocities aren't, with the head shaving of women who slept with Nazis, kangaroo courts etc. The plot-line gets silly, I mean I couldn't really have cared less who the traitor was by the end of the movie. It was also far too glossy, much better say Melville's Army of Shadows.<br/><br/>However I suspect there is entirely another level of commentary. I was reminded in particular of Verhoeven's movie Flesh + Blood, a gleeful study of amorality and the survival of the fittest. So the only character that interested me in this film was Ronnie (Franken's secretary). She was incredibly apolitical, a good-time-girl out for herself. As soon as the war is over she goes from being the squeeze of an SD capo to being the squeeze of a Canadian officer, as if there were nothing to distinguish them (and crucially she is not judged in this movie). That I felt, was the only part of the film which was Verhoeven to the core. It is no accident that the film really begins and ends with Ronnie, she is like a Red Queen prancing in between the carnage.<br/><br/>She is the only character in the movie who comes out unscathed, she just gets on with life. I think one of the points that the movie might have been trying to make is that the world is a lunatic asylum and trying to do what is right goes almost against the grain of existence and is so futile, that it is almost ruinous, far better to ride the back of the tiger (see how Ronnie cavorts with the soldiers who are pouring champagne all over her, immediately after her friend's arrest).<br/><br/>There is also Verhoeven's like of showing what powerful men are like in public compared to behind the scenes. In Zwartboek we are shown the butcher who is in fact a humanist, and the resistance hero who is in fact the darkest of profiteers. The scene where Akkermans attempts murder and then goes to the window to accept the acclamation of the crowd, looks totally ridiculous as part of the film but is very Verhoevian."
"imxo","7","3","5","26 May 2007"," A Very Good Film, But Ruined For Me In The Last 5 Seconds
","Why on earth the makers of this film decided to insert a not-so-subtle political message into the very last few seconds of what was otherwise a very good film is a complete mystery to me. It absolutely ruined the film for me. Instead of staying to watch the credits roll I just picked up and left, muttering ""how could they do that."" I haven't read any other reviews on these pages, so I'm curious to find out if anyone else had the same reaction. The scene is only a few seconds long, so maybe nobody else cares. Guess I'll find out.<br/><br/>The story line of Black Book is very interesting, if somewhat convoluted, artificial and overly coincidental. While the German military men are drawn too broadly - surely they can't all be Lumpen-Nazis, - at least members of the Dutch Resistance are given some depth of character development. They, of course, are at the heart of the story. Some of the Dutch are in the Resistance, some others are German collaborators, and most, I expect, just want the war to end. The dance between the amateurs of the Resistance who are trying to play the Germans and the professional Germans who are obviously playing the Resistance is very well done. Sometimes in the film it's difficult to tell who the good guys really are, but in war I expect there are no totally good guys.<br/><br/>While I did appreciate the story line, it is actress Clarice Van Houten who positively shines in the film. She brightens every scene. Halina Rijn was fine, too, but her part was relatively small. Unfortunately, for the male lead I'm afraid I'm pretty well bored with German actor Sebastian Koch. This is the second film I've seen recently in which he plays a ""sensitive"" German (the other film being the wonderful ""Lives of Others"" about the East German STASI.) If you like movies with a war and a counter-intelligence theme Black Book is for you. Not the best kind of its genre ever made, but certainly a film of much quality and substance."
"beattyg","2","8","20","25 August 2007"," Directors degradation
","The Lives of Others, The Downfall and The Pianist are quite exceptionally powerful yet subtle movies and then 'Black Book'comes along to undermine all prior intelligent thought.<br/><br/>This is a movie full of holes.<br/><br/>Was the directors usual proclivity for gratuitous violence, general humiliation and sad sex for all involved; hidden within the subject of war or was this subject matter way beyond his capability so he 'lost the plot'?<br/><br/>Whatever ones historical slant, to me, this was a thoroughly disappointing cinematic experience which cannot be packaged by overspending, miscasting, mediocre script and ham-fisted direction."
"p-elzinga7","1","15","44","7 April 2007"," the worst movie I've ever seen about World war II
","Something happens to Dutch directors when there back in Holland. They start directing s... again and they begin ranting about that Hollywood doesn't make real good movies anymore. Directors like Verhoeven kept their ideas of making their finest war-movie and telling the truth of Holland and the resistance.That it wasn't all that clear in the second world war we all know by now.The so called complicated truth about the resistance was in fact quite simple; we only didn't talked about it. Verhoeven doesn't realize that his truth in ""Blackbook"" (or soldier of Orange part 2) is irrelevant by now and if he wanted to make a contribution to history, he had to use a far better scenario, not ""inspired by true events"". About the movie. The acting was familiar in his amateurism, the music as if it belonged to some thriller that didn't make it, and the same old cast you remember so good from commercials and TV-shows. Please no more war-movies from Verhoeven and if you want to see a real good Dutch movie about this subject see ""Pastorale 43"" directed by Verhoevens former buddy Wim Verstappen from a novel by Simon Vestdijk."
"webmister","4","14","41","4 October 2006"," Big budget but neither vision nor story
","This movie is just as cheap, flat, vulgar and cliché as the Dutch movies from Paul Verhoeven before he left off to the United States. Which was kind of OK in the seventies. (Did we know any better? At least we hardly had any better.) But I expected this director to have evolved since then. He has not, not a single bit. And so yet again, all women characters are whores, and we get to see some nice tits.<br/><br/>I have evolved however, and seeing (yet another) WWII movie, 2.5 hours long even, without providing a single new perspective on the subject, was a totally depressing experience I cannot recommend to anyone.<br/><br/>The most ""tenenkrommend"" (toe-crunching) scene is with Theo Maassen, in an orgy of overacted anger and humiliation, so grotesk and over the top, you can almost hear Paul ejaculating behind the camera when the main character gets a bathtub full of human feces over her naked body...<br/><br/>Since Paul Verhoeven left Holland, there's a lot of talk about the ""grey history"" of World War II, in which most people were neither good or bad, but something in between. This movie flirts with that idea, but paints the same old caricatures in either black or white nevertheless, caricatures that are so familiar in Dutch cinema: the cruel Nazi, the brave Dutch. That someone from the resistance turns out to be a working for the other side (and therefore, in Paul's universe, is ultra ultra ultra evil), is the ""thriller"" part that carries the film, but that's not at all what ""grey history"" is about...<br/><br/>Oh, maybe the new concept is that there is actually a single ""good"" German officer in this movie. Well, bravo. But considering 61 years have passed since the end of the war, I am not impressed."
"Anonymous_Maxine","9","4","8","16 March 2009"," Smart war thriller from an international action veteran
","OK, so anytime I hear the name Paul Verhoeven I always immediately think of Robocop, which I saw for the first time when I was about ten years old and I never quite recovered from that scene where Murphy gets all shot up by the bad guys. It was a movie moment at a formative point in my life where I really learned the extent to which people can go in doing terrible things to each other (years later, I saw things like Texas Chainsaw and Wes Craven's Last House on the Left and The Hills Have Eyes and realized that I hadn't seen anything yet). Verhoeven began his American film-making career with Robocop, an enormously violent and hugely popular success, and began a career spanning nearly two decades of working on a lot of big budget Hollywood movies like Basic Instinct, Total Recall and the disappointing Hollow Man. <br/><br/>I wouldn't expect a respectable World War II film to come from someone with such a filmography, but Black Book is sort of a return back to Verhoeven's days as a filmmaker in the Netherlands, where he had a successful career before coming to Hollywood. It's becoming more and more difficult for people to come up with unique and interesting stories involving the widespread struggles against the Nazis in WWII. I would even suggest that it's becoming safe to say that a WWII film can be made or broken solely by the performances, which are becoming more and more the most memorable things about these movies because so much of the stories are already known. <br/><br/>In Black Book, however, Verhoeven's European film-making sensibilities mix nicely with his Hollywood experience to bring together a fascinating and even fresh, albeit fictional, story of a small group of people fighting back against the Nazis as the war slowly begins to go wrong for them. The title of the movie refers to a book that lists the names of wealthy Jews who pay handsome fees to be transported to safety, only the be killed and robbed be the Nazis.<br/><br/>The movie takes place in Holland in 1944. Carice von Houten plays Rachel Stein, a young Jewish singer living in hiding. She and her family come into contact with a man who claims to know a way to transport them all safely out of Nazi territory and into a neutral zone. During their night escape, however, they are gunned down and Rachel is the only survivor. She eventually joins a group of Dutch resistance fighters where she works menial jobs for a while before finally being promoted to a job of much higher importance and danger. <br/><br/>Her task  infiltrate the Nazi hierarchy and seduce a high-ranking officer, Ludwig Muntz and bug Nazi headquarters so the resistance can listen in on the Nazis war planning. Muntze is attracted to her and the seduction is easy, but Rachel fails to hide the fact that she's Jewish and, even worse, she ultimately falls in love with him. This all starts to sound a little cheesy, but it's actually one of the movie's strong points. I've read that the movie has been shrouded in some controversy, particularly in America, for having the audacity to portray a high- ranking Nazi official as anything other than pure evil, although I tend to doubt very much that any lack of deserved recognition that the movie found is probably a result of being filmed all in original languages. This was an artistic decision, not an economic one, and it was a smart one. Had they made the movie in English, a huge element of authenticity would have been lost. Indeed, portraying a Nazi official in a respectable light is a lofty goal but the movie pulls it off amazingly well.<br/><br/>And the authenticity of the movie is astonishing. It has all the polish of a Jerry Bruckheimer production but none of the stupid plot devices or cheap romantic subplots generated to drive the weak story. This is a stunning story of betrayal and total sacrifice in the face of insurmountable odds and adversity, and a brilliant cast arranges themselves behind Carice von Houten, who delivers a spectacular performance as a woman forced to bury intense emotions even while she strips herself of her dignity for the benefit of her oafish enemies. <br/><br/>The plot is too thick to explain in its entirety in a review, and it would also subtract from the fun of watching it all develop yourself. But there is real betrayal on the Nazi side and suspected betrayal on the side of the resistance that leaves Rachel and Muntze on the run from their lives, both of them fleeing from the very people that have been providing them with their safety.<br/><br/>There is also a powerful statement on the endlessness of war as the movie shows us that the killing doesn't always stop when the radio announces a victory for either side. It reminds us that after countless thousands of years or wars, human beings are no closer to world peace now than we've ever been. Paul Verhoeven has done something noticeably different with Black Book than we have become used to seeing from him over the last few years, but he has definitely turned around a worrisome direction that his movies started taking with Showgirls and bottomed out with Hollow Man. It's nice to see that Verhoeven has gotten his magic back!"

","So much about this film just does not ring true, and there are big gaps in the plot so that you come out asking yourself: but why did he/she do that or why did such-and-such happen? The answers may be there but who's got the energy to tease them out? It's the filmmaker's job to keep the plot lines clean and clear. I agree with other comments about the love affair between the Jewish woman and Muntze. It's beyond credibility that a woman who has seen her family gunned down in cold blood by Nazis would fall for one of them. However attractive Sebastian Koch may be! And Muntze's change of heart is hard to take. When he's first introduced to the film someone says 'He's the head of the Gestapo - has had hundreds of people killed' or words to that effect. Yet we never see that side of him - only the gentle, stamp-collecting, protector of the beautiful girl, mourning his dead family. It's an old-fashioned film, in the sense that it seems to be aiming for a thrill a minute and lacks the subtleties of plot and dialogue of recent quality films: European films like The Lives of Others, Downfall, and Hidden; or US films like Goodnight and Good Luck and Michael Clayton. It feels like it could have been made in the 1950s."
"Cloudmeister","9","4","8","17 April 2007"," Picture a cross between Schindler's List and Starship Troopers... if such a thing is humanly possible.
","For any self-respecting movie fan the words Directed By Paul Verhoeven are just about the ugliest and most blood curdling words one could imagine. This is a man responsible for such cinematic landmarks as Basic Instinct, Total Recall, Hollow Man, Robo-Cop, Starship Troopers and of course Showgirls. A man whose idea of subtlety involves full frontal nudity, excessive, perverted violence and a gratuitous two fingers to anyone who dares question him. He has been dubbed a pervert and is basically a walking controversy... in Hollywood that is. And here lies the key to the sheer greatness of Black Book: It is Verhoeven's first movie to be made entirely in his homeland of Holland since 1983. It therefore ranks alongside his previous Dutch-made movies Soldier Of Orange and Turkish Delight as one of his greatest movies.<br/><br/>It's a somewhat subtle and ambiguous movie (in particular the mixed and confusing portrayals of both Nazi officers and resistance fighters. Any pantomime-style cheers of hatred or disgust for the Nazis will most likely be followed by a ""Er, maybe not"", as will any cheers of support for the drab and corrupt resistance) and there are more double/triple/quadruple crossings than most audiences could care for, but it is an expertly crafted and beautifully acted movie. And of course it is a Paul Verhoeven movie so the expected gratuitous nudity, excessive violence and perverted degrading of central characters is very much present throughout the movie. Verhoeven is still a cheeky and explosively spontaneous filmmaker, so when you see human waste getting poured into a large vat you just know it's going to end up all over the lead character at some point. And yes, she's going to be half-naked at the time.<br/><br/>Altogether it's a very strange movie. Going in to the movie it's impossible to know what to expect and upon leaving the movie it's equally impossible to not to surprised, moved and maybe a little disgusted by what you've seen (it is after all, a very big bucket of poo). Picture a cross between Schindler's List and Starship Troopers... if such a thing is humanly possible. The message, if there is one, seems to be that the lines between good and bad aren't as clear as they would first seem. A message we've all heard before of course, but it's never been told quite like this."
"fertilecelluloid","9","4","8","14 April 2007"," Riveting, rousing cinema from a Dutch master
","Paul Verhoeven's first Euro flick in decades is riveting, rousing cinema. The sexy Carice Van Houten plays Ellis, a Jewish woman who goes undercover to, literally, infiltrate a Nazi stronghold in Holland. She befriends and seduces Muntze, a Nazi head honcho and poster boy for Dramatic Irony. Not only is the charismatic Muntz (Sebastian Koch) a card-carrying Nazi swine, he is also a keen stamp collector who is not unsympathetic to the Jewish nation. My threadbare synopsis barely hints at the splendid complexities of this magnificent, epic love story. Verhoeven has found the perfect dramatic vehicle in which to indulge his passion and preference for heightened drama, raw sexuality, and impactful, relevant violence. The film moves at lightning pace and is filled with unexpected twists and turns. The screenplay by Gerard Soeteman and Verhoeven is a model of economy and the lensing by Karl Walter Lindenlaub is superb. Van Houten is believable and stunning in her richly layered performance. A scene in which she is showered in feces is pure Verhoeven, as is a powerfully erotic moment when she dies her pubic hair blonde. ""Black Book"" is tight, terrific movie-making that feels like it sprung from the belly of the director's ""Soldier Of Orange"" via the vaginal canal of ""Turkish Delight""."
"Paul-Hesp","3","2","3","31 January 2013"," It wasn't like that at all
","I once knew a Dutch lady who as a young girl had lived through the Battle of Arnhem. Asked what she thought of the film 'A Bridge too Far' she said: 'It wasn't like that at all'. 'Zwartboek', a film on the theme of resistance and repression in the Netherlands during World War II, has an even more tenuous link to reality, although Verhoeven has invested heavily in making the thing look realistic: dialogues in four languages; lots of historic vehicles and aircraft; celebrations of the liberation modelled on colour pictures available from those days; soup kitchens with boys scraping out the food containers; the delectable Carice van Houten dyeing all her hair in order to become Aryan Ellis instead of Jewish Rachel. That includes her pubic hair, and here we get a glimpse (or two) of what Verhoeven really wanted to do with this picture: make lots of money. Which is fine, and not something most Dutch film directors are good at.<br/><br/>'Zwartboek' is not a documentary. But if you spend so much on recreating reality you might as well do it properly – I want value for money when I watch a film. Knowing a few things about pre-1960s planes I felt cheated right at the start: Verhoeven might have rented an authentic German plane to intercept the American bomber – they are available. Then, in order to gain height, the stricken bomber jettisons its bombs. Quite logical, but it would do that in one go, not as shown: one, just a splash in the lake two, a bit of an explosion right next to the little yacht carrying Rachel and a friend which briefly rocks the boat three – wham!!! There goes the remote farm in which she hides from the Nazis. These are on the spot in half a minute (I timed them), Rachel's identity card is found and the fun can start.<br/><br/>Some scenes in the film hit home alright. But there is just too much nonsense: <br/><br/><ul><li>A river barge is to take a number of refugees through the Biesbosch marshes to the safety of the liberated south of the Netherlands. This sort of thing did happen regularly towards the end of the war, but not on that (dangerous) scale and the skipper would (a) never have set out in broad daylight; (b) have made sure that his passengers were hidden below deck instead of lounging on top as if on a cruise. But of course that makes it easier for them to be shot, which happens. After a hit in the forehead the indestructible Rachel makes her escape.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Ellis and the rather nice Sicherheitsdienst officer (something of a contradiction) she will eventually bed for the sake of the resistance get friendly over his stamp collection! Well, this apparently happened in those days: I read somewhere that war-time US president Roosevelt seduced a woman that way. (Our heroine – a feminist touch - does the philatelic seducing).</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Why on earth would the baddie risk his life in the shootout in the cellar of the SD building? And why would the Germans have bothered setting such a risky trap when they could quite simply have blocked the coal chute of the cellar? (Likely answer: because then there would have been no reason for a shootout).</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The cauldron of ordure poured out over Ellis as a suspected 'Moffenhoer' (Nazi whore). It is a fact that those suspected of collaborating with the Germans were often subjected to inhuman treatment; but this is Grand Guignol theatre, Wagner from the sewers.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>I was soon laughing again, though. The near-final scene, where the baddie gets screwed (literally) in his coffin, was straight out of Polanski's 'Fearless Vampire Killers'. A real howler.</li></ul><br/><br/>I have known people who were in the Dutch resistance, who were imprisoned in German camps, who spent years in hiding. I am pretty certain that they would have found this film cheap, in spite of all the expense, and that they would have said: 'It wasn't like that at all.'"

","Zwartboek, among its many shining successes, does an excellent job of mixing conventional Hollywood film elements with a European, more specifically Dutch, identity. Nothing is cut and dry in this movie, everyone has blood on their hands, and everyone's motive's are believable even when leaning towards the psychotic, as would be the case with Mentze's Nazi rival and also the ""good"" doctor. The performances are all around excellent, with no exceptions or poor casting. Though I don't speak the languages used in the film (except for the smattering of English dialog) the subtitles were nuanced and hinted at what must be a first rate native script. The great conclusion left me sad, happy and everything in between, deftly reinforcing the relevance of WWII's aftermath and the fluidity of conflict that has eventually lead to many of today's headlines.

"hamsapsifu","Null","2","3","22 October 2007"," Good movie - not so good musical score.
","Loved the movie, although I have a few minor critical comments:<br/><br/>First comment: the musical score, its over the top and simplistic during some scenes, especially the scenes were Germans are looking ""sinister"". The music goes way over the top. Tip for Verhoeven, next time please don't work with Anne Dudley (composer), although I realize this was because it was a European production. Sadly Goldsmith/Poledouris are dead, but these guys were so much better. In case Verhoeven will make another movie in which he can hire any composer he likes, I would like to recommend Brian Tyler. His FRAILTY score is a typical VERHOEVEN score. Check it out, it oozes Verhoeven style, I think we will get one heck of a score if Verhoeven and Brian Tyler will work together. Perfect!<br/><br/>Another comment: The shooting scenes; not really realistic. The young ""religious, don't curse"" resistance guy...: he cannot act.<br/><br/>A few other things I really like though... you can see so nicely its a Verhoeven film. For example when the two Germans are fighting/strangling each other at the end, you can see how Verhoeven directed them to scream/fight ala Total Recall. It very nice to see, because Verhoeven is always acting these scenes out personally. (check out the Hollow Man DVD extra's) I really like to see his fight scenes. Also the scene where Mrs. Smaal got shot in the neck, its typical Verhoeven... her scream and blood spurting, all done in Verhoeven style! Also the scene with the fat German appearing in the bathroom was wonderfully disgusting! Very nice, that's what I like about Dutch movies, for example in American movies when a couple had sex, the female ALWAYS covers her bosom afterwards and the male always steps out of the bed covering himself up somehow.... hahaha so unrealistic. In Verhoeven's Dutch movies people just behave like... people. No silly bed sheet cover ups and stuff. I also like to hear (my native) Dutch spoken in movies like this one. It sounds great! 8 out of 10."
"arsenick","10","2","3","18 October 2007"," Black or dark?
","Both, I could say. Somme comments on this movie enhanced the ""50's movies"" style of it, which I agree on, but it is obviously a European movie, without heroes and villains, however we clearly see who is good and who is bad. The only thing is that good is not always simple as it appears to be. Almost every character is very much complex. I only have one doubt about the ""traitor""'s character (I do not reveal it, but you know that there is always one or several). We do not have enough comprehensive background about this character. Except from it, all characters are deep...and sound as human nature may be reassuring, capable of doing right AND wrong. Actors are wonderful. I have always loved dutch actors ...and actresses. Dutch people often say that their language is useless as it is only spoken by them. Even thought I do not understand it except when they use words similar to English, it is always a pleasure to hear it as it sounds to be a whistle which sometimes go deep into the throat. I am eager to watch the first WWII movie shot by Verhoeven. I first discovered Sci-Fi Verhoeven's movies, like most people among us. I appreciate his long sight about human nature, and this movie is a very sharp example of it. This movie is also dealing with issues not developed but still there, as the link between stolen gold from the Jewish families and Germans, Israel and south America or any other place where Nazis ere hidden after the war. I just do not know what to think about the last seconds of the movie: the attack of the 1956's war involving Israel, as Israell was one of the aggressors against Egypt, along with UK and France. I have just seen the movie and may need more coolness to think about it. Anyway, go and watch it!!"

","Just when we think we have read about or seen all of the stories there are to tell about courageous heroes/heroines who sacrificed much for the sake of many during World War II, along comes BLACK BOOK (ZWARTBOEK) with another dramatic 'biography' of a significant figure. Director Paul Verhoeven (Basic Instinct, Spetters, Total Recall) is a much admired Dutch artist who is able to draw his audience into another world so real that it literally feels as though we are part of the process. And that is precisely why this film works so well: the audience as a participant drives home the film's message that war changes people, that from one day to the next it is impossible to distinguish the 'bad' from the 'good', the 'enemy' from the 'friend'.<br/><br/>Rachel Stein (the enormously gifted Carice van Houten) was a Jewish Dutch born cabaret singer in Berlin until the war broke out, at which time she returned to Holland to hide during the Jewish Solution. A series of incidents in 1944 destroy her hiding place and thwart her attempts to join her family to escape the Nazis. She is left to fend by herself until she bonds with a group from the Dutch Resistance. Gaining their confidence she is asked to masquerade as a German singer, dye all of her body hair blond, enter Germany as the consort of a doctor Hans Akkerman (Thom Hoffman) and infiltrate the highest elements of the Nazi regime, namely to become the mistress of Gestapo head Ludwig Müntze (Sebastian Koch) changing her name to Ellis de Vries. She stays in contact with the Resistance, places microphones in strategic positions, and with her friend Ronnie (Halina Reijn) becomes a Nazi party girl, singing at events while assisting her colleagues underground. The story is complex with many surprises as to who is with the Nazis and who is with the Resistance, and the story is so well told that we the audience are left guessing identities much the same as the characters.<br/><br/>Paul Verhoeven wrote the screenplay with Gerard Soeteman and Verhoeven's dedication to his story is always present. There is a considerable violence and some sections that may offend viewers, but try to tell a true war story without including such aspects! The cast is brilliant, especially the multi-talented Carice van Houten, easily one of the finest actresses on the screen today. The entire cast is includes such gifted actors as Waldemar Kobus, Derek de Lint, Christian Berkel, Dolf de Vries, Michiel Huisman and Ronald Armbrust. The cinematography by Karl Walter Lindenlaub recreates not only The Hague, Holland, and Germany but also a kibbutz in Israel with solid veracity. Anne Dudley has created a musical score that includes songs from the period (sung beautifully by Carice van Houten), and atmospheric scoring for the tender scenes as well as the many tense scenes.<br/><br/>Released in Europe in 2006, it is not clear as to whether this film will be eligible for the Oscars this year. If it is it should win. It is one of the finest films this reviewer has seen in a long time. In Dutch, German, Hebrew, and English with subtitles. Highly Recommended! Grady Harp"
"tavm","10","2","3","7 June 2007"," Paul Verhoeven's Zwartboek, or Black Book, is excellent
","Paul Verhoeven's Zwartboek, or its English title Black Book, was the second movie (the first was Year of the Dog) I saw at the about-to-close Regal Entertainment Group's (previously United Artists') Siegen Village 10 Theatre in Baton Rouge, La., on its last day of operations of June 7, 2007. I picked its final showing of 6:30pm which had an attendance of maybe about 15 or so. Verhoeven co-wrote and directed a very compelling film about a woman named Rachel (Carice van Houten) who survives the Nazis during World War II in Holland by her connections, personality, and, most of all, her sexuality. van Houten's performance brings such a variety of emotions and intellect to her character that I cried and cheered with her all the way for her safety as well as those of other characters she cared about. Verhoeven brings such great drama and action in every scene that one never gets bored. If you know the director mainly for his American movies like RoboCop, Starship Troopers, Total Recall, Basic Instinct, or, most notoriously, Showgirls, Black Book will be a total revelation to you. It certainly was for me!"

I did not realise I was reading the subtitles, it was so realistic, so believable, riveting, and graphic enough to be effective without being over the top. If you do not like war films, and you don't watch subtitled films, watch The Black Book and be surprised. When the British come at the end, suddenly you realise English is being spoken for the first time. I did not find any of the acting under-par, but it is the plot which keeps your attention. The whole film is well balanced, no part of it is slow, or confused, and the use of Dutch and German speaking actors adds a refreshing authenticity to the realism. Unfortunately, not screened much here in the UK, nor for very long."

","Black Book marked a return to filmmaking in his native Netherlands for director Paul Verhoeven, following an extended run in Hollywood with genre successes including Robocop and Total Recall (as well as unmitigated disasters in Showgirls and Hollow Man). Outside of his homeland, Verhoeven made a name for himself as a purveyor of mainstream cinematic sleaze, albeit with subversively hidden depths of astute societal observations underneath the boundary pushing sex and ultra-violence... Verhoeven (just about) at his best, Black Book serves as a reminder of the provocative auteur's talents, whilst retaining some of his old and somewhat peculiar fixations. An extraordinary performance from Carice van Houten, however, is the real drawer."
"honorhorror","9","4","9","20 February 2009"," Bold, fast and delivering, with one of my favorite female lead.
","Basically what's gonna blow you away in the Dutch production ""Black Book"" is its individual narration presenting one near-perfect performance by the Dutch actress, Carice Von Houten. Regarding Jews in the 2nd world war, it's neither The Pianist nor Shindler's List. Instead, it's quite a mixture of the two movies, and fortunately a mixture of the good elements from the two.<br/><br/>Ellis was being hidden by a Dutch family in their farmhouse. However, after the house had been bombed, she had to escape to Belgium with the help of a Dutch resistant member. They were exposed and all her family were killed in the slaughter. Being the only one luckily enough to escape the carnage, Ellis had a chance to join the resistance and spy on the Germans.In the process she only discovered the truth of her family's tragedy.......<br/><br/>The story is not very complicated, but you will be entirely impressed by the way they tell the story. The whole presentation centers the lead character, Ellis. The audiences will enjoy the exploration of many topics in a chaos world and time. There is romance between the female spy and the German officer she spied on; there is also social comments regarding the morality of people in the war. But they are all presented in the first-person view so they were all correctly stressed, decorated and executed. There are countless nude scenes throughout the movie, but they never stand against the plot or jeopardize the integrity of the movie. On the contrast, all the nudity, torture and these elements are smart compliments to the story because they were all stitched by one of my favorite female lead in all movies, Ellis.<br/><br/>Ellis was quick, smart and always had the potential to escape the worst situations. She's also passionate and sympathetic. But the main feature of her is her uniquely strong personality. Heroine is not precise here because she didn't really do something heroic. However, she was always shining in every single scene. The audiences will find it mostly easy to root for her because she's so likable. Carice Von Houten completely sink into her character, or she herself is really such a bold and enthusiastic person as Ellis. In my opinion she deserved an Oscar.<br/><br/>Generally, you will remember this movie.<br/><br/>9/10"
"stan-71","6","4","9","14 February 2008"," Am I missing something?
","The first 2/3rds of this movie were pretty good. During that period the movie sticks to what the back of the box says it is about. The lead actress does a good job of showing the conflicting emotions you might expect one to feel as a Jew working in a Nazi headquarters. It's tense, though-provoking, and enjoyable.<br/><br/>But then at some point the film veers off the road and wanders through some over-the-top territory. It's all too much to suspend disbelief any more. This person is good, no wait he's bad, no wait he's good, no wait he's bad! At that point who cares anymore? Some horrific events are depicted but I never got a feel for the motives of the perpetrators. I just couldn't stop thinking that the movie should have ended by now. It's like they were stacking up stuff and for a while, they had a really high story, but eventually they tried to stack too much and it all fell down."
"pfgpowell-1","4","3","6","9 July 2013"," Undemanding lazy potboiler for undemanding lazy people
","I came across Black Book after reading somewhere that after his post Robocop and Basic Instinct decline into absurdity, Black Book marked a glorious return to form for Paul Verhoeven, And needing a DVD to watch and coming across Black Book at £3 in an Asda (the UK's Wall-Mart) bargain bin, I thought 'why not?'<br/><br/>Well, I should, perhaps, also have asked myself just what a movie - the most expensive Dutch movie ever made, no less - was doing languishing in the bargain bins less than 10 months after its release. I suspect you know where this is going. I had, in fact, only ever seen Robocop of Verhoeven's earlier films and had rather liked it's satirical touches, although on reflection it hadn't quite been the satire I had thought it to have been. Black Book made me ask myself: when we watch a movie, exactly what is it we want? Simple entertainment or something greater? Well, often, of course, it's simple entertainment.<br/><br/>Despite all the 'auteurs' and the 'homage' we 'serious' film fans are supposed to pay 'auteurs', there also has to be time out when we can set aside the quest to investigate the human condition for an hour or two, grab the popcorn and settle down to watch a little undemanding nonsense. And why not? Yet when a movie chooses to deal with what was one of the most shocking and tragic periods of recent European history and which, furthermore, directly acknowledges the most horrific aspect of that time, the wholesale slaughter of millions of Jews, quite apart from also touching upon such ultra-sensitive areas as the degree and methods of the Dutch resistance and the collaboration of other Dutch with the Nazis, including the betrayal of fellow citizens for venal gain, it is surely fair to expect that movie to rise a little above the status and ambitions of 'undemanding nonsense'.<br/><br/>But, to his shame, Paul Verhoeven never even tries to. He is quite content to churn out a large-scale potboiler, and one, furthermore, whose script is surprisingly lazily put together for a movie with this kind of budget and apparent aims. It would be tedious and boring for both you, the reader, and me, the writer, to list the script's many, many flaws and inconsistencies. I'll simply remark that Verhoeven and his co-writer were not in the slightest concerned with producing a truthful and honest tale. All they wanted to do was to make sure 'the action' roared ahead at breakneck speed and that you and I were given no opportunity at all to question the plot's many twists and turns. So: if 'undemanding nonsense' is your thing, packaged with a spurious mystery and a little, tho' not much, trademark Verhoeven soft porn, this is the film for you, available at your nearest supermarket bargain bin.<br/><br/>If, given Black Book's painful and tragic subject matter, you want a movie which takes both you and itself seriously, forget it."

","Terrific film dealing with the German occupation of Holland during World War 11.<br/><br/>The film is fabulous due to the exciting plot twists. Even though many of the good guys turn out to be villains, the film is done so well that you just don't mind having to think a little. Imagine, a Jewish woman, whose parents and brother were gunned down by Nazis, is eventually accused of being a traitor. An admirable job is done to depict her as this, especially since she was the one who helped to wire German headquarters while working for the Dutch underground. When it's discovered by the Nazis, what she is up to, they fabricate stories which they know will be heard by the underground.<br/><br/>The cast of German and Dutch actors are wonderful. One question I have is since when was escaping to Belgium considered a panacea?"

","I wanted to see this movie, so I was happy when I saw it would be broadcast yesterday. But now I've seen it, I must say that it turned out to be a disappointment. Everyone was thrilled about Mr. Verhoeven's movie with Carice van Houten in the leading role...it opened the road to Hollywood for Carice, so I thought it would be good...but it wasn't. The whole film is like a comic; you just don't feel anything with what's happening. Paul Verhoeven is good at making beautiful pictures, but I missed this movie just misses content. It doesn't take you, you just feel like watching a theater play. Apart from that; I did think Carice was a good actress before I'd seen Blackbook, and I still do. I'm just a fan of her; she's a very pretty, talented woman, but her talent just doesn't come out in this movie. Practically in the next scene after Rachel's/Ellis' family is killed, she's cheerful again. Right, she says: ""I'm unable to cry about it,"" but this just doesn't make sense; her whole family has been killed and she's smiling again in the next scene! This might be a part of Verhoeven's directing, but it just makes you feel; this doesn't make sense. Yet, I love Carice's acting. I'm just a fan of her, but I found it a pity. This movie is a missed chance to make something really beautiful."
"neil-476","8","3","6","23 February 2008"," Gripping
","When a film has had a lot of comment, I'm reluctant to spend time simply repeating others' comments: on the other hand, there is a 10-line minimum! Put me down as one of those who thought this was a good film. It is a gripping war drama, wholly credible in both concept and execution. Although it has the gloss, drive, and production values which we have come to expect from modern films, it never loses sight of the humanity which lay behind the real-world events which are fictionalised in this film.<br/><br/>And it has a splendid cast, mostly unknown outside Holland, headed by the wonderful Carice van Houten who simply lights up the screen whenever she is on it. Her performance is a standout."
"stock-1","10","3","6","20 May 2007"," a Oscar winner
","The Jewish girl Rachel, played by Carice van Houten is brilliant. Frightening brilliant if one realizes that it is her 1st ever movie. Even Paul Verhoeven was amazed with the end result. She saves her life by eating chocolate which was dropped by allied forces, after being drugged with insulin. Crazy enough there's a Dutch chocolate factory called van Houten. Every kid in Holland was raised with that. <br/><br/>Zwartbook, aka Black Book, contains some intriguing pointers. The Dutch student Hans Akkermans (Thom Hoffman) who acted as counter intelligence for the Nazi SS inside dutch underground, was specialized in medicine. His tool was insulin to create dependent victims whom by overdose could be easily killed, with no CSI questions asked... Interesting enough so-called diabetes is even today one of the most abundant diseases, which apparently has no structural cure but insulin itself. It gets even more scary when inside the movie the British forces drop a box labeled ""handle with care"" which contain insulin as a special delivery for Hans Akkermans himself. Who are the good guys and who are the bad guys? If one knows about the 'England Spiel' and the recent book 'Hitler was a British agent' a rather sinister image is depicted which presumably had the Netherlands as main theater and dutch resistance as its main actors. <br/><br/>The beginning and ending is also sinister, depicting Rachel and her family inside a Israeli kibbutz in 1956 with IDF forces on guard. A bus arrives from Israel Holy Land tours. Welcome to the holy land. Make sure though to have enough mitzvahs to make your safe journey home. The Israel/Jewish problem ain't solved to this very day. Something tells me its by design."
"basrutten","8","3","6","15 April 2007"," Verhoeven is back
","After a very long absence, director and infant terrible Paul Verhoeven return to movie-making with ""Zwarboek"", and what a return it is! One warning though: if you're expecting something over-the-top and/or satirical like in most of Verhoeven's more recent movies, look elsewhere. ""Zwarboek"", while far from subtle, is remarkably subdued and realistic for a Verhoeven movie, and all the better for it.<br/><br/>""Zwartboek"" tells the story of Jewish Rachel Stein, who, after her family has been shot during an escape attempt, becomes involved with the Dutch resistance and infiltrates the German headquarters. This makes for a great story, with plenty of twists and turns and a lot of suspense, even though the end is a bit formulaic, and the pace is sometimes so high that it can be hard to keep track. The movie has quite a lot of memorable moments, which become all the more impressive once you know that a lot of them are actually based on real events, though the characters and story themselves are fictional.<br/><br/>What's probably even more interesting is that the picture painted here isn't the stereotypical one of good guys (resistance and allies) versus bad guys (Germans). Verhoeven shows that in war, as in the rest of the world, very little is black and white. There are corrupt resistance fighters and sympathetic Germans, and while some people are motivated by ideals, many are just by self-preservation, greed, or revenge. While Verhoeven's treatment of all this is far from subtle, I found it refreshing to see a director that deviates from the usual good vs bad theme.<br/><br/>For a Dutch movie, ""Zwartboek"" also has remarkable production values. From start to finish, everything looks and sounds very authentic (up to the deliberately poor German spoken by the Dutch) and the acting varies from excellent to decent. Carice van Houten is fabulous as Rachel/Ellis. Fortunately, Verhoeven was also sensible enough to hire real Germans instead of having Dutch actors play Nazis.<br/><br/>There is on big flaw here though, and that is the Theo character, played by Johhny de Mol. The character (though based on facts) is already over-the-top, but he's played so poorly by De Mol that it really makes you cringe. Some people simply shouldn't be allowed to act, and De Mol is one of them.<br/><br/>But this aside, ""Zwartboek"" is a fast-paced and suspenseful war thriller, with plenty of memorably moments, a strong story, and remarkable moral complexity.<br/><br/>Oh, and don't worry, there is some typically raunchy Verhoeven stuff in there too....<br/><br/>8 out of 10"

Bad script, bad acting, dialogues that make you gringe, much too long, horrible plot.<br/><br/>Most annoying were the complete unnecessary reoccuring scenes of Carice van Houten's showing bare breasts. <br/><br/>This is DVD rental material, don't waste your time going to the cinema.<br/><br/>Soldaat van Oranje (Soldier of Orange, trans?) was a true masterpiece by Verhoeven, Zwartboek is not allowed to even stand in its shadow."
"bobgeorge1","2","8","24","29 June 2007"," a Dutch Hello Hello?
","I defy anyone not to like the Dutch. Apart from their astounding ability to speak several languages straight from birth and make some odd guttural noises that no-one else in Europe can do; they are engaging and open and a very tolerant people. Besides which I went to see Zwartboek directed by Paul Verhoeven after being in Holland for a fortnight. So, a film set in the wartime Netherlands directed by a successful Dutchman, one would like to be gem. I just found it despairingly trite.<br/><br/>Let's start with the positives. The background music? It underlines every mood with crescendos and cadences to exaggerate the mood if we haven't understood it from the story but was way too prominent. Maybe the photography that had crisp colours and showed some of the wonderful Dutch buildings and orderly landscapes? But it had none of the lighting contrasts of the Dutch painting masters. Well, maybe the acting then? For sure, the lead actress, Carice van Houten, who plays the heroine throughout the film is very easy to watch and , as you can see from the picture clips supplied to IDMB has a natty way of looking over her shoulder (in all 8 of the supplied pictures of her she stands looking over one shoulder or the other). I thought she and all the actors did a fine job, but....<br/><br/>About 2 hours into the film van Houten's character, by then having changed her name from the too Jewish Rachel Stein to the Dutch resistance nom de Guerre of Ellis de Vries, says ""When will it end?"" I had been thinking the same thing for about 90 minutes. In England ITV have programmes that are advertised as ""a stunning new DRAMA"". They are well made, well filmed, set in caricatured locations, full of well known actors who make their mark by bursting with ""drama"" meaning they always have some turmoil with a close up shot. This film struck me as a good ITV drama. Just right for a Tuesday night at 9.00pm.<br/><br/>My immediate reaction to the film was that it managed to equally offend everyone. Would Jewish people want to be portrayed as money and diamond grabbing; with the Rachel Stein character having to be noticed all the time even when trying to slip past the Gestapo? Do the Germans still want to be seen as sadistic power crazed peoples? Are we Brits ineffective wishy washy nice chaps ( well OK probably). Were the Dutch so bound up with their religious fervour? All much too caricatured for me.<br/><br/>I think the main disappointment for me is that one has no deeper understanding of people or their motives from this film. There is no exploration of character. The SS Officer Ludwig Müntze excellently played by Sebastian Koch collects stamps; so another German with obsessional characteristics. Stereotyping again; and he is the most developed character. And van Houten's Rachel Stein had to be noticed all the time; it drove me potty her showing her legs off at Germans whilst apparently trying to sneak through their lines; putting on candles in a transparent tent whilst again hiding; all the time that woman drew attention to herself.<br/><br/>Probably the biggest flaw really was the script; superficial and silly. I'm so glad my mother never saw this film; I think it's an insult to anyone in their 80s."
"oliverfranks-1","1","30","123","24 October 2006"," Errrr.....what the?
","This is one of the worst films I have ever seen. I loved Starship 
 Troopers, but let's face it, this director is camp, titillating and 
 insincere. That's WHY I love ST. However, if you make those kind of 
 films, best stay away from something as complex as Nazi occupation. The 
 result can only be bad taste of the highest order.
 
 Where were the Waffen SS? Why do we only see people's heads being 
 shaved when the Allies arrive? Are we seriously meant to believe a high 
 ranking Gestapo officer is 'a good guy really'? What's funny about 
 there being no demand for Kosher in Holland since the Nazis arrived? 
 Where were all the Dutch who collaborated willingly with the Nazis? Why 
 are the Dutch made to suffer and the Jews left to feel the guilt in 
 this film? These last points are very salient as it seems obvious to me 
 that this film is a blatant attempt to exonerate the Dutch involvement 
 with the Nazis. 
 
 The film focuses on the Dutch resistance (which in truth was almost 
 non-existent: the Dutch were one of the biggest collaborators) and 
 portrays them as heroic, it lays ALL the blame at the feet of one or 
 two Germans who resemble Barry from Eastenders and Uncle Fester 
 respectively, and creates only one or two Dutch collaborators. 
 
 The truth is much worse. Most of the population in Holland welcomed the 
 Nazis with open arms of indifference - tacit approval if you will. It 
 was in fact the Dutch Police, not the Nazis, who rounded up most of the 
 Jews for 'deportation'. To this day it remains one of Europe's 
 countries with the largest far right sympathies. This film sidesteps 
 all of these uncomfortable truths in a glib, revisionist tit-fest. No 
 wonder it got money from Holland; ""Come to the Netherlands! It wasn't 
 anything to do with us, it was all the Germans! Smoke this, watch that, 
 forget everything!""
 
 The fact that so many people from the Netherlands are singing this 
 film's praises on this site is no surprise. It must be very relieving 
 for you all to be told your ancestors were all heroes really, and that 
 they were all 'tricked' into the anti-semitic beliefs they held. And to 
 those Dutch people whose comments I have read condeming this film, 
 congratulations."

","If you like seeing beautiful young women completely naked, and posed in compromising and perverse scenarios, then ""Black Book"" is for you.<br/><br/>Carice van Houten as Rachel / Ellis, a Jew who falls in love with a Gestapo chief, is fully exposed on screen, and things are done to her body that I've not only not seen in movies before, I didn't think I'd ever see.<br/><br/>The sex only lets up in order to make way for graphic violence: a graphic scene of torture by water boarding, death by firing squad, and suffocation in a coffin whose lid is slowly screwed shut.<br/><br/>Director Paul Verhoeven was criticized for depicting a Jewish woman as the lover of a Gestapo chief, and for depicting the Dutch Resistance as less than uniformly heroic in its resistance. I expected to be shocked by these features, but I was not. I just felt bludgeoned into numbness by all the nudity and bloodletting.<br/><br/>I watched this movie on DVD, and after a while I just fast forwarded or closed my eyes through scenes I simply didn't want to watch: a woman exposing Ellis' body to the very Nazi who had murdered her parents, Ellis being drenched in bodily waste, yet another pile of corpses.<br/><br/>The production values are very high. The movie looks fantastic. If you are into sex, violence, and sensation, this is the movie for you.<br/><br/>I've read a lot of memoirs of the Nazi era, and met survivors. The Nazi era was not fun and games. I find watching movies about those days to be hard. When I do watch them, I want to feel that I've learned something, or felt something, that made watching the movie worthwhile.<br/><br/>I didn't learn anything about the WW II era while watching this movie, although I did learn something about exploitation. I was unmoved. Carice van Houten is lovely, but she plays her role as a tough cookie. Given that she is a sex toy in the film, I found it hard to relate to her humanity.<br/><br/>In the end, when Ellis / Rachel finally breaks down and begins to cry, one of her co-stars morphs into an eyebrow arching, mustache twirling parody of a Hitchcock villain, and tries to murder her by injection. That scene was so desperate for shock value I lost all faith in the film at that point.<br/><br/>Sebastian Koch, who played Ludwig Muntze, the kind and sensitive Gestapo chief with whom Rachel falls in love, left me completely unmoved.

"movedout","9","3","7","13 May 2008"," Easily Paul Verhoeven's most enjoyable and breezily entertaining films in years
","Only Paul Verhoeven could make another WWII film seem so fresh, audacious and altogether exhilarating by throwing in a strong religious subtext, simmering vulgarity, high-wire espionage and an unsparingly transgressive moral compass in which the Nazis weren't the only arseholes left in the war. But it's even more remarkable that Verhoeven, without missing a beat, vigorously fits in his brand of bold meta-satire and subversive political thought (by way of his ""Starship Troopers"" allegory being retooled) into a tightly written and highly toned script. The director's tenacious motif is his hilariously hyper-extended, overplayed melodramatics and luminously lit men and women  hungering with sexual evocation  filtered through the complexities of a ethical grey area visualised through nebulous clouds of cigarette smoke. The film adheres towards several key components, but coheres around one theme: Verhoeven has Old Hollywood in his sights.<br/><br/>The relative, tenuous calm of Israel in 1956 is captured as a tour bus pulls up to witness the quaintness of a kibbutz but gives way to a surprising reunion between wartime chums. A flashback beckons as a distressed Rachel Stein (Carice van Houten) proceeds to sit by a body of water and remember her life as a chanteuse called Ellis de Vries back in Holland, 1944-1945. With a family butchered in cold blood by a SS swine, Rachel joins the Resistance against the Nazis. Her natural good looks, the talent for both song and deceit inform the decision to send her deep into enemy regime, seducing a handsome and sensitive Gestapo up-and-comer (Sebastian Koch) and retrieve secrets vital to the reclamation of the homeland. This could be easily retitled ""Lust, Caution"", if it weren't for the film's voluptuously photographed and energetic direction of being a sobering thrill-a-minute, briskly paced actioner, more focused on its dramatic reversals of fortunes than it is about the genre's predilection for the elevation of its us-versus-them narratives and its inherent gravitas.<br/><br/>Like Verhoeven's greatest films, the female soma, inclusive of its complicated psyche and prevailing impulses, form the centrepiece of his film. And in ""Black Book"", van Houten as Rachel glows incandescent like a genuine Hollywood heroine, a classically beautiful movie starlet  an arresting Jean Harlow impersonate  playing her assigned role as Aryan siren to sleek perfection with the profound sadness of an identity implicitly becoming lost. But Rachel/Ellis is a creature of intense fortitude. Her instincts are sure and steadfast, traversing distances with dauntless reach, a woman of innate elegance and of the vicissitudes that come with suppressed desire. These fierce motivations and fully cognisant volition are incited by the inner rebellions formed as a Jewish femme in wartime Holland, caught in the middle of Nazi oppression and the Christian puritans (""if only the Jews had just listened to Jesus"") she takes shelter with as she's forced to hold a Bible for meals or the matter-of-fact abuses she takes on the chin when the leader of the Resistance remarks, ""When is a Jew's life worth more than a good Dutchman?"" An intuitive provocateur, Verhoeven charts the morass though prurient sexual encounters and base survival instincts while gleefully chafing the absurdly graphic with the warm humanism buried in his more outrageous oeuvre. The modulation between a tasteful recreation of the period and a modernist take on genre conventions by feeding off its own historical context provides the centrifugal force of the film's queries into the roles of liberators, oppressors and other postwar manifestos."
"owen_twistfield","5","4","11","15 February 2009"," Verhoeven returns to his native country and brings with him....
","Verhoeven has come back from that Walhalla of movie making. What did he bring with him in his little bag?<br/><br/>Clueless warfare.<br/><br/>I am cursed by the fact to be interested in warfare and astounded again that even the simplest of warfare concept are trod upon in this movie. Some examples: almost all firefights see the Germans stand up in full view fire-hosing their MP 40's. Might I point out that the essence of modern warfare is to take cover. Nobody in his right mind is going to survive combat this way. Another example: during the movie a armored vehicle is driven into the building. Argg. That is the first and foremost fault one can making in armored warfare. Even tanks might get stuck or shed a track. Weapons are transported with their magazines and in a lose fashion. More number one mistakes. People seldom reload their guns. During the armored car incident a Thompson is used to kill five Germans in a prolonged firefight and not once is the magazine replaced.<br/><br/>Cardboard baddies.<br/><br/>The story boils down to the fact that a resistance fighter hero is in fact an egocentric, selfish bastard who has entered into a deal with the SS to exploit the Jews and has no problem in killing off all his resistance buddies. And this then is the pivotal story. Oh and the German bad guy has no qualms about this resistance fight massacring German soldiers. And oh. The resistance people are all happy to lay down and die. Tow being murdered by the bad guy with a knife in broad daylight. It was one of the baddest scenes.<br/><br/>Unbelievable plot.<br/><br/>No believable plot is made to explain these actions. No anguish on the part of the killer. No the bad guys are cardboard baddies that need to be hunted down and killed. And of course only the hapless heroes know the truth of it. (and they are not believed by anyone).Break out the guns boys.<br/><br/>Poinless scenes. <br/><br/>The movie is filled with pointless scenes. Examples: the Israel shoot at the beginning and the end. The abuse scened after the liberation. The bomber flying at the beginning.<br/><br/>Bad directed scenes.<br/><br/>Did you note how fast the relieve column arrived after the bomber dropped the load on the farm? Within minutes. Even in modern times with cell phones such speed would be amazing. Another one: within a minute after the resistance fighter are found out by the police to transport guns an armed force of Germans arrives. Such speed is amazing considering they had no helicopters. Why are the resistance to entered the SD HQ by the SS when it's a trap. If caused them a lot of dead Germans.<br/><br/>Bad music directing<br/><br/>Music is important to a movie and Verhoeven shows that even his budget has it's limits. So we are treated with the same melancholic string music most of the time. Only at some key moments the melancholy is dropped for something more fitting. <br/><br/>Let's compare this movie to let's say L'armee des ombres and this Zwart Boek just falls flat on it's face.

"saadgkhan","9","2","4","28 June 2012"," An outstanding Dutch Nazi Thriller ...
","Zwartboek - Black Book - CATCH IT (A) Zwartboek is a Dutch movie about a young rich Jew woman hiding in Holland during World War II. Zwartboek is truly a masterpiece in regards of creating a thriller covering the Nazism & brutality of World War II. From start to finish, Zwartboek brilliantly explores a life of a woman in hiding & then working as spy for the resistance. The great thing is the tables are turned for poor her even when the World War II is over as she is labeled as Nazi Spy. This almost 2 and half hour a movie keeps on edge of your seat. The direction, screenplay, performances & production value is top notch. Carice van Houten's performance as Jew woman in hiding & spying for resistance is outstanding. There are some truly cringe worthy moments in the movie which truly makes you admire her as very few actresses would go that far to be humiliated. All the supporting cast along with Michiel Huisman did a great job. <br/><br/>On the whole, Zwartboek is highly recommended Nazi thriller. Catch It!"
"jghbrown","Null","2","4","6 December 2009"," Tears, tart and titty
","The makers of this movie seem to have crafted it in such a fashion as to conjure up as many sub-plots involving sex, violence and double-dealing as could reasonably fit in a 2-hour spell. In so doing they created an extremely fast-paced thriller with more twists in it than a mole's living quarters. Which no doubt will appeal to a certain type of movie-goer.<br/><br/>However as a result the film loses much of its moral authority. Take, for instance, the episode where the house in which Ellis has been hiding is bombed. Almost immediately afterwards we see her singing happily without apparently a care in the world and her only remark regarding those (including half a dozen or so children) who had been sheltering her was to say she was relieved that she no longer had to read boring passages from the Bible to earn her keep. Hmm. In another episode several resistance men are badly beaten and then dragged off by German police but this seems to leave little impression on her. Even after her whole family is murdered she throws herself into the role of tart to the Germans with unlikely enthusiasm.<br/><br/>Though her acting in the role of tart is superb, as a heroine she seems to be distinctly lacking in intelligence. She seems constantly to be out-of-depth. Manipulated by others, she never seems to have a coherent plan of her own, and frequently allows herself to be led into traps. There are the seeds in this story of a great cat-and-mouse thriller if she had been allowed to have a bit more brain and a bit less of the other. This could have taken the movie way above the general Hollywood fare. However the authors seemed to have aimed for the box office. A great pity, given the excellent standard of photography, dialog and acting throughout.<br/><br/>The climax of the movie when she is turning the screws in the coffin is just ludicrous."
"nodialogue","9","2","4","4 May 2009"," fits the big screen
","There had been many war time movies before this one. It has the outstanding quality being shot on location in Holland. This makes the film visually very believable. Germans actually play the Germans, speaking German in the dutch original version, again this adds to the credibility of the historical background. The story is based on historical facts however not true in that combination. Essentially it is a thriller, shot from the perspective of a Jewish actress/dancer who is a fugitive in occupied Holland trying to find out who delivers Jewish inhabitants to the Germans. It is very entertaining with all the action required, a beautiful lead actress and a string of highly skilled supporting actors.With all the details in the film Verhoeven does a good job of putting them all together into one story. There is not a single enjoyable detail in a scene that does not propel the overall story and makes sense sooner or later. Personally I find it very pleasurable to see that the outcome does not rely on the outstanding abilities of individuals but has everyone washed away in the wartime events. It is big entertainment filling over 2 hours, I saw it in a cinema late 2006 in Holland, one of the few productions maybe ten years back that really fit the big screen. On the other hand it can be taken as a serious look at the Dutch past with a view to a wider future of events as given by the flashback setup. Overall the film brilliantly succeeds in bringing back the past in full colour without ever looking like costumes and stages which is remarkable by itself in that genre."
"csrothwec","7","2","4","23 November 2008"," A so-so film, but massively over-rated by some commentators
","Good production values and a smashing central performance, but this film otherwise has very little indeed going for it, with its convoluted, (but also entirely predictable), plot, gratuitous violence and scenes of nudity and by over-staying its welcome by at least forty minutes. Obviously, its Dutch makers felt a real need to make a film about life under Nazi occupation, the Dutch resistance, the treatment of the Jews and the relationships of various protagonists from all of these domains, but, given the resources evidently at their disposal, one could have hoped for much more of an achievement than this concoction of a film. It seems that no-one could come up with a really convincing or satisfactory script/plot/vision to unite the various aspects of the stories they wanted to tell and so what one gets is a series of 'adventures' loosely linked together, but in such a manner as entirely to fail to illuminate, entertain or even, towards the end, hold one's interest much overall. Something to view once, but unlikely to remain in the memory for any length of time after having been seen, (beyond the really great performance by Carice van Houten and the interesting support of Sebastian Koch - both stuck in a film hardly worthy of their talents)."
"jpschapira","8","2","4","22 October 2008"," Is war beautiful?
","Welcome to Paul Verhoeven's ""Black Book""; a world of beautiful film-making and storytelling. Beautiful film-making because everything looks like out of a painting: everyone's perfectly dressed even when they're not wearing nice clothes (even the poor look nice), every scenery seems unique and specifically designed for each scene. Beautiful storytelling because what happens in the film is very well told and the words are the right ones. However, all of this beautifulness suddenly seems so painful if I tell you what the story is about.<br/><br/>Inspired by true events of World War II, Verhoeven's script (written alongside Gerard Soeteman) introduces to Rachel (Carice Van Houten), a beautiful Dutch Jewish woman who will later be known as Ellis de Vries because she will risk her life by infiltrating the Nazi headquarters office and seducing Chief Ludwig Muntze (Sebastian Koch, from ""The Lives of Others""); all for the support of the Dutch Resistance and the people who saved her life. <br/><br/>This is a movie, because what you've just read-the way I described it, at least- is the kind of thing that occurs in a picture. Well, in this particular picture characters also like to reference other pictures and their stars (Jean Harlow, Greta Garbo). In my opinion, the contrast of everything looking perfect while there's a war going on is one of the things that makes ""Black Book"" a very special experience. The film takes us places; not only to those places and sceneries that invade the screen but to places beyond, like the place I like to call 'forbidden love', or 'silent suffering' or even 'unexpected friendship'. <br/><br/>Yes, ""Black Book"" is not another movie about the war. The war will always be here (as it can be appreciated near the ending), and Verhoeven uses this specific war as a background to give us, firstly; the look of that period and era, secondly; a tremendous spectacle in which things don't need to blow up all the time. A spectacle that involves drama, action, suspense and the human relationships I mentioned above. <br/><br/>There's suspense in the way characters come up with rescue plans we normally see in the best crime movies; action in how these plans turn out, usually not well; human relationships in a romance that grows without us having to completely witness it and a friendship that emerges from need but solidifies with time. You have to pay attention, because it may be a perfectly looking world, but that doesn't mean the plot will be perfectly served for your comprehension.<br/><br/>I forgot to mention drama, which we can find in all the performances, starting from Van Houten, whose performance isn't great because of the pain she expresses out loud but because of the pain she lets us feel in her soft and troubled face. I'm talking about a pain built on expression, in a character that uses words as a shield. Koch delivers a fine performance, and so does Halina Reijn as Ellis/Rachel's friend. <br/><br/>This is just to mention a few names, because every performance is astounding and every scene works carefully to detail the personalities of characters I haven't mentioned yet and won't mention at all. Maybe there are scenes that don't serve the development of the film and that Verhoeven could have done without. <br/><br/>But these are just a few, and don't change the fact that ""Black Book"" is a triumphant film by a director who knows how to entertain without having to worry so much about realism; and by this I hope you don't assume I'm saying the movie is not realistic at all. But it's entirely true what they say sometimesthat it's enough with a good story."
"lastliberal","10","2","4","4 May 2008"," An exciting tale of espionage
","When I think of a Paul Verhoeven film, I think of excitement - Total Recall, Flesh+Blood, Robocop, etc. He hits another home run with this tale of the Dutch resistance against the Nazis and the sacrifice made by one woman (Carice van Houten) to avenge the death of her family. Van Houten, who we will see again as Tom Cruise's wife in Valkyrie (although we will certainly not see her to the extent that we saw here here), was magnificent and really made this picture. There was a superb cast of supporting characters that made Gerard Soeteman's and Verhoeven's story come alive on the screen. Nobody stand out like Van Houten, and she made this one of the best film experiences of the year."

","This film is about a Jewish woman infiltrating the German Army during the Dutch resistant in the World War II.<br/><br/>""Black Book"" is really an astounding film. Despite the length of the film, every single second has its significance and cannot be cut out. The plot is so tightly woven and quick paced, we needed to pause every now and then to discuss what's going on and to clarify what's happening. The fact that we want to discuss it is an indication that we are very drawn to the plot and want to know exactly what happened. The story unfolds in a fascinating and gripping way that viewers beg for more.<br/><br/>It's sad and yet thrilling that no one could be trusted. Good guys seem bad and yet bad guys seem good. It's a never ending struggle for Ellis de Vries, and I think this is one of the reasons that the plot is so engaging. At the end, the humiliation scene is particularly moving and disturbing. It is just one of the many shocking scenes, but they do not look out of place or contrived at all as it could have with other movies. That's another wonder of ""Black Book"".<br/><br/>Carice van Houten is an amazing actress. I feel it's wrong that she didn't get an Oscar nomination for the best actress. She has a 40's quality, radiating elegance and yet mixed with all sorts of pain when she was being undercover. The rest of the cast is also very good. They collectively create a lot of tension and carry the film very well.<br/><br/>It's hard to believe that ""Black Book"" is directed by the same guy who directed ""Showgirls"". It's a much welcomed change, and I look forward to his next film."
"extravaluejotter","7","2","4","22 April 2008"," A Finely Crafted War Movie, But...
","There is a lot to recommend ""Black Book"" to international audiences but the scale of the movie eventually works against it. The screenplay is based on actual events within German-occupied Holland during WWII, but Paul Verhoeven and his co-writer Gerard Soeteman have over-egged their story. <br/><br/>Despite some fine acting from Carice Van Houten and her supporting cast, there are moments in ""Black Book"" where you may begin to wonder how one person copes with so much tension and bad luck. Rachel Stein is (I assume) a composite character and this is the film's main weakness. Verhoeven and Soeteman, it seems, couldn't bear to leave anyone's anecdote out of their original screenplay and the result strained my credulity quite badly. I don't think that I would bother buying ""Black Book"" on DVD because, for all its atmosphere and tension, it's at least 20 minutes too long. <br/><br/>Whilst trying to portray what German occupation was like for Dutch people, Paul Vehoeven's otherwise admirable film tries to cram too much incident into one person's lifetime. The film does deliver quite a satisfying twist at the end but slides alarmingly toward the ""Showgirls"" end of Verhoeven's movie scale on the way on the way to its climax. <br/><br/>Having dissed it for 3 paragraphs, I would like to finish off with a recommendation to give ""Black Book"" a try if you like war films. It's better than a lot of recent efforts in this genre."

I was impressed that the subtitles seemed so transparent...so much so that I find it difficult to recall that the dialog was not in English rather than German/Dutch/Hebrew (although some of the dialog was in English). Black Book could be compared to other recent WWII films: Sophie, the Pianist, and Head in the Clouds. Of the 4, Sophie and the Pianist have to rate 10's both for the high quality of the films, and also for the consummate nobility of their (true life) characters. There was some concern about historical inaccuracies in the film; I've got a huge WWII and holocaust library and nothing seemed out of place to me. Carice van Houten was absolutely luminous (and she can sing!) which may not be among Charlize Theron's talents. Definitely worth a rent."

","Heartstopping action and heartfelt humanity combine to make Zwartboek (Black Book) a must see film that quite uniquely entertains and educates at the same time. This is an artistic achievement of the highest order. Paul Verhoeven's film manages to wrench a range of intense emotions from viewers as he simultaneously takes them for a thrill-packed roller coaster ride that is carefully plotted to keep riders on the very edge of their seats. Carise van Houten sizzles in a role that she seems to play so effortlessly one wonders why she isn't more in demand. Her face betrays emotion without the wild emoting that many lesser actresses seem to favor. Van Houten's on screen relationship with Sebastian Koch is similar to the complex interplay one encounters in exquisite literature. Watching this movie leaves one both breathless and stimulated by the intensity of the emotions that flood the screen at a frantic pace throughout. This film is so good that one need not read the subtitles to comprehend what is occurring on screen, although they obviously help viewers realize the full complexity of the film. This film draws positive parallels to Schindler's List and Nowhere in Africa. If you like quality films, you'll love Zwartboek. PTMR"
"chateau_dwars","8","2","4","2 August 2007"," A great production full of surprises and excellent acting
","When Paul Verhoeven was younger, he did a lot of movies in Holland. His most famous one was 'Soldaat van Oranje', which as I believe is still one of our best movies. Paul was playing with the idea of making Zwartboek for a number of years, but eventually decided to 'go for it'.<br/><br/>And what a great choice. Zwartboek takes you to the world that the movie takes place in right from the very start. Carice, a brilliant actress who I knew from her lovely film Minoes, (English Title: Undercover Kitten) gets you involved. All throughout the film, whether she's singing with the Nazi's, kissing Muntze or crying because of her loss, she takes the viewer with her. Wherever she goes, you go, and it doesn't get annoying. One scene, she wonders: ""Houdt het dan nooit op?"" (Does it never end ??!) Her emotions in that particular scene are so real that you feel pain in your chest. I think this was probably the best piece of acting I have ever seen! Also, Sebastian Koch is a fantastic actor in this movie. Though a Nazi, you get to feel for him, or at least understand that he is not so much a violent and crude man, but so much more a compassionate man who wanted to provide for his family. The tension between Carice and Sebastian throughout the movie is intense and real. No wonder they have had a relationship since the movie was shot. Halina Reijn, Ronnie, is a great actress too. Her beauty, might it not be the same as Carice's but there is something about Halina, makes her fit for this film.<br/><br/>However, some of the other actors fail to impress me. Michiel Huisman, who plays the boy that Carice meets while relaxing outside her house, doesn't seem to be the kind of actor for these movies. His performance in pulp like Costa would be a little more suitable. And Johnny de Mol really doesn't add anything. He's playing some kind of psychedelic Christian who's totally weird or something. Most of the Resistancepeople don't get to me either. A real shame.<br/><br/>Holland was in upright position when we first got to see this movie, but I think it wasn't what we expected. Still, a great movie and the so-deserved big break for Carice, who will now star in a James Bond, an Irish thriller and play the lead in a movie with no other than Tom Cruise himself. The ability of Verhoeven to get Dutch actors , as he did with Rutger Hauer, Jeroen Krabbé, Famke Janssen and others, once again is proved.<br/><br/>A great production that will take you from place to place in seconds. An absolute must for anyone who likes Carice."

Right next door Tower Records was started...<br/><br/>I have just bought the DVD. I was told that it cost $16 Million to make which, given the sets and acting talent (and screen writing) seems unbelievable here.

"dancingmike","10","2","4","28 May 2007"," Outstanding WWII resistance film
","I won't bore you by parroting the many great reviews, but there are two things I'd like to add, one which helped make this film more meaningful to me and another, a change I talked to friends about which I thought would heighten the tension. Just what we need, right? <br/><br/>I saw the French resistance film, ""Army of Shadows"" earlier in 2006. It was written and directed by men who had served in the French Resistance and was one of the most moving films I've ever seen. I was totally involved with the characters and almost felt it personally when something happened to a resistance fighter. My empathy for these brave men and women could not be greater.<br/><br/>This film set me up for ""Black Book"". I thought it was a marvelous film and all the more meaningful for having seen ""Army"". I had more depth of understanding and, of course, my empathy was on high alert. There were so many episodes of resistance exploits over and above those we've seen in films that one could write volumes about in the ""You can't make this stuff up"" category. It's just amazing and thrilling to see what was done to get the Nazis out of those occupied countries.<br/><br/>I had let it slip my mind that in WWII the Allies hopped over Holland on their way to Berlin, so it was occupied right up to the German surrender. A lot of Nazi frustration for their being on the eventual losing side was taken out on the Dutch. I suspect this film could have been much more harsh, but I'm glad the director didn't overwhelm us -- not that he spared us either, of course.<br/><br/>Since it's available in US format now, I'd suggest watching ""Army of Shadows"" followed by another viewing of ""Black Book"". I can't wait for ""Black Book"" to come to DVD so I can have my own resistance double feature.<br/><br/>The second item is tossed in for comments or whatever. It's clearly not a spoiler to say our heroine survives some pretty dire and painful situations. Hey, we see her in the Kibbutz at the start of the film. If that intro were not in the film we wouldn't know if she survives and there would be yet another layer of tension. What do you think? Having said this, if I saw the film restructured like this and liked it I'd have to change the rating system to award it more stars -- 12, 15 maybe?"

I've not seen his early films, but I have loved everything since ""Flesh + Blood"" in 1985.<br/><br/>""Zwartboek"" is interesting because if you take away the extreme sex, violence and horror what you are left with is an old fashioned Sunday afternoon WWII melodrama. You know the kind of thing. You've seen it a million times. In the dying days of WWII a plucky Jewish singer, hiding out from the Nazi's, starts to work as a spy for the Resistance. She dyes her hair blonde (all her hair) and starts to get close to a senior Nazi. She falls in love...<br/><br/>So far, so typical, but it is a good film. Not a film, perhaps, that he would have got away with making with an English cast. (It's mostly in Dutch.)

","There's been many World War II films and a good chunk of them involve the Holocaust in some way, shape, or form, but Black Book feels very much like its own original thing. Starring Melisandre herself, Carice van Houten, as Ellis de Vries, a Jewish singer who navigates herself through the hands of the Nazi's while doing her best to assist the Dutch Resistance. Though it's inspired by true events, the amount of twists, turns, and betrayals feel like something out of a spy film. Which, I guess, in a way very much fits the aesthetic and approach they take to this World War II film. There's a great sense of journey for van Houten's character, though I do feel like a further attention to geographic detail would have been nice. In all, this is a harrowing film that shows a side to World War II that I'm not sure we've seen before.<br/><br/>7.5/10"

We then see what the latter woman did during the war as the action switched to German occupied Netherlands in 1944. The woman is Rachel Stein, a Jewish singer, who is hiding with a Christian family. When that home is destroyed she seeks out a family friend who has contacts that can get her out of the country. She is passed on to a member of the resistance then meets up with a group of refugees, including her parents and brother. The boat they are travelling on is ambushed by the Germans and Rachel is the sole survivor.<br/><br/>She manages to contact the resistance and after an accidental meeting with a local German commander, Ludwig Müntze, she is told to get close to him to help gain useful information. She soon learns that the man responsible for the death of her family, SS Officer Günther Franken, is working in the same headquarters as Müntze. After planting a microphone in his office the identity of the man who betrayed the refugees is found and the resistance must decide what to do next as striking against any friend of the Nazis can expect repercussions. That isn't Rachel's only worry; she is developing feelings for Müntze. Even after the war is over the troubles haven't finished as those who worked with the Germans will do anything to protect themselves and anybody even suspected of collaboration won't get a fair hearing from the mob that quickly forms.<br/><br/>Writer/director Paul Verhoeven may be better known for over-the-top violent action films like 'RoboCop' and 'Total Recall' but here he shows that he is more than capable of making something more serious. That isn't to say there is no violence; there is quite a bit but it isn't gratuitous instead it feels real rather than exciting. The story isn't simply the heroic resistance versus the evil Nazis and collaborators... Müntze spares Rachel even though he realises she is Jewish and refuses orders to execute prisoners and we see resistance members showing anti-Semitic views and quickly turning on each other when it becomes apparent that somebody betrayed them... the identity of the traitors provides a good mystery. There is a good level of tension throughout the film and it is hard not to fear for Rachel's safety even though we know from the start that she survives the war. The cast does a really fine job; most notably Carice van Houten who does a great job as protagonist Rachel and Sebastian Koch as Müntze. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to anybody looking for a war film that is more morally ambiguous than most."

","A period piece that draws you in despite some questionable plot arcs and convenient gaps in judgment amongst characters. That aside, this is a tense pic that has its hands deep in the oil wells of reality, pumping away to generate tension, excitement, confrontation and some timely duets by the main architect of the Netherlands gestapo despite not being it's head. there are both sympathetic scenes and exaggerated action and rolled up in hard to believe plot where the obvious is overlooked.Mind you, I believe that was the point the director was attempting to make about the reality of the time. Flashes on our starlets breast and bush did nothing to add to either element, if only to add brashness to our character, but to the detriment of suspense of disbelief. Not that sex wasn't used by both sides to get what they wanted or needed, but it was pedaled more than bought and that's a bit hard to swallow. The acting is above par but definitely mixed all along, confusing this viewer and adding to the overall thought that the high cost film was spiraling and had to wrap up before these inconsistencies could grow further."

","This is a very good movie where characters are crossed by different determinations. During the second world war, we used to see some key groups in interaction: Allies countries, Resistance groups and German troops. Most of the second war films present these groups with fixed roles and expected behaviors. This film screenplay keeps us hunting who are the traitor of dutch resistance. At the same time, the main actress plays a resistance's spy who fell in love by a German captain. Beyond that, a German lieutenant is a robbery scheme chief that steals the money and belongings of Jewish upper-class people who pays to leave Netherlands. The main characters are shaped in a complex way grabbing the attention til the end. In short, a clever second world war film."

","The Dutch movie Zwartboek was shown in the U.S. with the translated title Black Book (2006). It was co-written and directed by Paul Verhoeven.<br/><br/>The movie shows us the ghastly treatment of Dutch Jews--and, in fact Dutch people in general--during the German occupation of Holland. Rachel Stein--who changes her name to Ellis de Vries--is a Jewish woman who survives the Holocaust and emigrates to Israel. (We know that she survives because the first scene of the film begins with Rachel teaching an elementary class in a kibbutz in Israel. The rest of the movie is shown as Rachel's flashback.)<br/><br/>The plot tells us how she survived, and how she was able to help the Dutch resistance movement as they tried to free their country from the Germans. The movie is extremely convoluted. It's also incredibly violent. It's definitely not for the faint of heart.<br/><br/>The film works because Carice van Houten is so convincing as Rachel Stein/Ellis de Vries. Of course, she's very beautiful, but she's also a great actor. Her beauty enables her to infiltrate the German headquarters, and her intelligence allows her to survive, even though betrayal is everywhere.<br/><br/>The film is long, very sexual, and, as I stated, very violent. If that's the type of film you like, don't miss The Black Book. This really isn't my kind of movie, so I gave it a rating of 7. However, the overall IMDb rating is 7.8, so other reviewers like it better than I did. <br/><br/>We saw the film on DVD, where it worked well. We watched it straight through.

","An excellent rendition of the plight of the Dutch, especially those of Jewish descent, under Nazi occupation. Most Jews did not survive under Nazi occupation and this is the story of a woman determined not only to survive but to avenge the atrocities of the SS and Gestapo.<br/><br/>Most English-speaking viewers will need the English subtitles to follow the film. Being a Dutch film, the Dutch language is of course flawless and the occasional smattering of English as well.<br/><br/>My only gripe is that whereas a large part of the film is spoken in German, the language is often spoken very poorly, both in terms of pronunciation and grammar. For example, it is common in most of the Netherlands to leave the ""n"" silent in infinitives and plurals ending in ""en"", but this is not the case in German. Nevertheless, this central Netherlands affectation gets applied equally to the German-speaking passages in the film. In addition, most of the Dutch actors struggle excessively with German nouns. Most irritating was ""das Vleugel"" which should be ""der Fluegel"". No excuse, given that vleugel isn't a neuter in Dutch either. Another example: ""aufmachen"" (infinitive) is used where the imperative (""mach auf"") is required instead.<br/><br/>Apart from that distraction, which non-reasonable-German-speaking viewers won't be afflicted by, it is a good story with plenty of suspense and is well acted."

It connects with all your emotions; it really digs deep. Most important of all, it takes you on a journey of an exciting story which you do not have to relate to to understand. I have not yet credited the actors or Verhoeven and so I must applaud their efforts. The story is fantastic but it was the actors that really brought it to life and the strongest performance for me was from Carice van Houten. I have researched how long Verhoeven worked on this film for-over 15 years! It definitely showed and his film was gripping from the opening scene. I do like (not love) war films, but you do not have to like war films to enjoy this. This has a slightly different focus that I believe to be more to do with human values. I would recommend this film especially to anyone that loves action, drama and history: you'll be in for a treat."

Verhoeven regulars Thom Hoffman and Jeron Krabbe (who were both also in ""The 4th Man"") pop up giving strong performances in supporting roles.

"Rapturous_Rich","10","3","8","21 July 2008"," And this is why European cinema needs more recognition.
","A powerful and daring picture, Black Book could have opened up some very old and painful wounds in its native Holland but instead was received with critical appraise, and is thoroughly celebrated as an appreciative look at the war torn times of WWII and the ends people would go to in order to stay alive.<br/><br/>After her family is slaughtered by Nazis, Jewish Rachel Stein (von Houten) joins the Dutch resistance hoping to have a hand in the downfall of the occupation. Seeing as she has nothing much left to live for she takes a life threatening task  infiltrate the Nazi base by befriending and seducing a commanding officer (Koch) and then leak information to the rebels on the outside. But, as these things tend to be like, it isn't that simple and soon enough lines are blurred, mistakes made and most of all Rachel falls for her Nazi boyfriend Muntz While their friendship and love blossoms on the inside, the rebels outside slowly grow assured that she has betrayed them and joined the Nazis and as she becomes a marked woman (due to one bastard officer who 'frames' her), both her and Muntz gradually move to a death sentence at the hands of their respective parties. The lines between good and bad are blurred irrevocably, and rather ingeniously in this film as the freedom fighters Rachel works for are made out to be savage bastards who will kill anyone if they meet even the slightest of loggerheads whom you grow to detest when in actual fact you'd think you'd be supporting them and sympathy for Muntz, for a German Nazi officer, rolls in, as it becomes clearer that he has lost faith in the war effort  or even had any to begin with  and he hopes to escape with Rachel to live out the rest of the war in peace in the countryside.<br/><br/>For Paul Verhoeven, the driving force behind such tripe as Total Recall and Starship Troopers, this is a fantastic and surprisingly mature step in a promising direction and carries echoes of such great war films as Wolfgang Peterson's epic Das Boot where the human spirit is studied and incorporated into German officials of the era in favour of typecast ""Nazi = evil"" representations. By creating a contrast in who's who in the war and who to root for, as well as making their characters so heavily tainted in grey there is no black and white way of looking at these people, Verhoeven has crafted a piece of cinema which is challenging yet merciful and surely a must-see for anyone who is sick of Hollywoodisations of the war.<br/><br/>Read more film reviews at www.wrawreviews.co.uk"
"DICK STEEL","10","3","8","6 June 2008"," A Nutshell Review: Black Book
","I guess the most obvious comparison this movie will go up against, is Lee Ang's Lust, Caution. Both are set during WWII in lands under Axis power occupation, and both involve using the adage of Generals having to stumble over the lure of beauties. This strategy is quite basic in fact and execution, and both movies involve having an ingenue infiltrate their enemy's territory by getting up close and very personal with the respective officers in command, taking a little more than the spreading of limbs to pander to the lusts of men. Even though I had enjoyed Lust, Caution, I would have to say that Black Book notches a rung above it, simply because of it more superior production values, and a storyline a tad more complex and intriguing, that makes the Ang Lee movie look like a walk in the park.<br/><br/>Granted that Lust, Caution involves a story on a more intimate level between two lovers, coupled with the more explicit and widely talked about sexual gymnastics between the leads, Black Book has a more end-to-end feel about wartime espionage in general, with various elements like intelligence gathering, gung-ho raids, assassination and capture, tactics associated these days with terrorist elements and the much used association with freedom fighters all rolled into one coherent story, and keeps you guessing almost all the way with its spy vs spy plotting and counter-plotting, double, triple timing and the poisoning of minds. For its ability to do just that, this is one WWII espionage movie I'll be recommending for quite a while.<br/><br/>Set in 1944 Netherlands near the end of WWII, we see how Rachel Stein (Carice van Houten), a Jew, had to take refuge on the move to avoid capture by the Nazis. Being reunited with her family in their flight from Holland, their escape boat got ambushed by enemy soldiers, and needless to say who had survived the ordeal. Using a new look and new identity as Ellis de Vries, she joins the resistance led by Gerben Kuipers (Derek de Lint) and Hans Akkermans (Thom Hoffman), before being given an opportunity to perform missions more dangerous than being a flower vase in their operations, having demonstrated that she has the intelligence to pull off something more than just sit and smile.<br/><br/>And soon she's sent packing to the regional Gestapo HQ where she has to seduce her mark Ludwig Muntze (Sebastian Koch). Yes, Lust, Caution style all over again, minus the gymnastics, but in Paul Verhoeven style, if you don't get gratuitous violence, you'll get gratuitous nudity. But this movie is not just about how satisfying the sex was for the enemy in order to let slip information that can be used by the resistance. Hell no, it goes more into the questionable motives of all, and I mean all, characters involved. As she was advised early in the story, these are dangerous times to be trusting anyone, and with that ringing in our minds, we too begin to mistrust just about everyone else in the movie, except for of course our heroine.<br/><br/>What I particularly enjoyed, is just how all this lack of trust permeates amongst everyone, even amongst the Resistance, and more so amongst fellow German officers who make side deals and go for personal material gains to satisfy their greed. It's spy vs spy not only amongst the rival groups, but amongst their factions as well, that makes your head go in a dizzy trying to figure things out and ponder about everyone's loyalties. That mental exercise of drawing you into the story rather than to sit idly and watching things as they transpire on screen, makes Black Book a certain winner.<br/><br/>And with these flip-flopping loyalties come the demand from the actors to pull them off. Carice van Houten can give Tang Wei a run for her money, especially when Carice seems more like the tough-as-nails cookie who isn't the demure damsel in distress. She has a lot more spunk in her and does a whole lot more, and if I had to choose between who's the better spy amongst the two, I'd give Carice's Ellis my vote hands down. Sebastian Koch who plays her mark Muntze however, doesn't come across as menacing or dangerous enough though, while Thom Hoffman shone through as the roguish looking resistance fighter who's always first to volunteer for any firefight.<br/><br/>Black Book was released in 2006, which left me wondering why it took so long to arrive on our shores. I had the opportunity to watch it during last year's Hong Kong International Film Festival, but due to scheduling conflicts, had to give the ticket up. So don't waste anymore time in getting to watch this on the big screen at The Picturehouse, which is already into its second week run. Well paced, excellent story and highly engaging, if you don't care much for the Panda, then please open the Black Book and give it a go. Highly recommended."
"rmax304823","8","3","8","30 May 2008"," Excellent film about Dutch resistance.
","Says my TV guide, ""In World War II Holland, a woman of the Jewish resistance falls in love with the German officer she was sent to seduce."" That makes it sound like another sappy love story. We visualize the scene in which the luscious babe holds a trembling pistol against the head of her sleeping Nazi lover, her face a mask of anguish. ""Do I love him too much to kill him""? Actually, it's much more than that, a bitter and adult story of intrigue and betrayal among the Dutch resistance during the German occupation.<br/><br/>Paul Verhoeven directed not only this highly European film but a number of American action movies as well, and he learned his commercial lessons in Hollywood, but he hasn't imported them to his native Holland. This isn't ""Robocop"" or a Schwarzenegger Schlagfest by any means. Lots of nudity, yes, but mostly non-erotic -- and male as well as female. Sharon Stone may open her knees and cross her legs while half a dozen men goggle and lick their lips. Here, Clarice Van Houten bleaches her pubic hair on screen and nothing is made of it except that she is Jewish, has black hair, and is trying to make herself blond all over so as not to be found out.<br/><br/>What horror. And it doesn't follow the usual trajectory, with a climactic shoot out at the end. Most of the good guys die before the end, except the ones who most deserve it. The German officer with whom Clarice falls in love (Jobst Schnibbe) is a fundamentally decent guy who, seeing the war's end, tries to prevent more bloodshed by arranging a truce with the Resistance. These kinds of stories generally call for him to die a heroic, self-sacrificing death, maybe in order to save the girl's life. But it doesn't happen. He dies alright, but only because he's caught, mistaken for a Nazi, and the Canadians who liberate the city permit a cooperative but still fascistic German to carry out the death sentence that has been imposed on Schnibbe. It's not a heroic death. Schnibbe is simply stood up against a stone wall and shot.<br/><br/>If there's a problem with the film, it may be that Verhoeven has learned a little too much from Hollywood. The end of the war, and the liberation of Amsterdam by the British and Canadians, is followed by a lengthy story of mistaken intentions and Allied gloating that lead not just to Schnibbe's death but to the incarceration and humiliation of Clarice by a drunken Dutch rabble. I mean -- they dump a cauldron of human excrement on her, and the scene is drawn out until long after we've grasped the point. And there's a great deal of gun play. It seems to go on and on, while automatic weapons tear bodies apart.<br/><br/>But this is no more a dumb action movie than it is a simple-minded love story. If it has its commercial elements, it at least is ambitious enough to reach for an audience of grown-ups who can understand the complexity of motives and of human nature.<br/><br/>Every once in a while, during a pause in the narrative, I thought of Anne Frank and her family and friends, most of whom lived in Holland and died before the end of the war -- and of Audrey Hepburn too, who managed to live through it."

But what I can not believe is the love that happens between Ellis and the Ludwig Müntze. I was watching the film with my friend and at the end we both agreed that the director has sometimes neglected the ability of the audience to imagine himself as the characters. How can the girl be in love with a Nazi Colonel which is a leader of Jewish killing team? How can she forget her family's murder? <br/><br/>The other great screen writing goof which makes me not love this movie is the role of Hans in cooperating with Germans. You do not see any significant sign of this conjoin in the film up to the last plans. If he had been aware of the Nazi attack in the jail, at the night that they were going to free the resistance prisoners, why did he participate in the liberating operations.

The movie plot which was originally based on several true stories got so twisted up that they can't be seen any longer. The thought behind the movie was a good one but the handing of the theme was pretty dramatic in a negative sense if you dig in to the resistance and occupational history of Holland.

Even if this is based on real events, the director has managed to present them in the most unbelievable way, not once, not twice, but scene after scene until the end, making the spectators sigh with regret and repeating to themselves ""Oh, come on!

The introductory legend of the movie would have us believe this is all based on a true story but what we get instead is a cliché-ridden action-packed screen-fest which to my eyes and ears seriously fails its serious subject matter. There is in the plot I believe, a taut story to be told of the different reactions of a population to military occupation, between collaborators and resistance but nothing gets in the way of the director's juggernaut vision of shoot-'em-up violence, gratuitous nudity and a plot with so many twists and turns it threatens to bore a hole in the floor. We get not one but two traitors in the midst of the resistance fighters and for good measure the most miraculous recovery from an overdose of insulin this side of Lazarus. The actors try hard and there's no denying that Carice Van Houten is strikingly attractive and resourceful in the lead part. But all in all, they're combating hackneyed stereotypical roles and in the main fail to overcome the limitations of the writing. Paul Voerhaven has seemed to me in the past to be more style over content. On this occasion he's got too much content to play with and instead crams his film so that the end product looks like a number of TV episodes badly edited together to make a disappointing whole.

However, I think some things can be more or less objectively agreed upon by people who appreciate the art of film and cinema.<br/><br/>The suspension of disbelief required for this movie to make any kind of lasting impression is MASSIVE. The script feels unfinished, almost as if the rough draft that outlined the films events was passed for a finished product. Where major plot development or emotional discharge is expected, the acting performances fall short and disappoint time and again.<br/><br/>Where do I even begin to exemplify this? I felt like every three minutes something in this movie irritated me to the point that I almost gave up watching it. Was it the jolly and utterly unconvincingly acted coincidental reunion of a Jewish woman with her family after being separated by years of Nazi occupation? Or the lack of emotional burden expressed by her at the equally sudden death of said family moments later vis-a-vis the hysteric attack that ensues after she learns of the execution of her Nazi officer lover, Captain Muntze? Or maybe the blind trust placed by Dutch Resistance fighters in said Captain, who after sleeping with our undercover Jewish heroine turns out to be a very compassionate and helpful guy despite years of service to the Reich? Or possibly the ease with which a Canadian commander, having liberated a Dutch town, is persuaded to comply with a German military tribunal sentence by a NAZI GENERAL, and the crime was NOT carrying out retributions towards FAMILIES OF DUTCH RESISTANCE FIGHTERS? Yes, and there was more, much more.<br/><br/>When the main lead, who by the way is infiltrating a Nazi HQ in order to get back at the enemy, reveals her affiliation with Dutch Resistance to an obviously promiscuous female co-worker of ambiguous loyalty and weak character, you know someone doesn't give two shits about contextual credibility. Even though the setting and premise of the film are interesting, it all becomes irrelevant through it's lack of depth or exploration of...anything. The films pace gives the impression that it was cut by a person with severe ADD who got bored with the scene they were working on between 5 and 10 minutes into it and just wanted to move on to the next one. I mean, when you can't even make a love scene reflect the sexual interest of at least one of the two people about engage in love-making, there really isn't much going for you by that point.<br/><br/>This movie was a joke, a bad one too, and I don't see how this can be classified as one of Paul Verhoeven's so-called ""satirical"" works, thus somehow making it less terrible(?) Anyone who says that should stop talking, because you can't talk me into thinking you actually believe that poppycock. If you have any reverence for the time-period and the genre, you will probably feel the same way I do. If this movie was based on real events, as it states, then I hope it was based on them with a substantial amount of deviation from them."

","Back in the days of the Third Reich when by law it was permissible to treat some people as less than human, it wasn't enough to just kill people. You had to make sure that the state confiscated all their valuables and maybe the state's helpers, helped themselves. And that's what the story of Zwartboek is all about. It's seen through the eyes of a Jewish survivor who did what she had to do to survive. <br/><br/>By the merest chance Carice Van Houten sees her whole family massacred after being scammed out of everything they had by someone who was going to help them and others escape from the Netherlands. Surviving that she finds her way into the Resistance and then because of a chance meeting with a top Gestapo man played by Sebastian Koch with whom she gives her all to find out useful information in general and what exactly happened to her folks in particular.<br/><br/>Zwartboek made over 60 years after the Germans were cleared out of the Netherlands is a mature look back at some terrible times. The Nazis of course are evil, but the Resistance people aren't idealistic heroes. They're allies of convenience in many respects, lots of serious comments about other people's shortcomings are made by characters regarding religion, ethnicity, and politics. Van Houten is accused of caring only about Jews and working on her own personal vendetta.<br/><br/>Sebastian Koch is also a three dimensional character. He's a widower having lost his family in an Allied raid on Hamburg and as such a very easy victim for the charms of Van Houten. But he's also rather ruthlessly seeing which way the wind is blowing and looking to come out of the war alive. Lots of mixed motivations and cross purposes working in Zwatboek.<br/><br/>This German-Dutch production sad to say got no recognition from our own Academy Awards though it seemed to be nominated for something in just about every other country's film society. Shot on location in the Netherlands, Zwartboek is an uncompromising look back at some times that we should be forced to remember."
"btm1","10","2","5","11 February 2009"," World War II from the viewpoint of a resistance fighter
","There have been many films about World War II's European Theater. Among the best ones I can recall at this moment are ""Saving Private Ryan,"" ""Schindler's List"" ""The Great Escape,"" ""Patton,"" and ""The Longest Day."" But none of these were from the viewpoint of a resistance fighter. ""Black Book"" fills that gap and is as powerful a film as any of these. Unlike the others, this one apparently is a work of fiction. <br/><br/>Because the film is a flashback from a kibbutz in 1956 Israel, we know that the protagonist, Rachel Stein aka Ellis de Vries, survives the war. But what she goes through to survive is so dreadful and yet seems so believable. The story keeps you at the edge of your seat all of the time. I don't think there is a dull spot in it. Sometimes it is the suspense of will the partisans accomplish their mission or will they be caught. When battles break out who will survive? If that is not enough to keep you alert, there is also a considerable amount of nudity and debauchery. <br/><br/>The film is mostly believable, but by the end there are so many twists and betrayals that it loses some credibility. However I didn't realize how far fetched it got until it was over and I began to think of all that happened and why the Nazis didn't just destroy the resistance cell without waiting for the partisans to attack before springing their trap. As done, the Nazis as well as the partisans suffer casualties in the traps the Nazis set for them. <br/><br/>Nevertheless, the chaos at the end of the war with vengeance seeking Dutch mobs and with the victorious allies (Canadian soldiers were the liberators) trusting the wrong people seemed all too realistic. <br/><br/>Carice van Houten is terrific as Rachel Stein/Ellis de Vries. <br/><br/>Although much of the film is in German and Dutch with English subtitles, there are times when it is appropriate for English to be spoken."
"Pycal","10","2","5","1 April 2008"," One of the best war films in years.
","Absolutely stunning war flick from Paul Verhoeven. The movie is set in Verhoeven's native Holland in the latter part of WWII and tells the story of a lone Jewish woman hiding from the Nazis. Eventually her cover is blown and she must embark on a deadly voyage to escape the country. Of course all does not go so well and a bevy of horrific events unfold. What follows is an unflinchingly realistic film completely devoid of CGI and Parkinson's like shaky camera. Instead the film relies on a lot of authentic WWII equipment and paints an excellent picture of the period. Moreover, the movie uses more squibs than just about any contemporary film I've seen and even features some Lucio Fulci like gore. I'd even say this film contains what are perhaps some of my favorite action scenes of the decade. The highlight of which is relatively brief, but exciting shootout. Also of note are some pretty liberal doses of nudity (the lead Carice van Houten being extremely sexy). Not to say that I only look for violence and nudity in my films, but It's rarely something I'd complain about it. I also really enjoyed hearing the variety of languages used in the flick. I'd say The 'Black Book' about ties with The 'Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford' as my favorite film of 2007 (though it came out in 2006 in some countries). Much better than Verhoeven's earlier war flick 'Soldier of Orange', and quite possible his best film to date."

","The movie actually begins in 1956 when a bus of tourists pull up to a community in Israel. One of the tourists, a lady, wanders over to the school and takes a flash photo. The teacher begins to admonish her for disturbing her lesson, then they recognize each other, having been in Holland together during the 1940s when Nazi Germany was carrying on operations to round up and dispose of Jews.<br/><br/>Carice van Houten is the lead character Rachel, who takes on the name of Ellis and lightens her hair to avoid being recognized as a Jew. She is the teacher in Israel in 1956. The movie is mostly her story and how she gets to that point in her life. There is a ""black book"" but in the movie we don't come across it until the very end.<br/><br/>This is a very well told story, hard to watch at points because of the depiction of the German mistreatment of the Jews. A key character is Sebastian Koch as German officer Ludwig Müntze who, through a relationship he develops with Ellis turns his focus towards sympathy towards the Jews. <br/><br/>We watched it with old friends who have a reputation for falling asleep during the second half of movies. neither of them even came close to falling asleep, and that is about the highest compliment I can give this movie. It holds your attention all the way.<br/><br/>SPOILERS: The targets were the wealthy Jews in Holland, a trusted lawyer would arrange for their passage to Belgium, but they really were being set up for a massacre, and after killing all of them, stole all their money, gold bars, and other valuables. Rachel/Ellis managed to escape by diving into the water and went undetected. At the end, after her lover Müntze was executed for being a sympathizer and traitor, she found the black book that the lawyer kept, revealing all the conspirators, and she took all the recovered loot to build the center in Israel where she is teaching in 1956."

","I saw it minutes ago, I know it's not very ""objective"" to write comments right after seeing a film, but here we are commentators, not established critics. I was sure I would find this in the Top 250, but I was a bit negatively surprised, again.<br/><br/>Before seeing it I didn't know what it was exactly about, I just knew that it's a story at the time of World War II. I really did not expect such a gripping and twisted thriller, more of a drama and luckily you get all of it. There are moments when you are at the edge of your seat because of the brutality between the Germans and the Dutch resistance, the filmmakers do not spare much with the violence. I haven't seen exactly every movie about WW II, but this one is such that it can really make you squeeze your teeth when you think of the Germans at that time. But I wouldn't say it's in any way offensive of Germans, because by the time of the third part, it seems that the blood is on each and everyones hands.<br/><br/>The story is really one of the most intriguing ones I've seen in a long time. And everything is enriched with the acting, for which the main credits go to Carice van Houten as Rachel Stein/Ellis de Vries. Speaking just out of the blue, she seems to have buckets of talent and if she can handle this, she can handle anything. The supporting cast as well. This film really seems like a quite heavy thing to pull of so authentically as it was. In the end it made me feel exhausted and shaken.<br/><br/>There is also one other thing that is worth mentioning, and that is that this film is not American, which shows a lot in the way it's made. There are scenes that are those by-the-way scenes, pulled of so easily and naturally, but you would probably never see them in a Hollywood picture with similar content. Think of the conversation between Ellis and Ronnie in the toilette, to give just one example. It's true that a lot of American films are adult-oriented dramas, but in a different style than European films. But this kind of difference of European cinema is just another plus in my opinion. All I can say is that Zwartboek is simply a ""two thumbs up"", to express myself in the usual critical manner."

","It felt as if Black Book was a James Bond story taking place during the Second World War but with a female lead instead of the man himself; it felt as if it was the sort of James Bond film that is half way between that espionage, intrigue and one-liner Bond that we knew for years and half way between the 'updated' Bond, ala Casino Royale. Fact of the matter is; this is a secret agent, 'sexpionage' spy flick that includes elements of genuine romance, subplots within subplots and gritty wartime violence  I also found it to be better than all of the Bond films as well as the first two Bourne films.<br/><br/>By the time the end of the Second World War arrives in Black Book, about a half hour to the end of the film, the film has the audacity to keep going. But such is the audacity of the film; to have the major event the film is set beneath finish but the plot to only become further complicated as the proverbial grip is tightened; never before have harmless Dutch villagers waving miniature flags been such a juxtaposed backdrop for underhand and nasty events of double cross and murder. Black Book is a European produced film that does not really fall into either of most of European cinema's dominant aesthetics; those being 'art' and 'realism'  you can tell the director has just spent the last twenty years in Hollywood. Black Book is more of a character study split into different chapters; a character study that the audience is never sure which way it will sway and a character study that would have us question if good people are actually that good and if evil people are actually that evil.<br/><br/>The film tells the story of a mole; of a spy named Ellis (van Houten) who adopts a secret agent role but unlike Bond or Bourne or any other secret agent we may have seen in a film, she is not trained right from the beginning thus forcing another layer, another goal to her journey. This is hinted at very early on before it is even proposed that she become a spy when she says so herself that despite seeing loved ones brutally mowed down, she ""cannot cry"" which tells us of soldier qualities: no matter what the situation; no matter who dies or what happens  soldier on. There is another memorable scene on a train when she uses another aspect of her future soldier qualities; her psychological reflexes and her quick thinking when a guard will shortly be asking for papers: if they ask her and the character she's with, they will be caught but she evades the situation. This incidence oddly enough leads her onto the chance encounter with Ludwig Müntze (Koch), who will the focus of the love story and will challenge her allegiances.<br/><br/>I think what I liked about Black Book despite all the character building; mise-en-scene; sub-genre elements was the way the deaths were presented: there were no glorious deaths; there were no needless killings and whenever certain deaths occur, they just seem to play out in a brutal and coldhearted manner; that is to say you expect someone to come along and rescue them or you expect them to be able to get out of it somehow but the scenes are carried on in a brutal, almost obligatory, manner that hits home. Black Book is a teasing and temping film  it recognises men's weakness for women as well as identifying ego and utilising it for its narrative drive. Since there are not many female secret agents in film and things like the Tomb Raider films are too lacking in subject matter to endorse this sort of ;'expoinage' idea, Black Book is a welcome change to the usual 'kiss, kiss, bang, bang' of a male action hero. This is more 'kiss, kiss, plant, report, kiss, kiss, escape, epiphany.' <br/><br/>Black Book teases because it has the protagonist's goal planted right under their nose. Ellis frequently sees the captives being pulled around and hit down in the cellars; she looks at one of them through a window as she reels off information sheets. We, the audience, even take a break from Ellis' undercover life to witness some Nazi torture the Dutch resistance had to face. And so I am reminded of a male action hero; if a male action hero was that close; was that far into the enemy's lair  the film would be ten minutes away from ending and you can bet anything the body count will have reached large levels by then. But Black Book changes tack to a degree when elements of rescue come into play; romance when the backdrop for the film comes to an end and like most films about war, tragedy will commonly prevail.<br/><br/>The vast Nazi headquarters makes for an excellent setting; inducing dungeons for uneasy scenes of torture, offices for the nitty-gritty dialogue and espionage planting, bedrooms for the activities enforcing elements of trust that become too intense for the character's ideas of love and bathrooms: a space that is purgatory; a space within the space of the HQ that Ellis can visit away from the prying male Germans to either relieve herself from seeing the murderer of loved ones or to get her self out of trouble (best illustrated in the scene when she needs to wash her foot)  it is no coincidence Ellis admits certain things to another character within this room. Whilst gripping and intriguing in its idea, Black Book morphs into a tragedy; a romance; a dark tail evolving around a Macguffin that is the result of treachery  a war film to savour."

","This gripping (true) tale of what the Dutch people went through during the waning days of WWII is masterfully told from the point of view of a young Jewish girl who is forced from hiding and joins the Resistance in order to spy on the Germans and, ultimately, to survive.<br/><br/>The main actress gives a brilliant and daring performance, and the story is so riveting, and at points insane, that it kept me watching in awe at how this group of people will do whatever it takes to survive and triumph over the Axis powers.<br/><br/>My only issue is that it is photographed and designed like a Movie of the Week. Everyone is so perfectly lit, (and overly back-lit), and the sets are soooooo clean that it just screams SOUNDSTAGE! It was so jarringly overproduced that it ripped me from the movie at times, and only the fact that the story/performance was so strong that I kept going.<br/><br/>Now, I know that this is the director's style, and for the most part it works for this other films. But I felt this time it was too campy for the subject matter. For ""Showgirls"" and ""Starship Troopers"" is was shot this same way, but those films were supposed to be ironic and campy, and they worked because of it. Here, it just seemed staged, hokey and sometimes downright silly."

","It's a movie I enjoyed: many twists and turns to keep you guessing, and the stunning female lead put in a memorable performance. It's never boring and there's a lot to be liked about the movie.<br/><br/>But at the same time, the movie feels disjointed. The first part--focusing on Rachel/Ellis's and the Resistance's struggle with the Nazi during the war--is gripping. However, the second part--about Rachel/Ellis looking for the traitor--is an anti-climax and feels tacky. A couple of surprises are sprang on us toward the end, but they are not very convincing. Also, the two parts are not well linked together and it requires a somewhat sudden shift of gear on the part of the audience in order to bring themselves back into the movie.<br/><br/>Another thing I have slight problem with is that the movie is a little too melodramatic and unsubtle. A couple of scenes I think are overdone and really unnecessary. And the movie's a little too black-and-white about the characters, hence making them less than realistic.<br/><br/>This movie bears many of the hallmarks of the director: if you have seen ""Total Recall"" and ""Starship Troopers,"" I guess you would discover some familiar features and styles in this movie. Direct, explicit (or even blunt), melodramatic, and hokey. I think those elements work relatively well in sci-fi movies. Applying them to a more sensitive and real subject like WWII, the result actually is rather interesting. But unfortunately, I think the movie is trying to do/tell too much that it feels a bit unfocused and contrived in the end."

","Seriously, what's going on here? an 8.1 rating? How is this possible I wonder after watching the film and barely finishing it. I'm a big fan of WW2 themed movies and I even found Verhooven's ""Soldaat van Oranje"" to my liking, considering it's from 1977 when WW2 movies were more action oriented without multi layered characters (like One Bridge too Far, etc). But Black book is significantly worse, sometimes you feel like you're watching an old action adventure like ""Where Eagles dare"" (1968). Don't get me wrong, I like that sort of thing in a cartoon black or white goodguy/badguy kind of way, but it has little to do with reality, which seems to be Veerhoven's intention to portray (granted he tries to spice it up a bit). But shallow characters a predictable plot and cliché typed dialogue makes this movie a big disappointment. After the release of recent films like ""Der Untergang"" and ""Sophie Scholl"" I'm quite surprised that ""Black Book"" is able to impress the people on IMDb enough to give it an 8 range rating. Maybe it's the old romantic portrayal of the second world war that people like. Uncomplicated, straight good guys versus evil bad guys. Because the fact that there are exceptions of a single good German in this film and two single ""bad"" dutchmen are definitely not enough to overshadow the classic stereotypes."

With too many melodramatic moments and a highly commercial approach to presentation has not done enough justice to live up to the words in the beginning 'Based on real life events'. The resistance group is full of caricature characters you will find in any sort of group - an aggressor, a thinker, a comedian, a guilt driven paranoid etc. The dilemmas, perspectives and consequences that happen on the immediate aftermath of German surrender to the Allied Forces has never been dealt before - that too this period is not just a commentary based factual display but a proper thriller thread is induced here.

The film starts out rather typical, informing us with what we already new about the war: people where poor, hungry and trying to survive. However, the second part of the film shows a less well known part of Dutch resistance history: that the war brings out the worst in everybody. Without losing sight of the importance of the resistance against the foreign repression, Paul Verhoeven confuses his audience by visualizing how ones own well-being seems to go at the cost of the well-being of another. No black and white, no bad or good, but only the individual choice, that is tormented by the will to survive and a feeling for morality.<br/><br/>The film is daring for showing the dark side of the Dutch national history. However, the most valuable of the film is that it captivates its audience and sensitizes its audience for the misery of the historical event of World War II, but also the contemporary difficulties that affects human beings rather than countries.

","""Black Book"" is an excellent film about a seldom talked about period and place in history--the final days of Holland during the Nazi occupation. Unfortunately, however, it is not a film for everyone because it is very, very graphic--in many different ways. As a result, it clearly is not a film for everyone and I certainly would not recommend it to kids or the easily offended. It's sad, because with a few edits, this would have been a fantastic film--one for everyone. But, at heart, it's still an exceptional film.<br/><br/>Carice van Houten did a great job in the lead. She played 'Ellis'--a Jewish lady whose hiding place was destroyed in 1944--a year before the war ended. Now with no place to hide, she and her family head to supposed freedom in Belgium (which at this point in time is under Allied control). But they are betrayed in a scheme to loot and then murder all of them. Yet somehow, she escaped and falls into the lap of the Dutch Resistance. There she is soon called upon to do something horrid--to seduce the local head of the SS and thereby infiltrate the Nazis. And, as she's beautiful and a very talented singer, she is soon in a position where she can help the Resistance. But it isn't all that easy. First, many different surprising things occur--and I won't mention them to you because I don't want to spoil the film. But one I will mention is the surprise--as eventually she finds herself in love with her quarry--a Jewish lady falling for and having sympathy for a 'good Nazi'! <br/><br/>Let's talk about the acting. First, it's interesting that van Houten didn't get nominated for a Best Actress award, as she did exactly what another recent great performance did. In ""Inglourious Basterds"", Christoph Waltz rightly wowed the Academy--with his fine acting AND great multilingual performance. Well, van Houten did the same--speaking four different languages and doing a heck of a performance. Plus, she really allowed the director, Paul Verhoeven, to put her through a hellish performance! The difference, I think, is that ""Black Book"" was not a Hollywood production AND it was not a nominee for Best Foreign Language film. In addition, can van Houten looked better simply because all her supporting actors did a great job as well. You can't help but give a great performance when those around you are professionals on top of their game.<br/><br/>As for the graphic aspects of the film, the worst was not the nudity (though there was a lot, I could at least understand the purpose to almost all of it) but the gross imagery not necessarily related to the war. Now it did not bother me seeing dead bodies--wars are about death. But I did NOT want to watch people urinate, throw up or have HUGE buckets of human waste dropped on them. Couldn't have been done without this?! <br/><br/>The film, aside from the nasty graphic portions, was nearly perfect. And, despite its length, it was neither over-long nor had any lulls. Exciting, compelling and very different. This is a film you may love but it's a hard one to to respect."

","I think I could probably count the number of foreign films I've seen out of my own choice on one hand. I am also not exactly the hugest fan of Paul Verhoeven. But there was so much hype surrounding this film, ""Black Book"", that I just had to see it.<br/><br/>I'm glad I did. This film brings back to memory the classic war spy films of the 40s, 50s and 60s, where brave men and women risked their lives against the Nazis for freedom. But the fact that it is based on real events creates a very sinister atmosphere to it, none more so than during the final third of the film, where history once again shoves a bitter blow to the face of ""peace lovers"" by showing what happened to those poor men and women who fell in love with Nazi soldiers or sympathised with them.<br/><br/>There are some excellent performances here, but although he seems to have come back with a bang, I just can't stick Verhoeven. It is now obvious after more than 20 years of his films where his interests lie - blonde women and violence. Just look at Sharon Stone in ""Basic Instinct"", Denise Richards in ""Starship Troopers"", even Elizabeth Berkley in ""Showgirls"" - and now Carice van Houten. If this is the way in which Verhoeven is to become an auteur, I suppose you could argue that he is a sub-par Hitchcock, but then I shudder at the comparison.<br/><br/>It's a shame, because this is a great movie, with plenty of twists and good historical background. You genuinely feel for Rachel/Ellis as life keeps dealing her with bitter blows. In the same instance, however, it does leave quite a few questions open - how does she get to Israel for a start? Ultimately, the theme is of violence once again - with the ending shot a rather pessimistic view of the rest of the 20th century.<br/><br/>7/10"

","Best Verhoeven ever. It's a true old-style epic on World War II and the occupation of Holland, done with all that particular charm of those 30s movies that seemed never to return. However, the true miracle is Carice van Houten who tops the wonders of this film by delivering that hard-as-nails charm known from Paulette Goddard or Jean Arthur. She's as beautiful as both, and Vivien Leigh to boot, but - courtesy of the 21st millennium - bares more of her charms than the old stars ever did. It's van Houten's performance that saves the film from becoming merely a truly great thriller or whodunit, although, it must be said, Sebastian Koch (the dramatist in Das Leben der Anderen) does his bit, too. In fact, the entire film seems devoid of substandard acting. I could go on and on and on, but suffice it to say that Zwartboek is one of those films that you hope for throughout decades, and just when you give up - by way of a miracle, there it is. It ought to make the Foreign Language Oscar!"
"zetes","10","1","2","1 October 2007"," Exceptional flick. One of the best 2007 releases.
","Stunning, gripping WWII thriller that plays like a pulpier version of Jean-Pierre Melville's Army of Shadows. That's not something that should be criticized, I think. There's nothing wrong with being entertaining when dealing with serious subjects, as long as the film stays respectful of its subject. And Black Book is respectful. It's tense and exciting, but it always made me understand that these were real people who were undergoing real suffering. I was both extremely entertained and involved in the situation of these characters. Carice van Houten stars, and is brilliant as a Jewish girl who escapes several near-death encounters to end up working with the Dutch resistance movement near the end of the war. She infiltrates a Nazi headquarters by seducing an officer (Sebastian Koch of The Lives of Others). While the film starts off as a very black and white, resistance vs. Nazis flick, things get more and more complicated and, after a while, no one can be trusted. You never know what will happen next. The film-making is very classic, and nearly perfect. Verhoeven has always been an interesting filmmaker, but his work is plagued by sloppiness in both direction and writing. Black Book exhibits few flaws (I might have rethought the opening, which assures us immediately that the protagonist will survive the war). It's one of the most satisfying cinematic experiences I've had in a very long time."

","which I liked but which had a simple plot. I wouldn't have bothered to make any comments on this movie if it weren't for the fact that a couple of days after having seen Black Book it dawned on me how all the details of the plot fit together. I left the movie wondering who the fellow with the helmet whom Muntze was chasing through the crowd was. Suddenly two days later it dawned on me and how all the characters fit together. This elicited the feeling that Verhoeven is a cinematic genius and my admiration for him is boundless. This movie is not just a very good movie, it is fantastic - but not in the sense of fantasy, but how reality is better than fiction. Admittedly it was ""inspired"" by a true story and thus embellished upon, but to show in movie form the progress of the main character's insights and to the final realization of the big picture, that in my opinion was Verhoeven's genius."

","Passed off as a true story, the film begins and ends with Rachael AKA Ellis in an Israeli camp. How she gets there takes us through 2 1/2 hours of World War II in the Netherlands and the Dutch Resistance.<br/><br/>As with about 200 other movies since 1960, the focus begins and ends with the Jews. There is no mention of Hitler's infamous bombing of 20,000 buildings in Rotterdam in 20 minutes --- with Dutch people in them. Hitler not bothering to wait for the Dutch response to his surrender ultimatum. Nope, the whole thing is just about the Jews; indeed one Dutchman even says Oh, well, we're nearly German anyway. Oh, sure!<br/><br/>Anyway Jewish brunette Rachel becomes blonde non-Jew Ellis and will have to face watching her entire family shot down when an escape to safety in Belgium is betrayed. Her saga is always interesting as she not only works with the Resistance but as part of it she meets and will truly love a German SS Officer, the hoptgrossenfuhrer who gives most of the orders killing people, Jews and non-Jews alike. The story gets muddled and confused -- as war must be -- but it's morality is annoyingly inconclusive.<br/><br/>World War II in Europe has been successfully re-written over the past 40 years -- mostly by successful movies -- to the extent that young people today think it was all about the Jews. It wasn't. It was about the invasion of Poland, of Czechoslavakia, of the Netherlands, of France, the bombing of London --- so much more than just the Jews. Such films have downplayed and forgotten the patriotic sacrifices of millions of Catholics, Protestants, et cetera who fought the tough fight and ended the Nazi madness. They, not the Jews, were over 90% of those who lost their lives in World War II Europe. <br/><br/>Teach your kids, and tell the truth."

","World War II covers so much ground that it is impossible to tell every story that happened during that period. Despite being one of the bloodiest and most destructive periods in human history, it has provided the world with many captivating stories, ranging from ""Schindler's List"" to ""The Pianist."" Now joining that list is Paul Verhoeven's ""Black Book.""<br/><br/>Rachel Stein (Carice van Houten) is a young Jewish singer who is the only survivor after a botched escape attempt that killed her family. Now she works for the Resistance in Holland (under the name Ellis de Vries), and becomes embroiled in a scheme that that leaves her wanted by both the Nazis AND the Resistance.<br/><br/>There are two names that stand out in this movie: Verhoeven and van Houten. Their work is outstanding in this picture, and while everything about this film is superbly done, they are the ones to remember.<br/><br/>Paul Verhoeven is adept at drawing the most out of his movies, whether it be the good (""Black Book"") or the bad (""Starship Troopers""). I'm willing to forgive him for the latter film (not much can be done when you have Casper van Dien in the lead), especially when he makes movies like ""Black Book."" Like in probably his most famous movie, ""Basic Instinct,"" he gives us another terrific female lead, Carice van Houten.<br/><br/>Carice van Houten is a force to be reckoned with here. She's smart, tough when she has to be, but she still shows a lot of vulnerability. van Houten gives it all in her performance (in more ways than one). This is an outstanding performance, and I am anxious to see what her career holds for her.<br/><br/>The other actors are great as well. Sebastian Koch is solid as Ellis's lover, who manages to get our sympathy despite who he is. Waldermar Kobus is despicable as Franken, who is always fearsome and loathing. Halina Reijn is great as the ditzy, oversexed Ronnie. The weakest is Thom Hoffman (looking strikingly similar to Edward Burns), who despite not being bad, can't command the attention that his fellow actors do.<br/><br/>If there is anything to complain about, and there isn't much, it's with the ending. It's not what happens, it's how Verhoeven handles it. The final explanation is pretty confusing, even after a second viewing. Also, the actors seem to switch languages at random times, though all of it is spoken flawlessly (which is in and of itself a problem, however slight).<br/><br/>Still, this is a great movie. Highly recommended! This is a great movie, and Verhoeven's best."

","ZWARTBOEK (Black Blook) is an amazingly well written, well paced and well directed world war II action/drama directed by one of my all time favorite directors: Paul Verhoeven. I'm a huge ROBOCOP/STARSHIP TROOPERS/TOTAL RECALL, etc... fan. I even found SHOWGIRLS to be not that bad at all. Anyway, Verhoeven did this film in his native Holland and I was actually expecting a kind of indie-styled war drama, you know: good but low budget. How wrong was I? Had this movie been done in Hollywood it would have amassed several academy award nominations. It's a slick looking picture with all the technical savvy of a Hollywood picture. Paul Verhoeven has put all his Hollywood knowledge into great use to make ZWARTBOEK an engrossing picture.<br/><br/>The movie deals primarily with the story of Rachel Stein, a beautiful Jewish girl living in German occupied Holland. While trying to get away from Holland, her family is mercilessly executed by the SS, after a fellow countryman had told her it was safe to cross into Belgium at night through the river. She manages to escape and joins a resistance group in Holland, where she is given the task to infiltrate the SS and pass herself as a German cabaret singer. In the process, she falls for Gestapo officer Müntze. At first, Müntze suspects she's a spy and after he finally finds out who she is, he also falls madly in love with her. The movie then turns into a series of conspiracies and double crossing friends. The action never lets up, and there's hardly a boring moment in the entire film (it is way over 2 hours, but they fly by at high speed!). As with other Verhoeven films, there's plenty of sex and violence to please old time fans, but there's also a solid story and great acting by dutch actress Carice Van Houten. She is really hot in this movie and her acting is what makes this picture so entertaining and believable. If she ever decides to go Hollywood, she's gonna blow some young actresses away in a Milli second! Sebastian Koch as Müntze and Thomas Hoffman as the resistance doctor are also superb.<br/><br/>Some people have argued that this is probably Paul Verhoeven's crowning achievement and they maybe right: the movie has everything going for it. It really took me by surprise since I was expecting something not THIS good. Make no mistake: ZWARTBOEK is a roller-coaster ride of a movie and it won't disappoint you!"

Compare it to Nazi Germany. You won't be able to tell the difference. It's sick and ironic at the same time. Concentration camps, walled neighborhoods, special identifying badges, military checkpoints in civilian areas, disappearing protesters in the night, etc... this all in a day's work for the modern Israeli government.... what a huge insult to survivors of the Jewish holocaust- to use their good name to fund an invasion like the Nazi invasion of Poland (the creation of Israel)and support for the Arab holocaust (the unwarranted mass murder of over a million innocent civilians in lebanon, palestine, iraq and afghanistan), well under way and over a million innocent dead already.<br/><br/>Your tax dollars at work.

When it was over I called my (Dutch) girlfriend and said 'it's an absolutely awful film!'. I agree it is easy on the eye and Carice van Houten is great to look at but the story is preposterous. It's exciting, moving and compelling, but some of the twists are just too much, bearing in mind this is supposed to be a serious film about the Dutch in World War 2. Having said that, I did tell my girlfriend to go see it, if only to hear her opinion. I SO wanted to love it. I was SO disappointed. I can't detail any of the nonsense twists without spoilers but there is one episode that is so far fetched as to bely belief. Also (this isn't a spoiler) are we really supposed to believe that the Nazi SS commander and head of Gestapo in Amsterdam, Muntze, is really a pretty nice guy underneath. He's SS, Gestapo, for goodness sake. We're supposed to be rooting for him? Don't think so!"

","I watched it last night and thought it was far more successful than 'Soldaat Van Oranje'. Zwartboek really put over the blurred lines and confusion of resistance and collaborators and was full of detail and events. The other film has loads of that ""provocation"" he's famous for, a poke in the ribs seemingly without reason or need. I understand, I think, what he was doing. It seems to me to be part of the Dutch character to strip all things down to what they really are; to what is real. His provocation was a poke in the ribs, but really one that bursts a bubble, to show instead (or beneath to) what is real. I see his method but it still just feels like a poke in the ribs to me! With Zwartboek he has a mature voice, not needing the farce elements of the earlier film, but showing reality in all its complexity and at the same time fleshing it out with character and his characters. I think it's my 2nd favourite Dutch film, after 'Father And Daughter'."
"jackjack-2","3","3","16","23 December 2007"," Sex, sex, and more sex.
","This maybe an interesting movie to the mindless but it has some serious problems. It is supposedly based on true events but the story itself is a combination of a number of different events that occurred during the occupation of the Nehterlands during WWII, which were unrelated. There was a story of a Jewish woman who became the mistress of a Gestapo officer. There is a story about how the Gestapo stole from Dutch Jews, and there are stories about the Dutch Underground. This movie attempts to tie all these stories together but it just makes the story a bad piece of historical fiction. The connections don't always work and appear to be fabricated. For example, the house in which the Jewish refugee is hiding is blown up by an American bomb while she away from the house with a man in a sailboat. Supposedly, the Gestapo find her Jewish identity card in the house wreckage. But in reality, if she was a Jewish refugee, she would have destroyed her identity card. And secondly, the Gestapo nor the police are going to investigate a house blown up by an American bomb. And because the house was in the countryside, it was unlikely that a firetruck would arrive at the house at all, much less within five minutes of the bombing as depicted in the movie.<br/><br/>Another flaw is that nothing happens to the heroine's girl friend after the war. She was a prominent collaborator and instead of being punished, she celebrates the end of the war. These are only two of the inconsistencies in the movie.<br/><br/>The movie is more about setting up a platform to depict nudity and sexual activity. It is more porn than truth."

Despite the 2 1/2 hour length, the plot is too fast-paced and feels more like a Hollywood action film.<br/><br/>Events that should be upsetting - such as the murder of the main protagonist's family - are dealt with in a matter-of-fact manner, quickly moving onto the next scene without thought.<br/><br/>Others end up looking ridiculous, with over-the-top efforts to throw in some sort of ""twist"". This is particularly true for the climax of the film which sees a sad and compelling situation of misunderstanding descend into farce.<br/><br/>""Black Book"" is a very shallow and disappointing film which fails to make the emotional impact that the likes of ""The Pianist"" or ""Schindler's List"" do."

It is an ordinary story more suited for a television series that goes on and on and on, and which ends with a (sort of) Hollywood ending. The actors walk through the film with unconvincing performances (Think of how much more interesting Sebastian Koch was in ""Lives of Others"") and the camera does not help create any special atmosphere. This is a about a feisty Jewish girl in 1944 Holland who survives by her wits, chutzpa and the allure of her body. This has been done many times before and much more effectively and interestingly.

","This movie has everything!!! I was disappointed at the end because I didn't see Hitler fly into Paris on a Zeppelin balloon, jump on a bicycle and win the Tour de France, bribing the officials with stolen jewels from murdered Jews. But other than that, it simply has everything. Every single plot twist ever shown on the screen before, or to be found in pulp fiction smut magazines of the Forties. Naked sexy chicks? Got it. Mean Nazis whipping and having sex with said naked sexy chicks? Got it. Nazis shooting double-crossed innocents? Yup, got that, times three or four! I must correct other reviewers who seem to think this movie was based on fact. The titles actually say that it was inspired by true events. It was also inspired by the cigarettes they smoke in Holland that are not legally available elsewhere. I will give the writers some credit – there actually was a second world war, but that's about as far as the movie parallels reality.<br/><br/>There are, in point of fact, about twenty betrayals and double-crosses in the plot, and a few false double-crosses where the lead character is thought to be a double-crosser but isn't really and she must prove her innocence before she can be killed. So on that score, this film wins on sheer volume and repetition of a plot mechanism. It becomes somewhat difficult to bear when we see Canadian soldiers hand out rifles to captured Germans after the war so they can shoot one of their own, a gentle, kind-hearted, sweetheart of a man who's in charge of the Gestapo and secretly saving the lives of guilty resistance fighters.<br/><br/>The film also can win the Most Implausible Coincidences award for all the incidents that it uses to move a sluggish plot forward. For instance, how did the evil Dutch doctor (muahahaha) know that our intrepid Jewish heroine would convulse in uncontrollable grief upon hearing of the death of her Gestapo-boss lover? So that he could inject her with a 'sedative'. (muahahaha!!!) And why did the after-war prisoners (collaborators) haul up a cauldron of sewage twenty feet into the air? Is that what you do with sewage? Haul it up in the air? Just so it could be poured by the gang of haters onto our heroine? Did they know she'd be there? The worst of the implausible events is when the resistance fighters try to kidnap a double-crosser who leads Jews to their deaths in order to steal their wealth. The evil-doer (muahahaha) puts up a struggle and gets the upper hand, and a religious zealot has the only working gun, but he can't shoot because he'd be taking a life. The heroine is being strangled to death but the Christian can't kill to save her. The villain calls her a 'damn' whore and the Christian is so overcome with anger at the swearing that he is now able to start shooting the evil swearing man. He fills him with bullets and his friends have to pull him away from shooting more, not for choking a woman mind you, but for blaspheming. Only gold leaf can be stretched this far, but credulity, mmmm, not so much.<br/><br/>Here is some truth about Holland's contribution to the war. It had a popular Nazi party. It fielded more than 25,000 soldiers to fight along side the Germans in Dutch SS divisions on the Russian front. This film about intense underground warfare, a complete myth, is nothing more than an attempt to firmly lock the closets, paper over the wall, and hide the skeletons of a not-so-glorious past. That can be the only explanation why such a fantasy could receive government funding. Blackbook is a brilliant example of inept writing, re-using plot twists and double-crosses, sex and violence ad nauseum, not until the story had come to a logical end, but until the funding ran out. Unfortunately, it also succeeds in draining one's patience, and I apologize to the actors. It must have required extreme professionalism to give top notch performances without bursting into laughter after each take, and to their credit they did not."

","Except for a couple of outlandish twists at the very end of the movie, Zwartboek (Black Book)might be a candidate for best World War II movie. As it is, Carice van Houten as Rachel Stein, a young Jewish woman who joins the Dutch resistance when she narrowly escapes an ambush in which the rest of her family is killed, performs brilliantly, and she is well matched by Sebastian Koch as Ludwig Muntze, the high-ranking Gestapo official whom Rachel agrees to seduce on behalf of the Resistance group she joins. Supposedly, the film is ""based on"" a true story, and that may be so. It is possible to believe that the Nazis discover she is a spy and trick the Resistance into believing she has betrayed them, putting her in life-threatening danger from both sides. That she might actually have fallen in love with Muntze, the ""good Nazi,"" is plausible. That Muntze may have risked his own life to preserve hers is also plausible. The tension and the danger faced by both characters is brilliantly sustained by director Paul Verhoeven, who is also credited as co-author of the script. This viewer was prepared for certain of the betrayals that emerge toward the film's end; they made perfectly good sense. I won't describe the two other events that made no sense whatever, but they went a long way toward undermining the credibility of what was otherwise a totally convincing story. I'd certainly award a 10 to the first 95 percent of the movie and a 1 to the final 5 percent. Both Ms. van Houten and Koch hold up their ends extremely well. On the strength of the first 95 percent, I awarded Zwartboek an 8."

","Director Paul Verhoeven, infamous in America for his ultra-violent satires like ""Total Recall"" and ""Robocop"" and his paranoid thrillers like ""Basic Instinct"", returned to his native Holland to make this complex and beautiful film about hypocrisy and human character in the context of a story about the Dutch resistance in the last days of WWII. He found an incredible leading lady in Carice van Houten, and matched her up with the dynamic Thom Hoffman and the stolid and emotive Sebastian Koch to come up with a dizzying mixture of romance, terror and paranoia.<br/><br/>Rachel Stein (van Houten) is a young Jewish woman forced to give up her livelihood as a singer in Germany and go into hiding. When she witnesses the brutal death of her entire family at an SS death squad's hands, she goes undercover as the lover of the SS commander Muntze (Koch) to get her own revenge. But she finds that it's not easy to know between good and evil, friend and foe, when money and power are involved.<br/><br/>There's something of a mystery element to the plot, which keeps us guessing at all times regarding different characters' motives and actions. Towards the end of the film this produces an astonishing moral disorientation, as we're pulled inescapably into sympathizing with several Nazi characters and into recognizing the really horrible actions that victims can perpetrate on their one-time persecutors. There's a place where the film takes us where one would want to simply throw down one's hands and give up on the species -- but just as soon as he's let that sink in, Verhoeven reveals the film's true heroes to us and allows for the possibility of morally repugnant but emotionally satisfying revenge to come to fruition.<br/><br/>I just cannot say enough about how excellent von Houten and Koch are in this film -- their natural chemistry, the zesty way they play their love scenes, the furtive glances and the emotional revelations. Of course their romance is deeply controversial and dangerous, but we do really feel like they made a real human connection. The point of the movie isn't to say ""well, there were some Nazis who were good."" It's to say that good and evil themselves mean nothing to people going through such situations and circumstances, so far beyond what human beings in a civilization should have to go through. At a certain point, the real human connection is all that we have.<br/><br/>This is the best film I've seen by Verhoeven. His bold use of grotesque violence in this film is among its more daring artistic leaps. It's the same kind of violence that he used in his ridiculous action movies, and while we're used to more taste and sentimentality being put into death in a historical film, it accurately and directly conveys the naked reality of the situation, at a time when even the ostensible ""good guys"" couldn't really afford to be noble about anything. Although the film is full of graphic sex and violence, I would argue that it is less an ""exploitation"" film than most of the more ""tasteful"" epics we've seen from Hollywood on the subject of the holocaust and the war. There is no false or unearned sentiment in this movie; the movie and the characters don't have time for it.<br/><br/>It's a gorgeous, profound, provocative film that takes the dialog about the holocaust and WWII to another level in terms of screen stories."

I did a little research and its true that by the time of the events in the film, the German foreign intelligence service  Abwehr  which had been run by an anti-Nazi, Admiral Canaris, had been absorbed into this service, and if Muentze was a former Abwehr man, it gets a little more plausible. But for me it would have helped if one of the tougher Nazis had made a crack about Muentze being out-of-place, a transferee from a different service whose personality made him good at achieving cooperation from the Dutch, but suspect as a real Nazi. <br/><br/>2. The plot did not require Rachel's Nazi-lover to have the high level job Muentze is given, since Rachel does not actually get any secrets from him, nor is she the one who negotiates the agreement for leniency from him. Muentze would have been more plausible as a lower- level officer, and the plot could have proceeded just fine without him holding the higher post. The only plot reason to have him hold such a high-level post is so that in the train sequence, his rank intimidates the investigators from searching Rachel's bags. And, of course, a hot chick like Rachel gains status if her lover is a top boss, even in the Nazis. <br/><br/>3. There is no way the Canadians, after taking-over the city, would have permitted the Nazis to enforce a military death-order on an officer with the high rank of Muentze, who would be an important source of information and intelligence  and especially when the order stemmed from Muentze's efforts to strike a deal to save Dutch lives. Having him executed was totally unbelievable. Dramatically, he had to die, probably as a lynching by Dutch partisans  although the problem with that is that it would taint his movie image as a good guy worthy of Rachel's love. <br/><br/>4. In the beginning of the film, on the day Rachel's hide-out is destroyed, the supposedly- helpful Dutch police officer arrives at dinner-time at her new hideout to warn her to flee because the German authorities have figured out that a Jew is probably hiding there. But then when she asks for his help, he says he will be back for her in the morning. In the morning? Hours later? What about the Germans  wasn't Rachel just told the Germans should be expected any moment? And when he tells her to bring lots of money, it isn't because she has to pay for her escape to Belgium, it's to live on in Belgium after escaping. Rachel should wonder why he gives her advice on her need for money in Belgium, since she could figure out as well as he how much money she would need there. <br/><br/>5. The other Dutch woman who works for the Nazis talks about how, on liberation, she will be seized and punished for her collaboration  but then in the victory parade, she is perched on a jeep, in full view of everyone, happy, not persecuted, even as she sees other women being shamed and having their hair shaved for being collaborators. Now, it is true that by distracting the Germans at the end she makes it possible for Muentze and Rachel to escape, but the Dutch see Muentze and Rachel as bad. Her escape from shaming is not explained.<br/><br/>6. When the main betrayer frees Rachel from the Dutch prison, she gets her belongings, and he sees that these include the ""black book""  a notebook he has never seen her with before. Yet he must know that she was seized in the offices of the lawyer, Smaal, who he, or his confederate, assassinated in order to silence him. So the main betrayer would be highly attuned to any evidence that Rachel might have taken from the lawyer, yet he shows no interest in even looking at the book. His carelessness about the book is implausible. This should have been handled differently. Something or someone  perhaps an enthusiastic hero-worshipper  should distract him at the moment the jailer produces the book, so that the main betrayer never becomes aware that Rachel has any book. <br/><br/>7. The coffin the main betrayer ends up being trapped in has a breathing slot  we know that from when Rachel was in the coffin early in the film, and we are reminded of that again at the end when the bad guy shoves money and jewels out of the slot in an attempt to bribe Rachel. Neither Rachel nor the main resistance leader is shown blocking up the air-hole, nor do they mention blocking it up. So when the main betrayer falls silent at the end it cannot be from death due to lack of oxygen. Maybe they filmed Rachel blocking the air-hole and discovered that test audiences didn't like the way it tainted their image of Rachel, so it was cut, but if we are meant to think the main betrayer died of lack of oxygen this air-hole is a major plot-hole."

","Thank G-d for the Dutch having the moral authority to tell the world how to think and behave. What would we do without them? The movie is worth watching but the forced plot and Speilbergesque silly action parts and pandering get really tiresome (Speilberg was born in Holland so the comparison is not random). I am no historian but the idea of an organized Jewish/gentile Dutch resistance seems implausible to me (their unions agreed to strike to support the Normandy invasion but only if the Allies agreed to make up for the lost wages). Glossing over the starvation that occurred in 1945 makes the movie even more superficial (one scene with kids scraping food out of trashcans based on one very overplayed dutch propaganda film). What is interesting though is how the movie moves between at least 3 (maybe 4 or 5) languages with no subtitles in the version I saw. The plodding preachy forced plot is very typical of Dutch movies. If you are not Dutch or have not lived in Holland you will probably have a better opinion of the movie than I did."

","Paul Verhoeven and Quentin Tarantino belong to a separate category of directors. Their films loaded with violence and in the case of Verhoeven and eroticism, both explicit and extreme to the conventional tastes, risk calculated and intentionally attracting the public for the wrong reasons. Paul Verhoeven's 'Zwartboek' ('Black Book' or 'Black Book') from 2006 is in many ways similar to 'Inglourious Basterds' which Tarantino brought to the screens in 2009. Both films are approaching the final period of -the Second World War in a very different way from other films dealing with this war, the Resistance, and the Holocaust. The two films copiously use elements from the spy and action movie kit to tackle a theme where there apparently wouldn't be much room for an entertainment atmosphere. In addition, both films use the entertainment vehicle to bring to light less-known and less-accepted aspects, some very uncomfortable, about those spent in that troubled historical period.<br/><br/>The story takes place in the last year of WWII in the occupied Netherlands, a period during which the mass deportations of Jews by the Nazis and their local accomplices took place. Rachel Stein, the main heroine of the film (played by the attractive and talented Carice van Houten ), a young and beautiful Jewish singer, sees the Dutch family hiding her killed, and then her entire family slaughtered in an attempt to save themselves by fleeing to liberated Belgium. Obliged to remain in the Netherlands, she joins a Resistance group. Receiving the mission to infiltrate the German command in The Hague, she meets the Gestapo chief, discovers that he is more human than many of his subordinates and falls in love with him. This relationship is just one of the less believable elements of a plot that is about as realistic as a James Bond movie script. The non-credible love story between the Jewish survivor and resistant and the Gestapo chief cannot end well, and after the end of the war, Rachel (or Ellis in her assumed identity) is suspected of treason and accused of collaboration with the Nazis. The end of the war does not mean justice for all criminals or relief for all their victims. All will end well, somehow, for those who will survive.<br/><br/>145 minutes of screening pass quickly for action movies fans. From a visual point of view 'Black Book' often looks like a Hitchcock movie, except that the element of psychological terror adds a lot of explicit violence plus the dose of eroticism characteristic to most of Verhoeven's films. But these should not distract attention from a few unique elements. History is not at all embellished in this movie. Jews trying to save their lives buy their freedom with money, jewelry and gold bars. The help received from others is not always disinterested, and Jews are often robbed and betrayed. The members of the Resistance are not presented strictly under a heroic light, there are also traitors among them, they are divided by ideological and religious conflicts. Not all Germans in the movie are 'bad guys' and not all Dutch are 'good guys'. The post-Liberation justice is far from impartial, and the behavior of the victors towards those suspected of collaboration is as violent and humiliating as the one of the Nazis, even if it is adorned with national colored flags. 'Black Book' was the returning home movie of Verhoeven after a two decades career in Hollywood. The film was well received despite its critical aspects. Verhoeven's style is visible not only in the visual treatment and the commercial cinematographic elements, but also in the extreme ambiguity of some of the situations. As for many of his films, from 'Black Book' we will later remember the controversies."

","Before he dazzled Hollywood with his blood-soaked satires Robocop (1987) and Starship Troopers (1997) - and made us cringe with Basic Instinct (1992) and Showgirls (1995) - director Paul Verhoeven made Soldier of Orange (1977) in his native Netherlands, a film about the Dutch resistance movement during World War II which starred Rutgher Hauer. Almost thirty years later, and only six years since Hollow Man (2000) seemed to drain him of his creativity, Verhoeven returned to his homeland to make Zwartboek (Black Book), and to again highlight his country's heroic struggle during the Nazi occupation.<br/><br/>In 1944, Dutch Jew Rachel Stein (Carice van Houten), a singer living in Berlin before the war, hides from the Nazi regime in the war-torn Netherlands. When the farmhouse she was hiding in is destroyed by the Americans, she is forced to flee, reuniting with her family before setting off by boat to the safer south. However, the boat is ambushed by the Nazis and Rachel narrowly escapes with her life, watching her entire family murdered in the process. Lost and alone, she decides to join the resistance in The Hague, where her many talents are put to good use. A chance meeting on a train leads her to charming the socks off high-ranking Nazi officer Ludwig Muntze (Sebastian Koch), so Rachel, under the guise of Ellis de Vries, is given the task of seducing him.<br/><br/>World War II movies seem to be made with one of two intentions. One is to delve into the human soul and explore the horrors of battle, and the other is to simply entertain. Verhoeven's movie seems to lie somewhere in between, and the results are intriguing to say the least. Too often does the drama get interrupted by an unnecessary gun battle or explosion for the film to be taken too seriously, but, even at 145 minutes, Black Book is never in danger of dragging. It also never misses an opportunity to get van Houten in the nude, but to anyone familiar with the work of Paul Verhoeven, this will come as no surprise. While the actress now most famous as Melisandre the Red Priestess in Game of Thrones is staggeringly beautiful, her constant clothes-shedding hardly serves the plot or her character.<br/><br/>In fact, Black Book asks a hell of a lot of van Houten, who is forced to don a number of faces and personalities as her character digs herself deeper into the role of secret agent and uncovers betrayals and secret plots at every turn. She handles it exceptionally well, and van Houten really should have gone on to be a A-lister after this. She has a sparkling chemistry with Koch, who is also very good as the man on the side facing defeat, hoping to agree a truce with the resistance to avoid more bloodshed. It's a handsomely shot film all round, made all the more staggering that this was conceived on such a modest budget, and it's clear that Verhoeven was out to make a movie he could be proud of. While his familiar exploitative approach prevents it from being great, Black Book is never boring and is peppered with enough grey characters (Verhoeven certainly doesn't white-wash the portrayal of his fellow Dutch) to keep the twists and turns coming until the very end."

","Viewed at Rouen Nordic Film Festival 2007. The undisputed highlight of an otherwise routine week in Rouen was that ""Basic Instinct"" man, Paul Verhoeven's new Dutch film, ""Zwartboek"" or (the little) Black Book. After a 20 year Hollywood career during which the Dutch director came up with such megahits as ""Robocop"" and ""Basic Instinct"" Black Book marks his return to his native turf and native language. The story, co-written by Verhoeven, centers on a very attractive Jewish woman who is the sole survivor of a group of Jews attempting to escape from occupied Holland towards the end of the war in a boat. Posing as a gentile blonde under a non-Jewish name (her false papers furnished by the Underground) she becomes the mistress of a highly placed Gestapo officer and is given a job in Gestapo Headquarters from where she is able to pass critical information on to the resistance. However, one thing leads to another in this highly charged complex plot where everybody is double-crossing everybody else in a typically Verhoevenesque drama of interlocking paranoia. Eventually Miss De Vries's cover is blown and another ultimately sleazy Gestaponik succeeds in making it look like she is actually collaborating with the Krauts. In the end as the Americans arrive and the country is liberated she is being chased by both sides -- especially because she has come into possession of a little black book which gives facts, figures, and names of key people involved in the fake smuggling of Jews with big-big dividends. In a role which reads something like The Perils of Pauline in WW II our heroine (Carice van Houten) at one point has to gobble a whole chocolate bar to counteract a nearly fatal dose of insulin injected into her arm by a false Dutch ""hero"" of The Resistance.<br/><br/>The plot is so complicated that it may take two viewings to sort it all out, but one thing which is perfectly clear -- (to invoke the words of an infamous ex-president) -- perfectly clear it is, that Carice van Houten, the heroine of the story, is, with this film, well on the way to installing herself as the next great international female Superstar. (Remember, you read it here first!) Ms. Van Houten, who is probably pushing thirty, has been around for a while and is currently the most popular actress in Holland -- which isn't saying much in terms of international recognition, but Little Black Book is on marquees almost everywhere so it seems to be only a matter of time before she is discovered by the outside world. Van Houten has a screen presence far more gripping than Sharon Stone, who became an overnight star as the heroine of Verhoeven's ""Basic Instinct"" circa 1991 and is a far better actress.<br/><br/>If ""Black Book"", which is currently on wide release in the States, doesn't do it for her all Verhoeven needs to do to launch another (more high-powered) Sharon Stone, is to come out with ""Basic Instinct III"" with Van Houten in the lead and La Stone will be a forgotten melody. Carice van Houten has it all; charisma, good looks both enigmatic and down-to-earth, sex appeal to burn -- AND she can act! This may be ridiculously early to talk about Oscar 2008, but in my book she's already there.<br/><br/>PS: Alas, Van Houten was never discovered by Hollywood -- their loss!"

","Wow! Who could have imagined that one of the best war-time thrillers of the last fifty years would be made by the man who brought us the comic-book violence of TOTAL RECALL and STARSHIP TROOPERS? Yes, Dutch director Paul Verhoeven is the man behind this story of the Dutch resistance in WWII, and it's his best work since STARSHIP TROOPERS. It's also an atypical outing for the director more at home with blood and guts and OTT action and a throwback to his films of old like SOLDIER OF ORANGE. This is an old-fashioned thriller with a bit of everything thrown in for audiences – romance, action, suspense, thrills, drama, human emotion. It's a film detailing the human condition and at its heart it contains an absolutely fantastic performance from a virtually unknown Dutch actress, Carice van Houten, who looks like Naomi Watts but is about a million times better as an actress.<br/><br/>The film details the constant struggle for power and supremacy between the Dutch resistance and the Nazis in the dying days of WWII. What I loved most about the plot was the constant twists and turns and surprises at every stage. I was trying to second-guess this film at some instances but it never worked, because I could never figure out what was going to happen next. Even the ending is a great surprise. There's a conspirator at work behind the scenes, a real traitor, but figuring out his or her identity is nigh on impossible. Great scriptwriting like this doesn't come along every day! <br/><br/>The cast is uniformly excellent, particularly Sebastian Koch as the sympathetic Nazi officer. Attention to detail is spot on and you come away feeling that the research has been 100%. The film's budget is up on screen to see and all of the old cars and uniforms look amazing. Even the special effects don't disappoint. Verhoeven can't resist throwing in some of his trademark violence, here in the form of shoot-outs and the like, and even some fairly explicit sex and nudity a la BASIC INSTINCT. But in the end, BLACK BOOK transcends all of its parts to become a thoroughly engaging and excellent war epic."

","This film never falls short of entertaining. The Nazis are commonly depicted as pure evil and generalizations sweep over entire populations instead of considering special cases.

World War II brought about great destruction in the 20th century, but it also transformed the world into a land filled with fear.<br/><br/>Following the life of Ellis Stein (Carice van Houten), a young woman whose lost everything, this film depicts the various facades resistance fighters needed in order stay alive. Cunningness and deception are at the forefront of this movie, and simply walking outsides poses danger to each person's life. Being inside isn't even necessarily safe.<br/><br/>Black Book is deeply thrilling and emotional. With the constant character development and war settling in the background, how life changes pre- and post-war is filled with both enjoyment and anxiety.

Rachel thinks back to those days, when she was hiding with a Christian family until their house was bombed. She then meets someone from the Resistance who helps her get a boat into free territory. Tragedy strikes.<br/><br/>Rachel begins to work with the Resistance who have her dye her hair and give her fake I.D. as Ellis deVries.

And within the Nazi regime, there were real baddies and some not so bad. An interesting take.<br/><br/>The film is carried by Carice van Houten, an absolutely beautiful woman who is one heck of an actress. I frankly preferred her with her natural dark hair; with her blond hair, she bore a resemblance to Annie Potts, which I found disconcerting.

","Conquerors have often had the tendency to beautify, glorify their contribution and the events towards victories.

Zwartboek is a pleasant exception which shows life in harsh and uncertain circumstances in a realistic manner, with ""good"" and ""bad"" people and actions in both sides. The plot is solid and intense, has several twists and turns, catchy action scenes and dramatic moments. The value is enhanced by filming in real locations (joy of recognition; however, it increased the budget a lot) and the use of both Dutch and German actors, thus the original languages were spoken during the film. The cast is very strong and with character actors mainly, beginning with Carice van Houten as Rachel Stein / Ellis de Vries and Sebastian Koch as Ludwig Müntze - both internationally famous European actors. <br/><br/>Highly recommended to those fond of versatile war films with strong feelings and dynamic events.

","Why would anyone watch Zwartboek? One reason to see Zwartboek is: because it has been recommended to you by someone. Another would be that Judith's preparations to seduce the Nazi Holophernes, the remarkable way she takes care of everything, in order to be a convincing blonde, are a nice bit; it is an endearing scene. But not much is revealed thus. The 3rd reason is that, from its 80th min onward, Zwartboek becomes a zany roller-coaster, a surreal mayhem—it accelerates the action, it enhances the suspense. Zwartboek, directed by Verhoeven, the somewhat _cartoonish rendering of a Jewish woman's run for her life through wartime Holland, resembles a comics book, and it depicts the way this endangered woman is helped by many honest, brave, clever people, who hate the Nazis as much as she does; after a while, she changes her mind, stops running away, and gets involved into the Resistance's activities. Frankly, it isn't much of a thriller, the dialogs are laughable trash, cinema of a very primitive and, to me, in its first 80 _mins., utterly _unengrossing kind, but it has a clean Hollywoodian look to it, and the female lead is comely. And for the viewer's benefit, Verhoeven indulges, now and then, in a bit of goofy humor, and of bawdiness. Zwartboek was kindly recommended to me by a female colleague, four months ago; and it took me four months to decide to watch it. The view could of been postponed forever.

","One of the first ""Foreign"" films I ever saw was Verhoven's ""Spetters"" - And he is back now to his roots. With this movie it was as if 15 to 20 years of Verhoven's Big Hollywood movies never happened. Although in fact they did happen, giving Verhoven the experience to make this film great, done on a ""shoestring"" budget of only 16 million Euros, this film has the quality of a 150-Million dollar Hollywood movie.<br/><br/>I recognise most of these actors from films like 2004's ""Downfall"" and two versions of ""Operation Valkyrie"" that were done in the 2000's - The German actors are well cast as Nazis especially Christian Berkel as ""General Käutner"" and Sebastian Koch as ""Müntze"".<br/><br/>This film utilises the capacity of Europeans to speak several languages fluently, and there are English, Dutch, Hebrew, and German lines tossed out without any difficulty by the actors chosen. 3/4 of the dialogue is in Dutch, as this is a Dutch film revolving around events in that country toward the last days of WW-II in Europe.<br/><br/>Carice van Houten portrays a Jewish woman surviving in The Hague in Holland during WW-II. I don't know if van Houten is ethnically Hebrew, or not, but she sells her heritage well in this film, except where she is hiding that heritage.<br/><br/>The thing I kept forgetting with the amount of Nudity and Frank Sexuality in this film, was that this was not filmed in Hollywood, where the Ratings are hung up on such things. In that way, the storytellers were not repressed like they were when involved in US productions.<br/><br/>The story itself, which is shown in flashback after ""Ronnie"" (Halina Reijn) meets ""Ellis"" (van Houten) at the Kibbutz in Israel, begins with elements of any standard WW-II story. But from almost the beginning of the flashback, we see that things as shown in this film, are definitely not ""standard"" in any form. Who are bad guys are, is shrouded in a fog - We know there is a traitor, but our attention is constantly being shifted. The events in this film happen over a very short period of time and mostly over a three day period in The Hague. Random unfortunate events combine with deliberate sabotage and deception to cause some bad things to happen to a group of the Dutch Resistance. Which events were just bad luck, and which ones from diabolical trickery? The way this film plays out, is that we do not know until the very end of the film.<br/><br/>This makes Verhoven one of my favourite directors, I am very glad he made this film, it was very well cast, of comfortable length, paced well, and one of the best things about it was Van Houten's singing in three languages throughout the film. I say this to anyone: If you have not seen this, go out and get it right away if you can find it- It took me about three months to find a decent copy of it."

Because its one of the most enthralling films I have ever watched."
"chakrabortyabhishek07","7","0","1","19 June 2010"," A very good film but somehow missing the Greatness
","There are lots of things in these film which are depicted with far more authority and creativity in few great WW II films. The story in the backdrop of World War II.<br/><br/>It's about a Jewish woman's journey during the war years. Very compact and very touchy performances by all the actors I must say. The script very well poised and the film was shot in a good manner. <br/><br/>One of the best that I have seen from the dutch. However I felt the film lacked the greatness factor. The director could have been much more careful and much more realistic while setting up the camera angels. At certain important scenes the facial expressions of the actors were not caught in the manner it should have. Also the knot between certain sequence could have been a bit tighter.<br/><br/>But I must recommend this movie to every one. A must watch as it gives a whole new plateau for the certain Nazis.<br/><br/>I'm sorry but can't really give a 8 or 9 for this movie."
"Samiam3","8","0","2","12 June 2010"," Solid and gripping, Paul Verhoeven has grown his brains back
","Paul Verhoeven struck gold with Robocop, which I found clever, but other wise I think he is pretty much a one track mind (well maybe two track). His motion pictures are either driven by sex or gratuitous violence.<br/><br/>It would be a stretch to call this a miracle, but Verhoeven's latest film Black Book has brought out the absolute best in him. Though it could use a bit of trimming, this motion picture is a constantly gripping and thrilling story, morally ironic, and though occasionally contrived, it is definitely not the product of the hack behind Showgirls and Basic Instinct<br/><br/>Black Book is based on a true story of a Jewish girl in Holland, in 1944. After her family was gunned down by Nazis, she joined the resistance and infiltrated the gestapo as a singer, and she quickly became mistress to the head Commander, who himself was actually had secret arrangements with the resistance (which of course it treason) Ergo, they both had something to hide which could get them killed.<br/><br/>The pace is stable and progressive up till the last half hour, where it drags on a bit long in an attempt to tie up some loose ends. It is here where Black Book is at its most controversial and ironic, yet also at its most intense. Verhoeven is takes this project very seriously, probably more so than anything he has ever done. In fact, there is nothing really to suggest that this is a Verhoeven picture. When it wants to, the film can get fairly nasty but never too hammy and the sexual content and violence are not actually that excessive or as overdone as I was expecting. <br/><br/>I'll raise my glass to Paul Verhoeven for this one. It's a pretty solid WWII film, and certainly his finest work yet."
"sergepesic","6","0","5","24 December 2009"," Missed opportunity
","World War II was a subject of countless movies. From ideological, propaganda rubbish to some of the best masterpieces ever made. If you decide to make a movie set in those times today, it is absolutely necessary to have a novel idea. This, quite well done and entertaining movie, doesn't have anything new to tell us. It is made in Hollywood mode, meaning thrills and turns and twists and not very much logic or character development. The horror of the war is barely touched upon, and even violence and death seem cleaned up not to disturb the modern viewer too much.It is a mystery to me how anybody can try to brings us back to those days of immense suffering and fail to touch us for a single moment. "" The Black Book"" is a mixture of brilliant technique and lack of things to say."
"buscamante2003","7","0","3","4 November 2009"," Complex plot
","I've watched over 100 films this year and this by far has the most complicated series of plot twists. Its worth watching. I'm not sure how she survived a bullet to her forehead either. The visual design of the movie is enjoyable too with great sets, wardrobe. In reading IMDb reviews little is mentioned of the actor Sebastian Koch (Muntze) and his character's motives. I think he senses that Germany is going to loose the war, the action takes place in 1944-1945 and meets Ellis in 1945 winter or spring. In any event the acting is superb and Sebastian Koch stands out. He also has a lead in ""Lives of Others"" also worth checking out. It does have one forgivable flaw common in European films - a short indulgent scene in the middle of the film designed to bring some levity to a heavy situation."
"Stampsfightclub","7","0","5","4 November 2009"," Good passionate religious ideology if not the plot that was needed
","After witnessing an emotional massacre, Jewish lady Rachel Stein (Houten) joins the resistance to infiltrate the German headquarters but struggles with feelings for their leader This controversial depiction of the Second World War brings together meanings of religion, sexism, and betrayal, all to which amount to a film flowing with issues that make a mouth watering prospect of a drama.<br/><br/>Whilst there have been numerous films portraying the events of the Second World War, the more popular ones being Schindler's list and Saving Private Ryan, this has an edge of feeling less glorified, more of a cult smash depicting the difficulties of the Jews in their fight against the overruling Germans. Including a love story may seem like Hollywood styling but this gives the film a gritty edge that has a wonderfully dramatic finale that goes to show mixing Hollywood with Indie can work.<br/><br/>Beginning in the future we see a reasonable good long shot of Rachel sat on a beach as she goes back in time, recalling her events in the war.<br/><br/>We are then taken back to war time as Rachel, living undercover finds herself being exposed and is soon lining up her options to make an attempt. Then after a warm reunion with her family there is a tragedy on a night boat and this is exceptionally dramatic and sets the tone for further drama to progress.<br/><br/>As Rachel reinvents herself with the Resistance the plot moves forward as she tries to help infiltrate the plans of the enemies but is left confused by her feelings towards their leader.<br/><br/>If we look at the time this was set and the way everything worked you can forgive the awkward eye lusting moments and focus on the degrading nature to which the men treated the women and how this ultimately affected the balance of this story. The cruel sexual acts and the disrespectful approaches made by the German soldiers would earn them a one way ticket to prison these days and this reflection is certainly controversial but bravely unashamed to tell it as it is.<br/><br/>With this picture we see surprisingly little war imagery and are shown demonstrations of religious acts and how people felt about Jews. These religious concepts are put to the ultimate limit with passionate actions being taken against them, such as shootings, slavery amongst others.<br/><br/>Whilst this picture has enough religious iconography to get its point across there isn't as much tempo to grab you in the way that's required. I often found my attention wondering as situations started repeating themselves and the obvious attraction did borderline on soppiness. Not to mention there are so many main characters with their own agendas you can lose your bearings.<br/><br/>Nevertheless this has a point and is worth a watch."
"jboothmillard","6","0","3","13 July 2009"," Black Book
","From director Paul Verhoeven (Total Recall, Basic Instinct), after a lot of success in Hollywood, this was a good return to his foreign language films. Set in World War II, ex-singer Rachel Stein (Carice Van Houten) joins a resistance smuggling many Jewish people across the South Netherlands. One night during one of these boat travels, a German Nazi boat fired at them and murdered all bu Rachel, but she is rescued by another resistance led by Gerben Kuipers (Derek De Lint). After his son is kidnapped, trying to smuggle weapons, he asks Rachel to pose as a German singer named Ellis De Vries, to seduce SS-official Ludwig Müntze (Sebastian Koch) to gain access to all areas. She manages to get Müntze to trust her and she joins his office as a spy, but someone in the resistance betrays her, and she is seen as the bad girl. Also starring Thom Hoffman as Hans Akkermans, Halina Reijn as Ronnie, Waldemar Kobus as Günther Franken, Christian Berkel as General Käutner, Dolf De Vries as Notary Wim Smaal, Peter Blok as Van Gein, Michiel Huisman as Rob and Diana Dobbelman as Mrs. Smaal. Filled with good performances, explosions, violence and even some English, this is pretty engaging war thriller. It was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film not in the English Language. Good!"
