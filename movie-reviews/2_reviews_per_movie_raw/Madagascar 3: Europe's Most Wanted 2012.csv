","Actually the best of the three. Had more laughs and heart than the other two films combined."

","Alex, Marty, Gloria, and Melman and the rest of their gang return in the third installment of the ""Madagascar"" series, and yes they are still trying to get back home to New York City. This film has them traveling with a group of circus animals all throughout Europe on the run from a French animal hunter who has killed every animal and has mounted their head on her wall, except for a lion.<br/><br/>This movie stars the voice talents of Ben Stiller (Tower Heist, Tropic Thunder), Chris Rock (Grown ups, The Longest Yard), David Schwimmer (Friends, John Carter), Jada Pinkett Smith (Ali, Collateral), Sasha Baron Cohen (Borat, Bruno), Cedric the Entertainer (Larry Crowne, Ice Age), and Bryan Cranston (Drive, Breaking Bad). Everyone did a great job with their characters and it was a blast to hear all these familiar voices in a film together again.<br/><br/>I have been a fan of the previous ""Madagascar"" films, and that still is the case, but I really didn't have any hype for this movie because from the trailers, it didn't really look that good. I am glad to say that it is the complete opposite of that. Surprisingly, I really enjoyed film from start to finish and thought that for certain audiences, the film is perfect. If you are a younger person (12 and under) the movie will entertain and make you laugh the entire time. Now for the other demographic (13 and up), the film is still a really fun experience having jokes that adults would get, as well as some really funny situations.<br/><br/>The ""Madagascar"" series has been known to be over the top, but ""Madagascar 3″ takes the cake for being the most over the top one yet. You can not simply go into this movie expecting a toned down film featuring animals that can talk and doing anything that humans can. You have to go into this film with an open mind and just enjoy the ride. I found myself laughing constantly throughout the film and I couldn't help but have a smile on my face the entire time. This movie made me feel like I was a kid again and that is one of the best feelings there is.<br/><br/>This is easily the best movie in the series in my opinion. What really blew me away though was something that wasn't crucial to the movie, and that was the 3D. This is probably some of the best 3D I have seen in a film. I was sitting on the edge of my seat waiting to see what was going to pop out next. If you see this film, please do yourself a favor and see the 3D version of it, you will not be disappointed. I highly recommend this film to all ages. Whether you are a kid or an adult, you will find enjoyment in this film.<br/><br/>Rating 7.5/10"
"DICK STEEL","8","58","81","7 June 2012"," A Nutshell Review: Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted
","There are eager animated film franchises that rehashed the same old themes and gags in all its installments, and deservedly crashed under its own repetitiveness. Think Shrek, which started brightly, but with each sequel the grumpy ogre and his friends started to become cheap parodies of themselves. There are other film franchises that grow from strength to strength though, such as Ice Age where we get to go on an incredibly long journey with its characters trying to survive the inevitable change and extinction, and then there's Madagascar, with Europe's Most Wanted surprisingly having a lot more to offer than what it had suggested.<br/><br/>We go back to where we last left off, rejoining Alex the Lion (Ben Stiller), Marty the Zebra (Chris Rock), Melman the Giraffe (David Schwimmer) and Gloria the Hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith) who are still in Africa, but getting homesick and yearn for their lives back in New York. So they hatch a plan to regroup with the Penguins, who had left with the Monkeys in their flying machine to Monte Carlo and its glitzy casinos, and compel them to take everyone back to New York. Granted it's a slow start, but when it picked up with Frances McDormand voicing the French policewoman Captain Chantel DuBois, more of an animal hunter in disguise and hell bent on adding a lion to her trophy wall, it really went over the top with a multitude of action sequences that get set to show off dedicated and meticulously crafted moments for 3D. It's clearly one of the better 3D efforts in an animated feature film that took pains to ensure the medium got milked for the premium ticket you paid for.<br/><br/>Then the narrative goes up a notch with the introduction of some circus animals with whom our protagonists get to mix with in order to momentarily escape the fanatical clutches of DuBois, and in comes the opportunity to expand on its cast, with the likes of Jessica Chastain, Bryan Cranston and Martin Short entering the fray as a cheetah, tiger and sea lion respectively, each with its own distinct quirk, objective and baggage. It's a zoo animal meets circus animal rivalry formed, and Alex and gang wanting to stick around, with thanks to the Penguins, because the circus is en route to Rome and London, where an American circus event promoter would be in town to evaluate if the troupe can make money if brought across the Atlantic, and naturally, New York.<br/><br/>I'm rather surprised by the depth of the narrative here, as Eric Damell and Noah Baumbach's screenplay managed to squeeze a lot in under 90 minutes sans end credits roll. Characters don't get thrown in for fun, but have enough screen time to perform without getting the feeling of being redundant to the whole scheme of things, and how they all blend well together for the major set action pieces, complete with comedy ranging from witty repartee to physical slapstick gags. The major new entrants to this installment will also become crowd favourites, such as the girly cheetah Gia, the curt Russian tiger Vitaly who has to reclaim his theatrical mojo, and Stefano the sea lion trying his very best to hold the entire troupe together, while not being very bright himself.<br/><br/>Every scene got designed to have the characters endear themselves to the audience, even if they come silent, such as the bicycle riding bear, and a couple of English dogs voiced by the likes of Vinnie Jones, Steve Jones and Nick Fletcher. Paz Vega also lent her voice to a collective group of show-horses, while perennial favourites such as Sacha Baron Cohen's Julien and Cedric the Entertainer's Maurice almost always threaten to run away with the show, given their rather spaced out moments that run outside of the main narrative thread. There are colours galore with gags running wild, and I'd suspect where your sense of humour might have been misplaced if there's absolutely nothing here in the film that can tickle your funny bone.<br/><br/>With an assortment of pop songs ranging from 90s hits to those by Katy Perry, the signature theme song only got an airplay during the end credits, and is an amalgamation of the Afro Circus song written by Chris Rock, that somehow had a strange yet infectious blend that epitomizes everything that had transpired in this film, and set itself up for more. Themes of friendship and sticking together through thick and thin, of never giving up and the likes, are good themes to have for a film that's going to appeal to the young for sure.<br/><br/>I'd like to think there's a stop at three policy and to leave the franchise as it is now, going off at a high, rather than to continue with a formula that would ultimately show its age. Madagascar 3 worked and delivered everything you'd expect of a crowd pleaser that can appeal to all age groups, and I'm very much compelled to earmark this for a 3D blu-ray title for keeps. Definitely highly recommended in my books, given its rarity of it improving upon the strengths of its predecessors, and finding room to add more characters, not caricatures, to its mythos."
"joefletch-16443","8","5","5","1 December 2018"," The return of the zoo animals.
","Alex, Marty, Gloria and Melman are back for the third Madagascar movie. This one is the best Madagascar movie in the franchise. It has good animation. Likeable characters, a strong villain and a good use of slapstick humour."
"bRAdY-01","9","50","80","25 May 2012"," Out with the old and in with the new
","I watched this at the Cannes Film Festival 2012 after deciding to take a break from all the serious art-house fare on offer. With the exception of Ben Stiller's lead all the original supporting leads take virtually a back seat in this third instalment. But several great new characters are introduced namely Frances McDormand as Captain Chantel DuBois, Bryan Cranston as Vitaly and the fabulous Martin Short as Stefano. All there performances are stand out but wished Shorts Stefano was featured more. Cranston as Vitaly was beautifully menacing but it is the wacky deadly policewoman in charge of hunting down and capturing the animals as they make their way across Europe which is the centre of the narrative drive. Since the police team where obviously the bad guys (DuBois only wants to capture Mike (Ben Stiller) so she can add his head to her mounted collection of stuffed animals on her office wall) it was ironic that I watched this in France since the police were portrayed as bunch gung-ho obsessive freaks (DuBois crawls around on all fours to sniff down her prey like a dog come insect). The film was screened in 3D, initially I was apprehensive since I don't really enjoy 3D movies but this was a pleasant surprise. After a few minutes I had completely forgotten that I was wearing the 3D glasses and actually...in the spectacular climatic scene I was completely wowed. An explosion of vivid movement and colour formed an intricate moving tapestry of light and colour that was gorgeous to watch. The kids will love it and any one young at heart enough to let themselves loose themselves in escapist fun for a couple of hours. One of the best ""family"" animation films that I've seen in years and highly recommended. Oh I nearly forgot....Baron Cohen's (as The King) love affair with a giant mute bear is both surreal and priceless!"
"Okonh0wp","2","36","58","15 May 2013"," So far removed from reality, it just became stupid
","I know it sounds silly to say I want more realism from a film about four talking zoo animals, but Madagascar III was so far removed from any sense of internal logic or consistency that it was just plain stupid.<br/><br/>Very little about the first Madagascar falls out of line with reality. They even go so far as to explain why the animals can't talk: When the quartet is nearly apprehended at Grand Central Station and Alex (the lion) tries to reason with the crowd but his speaking comes out as roaring.<br/><br/>The third Madagascar got so ridiculous, I eventually tuned its attempts at making sense out like white noise. We have the animals deciding to swim halfway across the planet, a tiger who can jump through a wedding ring, the circus now being run by chimpanzees and selling out to a human audience, and a lion suddenly learning the trapeze.<br/><br/>None of the new plot developments are particularly additive. In one, Sasha Baron Cohen's lemur monkey falls madly in love with a big bear (which by the way, is kind of gross) and the two go to the Vatican to kiss the pope's hand and get his blessing. What?! I'm not sure where the pope stands on monkey-bear unions but at least the first and second installments had a clearly spelled out humans-animals relationship.<br/><br/>The movie also feels rushed. It wasn't just the actual running time of 93 minutes, but the storyline weaved its way from one plot point to another at right angles with no transition. The gang decides to go to Monte Carlo and are suddenly there one scene later. One scene after that, they're being chased out of Monte Carlo and onto the next adventure. There's a weary Russian tiger played by Bryan Cranston who warns against clichés and nearly quits the circus but is talked out of it in 30 seconds by Alex. What do you call a sudden 180 reversal like that again? Oh yes, it's a cliché."

","Finally! We have a movie in 2012 that is worth every minute and every penny. If your kids (or you, for that matter) cannot stop singing ""Circus! Afro!"" then go ahead and see Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted in 3D. It is the most clever, fun, and exciting animated film to hit theaters in a long time.<br/><br/>When we see our favorite zoo escapees this time, they are on the run with their jungle friends in Europe. Alex (Ben Stiller), Marty (Chris Rock), Gloria (Jada Pinkett Smith) and Melman (David Schwimmer) desperately want to get back to Central Park. Standing in their way is Captain Chantel Dubois (Frances McDormand) as the most evil animal control officer in the world. They narrowly escape her clutches by jumping on a train with a traveling circus. Now their only hope for getting to New York is to buy the circus and whip them into good enough shape to earn a touring contract in America.<br/><br/>Director and screenwriter Eric Darnell does an excellent job of leading the crew with this third installment. The story incorporates new characters beautifully by adding a love interest for Alex (Gia, voiced by Jessica Chastain), a dopey friend for Marty (Stefano, voiced by Martin Short), and a fallen hero everyone can cheer for (Vitaly, a tiger voiced by Bryan Cranston). King Julien (Sacha Baron Cohen) also finds love in a big bear wearing a tutu named Sonya, and the results are as hilariously sweet as the love saga of Donkey and Dragon. Kids will be able to keep up with all of the new names and nationalities and may even find a new favorite character in the bunch.<br/><br/>What makes this movie truly magic is the skillful use of 3D technology. Every leap on the flying trapeze, flight out of a cannon, and grasp at an animal's tail by Captain Dubois jumps out of the screen and excites the senses. It is so refreshing to see a movie in 3D that actually takes full advantage of its capability. The clever script and silly animation also kept me laughing, but I could have done without all of the jabs at people of Russian, French, Canadian, and basically all non-American descent. What was initially funny drifted toward mean, and resulted in one joke that was totally inappropriate. These moments only accounted for about 5 of the nearly 90 minutes of running time, so do not let that deter you from enjoying this chaotic adventure.<br/><br/>Madagascar 3 is just like going to the circus, but with more laughter and less wondering about how the animals are treated backstage. If you still like to ""move it, move it,"" then you need to see it see it!<br/><br/>Review courtesy of The Rogers Revue"

","It's been four years since the last Madagascar film was released. Surprisingly, the elements of the franchise is still there and the film does not feel strangely different like in most sequels. Except, this one has a larger scale and crazier action. Well, Dreamworks Animation has gone to a new level in animation. Bringing a quicker, bigger, and more spectacular visuals to the film and make it a non-stop ride and worth it in 3D. But it's still not as compelling as any other classic animation films. The only purpose of these Madagascar films is to have fun and it truly succeeds in doing that.<br/><br/>It has the same old trope of the series. The gang trying to get back to New York then they suddenly bumped into new friends and they end up lingering to their situation and an old lady hates Alex the Lion. The penguins having the best gags and King Julien being crazy. It's delightful and the fans will be pleased for seeing these again. The new characters are as likable as the original characters. While everything is fun, the wonderful visuals adds the film's enjoyment. There are plenty of sequences that are meant to be seen in the big screen, either in 2D or 3D.<br/><br/>Some scenes are ridiculously exciting, some are awfully eye-candy. The film itself is like a spectacular show with so many wonderful colors. But it does not go beyond that. The film only wants to be big, fun, and nothing else. Just make sure you are not looking for more than mind-blowing visuals. The jokes are still pretty hilarious. You will still root for these characters. There is no need to tell how was the voice acting because all of them are predictably good.<br/><br/>Madagascar 3 is the most gorgeous part of the series but not quite the best. The trilogy will probably remain only as a little cult classic. We loved the humor, the characters, and their crazy antics. The movies have heart but there is a little impact to their drama. It's not something like Pixar. But these Madagascar films have their own personality and we accepted it. Talking animals escaping and creating some disaster. Slow moments with clever and sometimes slapstick gags. If you are a fan of these films then you will see something spectacular to it, but like I said, there is nothing bigger than that."

","It's hard to believe that it has been over seven years since the first ""Madagascar"" film arrived in theaters back in 2005. Now, the number of installments in the movie franchise has risen to three. In ""Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted"" we are reunited with our beloved Alex the Lion, Marty the Zebra, Gloria the Hippo, and Melman the Giraffe. Our favorite animals are stuck in Africa and are missing their home in Central Park Zoo in New York. In the process, they head to Europe (marking a shift in the setting compared to its two predecessors which are set in Africa) where most of the adventure takes place. Regardless, this third installment is a marked improvement from its two excellent predecessors, offers a great deal of fun, and promises a hear-pumping ride.<br/><br/>""Europe's Most Wanted"" is mostly set in Europe, from Monte Carlo all the way to London. This marks a shift in the setting compared to its two predecessors which are set in Africa. Anyways, you're probably wondering ""What happens in this third installment?"". Apparently our four favorite animals are stranded in Africa along with King Julien, Maurice, and Mort. The penguins and monkeys left them and head to Monte Carlo (specifically the luxurious casinos) and promise to never come back. The remaining seven animals then head to Europe to capture the penguins and monkeys in the hotel, only to cause trouble. Because of the chaos that ensues, Animal Control Captain Chantel DuBois is hired to capture these escaped animals in a chase that spans all over Europe. DuBois is ruthless and she actually wants the animals dead, especially Alex. Aside from ruthless, she possesses some of the coolest moves you would least expect from an elderly woman, and some of the most preposterous tracking methods, more reminiscent of a dog's.<br/><br/>Along the way, the escapees encounter the circus train belonging to the Circus Zaragoza (later renamed Afro Circus) where we meet new friends (which consist of the circus's members). This includes Stefano the sea lion who is a sea lion cannonball, Gia the jaguar who is a skilled trapeze, and the most harrowing of them all, Vitaly the tiger who can jump through a ring of all sizes (even as small as an engagement ring). We also meet Sonya the Bear, whom King Julien develops a romantic yet comedic relationship with. Apparently the circus has been losing its luster ever since Vitaly's bad incident years ago. From then on, the circus crew just didn't have that same energy and excitement they had before. Alex later on along with his friends attempt to rebuild the circus by developing some of the sickest and breathtaking stunts ever for a circus show.<br/><br/>The breathtaking circus stunts bring one of the most entertaining scenes in the entire movie. The scene I'm talking about is when the circus crew, now added with Alex and friends, performed in London. I like how they combine the different acts together along with the neon lights, fantastic sets, and not to forget, Katy Perry's ""Firework"" song playing in the background, to create something so spectacular and bright and colorful. Add the stunning 3D effect and this scene is just flawless.<br/><br/>""Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted"" is humorous and is better than the previous two installments even in terms of humor. Marty the Zebra' jokes assure that this film will be humorous while the romantic relationship between Sonya the Bear and King Julien is silly that it makes you laugh. But what made me laugh the most was DuBois's preposterous methods of tracking the animals. She can crawl on all fours and inhale the air to see what the scene was like hours ago. It is so preposterous that it's funny and humorous. She also possesses some of the coolest moves you'll ever see, most of them present in the chase scene in Monte Carlo where DuBois jumps over obstacles with her bike and does crazy stunts. <br/><br/>The actors gave applauding voice performances. Ben Stiller was great as usual providing the voice of Alex the Lion. Chris Rock delivered a great sound for Marty the Zebra. Jada Pinkett Smith gave a strong voice for Gloria the Hippo whereas David Schwimmer provided a great sound for Melman the Giraffe. Frances McDormand gave one of the best performances as she voices DuBois with ruthlessly and hauntingly whereas Bryan Cranston delivered a menacing voice for Vitaly the Tiger. I also loved Martin Short's performance as the sea lion Stefano where he makes Stefano an extremely likable figure and I wished that his screen time had been extended and made longer. <br/><br/>The 3D is also one thing to note about for this film. It's excellent and enhances the movie experience. One of the scenes that benefit from 3D is the circus show set in London where there is an eclectic mix of fantastic sets, breathtaking stunts, and the beautiful upbeat song (""Firework"" by Katy Perry) in the background. It makes you feel the movie more and makes the ride more thrilling. <br/><br/>Whether you're a fan of the previous two installments or not, go watch this one. ""Europe's Most Wanted"" is an improvement from the previous two films, even when its predecessors are already excellent. Its shift in the setting makes the movie more interesting and the presence of a human villain makes it more exciting. The 3D enhances the movie experience and allows you to feel more and capture the heart of the film. Overall, ""Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted"" is a great film and highly recommended especially after it's been a long time after the last family-oriented animated movie came out in theaters so go watch this film with your families. <br/><br/>Rating: 8/10<br/><br/>Final Verdict: ""Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted"" is an improvement from its two excellent predecessors that entertains you immensely and delivers a great deal of fun - and it has to be watched in 3D."

","As with most sequels, the quality greatly decreases with the number. Madagascar 3 is not an exception. I watched the first Madagascar back in 2005 and me and my friends found it hilarious. The second installment was still OK, but this one ... terribly sucks. I looked at the movie rating and the raving reviews and I am still wondering if the people were on some kind of drugs while watching it. Maybe one of the reasons is that I watched it on 2d and did not get the 3d treatment like the rest, but if one dimension will make you rate a movie that high, then the humanity is definitely in trouble.<br/><br/>For me it seems that this episode was created for kids up to 5-6 years of age: simple jokes, whole bunch of rainbows and bright colors, lots of musical flicks, many scenes that lack logical explanation (from being in Africa the animals end up in Monte Carlo swimming - why didn't they swim to the US in the first place then), lots of shallow characters, really insanely overblown circus tricks (a tiger going through a ring after being lubricated from head to toe).<br/><br/>Even the penguins are not the same. I cannot really say what was wrong with them, but they seem to be just a part of the scenery.<br/><br/>The only thing that was missing was pink unicorns, but I think it was well compensated by a zebra painted in white with colorful spots, wearing a rainbow-colored wig and singing something about polka. Genuinely ridiculous. Someone in the reviews was wondering what drug were the creators of this movie on ...<br/><br/>The only thing I really laughed at was the relationship between the lemur and the bear.<br/><br/>So, to summarize: if you are more than 5 years old you should find that this movie was a total waste of your time and money."

","""Madagascar"" is one of my favorite animation movies and it's sequel was nearly on the same level. You can count both to the best animation adventures you can watch. Sadly, with ""Madagascar 3"" it isn't the same. For me it's a very big disappointment.<br/><br/>The reason why I didn't really like ""Madagascar 3"" is that it's just too crazy, it's just too colorful, too much unrealistic moments, too much of everything. The female enemy is nothing but awful as well. The circus scenes are wonderfully edited, but again, just too much. I can go on with this, but I don't really have time for it.<br/><br/>So, you can surely watch it once if you've already seen the first two films, but don't expect a masterpiece. The technical aspects are fulfilled flawlessly again, but the story is just dumb - can't say it in another way. Four out of ten points in my opinion."
"pranav_2001","9","36","64","9 June 2012"," Hilariously brilliant!!
","Whoever said watching a movie in 3D is the same as watching it in 2D, got it all wrong. Madagascar 3 has amazing 3D effects which will really make you experience the movie in a different way. From the beginning till the end, you will get into fits of laughter and the animals will keep you entertained. The overall plot of the movie is good but what really steals the show are the new Italian circus animals and their Italian accent. I always felt that the real hero's of this smart Penguins and Marti, the Lion, is only a pseudo hero.<br/><br/>What I didn't like about this movie was the unrealistic villain and her super human abilities, although funny, but at some point you will feel it was too much. But I can bet you won't notice the small things with the crazy animals making you LOL through out.<br/><br/>My suggestion: Don't miss this one, and watch it in 3D."

","Madagascar 3 has the highest IMDb rating of the three, but it is much, MUCH poorer than either 1 or 2. Only the tiniest of tots will fail to notice how threadbare the plot is and how blatant a commercial exploitation of a reasonable franchise this is. The new characters don't add much either. Huge jumps in the storyline beggar belief and the over indulgent set pieces - however colourful - do nothing to distract us from the fact that this is vacuous nonsense. What a shame to say this, but Please end it here Dreamworks....no more mini episodes or Christmas Specials Either. Enough is enough (or rather, this one is too much already)."
"Animated_Antic","8","6","8","9 October 2018"," The zaniest, funniest, and most colorful of the series.
","The ""Madagascar"" series may not be one of DreamWorks' best franchises, but it sure is a series that I still highly enjoy though. Sure, it may not have the emotions the first two ""Shrek"" films, the ""Kung Fu Panda"" trilogy, and the ""How to Train Your Dragon"" series have, but it still does have lots of zany humor, memorable characters, and in my opinion lots of charm. I'm always delighted by this series strangely enough and out of three films in the trilogy, I think ""Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted"" is the best of them. It steps up the zany humor and delivers on some new memorable characters. It's a film that really is a lot of fun.<br/><br/>When we last left our heroes, Alex (Ben Stiller), Marty (Chris Rock), Gloria (Jada Pickett Smith), and Melman (David Schwimmer) were in Africa while the Penguins (Tom McGrath, Chris Miller, Christopher Knights, and John DiMaggio respectively) went off to Monte Carlo. After awhile, the four get homesick for New York City and decide to get the Penguins and continue their journey home to the Central Park Zoo. Their retrieval of the penguins goes as well as you'd think it does and ends up getting the attention of Captain Chantel DuBois (Frances McDormand), the crazy leader of an animal control in Monte Carlo who is determined to get a lions head mounted on her wall. After an incident gets the remains of the plane they're traveling on destroyed, the gang then decides to hitch a ride on an circus train that has only animals including a seal lion named Stefano (Martin Short), a leopardess named Gia (Jessica Chastain), and a Siberian tiger named Vitaly (Bryan Cranston) and pretend to be circus performers so they can get their way to America. However, in order to get to America, the circus has to get the deal of an American promoter and the circus itself is not very good. Hoping to fix the circus, Alex and the others decide to help turn the circus around and get to New York while also avoiding the crazy DuBois.<br/><br/>The film is definitely the funniest out of the three movies and also the best written which makes sense since Noah Baumbach co-wrote the movie. He's definitely worked on some fantastic movies including ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" as well as the Oscar nominated ""The Squid and the Whale"" and his style does seem odd for a third ""Madagascar"" movie, but it oddly enough works out well. The zany humor is back and better than ever and the stuff involving the circus is actually really investing. I did want to see this circus succeed and that could because the characters are one again memorable and funny. Alex, Marty, Melman, and Gloria still have their charm to them and seeing the latter twos relationship grow since the last movie was nice to see. I did like how insane King Julien (played again by Sacha Baron Cohen) is in this film as he falls in love with a bicycle riding bear named Sonia, but it's really the new characters that work out well. I did care about them and I can understand how much they love what they do and how the circus means to them. The passion and dreams that both Gia and Stefano have are nice to see, but it's Vitalay who is the most interesting of the bunch. He does seem very cold and heartless from the looks of it, but the film does show why he acts that way and I'll admit that I did get kind of emotional watching it. The character that steals the show though is DuBois. This is one hilarious character and Frances McDormand must've had a ball playing her due to how insane and over the top she is. Now we come to the animation which quite honestly is some of the best DreamWorks has made. There's one particular scene involving the circus that was such a sight to behold as it was filled with so much amazement and dazzle and lots and lots of color. It's scenes like that are why I adore animation. With that said though, the film isn't perfect and does contain problems. For one, the animation was clearly meant for a 3D showing. Seeing the characters sometimes get too close to the screen just looks odd in a normal showing and it's distracting. Another thing, is one scene that I won't spoil does drag a bit, but not too much to get me angry.<br/><br/>So, I was pleased with ""Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted"". It had a fun story, colorful animation, and some fun characters that it's certainly enough to give a recommendation. It's not amazing like the other DreamWorks' movies, but considering it's a ""Madagascar"" film, I didn't expect it to be. I just expected a fun and zany film, and considering that's what I got, I'm pretty satisfied."
"TheLittleSongbird","8","7","10","18 August 2012"," My personal favourite of the Madagascar movies...
","Having enjoyed the first two Madagascar movies and Merry Madagascar, and as a fan of the Penguins Christmas Caper and The Penguins of Madagascar, I knew I wanted to see this film, even if it wasn't as good. Watching it online, I was very taken with Madagascar 3. For me, it is the best of the three movies, and as far as the Dreamworks sequels go, it is third behind Kung Fu Panda 2 and Shrek 2. Madagascar 3 is not a movie I deem perfect, there is some suggestive dialogue during King Julien's romance especially(and in other parts of the film) that will fly over children's heads and only adults will get(same goes with the glove slap) and you do have to suspend disbelief a bit in Alex's dream when the penguins use warp drive for their airship(which you can't do in the earth's atmosphere), especially if you are a scientist.<br/><br/>On the other hand, it is a fun and hugely enjoyable film. It is the best-looking of the three films, the previous two looked great as well but here the characters move easier, the colours have brightness and warmth and the backgrounds have a great deal of detail. Especially of note is the animation during Katy Perry's Fireworks, splendid in all regards. The soundtrack is also great, varied in that it spans 30 years and full of exuberance. Firework I am not a fan of, but loved the animation and thought it fitted really well within the film. The dialogue is well written and hilarious, with light, subtle spoofing on other films and also on the Hollywood clichés.<br/><br/>The story is well paced, exciting and of the three Madagascar it is the most consistent and least predictable. King Julien's romance was on the bizarre side, but also sweet and hilarious. The characters are great fun, of the four main characters Alex is the most dominant and he's fun. Marty, Gloria and Melman don't have as much to do but they aren't completely side-lined. The penguins and King Julien steal every scene they're in. And the new characters are just delightful, especially Vitaly and DuBois. The voice acting is top notch, Ben Stiller, Chris Rock, Jada Pinkett Smith and David Schwimmer all do very appealing jobs. Sacha Baron Cohen is as witty as ever as King Julien, likewise with the penguins with Tom McGrath standing out as Skipper. The dogs are fun too. Bryan Cranston is subtly menacing, Jessica Chastain is charming and Martin Short is funny, but the jewel(and possibly the best single voice-over of the three movies) is Frances McDormand, whose DuBois is note-perfect.<br/><br/>In conclusion, a very good sequel and movie and my vote for the best of the Madagascar movies. 8/10 Bethany Cox"

","'MADAGASCAR 3: EUROPE'S MOST WANTED': Two Stars (Out of Five) <br/><br/>The second sequel to the popular DreamWorks animated movie finds the animal characters from the first two films once again trying to make their way home to New York Central Zoo, where they originally escaped from. This time they join a traveling circus in Europe and have an evil Animal Control Captain hot on their trail. Ben Stiller, Chris Rock, David Schwimmer, Jada Pinkett Smith, Sacha Baron Cohen, Cedric the Entertainer, Andy Richter and Tom McGrath all reprise their voice roles and are joined this time by Jessica Chastain, Frances McDormand, Bryan Cranston and Martin Short. The film is just more of the same and I was never a fan of the series to begin with (although I don't think I ever saw the second installment). The jokes are forced and the action is chaotic. Should please kids though.<br/><br/>Alex the lion (Stiller), Marty the zebra (Rock), Melman the giraffe (Schwimmer) and Gloria the hippo (Smith) are still trying to make their way home to the New York Central Zoo, which they escaped from in the original film and traveled to Madagascar (with the help of four penguins). In this film they first journey to Monte Carlo, in order to find the penguins once again. There they find trouble once again as well and have Animal Control called on them. The Captain of Animal Control (McDormand) wants nothing more than to kill Alex and relentlessly pursues him and the other animals. They join a traveling circus, as cover, and find a new family of struggling friends there. They're soon, of course, not sure if they even want to go back to the zoo in New York or not.<br/><br/>The film was directed by Eric Darnell, Conrad Vernon and Tom McGrath (Darnell and McGrath also co-directed and co-wrote the first two films as well). Noah Baumbach (who directed and wrote such critically acclaimed hits as 'GREENBERG' and 'THE SQUID AND THE WHALE') also co-wrote the screenplay for this. Considering all the talent involved (in acting, writing and directing) I just expect a lot more. I know the movie is made for kids, and on that level it succeeds, but kids' movies don't have to be so dumbed down and pointless. They can actually be smart, clever and have a well thought out message. This movie is just a mess. A mess that kids will enjoy but probably no one else.<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6yq7kwUUDQ"
"bkrauser-81-311064","2","10","16","6 December 2013"," Animation's Least Wanted Foursome Returns
","Out of morbid curiosity I sat down and watched Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted (2012). I had only seen the first Madagascar (2005) which I didn't like at all. The animation was awkward, the story just wasn't that interesting, the characters were annoying and the primary lessons was ""don't eat your friends."" This time around it seemed the makers wanted their public to gleefully swallow more absurd notions than a vegetarian lion. Hippos and giraffes can apparently fall in love; as can bears and lemurs, lions and cheetahs. Whatever floats your boat I suppose.<br/><br/>The plot revolves around the same four animals, Alex the lion (Ben Stiller), Marty the zebra (Chris Rock), Gloria the hippo (Jada Pinkett-Smith) and Melman the giraffe (David Schwimmer). This time the film starts in Africa as they await the arrival of the penguins (animals who also left the zoo from the first movie) to take them back to the zoo.<br/><br/>Apparently in the movie I didn't see Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa (2008), the penguins had created a crude aircraft that could fly to Monte Carlo but didn't bring the main characters for some unknown reason. Fearing they were abandoned, the four, along with their lemur compatriots, make their arduous journey to Monte Carlo, which meant they would have had to walk through the thick jungles of central Africa then trek across the world's largest desert, then swim the width of the Mediterranean. But hey why focus on that when with one screen dissolve they're there! Convenient.<br/><br/>The foursome manage to sneak into a Monte Carlo casino where the penguins and their monkey friends are winning it big. Things get hairy. The fuzz is called and we are introduced to our main villain Captain DuBois (Frances McDormand) a psychotic, seemingly unstoppable animal control agent. From there the movie just throws everything including the kitchen sink at you in fast procession. A nuclear reactor, a flying machine, an Edith Piaf song that can cure broken bones, a flying circus with a new glut of characters is introduced Jesus movie! Can't you slow down enough to explain anything? Now don't be thinking I have a lack of imagination here because I don't personally believe a hippo can fit through an air-duct. All I'm saying is if you want to violate the laws of physics that much you should keep it consistent. Why don't the animals simply swim to New York? Why don't they use the nuclear reactor they just happen to have to go back in time before they ever left? Why not break into the CERN Hadron collider in Geneva and make their particle mass resemble that of an electron then travel to New York near the speed of light? They're in the neighborhood after all.<br/><br/>In conclusion, just don't waste your time with Europe's Most Wanted. If you have kids and care about their future, don't expose them to this dreck. If you do, you might as well get used to raising a child who thinks all complex problems can be solved by acrobatics and a Katy Perry song.<br/><br/>http://www.theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com"

","Don't get me wrong...took 2 ten year olds and a 2 year old and they had a great time. They talked about the movie for ten minutes after and haven't brought it up since. This is a kids movie and it's pretty basic. As an adult you should enjoy some of the visual dazzle of the movie but the jokes are for the age group intended. The story telling is as lazy as you'd expect and the message repetitive as usual. And I challenge you to escape finding Ben Stiller not once again playing Ben Stiller. I've enjoyed many of his movies in the past but his range is Ben Stiller. So, in review, take the kids if you've drank enough coffee (I fell asleep twice), expect nothing new, be impressed with the superb animation, let the kids talk about it for a few minutes after the movie, and watch Ben Stiller play a lion who acts like Ben Stiller."

","I seldom laugh out loud whilst watching a film, but this one easily passed the '6 laugh test'. There are some delightfully funny sight gags and some really subtle dialogue that, I'm guessing, was deliberately put in for the adults. All of the performances were great, as far as voice- only performances can be. The stand-out for me was Francis McDormand; she really got into the part! It's a film that was never going to win any awards, but, you know, it did exactly what it was meant to do, and that's entertain. Aside from a couple of annoying musical numbers (which are probably featured in the trailer) I found it quite a surprising delight.

","It took me back that when I saw this in theaters I was so amazed by it. I enjoyed both the first two films, but this one, oh my god! By now the characters are welcomed friends, and the story is just super fresh and fun. The main enjoyable aspect here has to be the addition of Madame Dubois. She brings so much pizazz and spunk to this movie. What a devilishly hilarious antagonist. This one just really hit it out of the park: settings, jokes, characters and story-wise. The vibrant, colorful circus scene is enough to captivate someone.<br/><br/>Let's start off by saying that from the get go the humor is super quick and witty. I love the opening of Alex visioning everyone as much older and being stranded forever. The immediate transfer to Europe as the setting is brilliant and a perfect way to kick off the rest of the movie. Like I said, this movie would be absolutely nothing without Madame DuBois though. Pretty much from the second her character comes on screen, the movie is a non-stop action packed, jolting fun thrill ride that I am glad I had the pleasure of enjoying in theaters.<br/><br/>We also have the wonderful new addition of the circus crew. They are all incredibly likable with their own personalities and welcomed on the screen immediately. The story is fast paced and constantly changing it up, with lots of new great aspects. I enjoyed the love affair between King Julien and the bear on the bicycle, how all the relationships in the movie blossom and grow stronger actually.<br/><br/>There really is not a moment that Madagascar 3 is not pulling either pulling at the heartstrings, entertaining with flashy visuals, or causing laughter with it's outrageous characters, like the films before it did. Some more scenes that make this movie brilliant are the ""Non Je Ne Regrette Rien"" singing sequence that had me in tears the first time I saw it, as well as when Madama DuBois is first chasing them and completing unimaginable and unbelievable human feats like a mad Rhinocerous or something. I swear, the creators were so high when they wrote this.<br/><br/>It is all just in your face and random, and that completely worked for me. It is the highlight of the Madagascar series thus far. Great usage of characters, story, songs, everything. It is a completely sleek animation. Even the new update of ""I Like to Move It"" is funny, and not as annoying as many would think considering the marketing and public follow of it. So hilarious and fun from beginning to end, I recommend it to every individual for the goodness of their soul."
"jcbinok","7","3","4","24 November 2015"," Way Over the Top
","My 5-year old enjoyed it. I thought it was a bit much: high speed car chases, characters falling from helicopters, etc. There were about 100 times that each of the characters would've died in real life. Oh well... <br/><br/>Towards the end, all the glitz overloaded my senses. Hardly paid attention to the ultimate scenes. Somewhere in there is a decent story about coming home, but it was lost among the flash, IMO.<br/><br/>The voice actors do a very good job. Schwimmer is a natural for the put-upon hypochondriac giraffe. Frances McDormand also nails the role of the French wildlife officer obsessed with bagging a lion. She's a mix between The Thing and Terminator. Even that wears a bit thin, though."

Otherwise, if I don't watch their movie before, I think that the character of this film is very bad yet easy to predict.<br/><br/>I don't say this film horrible, I just said it is real nonsense.

"japamo","10","3","4","24 June 2013"," Alex, Marty, Gloria, and Melman Get Their (Circus) Act Together and Give Their Best ""Madagascar"" Performance To Date
","The first two ""Madagascar"" films are not bad films. They introduced us to an off-beat but likable quartet of zoo escapees who negotiate a crazy, unfamiliar outside world in a madcap attempt to get home. They also introduced us to another quartet - devious but hilarious covert operation penguins sometimes offering ""help"" to the other quartet but more often engineering get-rich-quick scams. Finally, we have the boisterous lemur trio led by an egocentric lemur ""king"". They ensured that the first two ""Madagascar"" films were at least fun, lively, colorful, and even quick-witted from time to time. But in my humble opinion, the two films lacked a certain something that kept them from being truly memorable.<br/><br/>I think that ""something"" missing was control. What I mean by that is that Alex the lion (Ben Stiller), Marty the zebra (Chris Rock), Gloria the hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith), and Melman the giraffe (David Schwimmer) didn't seem to have control of their destinies. They passively let fate (and the penguins, and even a little old lady in Alex's humiliating case) slap them around a little too much. However, I think things gloriously change and improve in ""Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted"" (hereafter ""Mad 3""). Alex and his friends not only gain more proactive control in getting home, they reveal previously hidden skills and abilities and even take on responsibility for making others' lives better.<br/><br/>I'll try to give just a basic skeleton of ""Mad 3's"" plot (yeah, right). The movie begins with Alex and friends still stuck on the African wildlife preserve, perhaps vainly waiting for commando-minded Skipper (Tom McGrath) and his penguin crew to fly back in the rickety aircraft from Monte Carlo after making repairs. Tired of waiting, they, plus the wacky King Julian (Sacha Baron Cohen) and his lackeys sensible Maurice (Cedric the Entertainer) and the obsequious Mort (Andy Richter), snorkel all the way to Monte Carlo and find the penguins in disguise playing roulette in a casino. Hiding in the rafters, Alex and friends plan to nab the sneaky penguins and force them to fly everyone home.<br/><br/>Of course, things go awry and all the animals find themselves relentlessly pursued throughout the city by Animal Control Captain Chantel DuBois (Frances McDormand). A combination of Lucille Ball, Inspector Javert, a bloodhound, and the Terminator, Captain DuBois's true goal is mounting Alex's head on a wall. Despite DuBois's non-stop efforts, all the animals find refuge on a circus train. Learning that the train's tour itinerary includes New York, Alex figures that it can finally take him and his friends home. Before that can happen, though, they must ingratiate themselves with the circus's skeptical members. Gia the trapeze-artist jaguar (Jessica Chastain) and Alex's potential paramour, and Stefano, the high-strung Italian sea lion (Martin Short) and first cousin to Sid the sloth in the ""Ice Age"" movies, are relatively easily won over. Vitaly the gruff and sullen Siberian Tiger (Bryan Cranston) is a tougher cocoanut to crack because he is suspicious of Alex and friends' circus credentials. Also, he is a hoop-jumping star in decline because of a fiery stunt gone wrong.<br/><br/>The rest of the circus is not in such hot shape. It is dilapidated and playing to smaller and smaller crowds. If Alex and company want to get home, they got to help Vitaly get his nerve back and make the circus acts really eye-poppingly spectacular again. Meanwhile, they must also stay ahead of the seemingly unstoppable Captain DuBois, still on their trail. Can Alex and company accomplish these three goals? What if the circus troupe finds out the truth about their real intentions? Will DuBois get her stuffed lion head? ""Mad 3"" is, I think, the best, at least so far, of the franchise because at last Alex and company take matters into their own paws and hooves to improve not only their circumstances, but those of others. And how! Alex's cajoling, encouragement, and athletic skills start to inspire the troupe, especially the smitten Gia. Gloria and the insecure Melman not only perfect a literal high-wire act, but a romantic one, too. Irrepressible Marty helps Stefano with the cannonball act and the circus with a ""rainbow afro"". Even selfish Julien romantically bonds with melancholy bear Sonya and adds new dimensions to her cycling act. All this culminates in a gravity-defying, pulse-pounding circus extravaganza, like Cirque de Soleil to the nth power.<br/><br/>So ""Mad 3"" certainly has the energy, fire, and comic zaniness of its predecessors. But beyond that, it unexpectedly reveals lessons in friendship, self-reliance, helping others, overcoming inhibitions, self-sacrifice, and what home really means. If you liked the first two ""Madagascar"" movies, ""Mad 3"" will really make your happiness soar. If you weren't crazy about the first two, I suggest giving ""Mad 3"" a try. You just might end up with an exciting, meaningful, and unforgettable experience."

","I was surprised about this one - normally by the time you hit movie number three, the same story has been taken, chewed and spat out in much less appetizing form - but this movie was actually entertaining! Yeah, so the plot is pretty thin - the movie more than makes up for it with engaging visuals, fun characters and Captain DuBois, the franchise's newest villain. This is McDormand at her best. The over-the-top animal catcher has it all - from a tough-as-nails attitude to the ability to sing songs that leave everyone with smudged mascara (you have to see it to believe it). Cranston's Russian tiger is a complex character in a simple film, and Martin Short's sea lion could elicit a chuckle from the crustiest of moviegoers. The main characters don't really do anything we didn't see in the trailers - surprise! Gloria and Melman love the circus! - but Marty's circus Afro song is still a memorable part of the movie. And finally, kids will be rolling on the floor when Kin Julian falls in love with tricycle-riding bear Sonya, but Alex and Gia's romance will charm adults with a simple, heartfelt message - home is where the heart is."

","...Sequel that is.<br/><br/>Let's face it- at the moment, everyone's jumping on the trilogy bandwagon. Some though provide more successful results than others.<br/><br/>Madagascar 3 is DEFINITELY one of these successes.<br/><br/>Taking off where the second film left off (with some dialogue EXACTLY the same) the film is thrust straight into the continuing struggle to find home of our favourite bunch of animals.<br/><br/>Swimming to Monte Carlo to reunite with the Penguins and Chimps, they face possibly one of the most brilliant, if a little unrealistically super-human at times (note how she smashes through building walls), villain in the shape of 'Captain Dubois', Animal Control.<br/><br/>With Dubois on their tails, the animals join a travelling circus and make their way across the European continent, where more hilarity ensues as they realize they need to re-invent the floundering acts.<br/><br/>There are some truly beautiful moments in this film, such as the Trapeze Rehearsal with Alex and Gia, all helped by an excellent score. Combine with some visually stunning animation (such as that in the London Circus performance) and some snappy and humorous lines and you've found yourself what has to be one of the best films of the year.<br/><br/>Very few films reach a third and continue to be consistently good (or better) but Madagascar 3 is certainly one of them. Enjoyed it so much did I that I have seen it TWICE at the cinema, and would happily see it many times over.<br/><br/>My only criticism of the film overall is the clichéd underlying romance story. I don't see why one of these has to be crow-barred into every film these days; it can't be claimed as compulsory or helpful to EVERY story as the first Madagascar went without and did absolutely fine.<br/><br/>This aside, what you have here is an all-round thoroughly enjoyable film that will keep you entertained every time you watch it.

","Usually I am a bit apprehensive when I heard about the sequel of a cartoon movie or any movie comes to think of it, especially if the predecessor proved to be a good one.<br/><br/>But Madagascar had different effect on me, it actually excite me, perhaps due to Ben Stiller was the voice behind it or more to see those Penguins, I think somehow the Penguins won here I even watched the Nickoledeon TV Series of the Penguins life, it was Hilarious! If only it minus the King Julien.<br/><br/>Then it hit me, was what the script would be about, coz I thought they lived happily ever after in Africa (?)<br/><br/>Well, when the movie opened with Alex and the Gang longing to be back to NYC, I said to myself, this is exactly how the Urbanite feels after they been away from the urban life. Just like human, just like me<br/><br/>And then, those crazy Penguins; Skipper, Kowalski, Rico and Private; together with the British accent chimps going rampant in casino, was a hilarious idea. Mason and Phil were the 2 crazy, sarcastic, sometimes smart sometimes easily fooled chimpanzees played more part in this movie compared to previous.<br/><br/>The unexpected characters and story lines blended very well bringing fun and tickled to your belly kind a way, it didn't make sense but hey, that the ticklish part of it. It was not Pixar-esque movies.<br/><br/>Well, since this was the 3rd movie, most of us already familiar with the main characters of the Zoo-Escapist, let's go through the new guys on the neighbourhood of Madagascar 3<br/><br/>As you know the main story line was Alex and gang in an effort to get the Penguins to fly back to NYC, ended up trying to escape the very persistent Monte Carlo Animal Control Officer, unexpectedly joined a group of animal circus which turned out almost running out of its money and needed to be rejuvenated. <br/><br/>Here are the new characters who spiced up the story line:<br/><br/>I normally 'hate' or shall I say dislike King Julien character, annoying to the core, but, when he fell in love on first sight with Sonya, the tricycle bike chick; I found it was a sweet and funny moments. The clips when they went out on date, the King even met with the Pope, was that supposed to show he was a Catholic lemur (?), what an idea! Ha ha Hilarity climax ensued when Sonya being given a racing motor bike. Who would've guessed, a female brown bear wearing pink tutu and ribbon could being portrayed as a female version of Rossi..<br/><br/>Stefano, an Italian sea lion who was naïve but I'd say the glue to the circus and big believer of Vitaly, the Russian tiger. It struck me immediately that Vitaly was a Siberian Tiger (?) as he was Russian (?).<br/><br/>I felt so tickled when it was told that Vitaly act in the circus was going through Rings, and not just those normal Rings/Hoops, it sizes varied until it was a Ring Finger size, it was impossible, right? But in this movie it was possible by the help of Olive Oil. But Vitaly confidence diminished when he was caught on fire from the flaming rings of fire, because Olive Oil was flammable! Luckily Alex was to the rescue by suggesting him to use Hair Conditioner which was Non- Flammable.<br/><br/>When there was a Lion, there would be a Lioness or Female Feline. And no exception here, this time Alex met a pretty Jaguar who was so flexible, and having exotic name, Gia. Memorable moment was when she thought she learnt 'Americano Trapeze' style from Alex.<br/><br/>Captain Chantel DuBois, a very 'ambitious' animal control officer, I couldn't imagined what this world would've become if we have police officer like her (not animal control officer though); it would be an ideal world, perhaps (???)<br/><br/>As for the gang, Marty the Zebra was still the comedian and the clip of him doing Afro Circus Dance with Ra-Ta-Ta-Ta Afro Circus Tune was really an ear worm.<br/><br/>I still recalled Maurice's expression when King Julien was swallowed by Sonya, he smiled happily but then turned sour the moment King Julien was spitted out. Too bad, right, Maurice? And who could have missed the cute super duper worshipper, Mort, he also got more screen time in this movie.<br/><br/>Overall, it was a good movie for all ages and not a disappointing sequel indeed..It certainly one of my fave animated movies.<br/><br/>I wonder will Dream Works plan to have another sequel?

","You know those animated films that are engaging to watch, then leave you with some kind of a warm squishy feeling inside, after which you stop to think about it and you can identify some simple truth? You're like, yeah, I don't mind sitting through it if it means spending time with my kid, and afterward there's something to talk about.<br/><br/>Why is the film getting praise from critics? Sure, there were several cool scenes, our familiar characters, a few more silly and not so silly ones that I guess I was supposed to care about but never really had a reason to... and they did stuff. Now I like watching good cartoons, I can't say how many times I've been sucked into Cars while it was playing in the background, but this one didn't have anything tying it together. Weak plot. Made for an amount of boredom. Wouldn't sit through it again, though wouldn't mind it being on if it weren't for something else. Now I saw it in Russian, so maybe there were some really great lines that got lost in translation, but I sort of doubt that could fix much.<br/><br/>The biggest thing though, is when afterward you stop to think about it... what's the solution to their problems? It's like watching Wall-e, but reversed, so the Costco addict blobs convince Wall-e that the space ship resort is the best way to live after all. They all dance, stop caring what the mirror looks like or what happens outside their box and live happily ever after.<br/><br/>**** plot spoiler*****<br/><br/>While lying and acting out of their own interests, and being wholly ignorant of the circus culture and business, the heroes go on to start prescribing how to fix their hosts and their act by... doing a half-baked job of doing complex skills, sexing things up with some special effects, and sell it for an amazing profit. Magically things work out, and they overnight develop the required skill sets needed of circus performers, the truth comes out, then they become friends anyway.<br/><br/>Do these sound like any stereotypes of Americans? Why do you think people hate us and think we're stupid and dangerous? <br/><br/>I find the use of this theme particularly irritating, and counterproductive for what our children need in America. We need our kids to understand that they need to work hard and consistently over time to acquire important skills and knowledge, that they need to start observing and learning before trying to fix the world, that you can't solve problems by just throwing money at them. The movie is reaffirming the exact opposite:<br/><br/>Lack of skills + Half-aced effort + Confidence + Money = Success"

","The animals we've gotten to know in the previous two movies continue their quest to get home to NY in this third installment of the very profitable movie franchise. This time they buy a circus in order to impress an American promoter enough to book them in NY, thus taking them home for good.<br/><br/>First of all, having recently watched Pixar's Brave, I am bound to say that Madagascar 3 feels inferior in almost every aspect. Whereas Pixar usually deliver a touching and well-worked screenplay, the story here is confusing and morally ambiguous. Are circus animals traveling around the world performing tricks really OK? Many feel that it's wrong, but the movie happily ignores this rather complex moral issue.<br/><br/>It is also obvious that the screenwriter has not forgotten or forgiven France opposing the American war efforts of the early 2000s, as the story takes a turn to Monte Carlo for no other purpose than to introduce the ridiculous French antagonist, and add to that a Freedom Fries-joke that feels incredibly dated.<br/><br/>To sum it all up, this movie has a pretty weak plot and its aim is pretty obvious - to milk more money from the franchise. I hope they let it end here, as I feel this is pretty much the end of the road for these movies."

","""Poor animals. Now, you deal with ME!"" Capitaine Chantel DuBois (voice of Frances McDormand)<br/><br/>Although I miss Fantastic Mr. Fox as much as any contemporary animal fable, Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted is a lees cerebral but more athletic entry into my canon of animations that satisfy both children and adults. Our heroes, led by the charismatic lion Alex (Ben Stiller), are determined to go back to New York by way of a traveling European circus.<br/><br/>If you judge by the quote at the beginning of this essay, you'll note that even the villain, Ciaptaine DuBois, is fun, albeit French, a culture open for satire along with Italy and other vulnerable targets. In fact, DuBois' pursuit of the animals over Europe is a delightful mash-up of goofiness and wit. When she sings Edith Piaf's ""Non, je ne regrette rien,"" I confirmed my nostalgic commitment to this animation and acknowledged the brilliance that would integrate that legendary lament.<br/><br/>Although this animation is written by Fantastic Mr. Fox's Noah Baumbach, much more slapstick and far faster segments occur than in Fox, making it a lesser production but far more attractive to younger audiences. Even the 3-D shamelessly throws debris at the screen. Attractive to all audiences is a major theme of looking ahead to expanding one's talents and seeing home as another springboard for growth rather than a sedate refuge."

","The first ""Madagascar"" was unexpectedly funny and entertaining. Those four lead characters Alex, Marty, Gloria and Melman were delightful and pretty likable. However, the second one already gave me the feeling that the franchise was getting tired. Now that the Penguins already have their own TV show, I don't really want to see them on screen anymore! However, how could I say no to the kids who wanted to see this third installment? I just had to grin and shell out for the tickets.<br/><br/>Missing their zoo in New York after a long stay in Africa (from the second film), our four friends now make their way to Europe in order to find a way to go back to their old home. While being pursued by the French Animal Control officers, led by the superhuman-ly relentless Captain Chantel Dubois (who wants Alex the Lion's head on her wall), the four join a circus animal train to escape. How opportune that this particular train was en route to New York too. So now, Alex and friends have to help their new friends get their circus act together in order to be finally NYC-bound.<br/><br/>I felt that this whole flimsy story was just there to in order set up the stage for one spectacular scene: a very colorful and beautifully- animated ""Fantasia""-inspired sequence of multi-animal circus acrobatics accompanied by Katy Perry's hit song ""Firework."" The relationship of the four friends, which was the center of the first two episodes, were hardly tackled at all. This time it was just all about the action of eluding the animal catchers and getting to New York. The voice work was flawless as usual. Having Frances McDormand there as the vicious Capt. Dubois and Jessica Chastain as the cute jaguar-trapeze artist Gia were nice to know as the final credits were running.<br/><br/>Overall, I did not enjoy this one too much. I did not really have any LOL-moments while watching this particular installment. There were in fact a lot of cringe-worthy moments led by that very lame sequence where Marty was painted white with big polka dots and wearing a huge multi- colored Afro wig. As for the new characters, the ability of Vitaly the Tiger to go through small hoops was too impossible, the face of Stefano the Seal is too annoying to be cute, and the bear ""girlfriend"" of King Julien the Lemur felt unnecessary. This one is really strictly for the kids."
"crashlives","3","4","7","2 January 2015"," Embarrassing
","After seeing the first two Madagascar films, I was very excited for the third film. Sadly, it was nowhere close to my expectations. It started off well enough with the animals busting into the casino in Monte Carlo, but it's leaving the casino where the film gets bad. The villain is unbelievable and absolutely stupid. You can't wait for her to defeated, but for the wrong reasons. <br/><br/>Then the circus animals they meet are rather boring and the tiger's story is so absolutely ridiculous it's ridiculous for even a cartoon. That really ruined the film for me. Along with the rest of the cast, he was boring and just ridiculous. <br/><br/>It did have some good scenes in the film past breaking into the casino at Monte Carlo, though. The King Julien-Sonya romance is one of the funniest and most charming romances you'll ever see. The film is worth sitting through just for those scenes.<br/><br/>Overall, this film is strictly for younger children. Seriously, you'd have to have the mentality of a 5 year old boy to really enjoy this film. While the film does have some words that are VERY close to swear words, I can't remember them saying actual swear words and the references to swear words will fly right over the child's head (along with the sexual innuendo). Not a fun or charming film and absolutely ridiculous, so I'll give it a 3 out of 10."

Poor voice-over work by the all-star cast, and the AFRO CIRCUS song gets old quickly. There are some striking and beautiful animation sequences, but they get lost among all the nonsense.

","I remember going to the cinema with great expectation to see the brand-new Dreamworks project MADAGASCAR, back in June 2005. Boy was I disappointed; it was the kind of movie that makes think something like ""that's it?"" when the credits begin to roll. Seven years later I didn't give a f*** when the third one (EUROPE'S MOST WANTED) was released. Nevertheless I ended watching it on the big screen (the 2D version) last Friday afternoon! I went to the cinema with my girlfriend and having seen already the great PROMETHEUS (we actually wanted to check out the new Woody Allen film, TO ROME WITH LOVE, but sadly its release was postponed or something) there wasn't really anything else that we wanted to see. We ended choosing this one, over the new Tim Burton picture (I'm still not sure if I want or not to watch this), mainly because my girlfriend actually liked the second MADAGASCAR (which I haven't seen). But in the end we both agree the third one is plain bad. <br/><br/>I actually liked the first minutes of it. Thought it was really cool the made-with-sand model of New York City and the reference to KING KONG. Yes, that's pretty much what I liked of this film. It's hard to believe that one of its writers also co-wrote (together with the mighty Wes Anderson) the masterpiece FANTASTIC MR. FOX. I mean, both films are quite the opposite, with this one being like a collection of random material. MADAGASCAR 3 is painfully random, to tell the truth. They throw at you lots of stuff that is just not really funny or spectacular (as they intended), like a lemur and a bear getting married in Rome (what is it with this traveling around the world kind of thing in animated films? I mean, I recently re-watched last year's CARS 2 and just like in this one the characters travel to Italy and England!), and frankly at one point I was like ""calm down!"" – it's only in the middle of the movie or so when you finally get some story to follow (about a familiar subject in kids movies: friendship). <br/><br/>Also, I found those new characters to be really annoying; take for instance the case of the antagonist, who is voiced by Frances McDormand. In the hands of other writers this character could have been a whole lot of fun (a bad to the bone animal control hunter who is trying to make the lion one of her trophies); they think this character is fun, but it's just so crazy it gets ridiculous. Anyway, the kids at the cinema even applauded when it was over. So yes, they seem to love it but I don't, at all. <br/><br/>*Watched it on 22 June, 2012"
"lucozade-32523","3","3","5","17 November 2016"," A Disappointing End
","Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted<br/><br/>Rating: 3<br/><br/>A Disappointing End<br/><br/>After the high of Madagascar 2, improving on the okay movie that was Madagascar, I came to Madagascar 3 hoping that the trend would continue and it would be even better than the second. I was sadly disappointed: it was dumb, dull and dreadful.<br/><br/>As is to be expected, the third main installment in the Madagascar series sees Alex the lion (Ben Stiller), Marty the zebra (Chris Rock), Gloria the hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith), Melman the giraffe (David Schwimmer) and their friends try to find their way back to New York. This time, they are pursued by a relentless French Pest Control Officer and stow away on an animal circus train, becoming owners of said circus.<br/><br/>In contrast to the rest of the movie, the animation was excellent. It was visually appealing, pretty and colourful and was an improvement on the earlier entries in the series. Shame there wasn't a movie to go with it.<br/><br/>The plot is by far the worst part of the film, and if it had been up to a decent standard, the other problems wouldn't have seemed so bad. Suspension of disbelief is to be expected in films, but this goes so far beyond this as t become utterly ridiculous and render the film pointless. Characters literally do the impossible in a huge way and on a frequent basis and it's lazy. In many ways, the film is all over the place and makes no sense. On other occasions, chunks of the plot are resolved far too easily and so become (I've said it before) pointless. In terms of comedy, it is almost non-existent. I remember about three occasions it made me smile and many jokes seem very forced.<br/><br/>Apart from Alex, the main characters from the previous film are shunted to the back to get even less development than Alex and the new characters that replace them. This is sad because they are as much a part of this series: I would have loved the penguins, the lemurs and even the chimps to get more screen time and lines. In fact, I don't even remember if the chimps got any dialogue at all and King Julien seems to be constantly drunk or high. Furthermore, the main quartet suddenly pick up new talents out of nowhere just to fit the plot. In my opinion, bringing in lot's of new characters is a sign of laziness and for the most part the new characters and predictable and dull. I say for the most part, I kind of like Vitaly, although I don't know if it's just his accent I like. The villain is unoriginal, unrealistic and dull.<br/><br/>Another thing that bugged me was the constant use of songs, some which I didn't even feel fitted the scene. In the previous films, they were strategically placed but here they are everywhere and they lose all meaning because of it. And don't even get me started on that horrible ""Afro Circus"" song - no, don't play it at the end like you're proud of it! <br/><br/>It's sad for me because the original film was quite a big part of my childhood. My siblings and I even had cuddly toy versions of the main characters, so it pains me to see the studio stoop to such levels of laziness and money grabbing it. A five year old might enjoy how colourful it is but there is nothing else to enjoy in this disappointing end. Now, I'm going to create fake accounts and dislike the ""Afro Circus"" YouTube video."

","If I was a toddler, I would have been amazed at the frenzy of colours splashing across the screen. Unfortunately I'm now in my 30's and need more than a bright colour palette to appease the child hiding somewhere within.<br/><br/>What I like most about animated films is their ability to usually cater for both adults and children (at times the animated films even feel like an adult movie hidden within a computer generated environment). Madagascar 3 felt more ""just for the easily entertained"". To be blatantly honest, the film is really not that funny despite the amount of talent involved.<br/><br/>King Julian is one of my all-time favourite animated characters, but the King Julian I fell in love with in Mad 1 and 2 disappeared in screen time and stripped down to a form of his lesser self in this instalment, being replaced by the less likable Stefano who's not just a blubber of a sealion, but also a blubbering mess.<br/><br/>If you prefer a visual overload without any sort of narrative depth or comedy anyone over five can enjoy, then this is the movie for you."
"policy134","5","3","5","31 May 2013"," A little of Column A and B
","This has to be the hardest movie to rate as either great or terrible. The good parts are so good indeed that you can almost forgive the bad, but not quite.<br/><br/>Let's start with the good. A truly compelling take on an absolutely stale idea: Running away, or in this case becoming a circus. It totally mimics that old, old saying: You can't go home again. Here the twist is that none of the characters really gives a damn about the circus and are using it to get this: Go back and be another kind of performers, although using a lot less skill.<br/><br/>Another positive: Ben Stiller really has made Alex the Lion his own. He totally nails it every time. Although, a lot of it is based on parts he has played before, he makes it so likable<br/><br/>Sorry to say that every single one of the other main cast are totally wasted. Somehow, they are totally written off as individuals in this one. Chris Rock's has only one scene to shine, David Schwimmer gets nothing and Jada Smith hardly has any screen time. They all get the same recycled material that may have worked 2 other times but totally falls on its face here.<br/><br/>What does get a lot of attention are the new characters and some of them impressed. Bryan Cranston does a marvelous job as the tiger with the wounded ego and burned coat and Frances McDormand is of course amazing as the French Gendarme. But sorry to say, the action sequences with her are just plain ridiculous. Like the T2 in Terminator 2 only with less emotions.<br/><br/>Of course, the animation is top notch all the way through and that's why it is so sad that the thing is so average anyway. Also, there are way too much emphasis on making the whole thing look as cool as possible to please teens and tweens. Also, the music numbers are poorly chosen."
"FairlyAnonymous","7","3","5","11 January 2013"," Better than the other first two movies
","Madagascar 3 surprised me in the fact that it was able to finally do something the other movies couldn't: have a structured plot. If there is one problem the first two movies had is that the plot was rather tacked on but the main focus of the movies was character interaction. The characters were the reason why we liked the Madagascar 3. This movie is able to accomplish both great character interaction and still maintain a fairly good plot. <br/><br/>Now the interesting thing about this movie is that the beginning of the movie (first couple minutes) is entirely rushed and for good reason. The plot wastes no time in Africa (no goodbyes even) so the beginning of the movie is non-stop crazy action and has very little explanation for why everything is happening. The movie does recognize some of the scenes are borrowed from the first two movies and that not everything makes sense logically. However the movie really picks up its pace when it reaches the circus.<br/><br/>The circus group is very entertaining and interesting. It adds a new cast of characters which was really needed. Since we have already established and gone through every issue between the main characters in the last movies this allows the movie to focus on issues of new characters. Alex, Marty, Gloria, and Melman get along fine and don't have any issues with each other. This is a good thing. The jokes in this movie work fairly well and the nice thing about this movie is that it shows stereotypes on all sides. It isn't just the French, Russian, Canadian, or Italian people who have stereotypes but the Americans as well (A man in a western outfit, wearing a wide brim hat with a bald eagle as a pet).<br/><br/>The overall plot is that the old gang is trying to find the penguins who are in Monte Carlo. However when trying to get them back they are chased down by a creepy animal catcher/hunter. She follows them constantly in their tracks. The animals manage to escape by boarding a circus train and this is where the plot really kicks off.<br/><br/>If there is one thing this movie has a lot of it's music. The movie uses a lot of licensed music and it actually works well. I was surprised that a certain well known song that is entirely overused in every movie and generally annoys me was actually used effectively and was appropriate for this movie. The animation also stands out as very remarkable. I have to say that I haven't seen a single Dreamworks movie that hasn't impressed me with its animation. Honestly, this movie looks really good.<br/><br/>So overall I have to say that Madagascar 3 does a lot of things better than the previous movies. It is faster, has better plot, has more characters, good humor, good soundtrack, and is never boring. It is always entertaining and something is always going on. Good movie!"

Still, I appreciated whatever stuff I thought was funny particularly when something that went over many under-12s heads was said or done.

","The third, and perhaps final, episode of the four friends who ran away from their zoo enclosures to experience a better life, are finally on their way back home. When Skipper the Penguin (McGrath) and his crew decide to take their warp speed travelling aircraft to Monte Carlo to win some big money, Alex the Lion (Stiller), Marty the Zebra (Rock), Melman the Giraffe (Schwimmer) and Gloria the Hippo (Smith) sense that they may never come back to fetch them. The crew decide to find them and make them go back home to NYC with King Julien the Lemur (Baron Cohen) and his sidekicks in tow. Animal Control officer Captain Chantel DuBois (McDormand) is called after the animals wreck havoc in one of the casino's and is asked to put the creatures where the belong, on her living room wall. The movie is a perfect example of 'old wine, new bottle. The main elements for which we all loved the first movie have been collected and repackaged into this brand new offering. King Julien is the same, his song is the same and the old characters seem to be there for no reason. Even Melman had no role as the 'doctor' as he always was, Gloria wasn't shown for her 'beauty' and Marty wasn't the eccentric that we loved. Its still a watchable movie, but is far from where the original epic was made."

",">>>>>>>Very very mild spoilers<<<<<<<<<< First thing first , all the guys who worked on this movie deserve a pat on the back and a warm hug. You guys just saved the 'Madagascar'.<br/><br/>First film was wonderful, full of humors, funny, hilarious. But then you crushed everything with the 2nd one. <br/><br/>But hey! Cheers, you made Madagascar 3 the way you made it. Madagascar 3 is wonderful, full of humors, funny, hilarious (once again on the track). I personally think that The Penguins, The Chimps, King Julian and his Minions should be given more space in your next movie and I think you should have done that in all previous 2. I mean they are there but its not enough. They are the bunch I like 'Madagascar' for, besides of course our 4 Heroes. Stay away from long negative character's roles in Madagascar and fill your movie with hilarious characters like The Penguins, The Chimps, King Julian and his Minions etc. That's the reason that I liked first film and thats the reason I never liked 2nd one. Because there wasn't any bad or negative character filling the whole movie in Madagascar (1st one ) but there was that psycho 'nanny' in the 'Madagascar 2' that ruined everything. Remember we watch Madagascar for fun, not for some 'psycho nanny'. The guys like The Penguins, The Chimps, King Julian and his Minions and our four heroes are fun. You tried to repeat that whole thing with that crazy, psycho 'captain dubois' in 3rd but luckily the hilarious characters and the whole circus thing saved you or this might have been another garbage like the 2nd one. So next time stay away from such negative characters in Madagascar.......I really really wished that you never had 'captain dubois' in Madagascar 3. To make Alex and the team run for their freedom and lives, only the normal police with no special characters would have been more fun and I would have kept the 'Madagascar 3' as a masterpiece..........There was no need for the psycho nanny in Madagascar 2 and there was no need for the psycho captain dubois in Madagascar 3( a bunch of normal cops and other law officials would have been sufficient or a fuuny character should have been more fun than the psycho captain dubois)......More emphasis should have been on 'The Circus' and the problems, triumphs and lives of our 4 heroes and The Circus members....... The 'captain dubois' character was a Big Turn Off and unnecessary. Mark my words and don't do this next time. But enough advice, let's talk about the experience. I was not sure after the 2nd movie but thanks my guts I gathered my courage to watch the Madagascar 3. Although when I sensed captain dubois's character it turned me off and I was about to loose hope but then came 'The Circus'. If not for the circus thing I might have given this movie a 1 the lowest possible. And if 'captain dubois' hadn't shown up in the whole movie (and of course no such other psycho, negative character) I definitely have rated it a perfect 10. I personally took the risk to watch Madagascar 3 because of The Penguins, The Chimps, King Julian and his Minions. Anything to watch and hear them :). The Circus thing was hilarious and it saved the movie.<br/><br/>The smart, inteligently funny Penguins, The Hilarius Chimps, And the romantic King Julian were at their best in the movie. I love them. The whole circus thing rediscovered the fun, adventurous sides of our 4 heroes and discovered there new abilities. Fun to watch them. I am waiting for another adventure with 'The Whole Circus' (i.e. our 4 heroes and the circus team members). You 'the makers' better stay from psycho 'nanny' and psycho 'captain dubois' like characters' long roles which fills and spoils the whole movie."

","I have to admit, that I didn't think this was going to entertain me as much as it did. There is the thin plot that made some people say that it gets the wrong message across. While it isn't entirely true (especially if you watch the movie you'll see there is more to it), you can understand why people would think that after watching the trailer of the movie.<br/><br/>And there was also the weaker second Madagascar movie that I had in the back of my mind. So I was hesitant when I went to see this one. But the jokes do work most of the time (even though there are some weird music choices in the movie). The 3-D effects are also really adding additional value to the movie. Animated movies seem to get them right most of the time anyway, but I thought I mentioned this anyway.<br/><br/>So maybe I liked it because of my low expectations or at least it helped a lot. But still if you are open minded you'll have fun with this"

","The film was fun to watch, I like how its funny yet emotional at the same time because you really want them to get back to he zoo! But on their way back to the zoo they encounter trouble on their way as the plain crashes and to get back to the zoo they have to act as circus animals to get on the train then they have to help the circus animals perform which was funny to watch. the journey from Africa back to new york zoo was a quick journey but on their way they made new friends and realised that they are wild animals. They get back to the zoo and they realise how much better their life is without the zoo and that the wild is their home. As you watch the film you notice that the wild is their home and they don't need to be in a zoo because they can survive with each other in the wild."

The voice acting and story line is amazing and carries on great from the first 2 films. I was very impressed with the effects that were in the film and all the bright colours.

","Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted – CATCH IT (B+) Madagascar is another franchise like Ice Age which has captivated audience's attention worldwide. By comparing both the franchises we are able to see the loving creatures fighting for their survival in unlikely circumstances. In Ice Age they are fighting the natural disasters and in Madagascar they just want to go back Home and funny thing is they don't know which one is there home after living so long in the ZOO. Alex, Marty, Melman, and Gloria are still struggling to get home to New York. This time, their journey takes them to Europe where they are relentlessly pursued by the fanatical Monaco Animal Control officer Captain Chantel DuBois (Frances McDormand). As a means of getting passage to North America, the zoo animals purchase a failing traveling circus as they become close friends with the staff like Vitaly (Bryan Cranston), Gia (Jessica Chastain), and Stefano (Martin Short). Together, they spectacularly revitalize the business and along the way find themselves reconsidering where their true home really is. I think Madagascar has gone better with each installment, as their characters develop more and more. I had really fun time watching them trying going back to the ZOO. The new characters were funny and welcome addition. And have to admit fanatical Monaco Animal Control officer Captain Chantel DuBois (Frances McDormand) character was something really impressive. In the end it's another fun movie about our favorite characters and cannot wait to see them on another fun adventure."
"bhaveshbhatia","7","2","3","1 July 2012"," 3D is the only way to watch this awesome sequel!
","One thing can be said for sure, Madagascar 3 has become more than a movie on the silver screen. Like all the previous Madagascar movies, this time also they tell us something more. The name Madagascar has become a brand and a franchise. People from every age relate themselves with the movie. It is amazing to see the effect of the movie on everyone. The movie brings tears to the eye of any kid which is remarkable. In today's world of graphics and animation, Madagascar is the Holy Grail.<br/><br/>Like every movie franchise, Madagascar has also had it share of bad days. But it seems that all is over now with the release of Madagascar 3. With their latest venture, it seems that DreamWorks have tied all loose ends to produce a star, forgetting all about their last disaster. There is nothing missing in the movie – excellent movie, great effects, hilarious jokes and the bonus – our animals have finally arrived in the city. The third edition finds Alex, Marty, Gloria and Mellman (lion, zebra, hippo and giraffe respectively) lost in Europe. They take the helps of some circus animals to return to the Central Park Zoo. There is a lot of (mis)adventure with all the animals being forced to become members of the Zaragosa (name of the circus)! We will also see a lot of penguins, the great King Julien XIII and his associates and a handful of ever-irritating monkeys. Vitaly (tiger), Gia (jaguar), Stefano (sea-lion), a gang of rogue Yorkshire terriers and police Chief Cpt. Chantel Dubois are the new characters added to this edition of Madagascar.<br/><br/>The animals are as spontaneous as ever. An interesting fact is that they are more human like in this edition. The humor well is spread making it a movie not so much for children only. The one-liners are hard-hitting and references to the pop-culture may not be pleasing to everyone. Children will find it difficult to relate to some scenes and jokes because of the maturity. However, this is good as they will find something new to discover when they sit to watch this movie year's later.<br/><br/>If indeed Madagascar 3 is the last movie of the franchise, it is bad news for the Madagascar fans. If indeed Madagascar 3 is the last movie of the franchise, there could not have any a more fitting finale to the great brand which we know as Madagascar."
"Christian_Dimartino","7","2","3","28 June 2012"," It's nothing special, but it's fun.
","The Madagascar series hasn't been that well received. I like them, but a lot of people don't for some reason. It's been a long time since we last saw Alex, Marty, Melman, Gloria, King Julian, and the gang. So I wasn't expecting a whole lot. But I saw Madagascar: Europe's Most Wanted Last Night, and it was pretty good.<br/><br/>Once again, the gang is trying to return back to New York. While doing so, they end up in Monte Carlo, where a break-in to a casino goes poorly. While on the run from a crazy animal control officer(Voiced perfectly by Frances McDOrmand, one of the films strongest parts), the gang joins a circus in hopes that they can finally get home.<br/><br/>I've noticed that every film has focused on Alex mainly, and here it is the same case. Alex sort of hogs the spotlight, the rest of the characters, aside from Marty's stupid afro circus song, get pushed off to the side. I can't think of one line they said. Also, the Italian accents from Bryan Cranston, Jessica Chastain, and Martin Short, are silly.<br/><br/>But the film is fun, and it's funny, and it's got some gorgeous animation. But I enjoyed a lot of the moments with Frances McDormand. McDormand give one of the most talented voice performances of the year. She's hilarious, wild, and she can sing wicked french. I had a blast watching her alone.<br/><br/>Madagascar the third isn't nearly as good as something like Brave, or a lot of animations. But it's a fun escape, sure to keep little munchkins entertained. It's not as good as the second one, but it's better than the first one. I had fun, but I guess i'm still a kid on the inside.<br/><br/>B"

","Madagascar 3 EMW brings us back to the happy fun group of Alex, Marty, Gloria and Melman, along with King Julien, Maurice, Mort, and the penguins.<br/><br/>Seeking the penguins in Monte Carlo, the group made chaos in a hotel and thus we're introduced to the antagonist Captain Chantel DuBois, the leader of the French Animal Control. Upon escaping from DuBois and her men, the group meets new (animal) friends in a circus train, en route to Rome and London. Can they get back to New York?<br/><br/>I watched this without remembering what happened in Parts 1 and 2. But that doesn't mean that one won't be able to understand this film without watching its predecessors. The laughter goes on from the beginning to the end of the film. That's a guarantee! It has quite a number of excellent songs, namely: Katy Perry's Firework (circus in London) and Edith Piaf's Non, je ne regrette rien (DuBois in Italian custody). Both fits the scenes really well. The latter reminds me vividly of that one scene in Babe 2.<br/><br/>Like Shrek, this film is not only for kids, but adults too would enjoy it. So, go watch it! =D"
"a-orourke-292-969653","6","2","3","10 June 2012"," More ""life"" than the first and second Madagascar!
","My vote: 6/10 (not so bad). I've just seen Madagascar 3 the month it came in cinemas. The film was all right but it wasn't too much my taste. It was funny with a lot of super actions and dancing but for me it was more for a little kid to see the movie. For me it was a little bit too childish like comedy. Madagascar is not my favorite movie, for sure. To be honest, it was fun! The pinguins and chimpanzes are still very funny! The makers of Madagascar put more life into the third one, and that is very good! Madagascar 3 has more imagination, more style and more life than the 2 first ones. They make us dream! I haven't seen it in 3D. King Julien still makes me laugh a lot! The end was so cool! The circus dancing was so fun! It was very well decorated for the film!!! Traveling around the world in a circus train is a very good idea for a story!!! Well done for it! I am almost sure that little kids will adore more Madagascar 3 than the older persons! I think (because it is a story for little children). I am fourteen and it wasn't too much my age this Madagascar! It is recommended for little children, for sure! They will find it more funny! Thank you very much for reading it! It was an asperger review.(it means that I have a different way of explaining and writing things)."

","Don't get me wrong, this movie was good. It still made me laugh a lot! The only thing was it did not beat out the first two Madagascars, but it still had a great storyline and a great bad guy which are the things I like!! The cute and cuddly penguins are also back and kicking butt. If it wasn't for them,Alex and friends would be dead. So enough talking,let me tell you about the film (and no, there is no spoiler!) After Alex try to leave Africa and fails, the team goes to Monte Carlo to find the penguins. Then they join the circus and thats all I am going to tell you. You can find out what happens when you go see it. Just because I gave this movie a seven because some parts where slow does not mean you can not go and see it!!! Hey we are all different. Who knows ,you all may love it. There is only one way to find out. Go and see it then write a review. I mean this movie was not a bad movie like ""Surfs Up""- now that was an epic failure! This movie has no profanity. Not even a little like omg or anything. This was a good clean family movie that everyone can see. I will just say if Dreamworks is going to make a fourth one make it epic!!! For Movie USA, I am Alex Adams. Thanks for reading."
"Chris_Pandolfi","8","2","3","8 June 2012"," The Simple Joy of Cartoon Watching
","The greatest pleasure of ""Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted"" is that it's nothing more or less than what it is. There is not a scene, a character, a shot, or a line of dialogue that falls within the realm of plausibility. It's a red-blooded cartoon – physically impossible, narratively unbound, totally absurd. It was a wonderful experience. I think we sometimes put too much pressure on ourselves to apply meaning to every movie we see; films like this are like a shot in the arm, for they give us license to put our brains on autopilot and take it at face value. I savored the humor, the charm, and the visuals, the latter of which are quite imaginative and surprisingly enhanced by the process of 3D. That shouldn't stop you from saving your money and seeing it in traditional 2D, however, especially since you will be seeing a brighter picture.<br/><br/>Picking up exactly where its predecessor left off, the film begins with our favorite New York City Zoo castaways – the lion Alex (voiced by Ben Stiller), the zebra Marty (voiced by Chris Rock), the hippo Gloria (voiced by Jada Pinkett Smith), and the giraffe Melman (voiced by David Schwimmer) – swimming from the African continent to Monte Carlo in an effort to find the Penguins. Their arrival and subsequent infiltration of a casino was well planned but poorly executed; they're immediately noticed by the elegantly-dressed gamblers, who run away screaming. This attracts the attention of Captain Chantel DuBois of Monaco Animal Control (voiced by Frances McDormand), a black-clad, military-like matron who lives for the conquest of hunting and stuffing animals, specifically their heads. All she needs is a lion to complete the picture.<br/><br/>Apparently indestructible (she can literally break through brick walls, concrete, and glass and only have to reapply her lipstick), a skilled ninja-like acrobat, and armed with an inhuman ability to crawl on the ground and sniff out animals on the run, DuBois takes part in a breathtaking action sequence that begins with a car chase and ends with all the characters dangling from the opening of a makeshift airplane. When the castaways finally do escape, they determine to work their way back to New York City. Lo and behold, they take shelter on board a travelling circus train, where the animal act could be transported to the U.S. if their tryout in London is successful. The leader, a Russian tiger named Vitaly (voiced by Bryan Cranston), is an angry soul who lost his spirit for performing after years of greasing himself up and jumping through hoops no bigger than an ordinary ring.<br/><br/>Under constant threat from Vitaly, who has the ability to throw knives, the castaways are told in no uncertain terms that only circus animals are allowed on the train. Naturally, they lie. They also take it upon themselves to train the circus animals, not only because the Penguins bought the deed from their original owners but also because they're genuinely awful. They befriend an Italian jaguar named Gia (voiced by Jessica Chastain) and an Italian sea lion named Stefano (voiced by Martin Short). The former, sleek and beautiful, is a trapeze artist. The latter, although a few coconuts short of a palm tree, is eager to have himself shot out of a cannon. Meanwhile, the lemur King Julien (voiced by Sacha Baron Cohen), immediately falls in love with a gigantic tutu-wearing bear that rides around on a tiny bicycle. She's the only animal character that doesn't talk and actually looks a little something like a real bear.<br/><br/>The circus' opening night in London is an astounding display of visual creativity. The animals defy gravity as they swoop, flip, and fly through gigantic neon-colored hoops that hover in the air. Melman and Gloria perform a tight-rope act across glowing chords that look like enormous guitar strings, and Alex and Gia team up for awe-inspiring trapeze stunts. This is the one scene that exemplifies the best utilization of the 3D process; yes, characters fly at you in gimmicky ways, but at the same time, we feel immersed in an explosion of sight and sound. The motivating force behind this revamped show, on the basis of Alex's motivational speech earlier in the film, was Cirque du Soleil. The characters never actually utter those exact words, but we know exactly what they're talking about.<br/><br/>There are many genuinely funny moments, although admittedly, children are unlikely to pick up on them. Consider, for example, the Penguins' sarcastic, disparaging comparisons between the French and Canadian work philosophies. Also consider the scene in which DuBois finds herself without backup, her entire team lying in hospital beds wearing full body casts; it seems that, when you passionately sing the French anthem ""Non Je Ne Regrette Rien,"" it inspires such devotion to a cause that the body can actually break through the hardened casts. Isn't it nice, how the filmmakers had both parents and children in mind? ""Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted"" may be little more than unbridled cartoon wackiness, but let it not be said that adults aren't just as deserving of pure entertainment.<br/><br/>-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)"

","Having enjoyed the first two movies, my family settled into this one anticipating enjoyment, certainly reviews here indicate that the movie is worthwhile.<br/><br/>The film starts where it left off, but then 5 minutes into it, the movie just lost the plot. I felt confused for most of the movie. There was no consideration for linking back to the story, and even for an animated children's film, lacked sense. I felt it took advantage of the audience by using previous frivolities and injecting them with steriods to the point of nonsense and not in a good way.<br/><br/>It is a terrible film. It has taken away the cleverness and fun of the earlier films and I wish I hadn't seen it. I gave it 2 stars - it was at least colourful."

","This is a story about passion, change, friendship and challenge. To be honest, the style of Madagascar is quite different, but it is this kind of difference that makes people sincerely admire after laughing. Whether it was the circus or the final rescue, it was a collective outbreak of imagination, scripts and visual effects. The first half of the European war was also excellent and interesting. It ends with a full stop to the series? Then this full stop is beautiful enough! The best picture of the three. Female boss is really quite powerful, the final circus robbery is simply shocking circus, colorful, very exciting and beautiful."

","The Madagascar trilogy has been a weird expirience meaning that the first one wasn't actually that good while both of the two sequels were so much better.<br/><br/>The second movie is probably still the best story, but Europe's Most Wanted steals the price as the most wildly energetic and absolutely crazy one of them which I mean in the best way possible. The first one was also kind of crazy, but came off as rather noisy while this is controlled insanity in my eyes.<br/><br/>I mean that every new character has certain characteristics like these circus animals of different nationalities and personalities and some are more fleshed out than others, but the tiger has a nice character arc to follow. Oh, and that French police woman is just hysterical! No doubt the funniest part of the movie.<br/><br/>And the animation here is just top notch with much vibrancy in the colours and swooping camera movements all over the place in the big circus acts and what else of these crazy chase scenes they embark on.<br/><br/>Not as heartfelt as the second movie, and to be honest, I think that the Madagascar adventure could have ended there, but Madagascar: Europe's Most Wanted wrapped it all up nicely and gave us a hell of an entertaining ride."

"tomgillespie2002","6","1","1","30 March 2017"," Packed with problems, but whizzes by far too fast to care
","A distinct lack of charm and originality have never been criticisms to inspire a studio to scrap a billion dollar franchise in favour of doing something a little more worthwhile, so Alex the lion (Ben Stiller), Marty the zebra (Chris Rock), Melman the giraffe (David Schwimmer) and Gloria the hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith) return four years after their detour to Africa for another continent-spanning adventure, this time in Europe. This third entry into the hugely successful franchise packs so much colour, noise and incident into its 90 minute running time that the issues with the first two films - which are still present here - are reduced to a mere afterthought. To my utter surprise, Europe's Most Wanted is actually quite fun.<br/><br/>Bored with Africa and longing for their home in New York, the anthropomorphic foursome take sail to Monte Carlo, where the penguins and primates have already made themselves at home. An incident in a casino leads to a vicious, game-hunting animal control worker named Chantal DuBois (Frances McDormand) chasing them across the city. As the authorities close in, the group make a break for it by hopping on a circus train, where they are met with resistance by a bitter, once-famous performer Vitaly the Siberian tiger (Bryan Cranston), but welcomed by the doe-eyed jaguar Gia (Jessica Chastain) and the optimistic sea lion Stefano (Martin Short). With the circus lacking inspiration with a tired act, Alex and co. come up with a plan to reinvigorate the show as they tour Europe, in the hope of making enough money to get them home.<br/><br/>Making up for the blocky, uninspired animation of the previous movies, Madagascar 3 is a feast for the eyes, really coming to life during the physics-defying, laser-filled circus shows. The script is slightly more sophisticated, which is possibly due to the involvement of Noah Baumbach, yet the characters still need to compensate for the lack of actual jokes by shouting nonsense or falling over. As for the newcomers, they are infinitely more engaging than the stock long- lost family members from part 2, with Cranston clearly revelling in the chance to do a ridiculous Russian accent, and Chastain purring it up as the love interest. However, the biggest impression is left by a character who doesn't speak at all; a giant female bear (the growls are performed by Frank Welker) who forms a weird romantic relationship with King Julien (Sacha Baron Cohen) in the movie's most endearing transgressive move. The narrative is packed with problems, but the whole thing whizzes by far too fast to care."
"cat_gio","Null","1","1","30 December 2015"," The innuendos in the film are to die for
","The movie starts out as always, with Alex and the gang stuck and wishing to go to another place (It may it be adventurous as in the first movie or just a return to home like in the second).<br/><br/>Warning: the following contains spoilers!<br/><br/>The penguins left Alex, Marty, Melman and Gloria in Africa to go to Monte Carlo to gamble and win big. The naive Alex believes that they will come back and suddenly realizes what Marty, Gloria and Melman had realized a long time ago – the penguins and monkeys are not returning. Their big idea is to go to Monte Carlo and find the penguins to make them apologize for deserting them. With hilarious scenes that even the most serious adult couldn't help laughing to, the animals meet up with the penguins only to find them fleeing from French Captain Chantel Dubois, who happens to be a relentlessly persistent animal hunter. Cornered by the captain, the animals board a circus train in hopes of once returning back home in New York. Aboard the train, we meet the Russian tiger Vitaly (voiced amazingly by Bryan Cranston), a former circus star who was scarred forever- literally. Alex falls in love with Gia, an aspiring acrobatic, Marty meets a shy and not so bright friend seal called Stefano (brilliantly voiced by Martin Short), and Gloria and Melman become more romantically involved.<br/><br/>The movie was actually very captivating, with little innuendos that only older kids and adults would understand. Sure, the movie does overplay the ""afro-circus"" bit we've all seen from the commercial, but nonetheless, it was entertaining. And what would be a Madagascar movie without ""I Like To Move It!""<br/><br/>The movie does seem to be more of an 8+ movie, and I, as well as any parent there, was surprised when Vitaly said, ""Bolshevik,"" clearly thinking that other, not-so-childish word. I'm not saying that you shouldn't bring a 5-year-old to see it, but I personally believe it becomes funnier when you do understand the implications that the screenwriters included in there. Anything from ""What's New Pussycat"" to The Matrix is included in this film, leaving you somehow feeling superior to the kids who don't understand any of it. (Even though that sounds harsher and weirder than what it really is). This movie plays on all your emotions, leaving you a helpless romantic with Alex and Gia or even with Gloria and Melman. It makes you yearn to learn more about Vitaly's past, and in fact, it leaves you upset when you finally do learn about his past. It also leaves you feeling just a little bit sad when you realize just how bright (or not) Stefano really is.<br/><br/>But most of all, I think it's the subtle details that leave you in awe and laughing. The smile on Mort's face when King Julian ""dies"" or the color effects of the body paints used in the circus. Sure, there are some slow parts, and I am not saying you should go miss something important to see this movie, but you should go see it if you are in need of something to do. Also, although sequels (and threequels in this case) usually tend to do worse than the first one, this one did definitely better than the second one – and might actually surpass the first – and then you start wondering just how many story lines can be made out of trying to return home."

","For some film trilogies, the third time is rarely the charm. But for viewers beyond 9th Grade {Ages 15 and older}, Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted has little.<br/><br/>Picking up where we left off in Escape 2 Africa, Alex the Lion {Ben Stiller}, Marty the Zebra {Chris Rock, acting like an annoying party guest at times}, Gloria the Hippo {Jada Pinkett Smith}, Melman the Giraffe {David Schwimmer} and King Julien, the Lemur {Sacha Baron Cohen} decides to return home this time to the Central Park Zoo. But first, they attempt to pick up their fellow friends, the Penguins and the Monkeys in France's Monte Carlo.<br/><br/>The plan soon goes into danger mode when the animals are being chased by Captain Chantel DuBois {Frances Macdormand}. To hide, the animals then runaway with a group of circus animals including Stefano the Italian Sea Lion {Martin Short}, Vitaly the Tiger {Bryan Cranston} and Gia the Jaguar {Jessica Chastain, soon to star in Broadway's The Heiress this fall}. Soon, the zoo folks buy the circus and use it as their journey home from Europe to New York, while avoiding being caught by DuBois. <br/><br/>Directors and DreamWorks Animation veterans Eric Darnell, Tom McGrath and Conrad Vernon handles the gimmicks for the 3D version amazingly well and the animation look rich and colorful enough. My favorite moment is this film is when the once- lousy circus gets its magic back in a sparking sequence set to Katy Perry's Firework.<br/><br/>But the film's big problem is blamed on Darnell and Noah Baumbach's script. It plays at an elementary school level and doesn't deliver much big laughs as the previous films. For the record, I laughed three or four times during the first 30 minutes and chuckled towards the end.<br/><br/>Even the Monte Carlo chase sequence in the film plays like a rehash from three different films.<br/><br/>Remember a van flying to land on a building? {See Speed}. Remember a person standing on top of a moving piece of transportation {See Back to the Future: Part II}. Remember a villain holding on a rope to catch the heroes, then falling? {See Chicken Run}.<br/><br/>The voice actors including Schwimmer, Cohen, Chaston, Smith and Short are really acting through the motions here. Cranston is miscast here in a role that should have worked better with Nick Nolte. I'm not sure if Stiller is feeling right at home with Alex or taking it forcefully. But Macdormand brings in a just-for-the-paycheck performance as Dubois. I didn't get win over by the captain's Edith Piaf- like song when she rounds up her fellow injured officers. I even didn't understand what she was singing about.<br/><br/>Kids will gobble this so-so taste more than parents, whichever version it is {2D or 3D}. Grownups without kids may want to sit towards the nearest exit just in case.<br/><br/>But I just don't know how the world is going to react to Madagascar 4 {if it happens}.<br/><br/>Rating: **1/2<br/><br/>Parent Advice: Rated PG for some mild action and rude humor. Suitable for ages 4 and up. Maybe parents or grownups could drop off their kids at the film and instead see Moonrise Kingdom, Prometheus, Rock of Ages, or That's My Boy for themselves {depending by the movie theater they're visiting}."
"khfan250","1","7","19","9 June 2012"," 3 Stars for the 3rd Installment of this Awful Franchise!
","As bad as they are, I've been pretty lenient on Dreamwork's ""Madagascar"" franchise, for the most part. The first one was pretty awful; it was tedious, unfunny, and tried to shove that ""Move It, Move It"" song down our throats. The second one I remember enjoying. The jokes did improve, even at the expense of the story, but for a kid's movie, it was sub-par. The third movie takes what made the second movie such fun and ruins it! We spend about five minutes of the movie in Africa where the second movie left off before the animals SWIM TO MONTE CARLO. How? Only the half-baked minds of the writers could answer that...<br/><br/>When they arrive in Monte Carlo, they find the penguins and the monkeys have disguised themselves as the Prince of Versailles so they can get away with playing poker. Since I doubt your six year old kids know who the Prince of Versailles is, they will be utterly confused while your busy asking yourself ""Why the heck would the Prince of Versailles be playing poker in Monte Carlo? This is the worst disguise ever!""<br/><br/>But, as you might have guessed, the animals are discovered, so a security guard calls in Captain DuBois of animal control to take care of them. And this is where I actually start to sort of enjoy myself. Captain DuBois is the only character with a clear motive and a likable personality. The way she's animated is quite hilarious and she has the best lines of dialogue in the entire movie. And how sad is that when a psychotic, obsessive woman is the most identifiable character in the movie.<br/><br/>The animals get away on their plane but the plane crashes. The animals sneak aboard a circus train. Here, we're introduced to Vitaly the Russian Tiger, Gia the Jaguar, and Stefano the Sea Lion. And here, I'm sorry to inform you, is where I end the plot synopsis because I honestly have NO IDEA what goes on afterwards. From there until the end of the movie is a jumbled, incoherent mess. <br/><br/>Final verdict: I apologize that this isn't a complete review, but I just don't have a clue what to say about the rest of the movie. My guess is that if you want to keep your kids quiet for about ninety minutes, then this is okay. But there are much better movies for them that'll do just that. If your a fan of the first two, you'll probably like this okay."
"Boba_Fett1138","8","3","6","11 June 2012"," Surprisingly good and fun.
","Having not been the biggest Madagascar movies fan, this third movie came as a bit as a surprise to me. It was much better and more fun than basically the two previous installments combined.<br/><br/>Thing I mostly disliked about the previous two movies, was that they felt rushed and had two much jumping around and bright colors in it. It didn't seemed all that worried about telling a fun story or having impressive looking animations in them. They thought that simple, childish actions and comedy would be enough to draw in a big crowd. And I guess they were right about it but it didn't exactly made them good movies to watch, at least not to me.<br/><br/>This third movie feels far more well thought out. Everything was written far better and all of the comedy was being much more clever and got executed better in the movie. I can even actually actually say that most of the comedy and gags really hits and the movie had me smiling and laughing, basically the whole time.<br/><br/>It also definitely makes all of the characters work out as much better ones. In the previous movies they all had something annoying to them as well but that's all truly gone in this film! They are all simply amusing and the movie introduces a whole bunch of new fun characters as well this time. This also has as a result that there is no time and room for any distracting side-plots, featuring either Marty (Chris Rock), Melman (David Schwimmer) or Gloria Jada Pinkett Smith. It makes the movie feel more balanced and focused, since there aren't really too many distractions from its main story this time around.<br/><br/>But even though that the story story is far better written, I really can't say that the movie is being anything too brilliant with its actual story. It's all being some incredibly formulaic stuff but at least they knew how to make things fun and the story really doesn't feel that important for the movie at all. The story leaves plenty of room and opportunities for fun and gags, involving all of the characters, new and old ones.<br/><br/>Also the animations seemed to be more smooth, as if they decided to spend some more money and/or to put some more time into the making of this movie this time. Some great choices, that helped me to finally truly love a Madagascar movie and made me interested in actually seeing more Madagascar movies now. I most definitely would rather want to see another Madagascar movie than a new Shrek, that's for sure!<br/><br/>A really fun movie to watch, I'm surprised to say.<br/><br/>8/10 <br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

The film picks up where it left off in the last one with Alex and the gang still in Africa but they all want to get back to their new york zoo so they set off on an epic adventure across Europe in an attempt to get there. Along the way they meet some new friends that are a circus act but the circus act they have has fallen apart since their lead act had an accident and cannot perform anymore. So Alex and the gang help them all train and build the circus back up to its former glory. In the end they all get back to their home in new york. 7/10"
"jdkraus","9","2","4","3 July 2012"," Well this was worth the price of admission
","I saw this at a drive-in. There were multiple ""technical difficulties"" and the movie did not start on time. Even with these discrepancies, ""Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted"" proves to be the most entertaining animation this year. It outdoes its predecessors in so many levels.<br/><br/>Bored with their time in Africa, Alex the Lion, Marty the Zebra, Gloria the Hippo, and Melman the Giraffe make an effort to get back to the Big Apple. They end up getting pursued by Europe's most notorious animal catcher, Chantel Dubois. To evade capture, they hide out with an animal circus that is traveling Europe. Here they meet new friends and attempt to work their way home. A huge advantage to this Madagascar over the others is the story. Sure, the plot is simple, but it is effective. The fact that there is a villain helps push it along—unlike the other Madagascar films. <br/><br/>These movies have always been known for going over the top. This one takes it to the extent that it is ridiculously funny. The penguins clean out casinos with the help of the monkeys in human disguise. A tiger can jump through a circus ring that is smaller than a doorknob. King Julien falls in love with a bear that wears a tutu and rides a bicycle. The animals drive a car in a chase that nearly destroys Monte Carlo. And all of this is just within the first half hour. The voice talent from the previous films return at their very best, which scores some points. <br/><br/>However, the new voice actors outshine the original cast. Martin Short delivers cleverly as the idiotic Italian Seal Stefano. Bryan Cranston pulls off a marvelous Russian accent as Vitaly the Tiger. Jessica Chastain sells as the adorable Gia. The one who tops them all though is Frances McDormand as Captain Chantel Dubois—the movie's antagonist. She makes a good French accent and enunciates her words with a sly, devilishness. In addition, her character design and the animators make her capable of anything. She can dodge vehicles in a car chase, crawl on all fours like a spider, and even sing her minions to perfect health. If an animated character could win an Oscar, it should go to Chantel Dubois! <br/><br/>I enjoyed every minute of this movie and I will buy it when it hits the retail stores. As Skipper says, ""Well that was worth the price of admission."""

"rgkarim","8","2","4","10 June 2012"," Third Times the Charm!
","A kids movie is usually a reviewer's worst nightmare, not for the movie, but instead the audience. The constant chattering from kids, the excessive screaming and crying, and perhaps worst of all sitting behind a couple of adolescent's who think it's the best thing in the world to kick your chair are all annoying distractions. However, I decided to face this annoyance and review the latest kids flick Madagascar 3 on this beautiful Sunday. What were my thoughts on this movie? Read on to find out. <br/><br/>With some of the recent disappointments I've seen this summer, I was thinking this sequel was a safe bet after seeing the trailers. For those who haven't seen the trailers, here is a quick summary. The crazy animal quartet of Alex (Ben Stiller), Marty (Chris Rock), Gloria (Jada Pinkett Smith), and Melman (David Schwimmer) are tired of Africa where they traveled to in the last film. Their destination is none other than the central park zoo, but they must first head to Monte Carlo to pick up the penguins and the chimps that have the only plane. As expected, things don't go as planned and the gang is soon chased by an elite animal hunter named Captain Dubois (Frances McDormand) and her silent posse. In an attempt to elude her, they hitch a ride on a circus train, which is home to an energetic seal named Stefano (Martin Short), an aspiring Jaguar star Gia (Jessica Chastain) and a Tiger with an attitude named Vitaly (Bryan Cranston). What will happen to the gang?<br/><br/>No surprise this movie was a safe bet, but at the same time was perhaps one of the most fun animated movies I've ever seen. What started out as a mirror of the trailers for the first ten minutes became a wild ride of fun, humor, and balance that kept me entertained. However, once the chase began the pace picked up and the surprises began to flood in. One major surprise was how well the chase scene was done and the clever use of penguin ingenuity. Although Dubois' moves were a little over eccentric and silly at points, it was still exciting and perhaps the best chase scene since the Italian Job. Another surprise came from the multiple stories embedded in this film. The main story like always is for Alex and the gang to get home, but within the main tale lie stories of passion, dreams, pride, and unity that connect all of the characters together. There are also a couple of love stories in the movie as well, one that is cute, the other more funny/ridiculous than anything else, both entertaining. All of these stories, mixed in with some diverse comedy, were very entertaining and I felt that many audience members will love. <br/><br/>The other major strength of this movie is the animation. As I've said before, DreamWorks animation team knows how to make digital art come to life. Throughout the entire movie the movements of the animals were smooth, flowing, and well edited that impressed me once more. Even the lip work of the animals seemed to mimic the human way of speaking that is seldom seen in animation. Yet this movie also had something the other two didn't have, and that was being shot in 3-D. Although I didn't see it in 3-D, there were various shots that one could easily tell were meant to pop out at you, most likely to add another level of entertainment for the kids. While most of the 3-D seemed to involve things flying out at the audience, there were a few scenes and sequences I thought would be fantastic in 3-D adding more depth, color, and pizazz to what was already a good scene. The soundtrack for the film may have also helped with the entertainment values, especially one of the best uses of Katy Perry's Firework song, even though I had heard it three times in the same movie. Another thing I really enjoyed was that this was a fun, feel good movie that manages to give you an energy boost on some level. <br/><br/>Despite how much I enjoyed it though, there are a few weak things to mention that may or may not be important to you. Perhaps one of the biggest weak areas is the lack of Mort, Maurice, and the penguin humor. Although they had some show stealing moments, fans of these characters will be a little disappointed to see how little their humor they have. Instead they shifted more of the focus on the new circus animals, in particular Stefano. My next warning is for those who are not a fan of Martin Short comedy as the movie is filled with his constant screaming and anxiety filled dialog that was humorous for me at some points, but at some points annoying. Perhaps a third thing to mention is how much the team focused on kiddy comedy than adult and kid comedy. Unlike Shrek or even the first Madagascar, this film didn't have the well-disguised adult humor and instead was more about juvenile bonking on the heads, and mindless screaming. As I'm sure you can guess though, the movie is very predictable and at points shallow, but that is what most kids' movies are these days.<br/><br/>Madagascar 3 is definitely one movie I suggest you head to the theaters to see. Although you can guess what is going to happen, the animation and visual effects of the movie combined with the fun soundtrack are sure to keep you entertained. If you are looking for a film to see with a group of friends, a church group, or even just to take your kid to see this is the movie for you. Although not the most unique, it is still very entertaining and worthy of attention. My scores for this movie are: Animation/Adventure/Comedy: 8.5 Movie Overall: 7.5 Tune in next week for more reviews."

","I mean the characters and story are nothing special, they aren't bad they're just serviceable. (Besides the penguins which are great). But the reason I like this movie so much is because of how fun, funny, and creative it is. It's just a blast to watch, it's consistently funny and fast moving. And like I said the plot is cliched and predictable, but I don't think it's that important for this movie to work, because it's entertaining anyway. The best character in this movie is probably the villain; this animal control lady who's virtually indestructible and basically has super smell and other animal like characteristics. And this character being the way she is leads to some great action, particularly in the first act. There's one chase scene within the first act that is just so incredibly crazy that it just works. Also one other thing I wasn't crazy about were the song choices. (Katty Perry). But in the whole, this movie is great fun. I'll give it 87%"

","I know this is coming in late but my kids just got this as a gift and we've watched it a few times now. I think the whole movie summarizes nicely when the animals finally get their wish by returning to the NY zoo only to realize that its not what they really want, having experienced all that they have with their travels. Being zoo animals all along only hindered their growth and never would have given them the experiences they shared between each other and with the other characters. Each of the M-animals find ""true"" happiness and Dubois gets served justly. I think some of the ""show stealing"" moments are by Stefano's facial expressions (in particular when he is in the train car eagerly waiting for Alex's description of his American circus routine), Dubois crashing through the office building walls pursuing the animals, the way the bear drives the motorcycle flipping every where, and the scene where the French animal police are in a recovery room and bust their casts as Dubois sings. Yeah, it's only a cartoon but...just how does a large Siberian tiger fit through a tiny ring? Hilarious!"

","In Madagascar 3, Alex the lion, Marty the Zebra, Gloria the Hippo, and Melman the Giraffe are back still trying to find their way back to the New York City Zoo. They join a circus that promises of traveling to America. The circus adds Vitaly the tiger, Gia the jaguar, Stefano the sea-lion, and Sonya the performing bear to the cast. The gang helps to reinvent the run down circus along the way. As they travel through Europe, Captain Dubois of animal control is chasing them.<br/><br/>The imagery in this movie is spectacular. I really enjoyed the big circus scene. The circus acts are fun and fresh and great to watch. The storyline however, is not as good. I found the plot to be a little jumpy and full of little sideshows that don't relate much to the central goal of the characters trying to get back to America. I find the love affair between King Julian and the bike riding bear to be a little strange and unsettling. Although the Penguins take a backseat in this movie, there are plenty of jokes to go around. A few jokes are truly funny, but for the majority of them I can't say I found them to be funny at all. I was rather disappointed that the main character Alex lies to the other characters, especially Gia, to protect himself and to convince them he is something other then what he really is. It is nice to see that the gang, new and old, stick together and help each other. But overall in the end, Madagascar 3 leaves me feeling let down and confused."

","Never expected MADAGASCAR to become a trilogy. It's not that the animated picture wasn't great however it didn't seem that Alex, Marty, Melman and Gloria had it in them to go this far. They have and I am certain the fans are glad.<br/><br/>Alex (Stiller) as usual will never rest until he goes back to the Central Park zoo. Much like the previous installments once again this is a tale of their journey back home. The awesome foursome has been in Africa for too long and the heats getting to all four of them. Since there is no signs of the penguins returning to take them back to New York they decide to find the penguins themselves. The last known location of the feathered friends is the Monte Carlo Casino and that's where our favorite talking animals are headed. One may think that once they are away from the Savanna of Africa they would be safe. It seems like the grasslands are much safer than Monaco. No animal is safe with Captain Chantel Dubois and her trusty scooter. Alex and his friends need to get out of Europe and head to New York while dodging Captain Chantel and the only way to do so is by buying a circus and making some new friends.<br/><br/>Eric Darnell and Tom McGrath team up for the 3rd consecutive installment of the trilogy. The positive aspect of this is that the originality will remain the same and the fans would very much feel like nothing has changed. However where do we draw the line in being true to the beginning whilst still reinventing ourselves? Darnell and McGrath may survive MADAGASCAR 3: EUROPE'S MOST WANTED but if they ever decide to return things need to re-evaluated by DreamWorks Animation since things are starting to get pretty stale with all the characters. Marty (Chris Rock), Melman (Schwimmer) and Julien (Cohen) have been the funny guys all journey through since 2005. The penguins have been the tactical team and Gloria (Smith) has always been the mother figure and the occasional romantic.<br/><br/>MADAGASCAR 3: EUROPES MOST WANTED is funny as it has always been thanks to the introduction to a few new characters as well and it keeps the trilogy still alive. This is the one department that the folks at DreamWorks do things right. The ability to get the same stellar cast onboard every single time has made the animation stay afloat. One does need to emphasize on the talents of Ben Stiller, Chris Rock, David Schwimmer, Sasha Baron Cohen and Cedric the Entertainer. These boys rock the boat so hard it's hard not to be impressed and to love the characters for it. One may say that King Juliens jokes are getting old, but one cannot stop them from laughing out loud at Cohens voicing.<br/><br/>Lastly as it has always been and it always will be in the future as well DreamWorks Animation clearly has outdone them and raised the bar in the creative wings. This motion picture is by far the most vibrant one in the trilogy and also has been released in 3D. I am no fan of the technology but still if I am ever given a choice to sit in for a 3D movie I will go for an animation rather than a motion picture.<br/><br/>Not a bad way to spend an evening and if you want to watch make sure you try your best to watch in HD or Blu Ray, the animations are to die for.<br/><br/>TITLE: MADAGASCAR 3: EUROPES MOST WANTED DIRECTED BY: Eric Darnell and Tom McGrath STARRING: BEN STILLER, CHRIS ROCK, David SCHWIMMER, JADA PINKETT SMITH, SACHA BARON COHEN and CEDRIC THE ENTERTAINER RATED: PG13 RATING: 06/10 RUNTIME: 93 MINUTES"

However, it is Stephano (Martin Short) the half-witted sea lion, who will steal your heart.<br/><br/>But the true stars of the film, as in the two prior films, are the Madagascar Penguins. They truly steal every scene that they are in. The team of Kowalski (Chris Miller), Private (Christopher Knight), and Mason (Conrad Vernon) are pure cinematic genius, and I just love them!!!<br/><br/>Not a great movie, but it's a good family film; and with nothing else out there to compete with, it will rack up handily at the box office. A moderate recommendation; it's good wholesome fun. So enjoy!<br/><br/>SEE MORE OF MY REVIEWS ON FB @ ""THE FARIS REEL"""

","I loved these cartoons,because the main characters are all animals.My favorite character is Melmen, he whines like a big baby. He reminds me of my dad because he to thought that, he could catch any bug that was known to man.Their misadventures, are quite funny.They seem to find trouble where ever they go and if they do not find it;some how it always finds them.These cartoons are a good way for children, to learn how to make friends with,those who are different. That is my mom's take on these hilarious cartoons! Mine is that I too find quite funny, nothing seems to go their way! Everywhere they go trouble always follows them! In one way or another, my favorite character is Marty. Because he always has some out there idea, followed by sarcasm! To sum it up we both loved these cartoons! And if you want a good laugh ! And are a child at heart , then these are the cartoons for you!"

","This review contains spoilers, not that there's anything to spoil, really. <br/><br/>Generally when I see a kids' movie with my kids, I find it tolerable and sometimes enjoyable. I still laugh at Spongebob episodes that I've seen a hundred times, if that tells you anything about my tastes. Most kids' movies throw in some humor for adults- not referring to inappropriate humor, just cultural references or something that gives adults a tickle that kids don't really understand.<br/><br/>Not this movie. This movie makes no attempt to appeal to adults at all. There was not a single moment where I laughed or was amused. I found all of the over-the-top accents kind of disrespectful, and I could not figure out why a kids' movie had three animal pairs with love stories. The plot was an absolute mess. They did manage to work in some happenings that gave my 4 year old and 6 year old some thrills- rocket shoes, shooting out of cannons, a very colorful circus. However, I was left wondering what kind of drugs the filmmakers were on while they wrote this, and I was also left thinking that the animators worked really hard but the writers, directors, producers, whoever REALLY phoned it in. I mean REALLY. It was an awful script. David Schwimmer should not be voicing anything, and I'm really not there to watch a lion and a leopard fall in love, and neither are my kids. Also, why the heck doesn't the bear ever talk?<br/><br/>As for kids, my kids didn't hate it, but they didn't love it either. My little one laughed about four times, which was far less than the number of times he said he wanted to leave the movie (but we were stuck because we'd driven with friends). <br/><br/>My recommendation to parents is if your kids absolutely insist on seeing this movie, send them with their friends' parents so you don't have to go. Otherwise, your eyes will be rolling so hard they may get stuck that way."
"fpicabia","5","3","9","11 June 2012"," OK story, stimulating visuals and music, stereotypes played on
","The Madagascar series feels like it is playing itself out, especially with the Penguins TV series being out there.<br/><br/>What makes this movie fun is not the core characters. They are full of the expected dialog. While they try to provide humor, it is of the sort you've seen before (unless you are very young). The core characters are really more of the straight man. The fun in this is almost always injected by the penguins and lemurs, who pull in their off the wall, couldn't see that coming, type of actions and remarks.<br/><br/>The music and visuals are top notch for animation. The way light is used from light sources was particularly well done for an animation of this style.<br/><br/>In Canada, we were confused and a little offended at the penguin remark about our work ethic. In the movie a character states that in France they work 2 weeks of the year and take the rest of the year off, to which another character replies ""somebody else has the Canadian work ethic"".<br/><br/>To set the record straight, in Canada, the minimum statutory vacation period is 2 weeks annual vacation. It is among the lowest in the world, similar to Vietnam and Guatemala. In the U.S. there is no legal standard. Many countries have 20 days of annual vacation. I can't provide the link here, but look up statutory employment leave in Wikipedia.<br/><br/>Message to the script writer: as an American, do you take pride in the idea that other countries get more vacation time than in the U.S. (and Canada)? I'd rather have the 4 weeks off Australia has, or similar in any European nation. Life isn't work. In addition, work ethic has little to do with vacation time. One can work hard and also enjoy their time off well."
"lagudafuad","8","2","5","14 June 2012"," This movie you must see
","The truth is, this movie is extremely funny, and far better than Madagascar 2. Never a dull moment while watching and every scene make you eager to see what was next. The makers went over board and decided to make the movie unrealistic to the core, Tom and Jerry style.<br/><br/>DreamWorks Animation's CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg, confirmed in 2008 that there will be a part three to Alex and his crew's adventure, promising us that we will see them return to New York.<br/><br/>The animation is just as good as the other installments and as usual the producers gave King Julien XIII (Sacha Baron Cohen, Borat 2006 and The Dictator 2012) his own story and this time it is a romantic one. But not only Julien had a romantic attachment.<br/><br/>The crew is joined by bunch circus animals which they met when trying to escape from Captain Chantel DuBois, the leader of animal control in France.<br/><br/>Alex, Marty, Gloria and Melman are abandoned by the penguins and the monkeys who were trying to buy their way back to America. Alex and the crew found the penguins in Monte Carlo and started a chaos that led to the introduction of, DuBois. Their journey takes them through Europe where they find the perfect cover: a traveling circus, which they reformed.<br/><br/>The most impressive addition and the star of the movie to me was DuBois, she was a cross between Terminator, Rambo and a Blood Hound. You will love the way she smashes through walls, but no matter how bad ass she was, the penguins were better.<br/><br/>The lines, the screenplay and the penguins were far too much for my stomach to handle. There is a rumor that there will be a fourth installment, I hope it is true.<br/><br/>Did Alex and the rest make it back to Central Park? That you have to find out yourself, so make sure when it is out in the cinema near you, you queue up to see it."

","The second movie is the best and the one with the lowest ratings... i don't get that! Madagascar 3 is just not funny, and even irritating. Yes Frances McDormond thanks for destroying the french language seriously wtf are you doing here that was horrible!!!
Again the funniests are the penguins but we don't see them enough and they're less funny than before. The music is unbearable, this movie is really exclusively for kids or teenagers i think. They brought Bryan Cranston and give him the voice of the russian tiger who doesn't have a single funny line! Anyway:
Madagascar 1: meh but okay
Madagascar 2: funny
Madagascar 3: garbage<br/><br/>2 stars for the penguins!"

"Stompgal_87","8","1","2","5 January 2014"," On par with the first two but is probably the funniest with the best soundtrack since the second
","I rented this DVD to see what it was like compared to the first two I had seen at the cinema and it is just as good. <br/><br/>The first fifteen minutes were filled with laugh-out loud moments such as Alex imagining himself and the other three main animals as elderly animals, the lemurs jumping out of Alex's birthday cake that had a sense of scatological humour (Mort vomiting pink icing) and the antics in the casino and the possible parody of 'The Matrix' involving the monkeys shooting from 'banana guns,' thus making these the funniest first fifteen minutes in the entire 'Madagascar' franchise. <br/><br/>As for the soundtrack, this has the best of all three 'Madagascar' films. Its highlights were the opening African-inspired music; the spy-movie-type music playing as the four main animals swim towards the hotel in Monte Carlo; sing-songs of 'Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now),' 'Wannabe,' 'What's New Pussycat?,' 'New York, New York' from the 1949 film 'On The Town' and 'Hot In Herre (in which King Julien replaces, ""so take off all your clothes"" with ""so take off all your fur""); the piece of classical music played over the shot of the Colliseum; Chantal's rendition of Edith Piaf's 'Je Ne Regrette Rien;' the brief Psycho-sounding music playing before the lemurs encounter the bear on the train; Yolanda Be Cool's 'We No Speak Americano;' Katy Perry's 'Firework;' and last but not least, 'I Like To Move It (probably the signature song of the 'Madagascar' franchise)' mixed with typical circus music. <br/><br/>The character animation is on par with that in the first two and while the film includes my favourite characters of the main four, the penguins, the monkeys and the lemurs, I also liked the side characters consisting of circus animals (especially Gia and Stefano) and dogs. Chantal was a menacing villain and while I was initially worried when she rolled on the train track in case she got electrocuted or run over by a train she was okay, although her most amusing moments involved shooting various Italian police officers with tranquillisers, getting shot in the bottom with one herself towards the end and being shipped towards Madagascar in crates along with other human characters in a similar manner to the main animals in the original. I must admit I do miss the presence of the elderly woman who called Alex a ""bad Kitty"" in the first two films because she was comical. There is a wide variety of backgrounds such as the picturesque surroundings of Monte Carlo and the mountains as well as a lovely flythrough of London at night with Big Ben and the London Eye being beautifully illuminated. The interior circus scenes in the latter half use beautiful fluorescent lighting too.<br/><br/>Moving onto the dialogue, it is as smart and witty as that in the first two films, especially Stefano's line ""My tears are real, you're not!"" when the four main animals reveal they are zoo animals rather than circus animals, which makes this a typical use of the 'liar revealed' trope. The script also mentions clichés such as Chantal labelling the idea of running away from the circus as one. I also liked Alex mentioning his ancestors (I.e. other lions) used to perform at the Colliseum and one of the circus animals saying, ""That's Bolshevik!"" as a play on a profanity. As usual, the voice acting from Ben Stiller, Chris Rock, Jada Pinkett-Smith, David Schwimmer and Sacha Baron Cohen was superb as was Frances McDormand voicing Chantal with a convincing French accent. I also liked Stefano and Gia's Italian accents.<br/><br/>Overall this is an amusing third instalment of the franchise with the creme de la creme consisting of the witty dialogue, the character animation and the soundtrack. 8/10."
"g-bodyl","9","1","2","3 January 2014"," Wildly Entertaining Three-quel!
","To be honest, the third addition to the Madagascar series didn't do me justice after DreamWorks released the trailers. But being a fan of the series on a whole, I decided to check this film out. It turned out there's nothing to worry about because this film was just as entertaining as the first two films and is delightfully funny. There are some wonderful new characters here such as Vitaly and that evil animal control woman. The animation itself is beautiful and more sharper.<br/><br/>Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted has Alex and the crew still stuck in Africa. While trying to find the penguins, they crash a party in Monte Carlo attracting the attention of the animal control lady and her posse. Now in order to escape their clutches, they join a circus in hopes for them to get back to America.<br/><br/>Our favorite voice cast returns for the sequel and still provide exceptional voicework. We here Ben Stiller, Chris Rock, Jada Pinkett Smith, and Sacha Baren Cohen. There are some new voices her that do swell such as Frances McDormand and Bryan Cranston.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a very good three-quell and it's a worthy addition into the series. Like the previous two, it's a bit silly. But if you like them, you should like this. Kids will definitely be entertained here and so will adults. I know I was entertained because it has an interesting story and lots of laughs. I rate this film 9/10."

I was pleasantly surprised! I think they knew that the second one wasn't good and strove to make the third much better, and they nailed it! I was entertained and laughed a lot. The new characters were awesome, I especially loved Jessica Chastain's character and her accent. It was also very cool to see Martin Short doing something again, I can't remember the last movie I saw with him in it! <br/><br/>The movie is funny, the animation is brilliant, there are a lot of colors, and even the villain is hilarious.

","Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted is a 3D computer-animated comedy film that is the third installment of the Madagascar series, and it is the first in the series to be released in 3D. <br/><br/>In the this third movie,Alex, Marty, Melman, and Gloria are still struggling to get home to New York. This time, their journey takes them to Europe where they are relentlessly pursued by the murderous Monaco- based French Animal Control officer Captain Chantel DuBois. As a means of getting passage to North America, the zoo animals purchase a failing traveling circus as they become close friends with the staff like Vitaly,Gia and Stefano. Together, they spectacularly revitalize the business and along the way find themselves reconsidering where their true home really is.<br/><br/>The movie's ensemble cast includes the voices of Ben Stiller,Chris Rock,David Schwimmer,Jada Pinkett Smith,Sacha Baron Cohen,Cedric the Entertainer,Andy Richter,Tom McGrath,Jessica Chastain, Bryan Cranston,Martin Short and Frances McDormand. The film is directed by Eric Darnell, Tom McGrath and Conrad Vernon. <br/><br/>This third edition may arrive with low expectations, but it's a pleasant surprise, sending its character barrelling across continents for a zippy, engaging 90-minute adventure.It may lack a little in charm and warmth, but the technical brilliance and decent use of 3D go some way towards compensating for the dimensions that the film otherwise lacks like the development of the characters or situations for comedy gold as the filmmakers instead just crank up the chaos.Overall,it is a dazzlingly colorful and frenetic film that is silly enough for young kids, but boasts enough surprising smarts to engage parents along the way."

","Once again Eric Darnell made an amazing animated movie. Yes I'm talking about Madagascar 3 Europe's Most wanted! It's a 2012 American 3D animated funny movie produced by DreamWorks Animation and distributed by Paramount pictures. The movie budget is $145 million and it has done $734,291,482 on Box office. Each part or of movie is full of fun! Good thing about movies is everyone can watch it with their family and mates. The story is quite good I really liked it, especially the police officer woman. She works for animal control agency and the way she speaks English is so funny. Russian tiger role was quit boring but pinging's were amazing and the way they were driving was awesome! Each part of movies is speechless. If someone hasn't watched it yet I would like them to go and watch it today before it goes off cinema."

I liked the graphics that are on the movie and all the different type of animated effects and I think that is one of the reasons the movie is so good. I like all the voices of the characters that are of other shows like (Alex) Ben Stiller of night of the museum 1 and 2 and Zoolander and Dodgeball and (Marty) Chris Rock of grown-ups and dogma and what to expect when you're expecting and (Melman) David Schwimmer off of the TV series friends.

There they pick up a very persistent cop who wants to capture and impound them.<br/><br/>But they still manage to get in with a circus, work their way through Europe and finally to New York. The story is just a framework for the various characters to do and say funny things. Which they do. Frankly I am getting tired of the Madagascar series of animated films, I hope this is the last one. It is enjoyable and I laughed often, but please no more!<br/><br/>And, BTW, it was Frances McDormand herself singing ""Non, je ne Regrette Rien"", the famous Edith Piaf song."
"houghtonetet","10","1","2","4 November 2012"," Superior sequel
","After reading glowing reviews of this latest instalment in the Madagascar franchise, and after hugely enjoying the previous two movies, my hopes were high for a similar helping of nonsensical mayhem and was not in the slightest bit disappointed.<br/><br/>The familiar faces are all there once again, this time making a successful return to New York Zoo, and picking up a few new friends (and enemies) on the way. Alex and the bunch travel via a Monaco casino and then, pursued by Animal Control, hitch a ride with a failing circus to Rome and London to earn themselves a trip across the Atlantic, and home. Once there, they discover they have outgrown the Zoo which has become a prison for them. They are pursued all the way by a formidable French Animal Control officer, voiced by Frances McDormand, intent on completing her collection of wall trophies with Alex's head. Needless to say, she and her assistants get their just desserts, but I get the distinct feeling she will be back in the next sequel, angrier than ever.<br/><br/>Alex and the gang get their fair share of screen time and wisecracks, with only King Julien sidelined a little. The monkeys and the penguins were as manic as ever, and Alex holds the group together nicely. The newcomers come in the form of a failing circus, and they present an entirely new group, the chief characters being Gia the trapeze jaguar who develops a crush on Alex, Vitaly a tiger suffering a crisis of confidence, and Stefano the sea-lion, wonderfully voiced by Martin Short. These three are as close as Alex and his friends are, but learn to like and then love their new companions as they overcome the various obstacles in their way. All the animals and the humans also, even the Italian policemen, are given time to endear and engage with the audience, and this is done seamlessly with great skill. I spotted nods to the Matrix, with the banana machine gun and Shawshank Redemption, with the wall poster, and there are probably a whole bundle more.<br/><br/>I saw it in 3D and would recommend it – the animation is sumptuous and exhilarating. The characters are beautifully observed and well scripted. The humour is engaging with plenty for children and adults to enjoy.<br/><br/>I liked the tour promoter the Circus had to impress in London. Alex spies for anyone looking like an American in the audience, well there's Uncle Sam himself with a bald eagle feeding him a piece of popcorn! Hmmm – rather obvious! Excellent!<br/><br/>(I also particularly enjoyed the Circus's visit to Rome, having been there myself two years ago, and recognising not only the Vatican and the Colosseum, but also the police station in the city centre which was opposite the hotel we stayed in!)<br/><br/>There is not much of a plot or a story to speak of, other than the journey itself being an excuse to hang set piece after set piece of massively excessive CGI which is highly entertaining. If there is a message it is about friendships forged in the face of adversity, all pulling together with their passion, enthusiasm and belief conquering all.<br/><br/>The movie closes the return to New York, and ends with the whole gang steaming off on a Circus tour of the USA to continue the insanity. Ninety-three minutes passed like a snap of the fingers and I, for one, can't wait for the fourth movie."
"gregwetherall","7","1","2","31 October 2012"," The gang is back for another cross-continental jaunt in a surprisingly effective (and very funny) entry for the series.
","Arriving in 2005, in a period when Pixar's dominance looked all-encompassing, Dreamworks dispensed a challenge to the throne with Madagascar. Success did not look likely when it came accompanied with middling-to-poor reviews, which accused it of being one-dimensional and clichéd, despite some humorous characters and a strong voice cast. It suffered critically because it lacked the multi-layered intricacies and groundbreaking animation of Pixar's finest works (of the time period). Such films as, The Incredibles (2004), Finding Nemo (2003) and Toy Story (1995-). Consequently, it was easy to disregard the worth of this more traditional escapist fare. The audiences spoke in droves, however, with the original feature becoming extremely successful and spawning a disappointing sequel in 2008, entitled, Madagascar 2: Escape to Africa.<br/><br/>Off the back of this mixed history comes this third instalment. The now-familiar troupe of misfits and comrades are still plotting a return to their native home of New York, only this time, they opt for a route across Europe. This will culminate in brushes with the French authorities and a frosty reception with a travelling circus with chaotic results. The starry voice cast all return, as Ben Stiller, Chris Rock, David Schwimmer, Jada Pinkett Smith and Sacha Baron Cohen lend their voices to Alex, Marty, Melman, Gloria and Julien, respectively.<br/><br/>It is easy for snobbery to creep in when assessing films, and to become haughtily unimpressed by simple satisfaction and crowd-pleasing gestures by film makers. This is highly unfair and unreasonable. For instance, does this film put a smile on the viewer's face? Yes. Is it funny? Extremely. Does it out-stay its welcome? Not really – it wraps up in a neat hour and a half. All of these factors reflect positively on this addition to the Madagascar chain. In fact, it is the strongest of the three films so far. It is a rip-roaring ride that not only packs in a fast-moving plot, but also contains plenty of animation ingenuity. It looks as though this film has been lovingly crafted. As expected, there are bright colours, lots of noises, and strong gags. Julien is back with his funniest lines since the first film and the introduction of new characters replenish the lifeblood of all involved.<br/><br/>This does come at the expense of Melman and Gloria, however, who are sidelined slightly in this particular outing. Although fans may be disappointed with this outcome, it is most likely the result of honing the script down to bare essentials and trimming any excess that might enable all to get a fair airing, but to the detriment of telling the tale. Also, criticism could be levelled at a few of the plot excursions which have been seen before elsewhere. For example, there is a strand involving a moody and aggressive Russian circus tiger, Vitaly, who has a similar story trajectory and development as that of Paul Newman's Doc Hudson in Cars (2006).<br/><br/>Such nit-picking as that above is pointless and unhelpful in the end. What matters is the expert execution and the feeling that this feature generates. Simply, it as enjoyable an animation that has been released all year and well worth the price of a cinema ticket.<br/><br/>for more film reviews: toomuchnoiseblog.com and www.huffingtonpost.com/greg-wetherall"

","Dreamworks' second largest series manages to achieve what its biggest money-maker (hint: big green ogre) couldn't: a threequel that keeps the franchise's standard high. Heck, this third instalment even eclipses both of its predecessors, which is an extremely rare feat indeed. Alex the Lion (Ben Stiller) and his mates depart Africa for New York, but not before going via Europe with a travelling circus and gaining the attention of the malevolent animal control Captain Chantel DuBois (Frances McDormand). From its wonderful Monte Carlo opening act to its grandstand New York climax, the action sequences are superbly constructed and tremendously exciting; the predictably sharp animation is the icing on the cake. It's laugh out loud funny too, with a very respectable amount of jokes – both verbal and visual – hitting the spot for kiddies and parents alike. There's often a lot of dross on the big screen between school terms; thankfully however, Madagascar 3 is the perfect holiday flick."

","What do you get when you take a traveling circus, add in zoo animals, penguins and some lemurs? You get another hit movie from Dreamworks Animation – Madagascar 3 – Europe's Most Wanted. KIDS FIRST! Film Critic Julianna No one, age 12, reviews the film below: Video review: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJ6nuOSOsMY<br/><br/>This movie takes off where the last film left us, with Alex (voiced by Ben Stiller), Marty (voiced by Chris Rock), Melman (voiced by David Schwimmer) and Gloria (voiced by Jada Pinkett Smith) trying to get home to the Central Park Zoo. Written by Eric Darnell and Noah Baumbach and directed by Eric Darnell and Tom McGrath, this animated hit, has a great message that it passes along in this film. In my opinion, the message of this film is that the journey is often more fulfilling than getting to your destination, particularly when you are with the ones you love. Or in other words, if you are with the ones you love then it doesn't matter where you are, that place is home. The four main characters start off in Africa trying to figure out how to meet up with the penguins and get back on track in getting back to the Central Park Zoo. They end up finding the penguins, but their journey is just getting started as they head off across Europe trying to not only get home, but to not be captured by the villainous Captain Dubois (voiced by Frances McDormand). They find the perfect cover in avoiding the Captain in joining a traveling circus. The addition of the circus allows for the introduction of many new characters, one of which is my favorite character, Stefano, who is a horn blowing seal. Stefano is very nice, happy character, but admittedly is not very smart. This goofiness only adds to how cute he is. And while Stefano, may not be that smart, it's his brilliant idea that may save the circus and all his new friends who are trying to get back to their beloved zoo. One of my favorite scenes is the Afro Circus scene, where Marty tries to blend in with the circus, donning a rainbow colored wig and polka dots on his body. He performs the ""Afro Circus"" song that I am sure everyone has seen in the trailers. My other favorite scene is when King Julien (voiced by Sasha Baron Cohen) meets his true love, in the form of a giant, tricycle riding bear. The animation is fantastic in this film, and while 3D doesn't always work for me, the 3D was exceptional, particularly in the climactic scenes towards the end of the movie. I recommend this film for all ages, as adults will love the humor and storyline just as much as adults will."

","Alex, Marty, Gloria and Melman are back for their third adventure in Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted. This time, they're going through Europe together with a circus to get back to New York. On the way, they meet some new faces, both good and bad.<br/><br/>I think the first movie is very good, the second movie was therefore a disappointment because it lacked charm and character, but this third installment is a good way to end (well, at least I hope) the Madagascar franchise.<br/><br/>The movie is extremely cartoony, which is one of its main qualities. It's the most extreme Madagascar movie, as it involves scenes such as a car chase through Monte Carlo with an atomic reactor, a woman that can run through walls (kinda like Juggernaut from the X-Men franchise) and a rope that chains together the characters, while driving through cars, walls and flying in the air. Like, holy crap!<br/><br/>Some characters I feel are just there because they were in the previous movies. Like King Julien (the I Like to Move It-guy). He's in the movie throughout most of its entirety, but he never does anything to change the plot, other than having a side-story about his relationship with a bear on a tricycle.<br/><br/>Overall, Madagascar 3 is a fun time for the whole family. Anyone can have at least a little bit of fun watching this."

","The French are cruel and lazy, the British feisty and Italians dawdle too much. Or at least that's what your children might think after watching 'Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted', the latest box office hit from DreamWorks Animation.<br/><br/>Leading lion Alex (Ben Stiller) and his urbanized furry friends are still desperately trying to flee Madagascar, return to the Big Apple and live in their beloved zoo. Their journey suddenly halts in Europe, where the delectable and villainous French animal-control official Captain Chantel DuBois delights in the opportunity to behead Alex. Relentlessly she pursues him, Marty the zebra (Chris Rock), Melman the giraffe (David Schwimmer) and Gloria the hippo (Jada Pinkett-Smith) across several countries.<br/><br/>The breathtaking chase takes us thorough Monaco, Switzerland, France, Italy and the UK with many droll observations made along the way. ""Labour laws are more lenient in France, they only work two weeks a year,"" says a chimpanzee.<br/><br/>To hide from DuBois and her minions, the foursome, plus some new additions, blag their way into a circus group filled with has-been animal performers who are also on their way to New York. Not only is it a city named twice, but one where we are honored with two bass-pumping renditions of Katy Perry's 'Firework'.<br/><br/>There are plenty of rambunctious characters, hilarious one-liners, love stories and the mandatory moral messages associated with the genre.<br/><br/>The number of celebrity voices is well over a dozen including Sacha Baron Cohen, Cedric the Entertainer, Jessica Chastain and Vinnie Jones.<br/><br/>Comedian Chris Rock as Marty outshines them all. His 'Afro Circus' remix of Julius Fucik's 'Entrance of the Gladiators' is a definite musical highlight and will play on repeat in your head way after the credits end.<br/><br/>This year has seen and will witness plenty of blockbuster prequels and sequels (Men In Black III, Prometheus, Ice Age: Continental Drift, The Dark Knight Rises, to name a few). Madagascar 3 opened last weekend in the US to a tuneful $60.4 million, beating Prometheus, and is likely to do well in the region too as temperatures soar and audiences flock to air-conditioned theaters. You don't need to have seen the film's two predecessors to enjoy this 93-minute installment.<br/><br/>All three are directed by Eric Darnell, who also squeezed a television series 'The Penguins of Madagascar' out of the movie.<br/><br/>In Madagascar 3, Darnell's proved again that great writing has to accompany awe-inspiring animation to keep audiences locked. Adults will delight in subtle, witty lines more than children – Melman (Schwimmer) declares at one point that he is a doctor, a line we all know pays tribute to Schwimmer's Ross character in the Friends sitcom. Kids, meanwhile, will watch open-mouthed and in fits of laughter as Alex and his dozy pals fly through colorful skies, run from their enemies and perform in at least one spectacular psychedelic circus scene.<br/><br/>The finale is a surprise – the perfect ending to a massively fun family film.<br/><br/>Find all of our film and festival coverage, as well as our events and education at www.DohaFilmInstitute.com.

","I took my 3 year old daughter to the movie; she loved the music and was dancing in her chair. I was unsure about her being 3 but it was a hit. Not a bad movie either... as I said, good family fun. I'm not going to go into plot and other information as well, it's a kid's movie, yet I being 35 was pleasantly entertained, the most fun seeing my daughter smiling and laughing at the characters. The reason I gave it an 8 is there is lots of gun references, look I was a kid once and everything was a gun to me so it really isn't a deal breaker, but I'm sure there are some parents that may be sensitive to it. The only other slightly iffy part was the references between the bear and king Julian, again they went right over my daughters head, but I thought it was a little close for a kids flick. Ultimately it was a success so don't overly read into it and enjoy the movie."
"Smells_Like_Cheese","9","1","2","8 July 2012"," Great fun!
","When Madagascar was first released, I was one of the people who was against the weird looking animation and really didn't want to give it a chance. But I had rented it anyways and decided to give it a fair chance, I actually loved the side characters the best vs. our main characters. I don't know, the main characters always seemed kind of bland to me. The penguins and King Julien are just hilarious and are a great balance between serious and wacky humor. But the second film really picked up and even the main characters became a little more interesting. I honestly didn't realize how popular these movies were to spawn another sequel. But I couldn't resist the penguins, they're just too hilarious. So naturally I saw this opening weekend and was left with a surprise that this actually topped the second film in story and jokes.<br/><br/>Still in Africa, Alex suggests to Marty, Melman, and Gloria that they should go to Monte Carlo to get the penguins to fly them back to New York City, which they agree to. In Monte Carlo, the penguins and the two chimpanzees keep winning in gambling until Alex's gang's attempt to reach them blunders and sparks chaos in the Hotel De Paris. Hotel security calls Monaco Animal Control officer Captain Chantel DuBois to deal with the animals. But rather than capture them live, DuBois desires them, mainly Alex, dead as trophies. During a high-speed chase between the relentless DuBois and the animals in a truck driven by the penguins to reach their aircraft, the animals barely manage to elude her. They escape but the airplane fails once again and they land in France. Getting on a train with a circus group, who is in a competition to win a trip to New York, Alex takes the opportunity to lead the group and get back to America once and for all.<br/><br/>I have two major grips in this film and it's two songs: Afro Circus and Firework by Katie Perry. Now with Afro Circus, for some reason they are trying so hard to push this song down our throats during the trailer, it gets annoying very fast. Firework I've heard way too many times to the point where I want to strangle it! I know this is nitpicking, but that's how bad I hate these songs. But if it wasn't for these two songs, honestly, it would have been a perfect animated movie. The animation is bright and colorful and you can tell the love that was put into this film. I didn't see the 3D version and did regret that because I think the 3D would have been worth it. The penguins are still great of course and always provide a great laugh. They're basically like Patton, they take themselves way too seriously but still get the job done. King Julien has a fling with a circus bear that is just too hilarious and will have you in stitches. I loved how they kept the face of the bear very life like, almost looking like it's just a blank expression as Julien is professing his love to her. I really did enjoy Madagascar 3, it's definitely the best of the series and worth the watch.<br/><br/>9/10"
"sesa_xyris18","10","1","2","26 June 2012"," Their Biggest Adventure Yet
","The animals that re-invented the song I like to move it s back now in 3D version. Alex the Lion, Melman the Giraffe, Marty the Zebra and Gloria the Hippo reunites once again to their biggest adventure yet.<br/><br/>The four animal friends (Ben Stiller, Chris Rock, David Schwimmer and Jada Pinkett-Smith) are still stranded in Africa hoping that their penguin friends would comeback and take them home to their beloved New York City. They decided to go to Monte Carlo to find the penguins so they can go back home. But their plans went on a bust as they were tracked down by Captain DuBois who has the dream of adding a head of a lion on his stuffed wall collection. The guys find a perfect cover as they join a traveling circus where they need to re-invent it and hopes that it would bring them home.<br/><br/>The third film in this series and the first one in 3D. Madagascar Europe's Most Wanted is simply enjoyable from start to finish with blistering lively colors onto the screen. It maintained the silliness and jokes from the previous movies that can entertain young audiences and adults. With the addition of a bunch of new characters and a circus themed story Madagascar 3 simply is the best animated film released this year. The CGI effects was amazing and even were sitting in the front of the screen it was still a tremendous fun experience. Arguably the best 3D animated film we watched.<br/><br/>For the story it's pretty wacky with the sense of comedy, family entertainment and friendship. It is filled with bright animation and charming situations. The Afro-Circus polka dot thing is still stuck in my head, it was one of the best scenes as the young crowd burst into laughter with it. The penguins are hilarious in their gimmicks and a circus bear riding a Ducati motorbike was cute. The voice cast absolutely done their part maintaining their performances for the characters we love.<br/><br/>Overall Madagascar 3 is the best part in this series. We recommend this to families who want to experience a wonderful movie experience. It's definitely a great movie for all ages no doubt that this series might have a fourth part. Nevertheless even your not a fan or you missed the first two films you'll surely bedazzled by the characters of Madagascar.<br/><br/>10 out of 10 stars www.lakwatseralovers.blogspot.com"

","I took my 5 year old to see Madagascar 3 and he really enjoyed it. The film is pretty much along the lines of the first two with Alex, Marty, Gloria and Melman trying to find a way to get to their true home at the zoo in the Big Apple. The film is a fast paced 90 minutes and the jokes come pretty rapid fire. There's enough laughter for both kids and adults and some cute visual gags.<br/><br/>Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted. The best thing that Madagascar achieves is that it out does it's trailer and is most definitely in league with the first two installments of the trilogy. Some are saying this is the best of the three, but Bruno Wang disagrees. I feel pretty strongly that the first Madagascar stands as the best.<br/><br/>In Madagascar 3, the gang, Alex the Lion (Ben Stiller), Marty the Zebra (Chris Rock), Melman the Giraffe (David Schwimmer) and Gloria the Hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith), while still in Africa, decide that they are no longer going to wait for the penguins, who have gone to Monte Carlo with jewels to gamble. The four main characters travel to Monte Carlo and get discovered where they then begin the chase across Europe to try and escape Captain Chantel DuBois (Frances McDormand). In the process of trying to hide out, the main characters join a run down traveling circus where they ultimately help the circus to reinvent itself and earn a ticket back to New York City to put on a performance.<br/><br/>The plot is well balanced and the new circus characters, which are the cheetah girl Gia, a Russian tiger named Vitaly and Stefano (Martin Short) as the sea lion add depth to the movie. There are even some developing relationships that come from the new mix of characters leading one to wonder if a Madagascar 4 might be in the works.<br/><br/>As in the first 2 films, Sacha Baron Cohen plays the wacky King Julien and his repertoire of comedy stays true to the first films. In Madagascar 3, King Julien falls madly in love with a tricycle riding circus bear and some of the better jokes and sight gags come from this unusual relationship. One interesting item of note is that the circus bear is the only animal that does not actually talk. All of the other circus animals speak but the bear just growls and grunts.<br/><br/>All in all this is a solid addition to the trilogy and it will be interesting to see if it is kept that way or if a successful outing will lead to a potential 4th. Most franchises die with a number 4 so we will see.<br/><br/>The basic themes of friendship and sticking together through thick and thin and banding together to fight the bad guy and never giving up are all the solid story lines that offer something meaningful to the kids. The rest is just some good humor and cute sight gags and the music is modern (Katy Perry and some 90s pop) as well as the soon to be rehashed ""Afro Circus""...much like ""I Like to Move It"" will be a big hit with kids.<br/><br/>I give this movie a Bruno Wang 4 stars out of 5. It is a fun and visually pleasing 90 minute romp. The characters are strong and the new characters add depth to the film. Definitely see the 3D version if you can...it is worth the couple extra bucks."

",":::::: SPOILER ALERT :::::: for this movie and for the movie Ratatouille :::::: <br/><br/>What I thought that lacked on this installment of the trilogy was a more developed villain. And this is why Pixar still stands strong because they humanize each and every character along their stories, always remembering there are two sides on a same coin. For example, does anyone remember the character ""Anton Ego"" - a food critic - in Ratatouille? His bitterness melting away as he savors a dish by the end of the movie... That is what this movie denies us by settling in for a ruthless, cold-blooded, caricatured hired gun."

Along the way the circus animals regain their passion for performing, and the zoo animals learn the importance of family and friendship. Unlike the 2 previous movies, this one has plenty of heartfelt moments that will pull at your heartstrings and even make you misty-eyed in some parts. It also has some gorgeous special effects to boot. Even though it has a ""happily ever after"" ending, there are plenty of possibilities left for these characters, so hopefully DreamWorks will make a 4th one!"
"rigoletto339","8","1","2","15 June 2012"," Third one is a topper
","Far too many sequels fall short of the original. This is one series where ""III"" outdoes the first two. This one has heart, has a good story, has brilliant animation (about 95% of the final credits to to Indian animators).<br/><br/>It has a suitably villainous villain (""Capitane Dubois""), who has one of the best scenes in the movie: she sings the Edith Piaf blockbuster ""Non, je ne regrette rien"". (We saw her the other day in ""Moonlight Kingdom"").<br/><br/>The interplay between the Bear and Julien is marvelous. The animation is superb.<br/><br/>There's a bit of artistic license in getting the stars from Africa to Monaco, but we can overlook that.<br/><br/>There are many outside references (and in-jokes, most of which I probably missed). One is when the circus is rehearsing, and one of them talks about ""this Canadian group"" - that's the Cirque du Soleil.<br/><br/>I wasn't expecting much (remembering the first two, and considering what usually happens to sequels), but this is one of the year's best."

","It's been seven years since Marty (Chris Rock) escaped his comfortable confines, followed by Alex (Ben Stiller), Gloria (Jada Pinkett Smith) and Melman (David Schwimmer) in Madagascar. Unfortunately, a zebra (Marty), lion (Alex), hippopotamus (Gloria), and giraffe (Melman) running loose in the Big Apple isn't easily accepted. Once captured, the four life-long friends are put in animal containers and shipped to Africa; and end up in Madagascar, found by King Julian (Sacha Baron Cohen) and his tribe of lemurs. In Madagascar 2: Escape to Africa, the group end up in *SPOILER* Africa, and now in Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted, the wayward animals are stranded in Africa, trying to make their way back to New York's Central Park Zoo.<br/><br/>Although the first Madagascar wasn't perfect, it was an enjoyable family film; made even more so by its cast of characters and especially by its breakout stars, the penguins: Skipper (Tom McGrath), Kowalski (Chris Miller), Private (Christopher Knights) and Rico. Madagascar 2: Escape to Africa tried to relive the comedic moments from the first film far too often, and even worse, came off as a cheap imitation of the Lion King. It wasn't a matter of would a 3rd film be made, not with a combined gross of over $373 million, but when would it be made? And would it be an improvement over the 2nd film?<br/><br/>Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted starts off familiar, with our trusty foursome, along with help from King Julien, Mort (Andy Richter) and Maurice (Cedric the Entertainer) making their way to Monte Carlo to track down the ever so tricky penguins, to gain their help in the hopes of getting back home. Upon their arrival and ensuing crashing of a Monte Carlo casino, they become the target of local Animal Control led by Captain Chantel DuBois (Frances McDormand). In order to avoid being found, the group takes refuge as part of Circus Zaragoza, a traveling circus.<br/><br/>Madagascar 3 is a definite improvement over Escape to Africa; however, the film is not without its flaws. The biggest issue is the inclusion of the Monte Carlo Animal Control. I realize that it's a plot device used to guide the film's stars to the traveling circus, but it didn't feel necessary; often it felt forced, and intrusive to the story. Captain Chantel DuBois is aggressive and non-stop of her pursuit of Alex for the sole purpose of mounting his head on her wall. Truth be told, once the four make it to the circus she becomes irrelevant.<br/><br/>The opposite can be said for the traveling circus, and the cast of new characters introduced. Vitaly (Bryan Cranston) the tiger, Gia (Jessica Chastain) the jaguar, Stefano (Martin Short) the sea-lion and Sonya (Frank Welker) the bear perform various stunts and acts in the failing circus. Once Alex, Marty, Gloria and Melman incorporate themselves into act, the movie really takes off. It becomes a bright, fun and enjoyable spectacle to watch. The interactions between the old and new characters are done perfectly and in such a way that easily integrates the new characters into the Madagascar lore; in the case of King Julien and Sonya, their relationship provides some of the films funniest moments.<br/><br/>The issues I have with Madagascar as a franchise is the length of time spent in Madagascar, Africa and now Monte Carlo, all in the hopes of getting back home. I'd also rather not even see any human characters in the films, because all they do is take away time from the films' actual stars. They don't add anything in the form of plot, and that screen time could be better used by showing more of the penguins. Speaking of which, I realize they have a T.V. show of their own, but isn't it time we get a Penguins of Madagascar movie??<br/><br/>What makes Madagascar 3 work is the exceptional voice work done by the actors and actresses. The chemistry between them shines through in every sequence. The addition of the new characters, as well as introducing the traveling circus allows for new opportunities to help the franchise move forward. My only request is that they don't continue to have Marty sing ""dadadalala Afro-circus, Afro-circus, polka-dot, polka-dot, polka-dot, Afro"", because I'm not sure how much more I can take of hearing my kids sing it. Although not on par with films by Pixar, Disney or even Dreamworks' own How to Train Your Dragon, I really enjoyed Madagascar 3 and hope they take advantage of the story possibilities revolving around a traveling circus.<br/><br/>Grade: B<br/><br/>visit our site at www.twodudereview.com"

","The Madagascar franchise has been a pretty mixed bag for me, the first film was fun, but the first sequel Escape 2 Africa was terrible, I didn't have my hopes for this third movie, but I went with it anyway. Basically it picks up where it left off, Alex the Lion (Ben Stiller), Marty the Zebra (Chris Rock), Melman the Giraffe (David Schwimmer) and Gloria the Hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith) are still stuck in Madagascar, Africa, and wish to return to the Big Apple, and their beloved Central Park Zoo. The four friends manage to work their way to Monte Carlo and catch up to the penguins and the chimpanzees gambling in the casino. But their antics draw the attention of the animal control, led by highly skilled and scary hunter Captain Chantal Dubois (Frances McDormand), who pursues them, determined to catch and kill them, and add them to her animal heads collection. The animals next wind up in the skies of France, crash land, and come across a circus train, containing Stefano the sea lion (Martin Short), Gia the jaguar (Jessica Chastain), and Vitaly the tiger (Bryan Cranston). After convincing the circus animals they are also part of the show, the four friends learn that the circus is on a European tour, going from Paris, then to Rome, and to London, before travelling to America. The four friends slowly find themselves blending into circus life for real, Alex convinces the glum animals to keep pursuing, Marty enjoys being fired out of a cannon, and Melman and Gloria walk the tightrope. Alex becomes part of a perfectly executed spectacular performance, the promoter is impressed and arranges the American tour, Dubois catches up to them, but the penguins foil her plan to capture them. There is a point when Alex is forced to confess to the circus animals that they are just trying to get home, they go their separate ways, but the zoo animals realise that their true home is now with their new friends. Before they can go back, Dubois tranquilizes and captures them, the zoo staff assume she has returned the animals to the zoo. King Julien XIII the ring-tailed lemur (Sacha Baron Cohen) and Skipper (Tom McGrath) and the penguins manage to convince the circus animals to help them save the zoo animals. In the end, Dubois and her henchmen are defeated, Alex and the others decide to permanently join the circus and pursue more adventures, and thanks to the penguins, Dubois and her henchmen are shipped in crates bound for Madagascar. Also starring Cedric the Entertainer as Maurice the aye-aye, Andy Richter as Mort the mouse lemur, Chris Miller as Kowalski, Christopher Knights as Private, Vinnie Jones as Freddie the Dog, Frank Welker as Sonya and Futurama's John DiMaggio as Rico. The recognisable voice cast are all fine, and the animation is fantastic, the most memorable sequence is the performance with ""Firework"" by Katy Perry playing, but even with some fast-paced chase sequences, and fairly amusing jokes, it is still lacking some charm, an alright animated family comedy adventure. Okay!"

","Well, it seems as if they couldn't leave the movie with our four heroes happy back in the plains of Africa because, well, they are starting to get homesick. Actually, the Penguins and the Monkeys had already headed home, via Monte Carlo to do a bit of gambling with all of the gold and jewels that they dug up in the previous adventure, and our heroes are starting to scratch their heads, wondering when they are going to get back again. Well, as it turns out the Penguins have completely forgotten about them so our heroes decide to head off the Europe. There is only one problem – after causing a raucous at the casino they catch the attention of Dubois, a dangerous animal hunter who wants a lion's head on her wall, so they do what any self respecting animal does, and join the circus.<br/><br/>This film seems to move away from what the original two were exploring, namely the animals returning to their natural habitat. Okay, the animals don't actually live in Madagascar, but that was because they fell overboard and landed up there. However, we now return to civilisation (for want of a better word, though maybe I should say 'industrialised world') and have to learn how to perform in a circus. Okay, there is the problem that carnies (that is circus performers) tend to stick together and not particularly like strangers, but the Monkeys, taking on the disguise of the King of Versaille (which I have to admit is a pretty awesome disguise), buy the circus as a way to get onto the train.<br/><br/>The problem is that the circus is, well, run down, particularly since one of the star performers ended up failing in one of his acts and now spends his time moping in the corner. In the end, as can be expected from a Hollywood movie, everything turns out for the best, though the whole adage of there being no place like home is a bit of a misnomer because, as our heroes discover, once you leave home then all of a sudden home is no longer what you could consider home. In fact once you leave home then in reality you can never actually go back home again.<br/><br/>I have to admit that I didn't like this film as much as the second one in the franchise, but maybe because the whole joining the circus pretty much introduced a whole heap of new characters that I found quite difficult to start relating too. It wasn't as if they were bad, or annoying, it was just that they were new and, okay, somewhat annoying. I guess the whole circus thing sort of annoyed me as well. Okay, it did have a plot, and it did end reasonably well, though I guess the other thing was that Dubois also started to get under my skin by the end of the film. Sure, it is called Europe's Most Wanted, and by the end having Dubois in the film was necessary, but I still didn't particularly like her. The film was okay, but nowhere near as good as the second in the series."
"filipemanuelneto","4","1","3","7 February 2017"," A reasonable movie with a bad script.
","This is the third ""Madagascar"" film, a sequel to the sequel, continuing the story of the four animals of the New York Zoo that went to Africa in the first two films. In this one, in an unbelievable way, they end up going to Europe where they get into trouble with Monaco's animal control before entering a travelling circus. One of the most interesting things about animated cinema is the great creative freedom it allows. However, there are plausible limits that should not be exceeded, otherwise the film will be totally absurd. ""Madagascar 3"" goes far beyond them. I recognize that it has a lot of funny moments but the script is absolutely predictable, annoying and implausible. The villain never seemed good, being a heap of clichés and francophone prejudices of remarkable bad taste. The four central characters also lose interest, especially Marty (the zebra) and Gloria (the hippo), seconded by the protagonism given to the new participants. On a technical level, it is impeccable: the animations are excellent, the voice actors (still appreciably inherited from the two previous films) do a great job and the film is visually beautiful. It has a positive thing: it goes back to the music and the songs, much despised in the previous film, but they are rather weak, the one that I liked the most was a comic imitation of ""Je ne regrette rien"", Edith Piaf's original."
"marktuovinen32","5","1","3","23 June 2016"," What happened to Madagascar?
","As a child my favorite animated movie out was ""Madagascar"" I absolutely loved the humor and the gorgeous animating (which stands to this day) from Dreamworks Animation Studios. Then the sequel which was in my opinion even better, with so much character background and development throughout it was an animated masterpiece. Every character was well played and enjoyable to say the least. I was about 15 years old when I first heard Madagascar 3 was being released and I was excited to revisit my childhoods favorite characters. Man was I wrong! Madagascar 3 just didn't feel the same. It was the same characters as before which I appreciated and the introduction to characters was good too. Animation was gorgeous as always also. The problem that I have with this film is the writers. What were they thinking? The story is so separate and different and unrelated to the previous two films which were great. The story winds the characters to end up travelling with a travelling circus of animals that are touring Europe. From this point on the story goes downhill. It decides to develop the characters from this circus and cover their back stories and why they are what they are like. Which in my opinion takes up to much time throughout the movie and totally spoils it. As for the ""Bad Guy"" or ""enemy"" in this film I would say is what ruined this film. The protagonist is a female Russian police officer who decides to hunt down all of the main characters and kill them. Alright then?..I found her character quite dark, sadistic and very annoying to say the least. Although there are a few factors that in my opinion ruin the "" Madagascar"" franchise the main characters are still lovable and have great character. If you haven't seen this film and have seen the first two then probably don't watch this. Children who aren't bothered by films that have a very different feel to the first two will enjoy this none the less."

","Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted (2012): Dir: Eric Darnell, Tom McGrath, Conrad Vernon: Voices: Ben Stiller, Chris Rock, David Schwimmer, Jada Pinkett Smith, Sacha Baron Cohen: Third entry in the Madagascar animated franchise involves a fish out of water plot where our trusty lion, zebra, giraffe, and hippo venture to Europe to reclaim those gambling penguins and chimpanzees. This results in sightings that land them as the target of animal control officer Chantel Dubois. She is relentless in her pursuit and seems to have more lives than most horror movies monsters. This results in some laughs but the material is still thin. Our heroes luck out when they go into hiding at a travelling circus in hopes to land back to the zoo in New York. This introduces fresh new characters such as a tiger whose impressive fire hoop act bares bad memories. Also, there is a female jaguar who can flip from the swings. There is the stammering sea lion struggling to organize an event well past its prime. This is all quite predictable with an effective subplot involving the tiger but little else. They all learn a valuable lesson about friendship and teamwork that opens new doors but the collaboration of such creatures is still a head scratch vision best left to younger minds. Children will enjoy the colourful animated wildlife and amusing antics, but frankly, watching Animal Planet is much more educational and far more entertaining than this fiasco. Adults will not find this as solid as The Secret World of Arrietty but as family entertainment this trip to the circus is suffice juvenile entertainment. Score: 5 / 10"

","Disappointing? I wouldn't say so but I went in with a bit too high expectation I guess given the fact that I've watched the first 2 installment of the Madagascar 3 and I freaking love Madagascar 2. The show is so short. The story wasn't that fantastic. I get the feeling that Madagascar 3 is just to tie up all the loose end and show everybody a happy ending. And I found of the supposedly ""funny"" parts were dumb. But again I'm looking at this from an adult point of view, which yeah maybe not be that suitable for a 3D cartoon show. However, that's because Madagascar 2 did cater for that without losing its younger audience. I somehow felt that they didn't really put a lot of thought into this and just go all out make something damn epic because it's the finale. I can still forgive the giraffe and hippo dancing on a tight rope but which f-ing tiger can jump through a key hole while holding a zebra? Come on! I know it's cartoon this is ridiculous even for cartoon.<br/><br/>But on a positive note, the show is light-hearted and does make you smile and enjoy the fun. If you ignore all the stupidity, and just go in and relax your brain. Madagascar 3 serves you well. So yes despite the fact that I don't rate it so high, it's still not really a waste of money to watch."

","It's been 7 years since the first Madagascar show and without doubt, the show has constantly improve without fail. One thing which I am truly amaze is that this series could actually keep in touch with it's comedy without losing it especially since most comedy series tends to die down as it continues. A good example to give is ""Shrek"". It started all funny and nice, but as it progresses to ""Shrek 2"", comedy starts to die down and it hit rock bottom with ""Shrek the Third"". No doubt ""Shrek Forever After"" did better than ""Shrek The Third"" but overall, the whole series lose it's roots. Which is why to me, this show deserves this 10 out of 10 rating as not only did it keep to its roots, but it improves it tremendously from the first to the second one. One thing I like most about this show is the balance of both child like comedy with adult humor and also, with some dirty jokes here and there. With all this elements together, it makes the show prefect. And the romance of Gia and Alex or King Julien with the grizzly bear was indeed hilarious and interesting.

","Pixar is going to have a tough time taking the Animated Oscar away from this troupe. Without going into much detail, and this type of film shouldn't be deconstructed for much depth and hidden meanings, let's just say, our quartet and the associated penguins have finally hit the target, not once, but over and over.<br/><br/>We have a film that didn't reveal much in his early previews and saved much fun for the final release, and it's a ball!! It seems as if everything visual gag, every joke, every nuance, every special effect just works. When I attended its screening, young and old people were laughing out loud, relating to the highs and lows of each character, and as I mentioned before, every single one of the characters has finally found a way to shine, with none of the extended and sometimes painful exposition pieces that dragged the original down. It's beautiful to see when a project of this type works because as of lately, we have been getting some pretty contrived entries that forget to let that heart beat loud.<br/><br/>It's fun to see the penguins take on a much sympathetic approach without sacrificing some of their quite daring personalities. They are not sweet, just a bit less mean than before, and this time they manage to even top themselves in the resourceful and imaginative categories.<br/><br/>One of the most pleasant surprises is the female antagonist, voiced by Frances McDormand, an interesting choice for this type of entertainment, but a most successful performance in every aspect. She is an instant classic from the earlier sections of the film until its closing frames.<br/><br/>Here is a sweet, silly, charming, and very entertaining movie, something that will be hard to top, if there ever is a 4th entry to the series."
"StevePulaski","8","1","3","10 June 2012"," An animated odyssey
","The films of the Madagascar franchise link together in a way rarely seen in the new age of cinema. Sequels tend to usually take place ""x"" amount of years after their predecessor, but here, it seems that each film picks up not long after the first previous one ends. I recommend to parents that if they find nothing to do on a specific day, then watching all three films of the Madagascar franchise in a row (since they're all relatively simple, fast watches at no more than eighty minutes a film) would be an ideal exercise.<br/><br/>Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted is an unlikely sequel because, like its predecessor, Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa, the film improves from its original, a rather kinetic and unusually rambunctious animated film. After rewatching both films to prepare myself for this excursion, I was very surprised at my reactions towards both. I haven't seen each film in their entirety since both of their theatrical release weekends, and my views on each film sort of swapped. When I originally watched them, I found the original Madagascar to be a smooth and satisfying picture, while I sort of gave the second film the colder shoulder. My views have directly changed, and I think the opposite of both pictures.<br/><br/>The third film provides us with some of the same things we've seen prior to this outing, but also adds some new elements with confidence. Our heroes have been through so much, that if you've seen the first two films, it's hard not to feel some sympathy while watching this one. Alex the lion (voiced by Ben Stiller), Marty the zebra (Chris Rock), Gloria the hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith), and Melman the giraffe (David Schwimmer) open the film, still stranded in the sunlit fields of Africa awaiting the return of the four penguins and the two monkeys who took off to Monte Carlo in another junkyard plane to visit the luxurious casinos. They make the simple, painless trip to Monte Carlo to try and recover them to make it home to their zoo in New York City.<br/><br/>Once there, they make a big spectacle at a casino, similar to how they created ruckus at Grand Central Station in the original film, and the animals, monkeys, penguins, and King Julien (Sacha Baron Cohen) along with his two sidekicks, Maurice (Cedric the Entertainer) and Mort (Andy Richter) immediately capture the attention of the Monaco Animal Control officer Captain Chantel DuBois (Frances McDormand). After breathlessly chasing them through the streets of London, the heroes manage to escape in a car-turned-plane to France, where the four zoo animals manage to hitch a ride with a traveling circus.<br/><br/>Bear with me here, as I'm having a truly difficult time summarizing this coherently. The four wind up purchasing the deed to the circus, and then realize that it's a rundown hack of an event, with has-been acts and a stubborn lion named Vitaly (Bryan Cranston), whose act of jumping through rings as small as an engagement band cost him his luscious fur coat and left him with a morose outlook on life. The four learn that if they manage to get an American sponsor to invest in the circus, they could potentially return home to New York City as an act.<br/><br/>This then spawns a frenetic and rambunctious journey through all formulas of animated films, from heart, to chaos, to adventure, to sentimentality, to ruckus, etc. While the original film seemed concerned with bringing manic sensibilities to the screen and the second film the sentimental and somewhat saddening side of the screenplay to light, Madagascar 3 seems determined to blend the two personalities. As convoluted and as desperate as it sounds, it actually makes for a very convincing ride.<br/><br/>Probably the most entertaining part is during the latter half of the second act when the animals put on a beautifully choreographed sound-and-light show in London to the music of Katy Perry's infectiously over-played anthem ""Firework."" While this perhaps isn't the most coherent animated film in a long time, being very sketchy, jumbled, and very, very springy in its narrative, it has its heart in the right place, and, let's face it, these characters, by the end of this movie, come off as likable scamps. Perhaps it's because I grew up with them, but even to a cynic, they manage to summon a smile to my face. For a series once reliant so heavily on hyperactive instincts and bathroom humor, it has matured and came of age nicely. Hopefully, so have most of the film's original fans.<br/><br/>Voiced by: Ben Stiller, Chris Rock, Jada Pinkett Smith, David Schwimmer, Sacha Baron Cohen, Cedric the Entertainer, Andy Richter, Frances McDormand, Bryan Cranston, Jessica Chastain, and Martin Short.

","I loved the first two movies, but this one was just ""Eh."" Part of the problem is that it made the zoo and the circus seem like the places to be, which is kinda naive considering animals get mistreated in the circus and the zoo isn't much better. I liked part 2 because it was animals in the wild in their natural habitat. Now off of my preachy soapbox, I wasn't into any of the zoo characters minus the bear. The relationship between that bear and raccoon was entertaining, especially when she gave him the silent treatment. The lioness and the lion relationship was all right but nothing special. Nothing about this movie popped. The annoying mother behind me who felt the need to narrate the entire movie made me move in about five minutes only to sit by a girl who gasped at every single thing (I'll take the girl over the mother any day though). I didn't really laugh. I listened to silence during some of the jokes with a packed crowd. I still love Chris Rock's zebra character, Marty, but he was much quieter in this film. I wouldn't say the movie is bad and I only paid $5 to see it, but I wouldn't want to own it. The first two though? Those will definitely be in my DVD collection soon."

"diac228","8","1","4","8 June 2012"," Utterly ridiculous. And it works.
","The cinematic franchise known as Madagascar is at its absolute best when the jokes are flying, the action is relentless and exaggerated, and you see more of the supporting characters as opposed to the main four. Everyone in the Milky Way knows that the penguins, Julius, and Mort provide the highest percentage of laughs on screen.<br/><br/>So now taking a page from the playbook of Ice Age 3, the third installment stripped away all sanity and logic, removed most of the heart, and increased the speed of the entire production. So what we have here is an extremely fast-paced and random nutty funhouse that is heavy on laughs, heavy in action, and only slows down when the story picks up any sentimentality.<br/><br/>Despite the movie moving so rapid that you don't realize there's a plot----don't worry, I will explain it to you. Alex and company are trying to find a way back to the United States before a psychotic animal hunter catches up to them. Along the way they get chased in Monte Carlo, join a circus, and befriend a group of circus animals that has seen better days. The plot is slightly original but still manages to hit all the clichés. But don't worry; it won't bother you too much.<br/><br/>Not when Julius has an incredibly bizarre (but downright hilarious) love story.<br/><br/>Not when the penguins and the monkeys continue to scheme, beg, borrow, deal, and build their way out of any situation.<br/><br/>Not when Mort's big bulgy eyes and random moments continue to thrive on the big screen.<br/><br/>And not when you are treated to action scene after action scene that breaks every single law of physics humanely possible.<br/><br/>The staff behind Europe's Most Wanted (it's a three-director team, which is why it seems as though this movie wants to head in multiple directions) is fully aware of the power and appeal of the non-main characters---so they gave them more screen time and focused far less on the drama of going home. That being said, it still didn't feel like it's enough. Unlike the support (and their voice actors) the main characters have gone a bit stale; the writing towards them has weakened severely over the years.<br/><br/>But as long as those penguins and lemurs continue to exist, Madagascar will remain a delight for kids and a guilty pleasure for adults. And the third time may not be the charm with the original still being the best, and although once again Madagascar mildly flounders in the third act, it's still a ridiculously dizzily entertaining movie that never overstays its welcome—even if the main characters do."

"weezeralfalfa","8","0","2","2 January 2014"," Highly energetic, possibly misogynic animation about humanoid mammals running their own circus.
","Superb for those who crave a variety of charismatic humanoid mammalian animations, and long stretches of virtually non-stop supersonic action or slapstick, punctuated by heart to heart dialog. For me as an adult, it gets pretty exhausting and mind-numbingly irrelevant to reality at times. As with most cartoons and animations, it promotes the fantasy that humans and animals can routinely defy the laws of physics and have an infinite number of reincarnations after having been subjected to numerous normally fatal or near fatal bodily insults. Obviously, these are very attractive fantasies for humans, especially children.<br/><br/>As in the case of the recent animation ""The Pirates: Band of Misfits"", not to mention some classic fairy tales, this film risks being perceived as misogynic, as the constant prime villain is characterized as a woman in authority(In this case, a fanatical, virtually indestructible, French animal control police woman, who shoots anesthetizing darts at them, hoping to add a mounted lion head to her extensive wall collection of animal heads, along with returning the others to their home zoo). Perhaps the idea is that the direct authority figures for most children(mothers, step-mothers, teachers) are primarily women. Hence, the children are identifying with the pirates, scientists, animals or damsel whom the authority figure wants to control or harm. The persecuted humans or animals thus become the heroes in rebelling against the traditional or abusing authority, just as children often wish they could invent their own individual or group activities rather than being directed by robotic authority figures. In this film, the animals eventually are able to own and control their own circus, thus can devise their own amusements for others, as children(and adults) often wish.<br/><br/>The other significant intellectual issue is the attitude toward whether it's better for non-domesticated animals to be in their native habitat or confined to a zoo, circus, home or other human-devised enclosure. 'Born-free' fanatics abhor any kind of human-devised confinement and, often, any killing of non-domesticated animals. They forget that nature also is often cruel: that unprotected animals often die of starvation, thirst, poaching, predation or health risks. This point is dramatized to some extent in Madagascar I & II.<br/><br/>The ending of the recent animation film ""Rio"", with an exhilarating escape of the last two known members of a macaw species into the native jungle, plays on the human emotional bias of wanting to escape physical confinement and the behavioral limits enforced or encouraged by authority figures or, in the case of Blu, by one's own timidness. In reality, assuming that humans had worked out how to promote good reproduction and survival under confined conditions, you wouldn't want to release the last few individuals of a species into the wild, where they and their offspring face many more potential life-threatening challenges, with the possible exception of communicable diseases and parasites. The wise Tulio knows this. But, Jewel, having tasted the freedom of her(much reduced) native forest, and unaware of her own extreme rarity, refuses to accept continued life in confinement, however safe, and has convinced lifelong pet Blu to try to overcome his fears of dealing with the unknown of an unprotected habitat: a good message for children. <br/><br/>In the present film, the animals are not characterized as being among the last few of their species. Initially, they decide to try to return to their 'home' in the barred NYC Central Park Zoo, having discovered the downsides to living in their native African habitat. To get there, they jump on a European circus train to escape capture, learn about the circus as a potential fun lifestyle and buy it. They now can have the best of both worlds. As long as they please the customers with their antics(which they initially fail to do), they can have fun, choosing their antics, and not worry about starving or being eaten by predators, nor about being mistreated by human owners. However, first, they have to eliminate than mad French animal control woman, who has followed them to NYC to accomplish her goals. Finally, they subdue her, and she is last seen in a crate bound for Madagascar(which once was a French colony.) <br/><br/>Of course, real animals can't own and manage their own circus or zoo. However, as of recent times, they may be lucky enough to escape both the dangers of wild habitats and the boredom and possible mistreatment of confinement in cages, by a more practical alternative: the trend toward open habitat zoos and large aviaries, so that humans can observe them in somewhat natural conditions. That would have been a fitting finale message.<br/><br/>Didn't miss that crack about the French and Canadians being ultralazy!"

","I liked the first 'Madagascar' film; but the third in the series doesn't match it's predecessor, and for a surprising reason: it doesn't make sense. You might think that this is a strange criticism of a film about a bunch of talking animals, but the skill of the first movie, as with many of the best animations, was in placing comic absurdity within a set of very human parameters. 'Europe's Most Wanted', however, puts the emphasis on high velocity action scenes, and tells a story where the world of its characters is totally unconstrained: anything can happen as long as it makes for a spectacular sequence. As a result, the film seems much closer to movies like 'Ice Age' than to Pixar's frequently outstanding output: one for the kids, but without the depths that have made many recent animated movies (includng its own ancestor) something special. However, the train-spotter in me was pleasantly surprised to see quite how accurately the film portrayed not just the tourist sites of Europe, but even Rome's Termini station."

Naturally penguins, distinguished chimps and ego-maniacal lemurs get they fair share of screen time, but they are enhanced by a selection of great circus mammals, starting from a Russian tiger capable of the impossible (literally) and ending with belligerent little pooches, each with their nice character quirks. Meanwhile the supposed foursome which make up the heroes of the franchise take a back seat in proceedings. Thankfully, as Alex lacks any true impression, while Chris Rock's frantic exuberance as Marty is mostly just achingly irritating. Melman and Gloria as generally likable, but almost invisible with no true impact on the story, apart from them working out a circus act together.<br/><br/>Nonetheless this crazy and chaotic sequel is a far cry from its tired predecessor, inflaming life into characters and highlighting its strongest traits with a no-holds-barred approach. All in all the film is a wacky pleasure to behold, despite the apparently flimsy narrative to follow, more working out like random goofs and gags, which fit together to create a grand picture heading to a big final prank. Thankfully the script manages to never overwork the premise or overuse their most intriguing characters. Managing to avoid a simple rehash (as in ""Madagascar 2"") this part invigorated interest in the franchise with a host of new animals sure to endear themselves to the public and probably increasing the shelf life by at least one more movie venture into the universe and more Penguins series to boot. The story itself, despite being somewhat basic and predictable (dealing with recognisable issues of friendship and trust), holds the proceedings together, despite the rampant wildness of infectious humour, which is sure to imbue an honest chuckle more often than not. Definitely a movie which is sure to entertain both young and old, albeit moments of laughter are sure to differ depending on age groups.<br/><br/>Surprisingly must say I enjoyed the movie much more than the original and is a rare example of a movie, which manages to focus on what works and remolding what doesn't to deliver an improvement on both the original and its sequel."

","Madagascar 3 is a fun family film. it has many humorous moments (the whole film) in my opinion it was a good use of animation, but if i hadn't gone with my class i probably wouldn't have gone to see it because the trailers were not very well thought out. i personally prefer horrors, i give this film a 4 out of ten mainly because the humour was the best part of it and i didn't fully connect with the characters as well as i could have. the graphics were not bad but i have seen better in my opinion Madagascar 3 is not as good as 1 and 2. the music was all pointless and weird. the voice of the main character Alex the lion is played by Ben Stiller who was in night a the museum which was a better film."
"arielmagno2008","9","0","1","10 November 2012"," This one is epic and the plot is so smooth. The soundtrack was also great.
","This movie is just another add- on to Dream Works' array of masterpieces. The plot is epic smooth and comedic and the new characters were all awesome and hyperbolic. Voice actors and actresses were also working so great and just perfectly fit their respective roles and the European scene could be felt in anywhere in the scene (except on the latter part). The most loved character perhaps, would be Captain Chantel DuBois, a French police woman possessing that super hyperbolic character. The circus characters were also playful and the entire film would fictionally drive you to European scenes. Also, Fireworks by my Katy is a perfect soundtrack of the film. Some action were mild though and the other ""some"" possesses rude humor but I don't think so this should be rated PG :)"

","The mismatched menagerie is back for its third outing, still trying to return to the New York Zoo. On this occasion, pursuing the aeroplane which the penguins and monkeys have taken to Monte Carlo, they make the mistake of attracting the attention of rabid French animal cop Mme Dubois. In an attempt to escape her, they attach themselves to a travelling circus where, initially, they are not very welcome. Mme Dubois, however, has not given up...<br/><br/>I never cared for the main characters in the first film: Ben Stiller's anxious lion and Chris Rock's hyper-intrusiveness irritated me, and David Schwimmer's giraffe revisited all the aspects of Ross's whiny personality which had grated on my nerves so severely. I found the second film an improvement, and I liked this one more still. The circus animals add some welcome variation, the story is fast paced, Dubois is a well-realised (and much-needed) villain, the character dynamics are good, and the whole thing is a visual feast with some dazzlingly realised action set-pieces.<br/><br/>This movie brings the series to a satisfying end. I hope they resist the urge to add a further instalment to a series which come to a pleasing conclusion.<br/><br/>The 3D is first rate, and adds immeasurably to some of the sequences."

","No doubt that it is best of the madagascar series.. More funnier,more colourful and just above in everything than original movies. Must say,the visual effects are fantastic and magnificent for a animated movie. Shinning and shimmering set of pieces are just too good. voice acting is just over the top,everybody did a great job. the gags,punches,jokes and slapstick really entertains us. The only weakness is its silliness and stupidity of script and how all the animals do the things they just can't do,but its fine because it is a animated movie for kids. but the story could have been better its really simple and predictable. in spite of not-so-good writing it is the most entertaining in the series and dazzling enough to take us on a bumpy ride with full of fun. Just switch off your brain,don't think what's happening and how is it happening and Enjoy the visually impressive and funniest animated flick of the year"
"domtaylor","8","0","1","25 October 2012"," A 3D family fun ride!
","Madagascar 3:Europe's Most Wanted is a lovable film for the whole family! The effects and 3D on this film are amazing.The fun is in your face and you'll just be wanting more. As a family film, it has lots of jokes including kids jokes and adult jokes which will have you laughing out loud along with all your friends! I prefer this to the first Madagascar film but I think is on par with the second one! All your favourite characters including Alex, Marty, Gloria, Melman, King Julien, Mort, Maurice, the monkeys and last but not least, the hilarious penguins come to the big screen once more! Throughout the movie, these characters are joined by the clever,villain Captain Chantel DuBois and lots of circus friends! In my opinion there shouldn't be another Madagascar movie as this one ends the trilogy very nicely and a fourth film would ruin the franchise. This is a great 3D cinema watch with all of your family and is filled with fun! The characters go,once more, around many places of the world and will take you with them laughing! My rating 8/10!"
"Ostrumation","Null","0","1","13 October 2012"," Lots and Lots of Fun
","""Madagascar"" and ""Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa"" were decent entries in DreamWorks' animated line-up. The first one had good ideas, nice slapstick and stylized animation but a story that quickly lost steam halfway through and a had screenplay that just wouldn't keep quiet. The second one was more story-oriented and had better character development, but a lot of the fun that defined the first film felt absent. I could only imagine what a third ""Madagascar"" was going to do with these characters and such. From the trailers, I thought it looked like a disaster in the making. Just a safe, harmless money-maker for DreamWorks so they could support the more ambitious works like ""How to Train Your Dragon"" and the upcoming ""Rise of the Guardians"".<br/><br/>Fortunately, I was proved wrong. ""Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted"" knows exactly what it wants to be: A crazy, over-the-top, colorful comedy for both kids and adults. What was actually surprising was that this was almost devoid of the mean-spirited humor and pop culture references that dominated a lot of the older DreamWorks' computer animated films and the first two ""Madagascar"" films. This one focuses more on the story, even though the story may not be spectacular by any means. It's your basic get back home story, and the animals join a European circus to get there. They pull a nice big lie, you know the deal. The character development is good too, in fact I thought the zoo gang was far more interesting in this film than they were in the first two. I also enjoyed the new characters, as the second film's new batch of characters were bland and forgettable. The circus gang is just as likable as the zoo gang, if not more interesting.<br/><br/>""Madagascar 3"", like its predecessors, also has very good animation. This time, the writers take the silliness and launch it over the top. This is essentially the whole idea of the franchise realized. All the rules are thrown out the window: There's crazy antics from the film's villain running through walls like a wrecking ball to the characters hanging off of the chimpanzees on a makeshift helicopter. The first 20 minutes alone are some of the wildest, craziest stuff you'll see in an animated film this year. It's all handled well too, the animators probably had a load of fun with this film.<br/><br/>Even more satisfying is the screenplay, which Noah Baumbach (Wes Anderson's protégé) spiced up. As I said earlier, this one balances both the story and the fun without having one overshadow. There are a few problems, and the movie isn't great by any means. It's basically a fun animated film. It's certainly not Pixar or something else, and it knows it. It just wants the audience have a good time. I sure did."
"lethalweapon","6","0","2","5 October 2012"," Surprising how high this is rated. It's watchable, but not as good as the 1st two
","It's not bad, but not exactly good either. Doesn't stick to the tone of the first two parts - makes things over the top and inconsistent. So it's off track from 1 and 2, but not in the way that it's exploring new territory... in sharp contrast with the Ice Age series - which built on the stories, remained consistent, and the stories, implausible as it were, broke new grounds in terms of plot...<br/><br/>At the same time, it is linked to the earlier stories such that it cannot stand alone. From the get go, the plot and the characters are brought out as if everyone knows and remembers the characters and their adventures... It'd be difficult for a new-comer to grasp the story.<br/><br/>The only plus over the preceding movies is that the animation has gotten better. But that was bound to happen anyway. But it's not 'unenjoyable'. It has its moments. Overall, it is watchable. But I preferred the first two."
"Ryan_MYeah","5","0","4","7 September 2012"," This beast has grown real old, real fast.
","As someone who really liked the first two Madagascar movies, this one was just flat out stale. While not without merits, the movie suffers from an overabundance of characters, both old and new. Some of these characters are more entertaining than others, but it just makes it hard to stay focused on any one of them. On top of that, the movie is rushed, and the humor is inconsistent. King Julien, a comedic gem in the previous movies, is played up to be such an irritating idiot. Even the penguins have grown old. It's still occasionally entertaining, and it looks great as always, but this beast needs to make way for the next franchise.<br/><br/>**1/2/ *****"
"pelegosto264","6","0","3","18 August 2012"," Not too bad
","The first movie was a huge surprise to me and I found it hilarious! But after seeing the second movie, I had grown tired of the ""heroes"" of the series. The lion just keeps complaining, nag nag nag.... pffff, the giraffe has nothing special besides being sick all the time, and as for the other two, I have no idea what makes them so special (eat the zebra and get it over with). But there were always funny bits with the penguins and the lemurs. So I was very curious about this third movie. They have introduced some new characters (thank God!), and they have a lot of screen time. Whenever the old cast is on screen, they do what they always do, nag nag, complain, wanna go home, nag nag. And of course you know how this is going to end... So, was it bad... no, not really. There are a lot of funny bits (none like in the first one). Puts a smile on your face, thats about it."
"estreet-eva","4","0","4","18 July 2012"," Probably not really Europe's most wanted
","So our heroes have escaped and living free in their native African habitat; however, they long to return to their cramped, damp enclosures in Manhattan's Central Park Zoo where they can stand on concrete and have peanuts hurled at them by children visiting the city. Um...look just go with this premise, alright? OK, the only way to return to New York, despite the fact that the penguins can build their own boats and airplanes, is to save a dying Italian circus. Um...look, again, just go with the premise. For adults, if you can suspend your disbelief and go with the silly plot you get...well, not much in return. Voice work by Stiller, Schwimmer and Rock involves them basically playing themselves with some effort at vocal demonstrability to punch up a thin script. Like ""Tintin"", the strategy employed here is to keep the action moving at a frenetic pace as filler for old-fashioned concepts like dialog and story. Anyway, younger children will be delighted that the animators use all 64 colors in their big Crayola box and by multiple dance sequence. Older children and adults will be distracted by questions as to why Gia, the female leopard character has human boobs much like the eleven-foot cat people in ""Avatar"" and why the Captain Chantal DuBois character is drawn with near obscene pulchritude? In short, 2012 may go down as the ""Summer of Disappointing Animation""."

","That is pretty much the motto of this 3rd instalment in the ""Madagascar"" franchise...a real place which most people probably couldn't point out on the map...you know that island next to that continent we call Africa...no no no, not Antartica...I said Africa, stop looking at the South Pole...<br/><br/>Since the past couple of years have been dominated by sequels, prequels and re-boots (and re-boots of re-boots...""The Amazing Spiderman""...really do we need another one?!), ""Madagascar 3.."" and whatever the rest of the title was, sure falls into those categories very neatly.<br/><br/>The movie has its funny moments, and is sure to be enjoyed by the kiddies, the adults will also be entertained a few moments at the time, before nodding-off or checking their BlackBerries or Iphones.<br/><br/>As a sequel it is not bad, it introduces a few new characters, some worthwhile, others just filler. I guess by this point, as they did with the ""Shrek"" franchise, Dreamworks decided this will be the movie where everyone will find a significant other and fall in love. It almost without a doubt sets up the obligatory fourth instalment where all our animal heroes will have children...just ask Shrek...no wonder he looked soo depressed and suicidal the last movie he was in...<br/><br/>Since this sequel takes place in Europe, they chose the right spot, Monaco...to be more specific Monte Carlo, the one place where Europe's desperation and free-fall can be better concealed...but hey, even in an animated movie, the denizens of Europe looked positively miserable and frightened. The baddie in this movie after all, is a crazy woman and her fanatical henchmen..bent on hunting and killing as many animals as possible to fill-up her trophy collection.<br/><br/>Since cannibalism seems to be in fashion again, this movie makes a pretty good case for it...just watch it and you'll see...<br/><br/>Anyways, yeah take your kid to see this one, Dreamworks is about the only studio whose animation division has given Pixar a run for its money, the only thing that drags all of them down, are the endless sequels they subject their movies too...enough of that!!!"

",".....and I mean this in a good way. If Dreamworks ends this series with this film, then they have ended a fun franchise on a positive note.<br/><br/>The film begins with Alex, Marty, Melman, and Gloria still in Africa with the penguins taking the plane to Monte Carlo to hit up the casinos big time and promising they will return. However, the penguins never come back and the four heroes end up growing old in Africa. This turns out to be a recurring nightmare for Alex. After this, the four decide to go to Monte Carlo themselves and track down the penguins themselves.<br/><br/>When their plan goes awry and they are seen by tourists, Captain DuBois, a French animal control expert makes it her mission to track down the animals, and more specifically, Alex. In order to keep themselves hidden away from DuBois, the four heroes, along with the monkeys, King Julien, Maurice, and Mort, all stumble upon a European traveling circus. They find out that this circus may be their ticket back to their home in New York.<br/><br/>The story is a fun and interesting one, with some hilarious jokes and unexpected plot twists. The script was written by co-director Eric Darnell and Noah Baumbach, whose previous writing credits include Fantastic Mr. Fox and the Ben Stiller starring vehicle Greenberg. They do a great job of keeping this story interesting.<br/><br/>Stiller, Chris Rock, David Schwimmer, and Jada Pinkett Smith all return to voice their respective characters for the third time and continue to do their jobs well.<br/><br/>There are two standouts in this cast, who are also two new arrivals. Bryan Cranston voices Vitaly, a circus tiger with a bitter outlook on life and is not interested in having anything to do with Alex. The other big standout is Frances McDormand as Captain DuBois, who will stop at nothing until she has captured Alex and has his head on her mantle.<br/><br/>The film has three directors: Darnell, Tom McGrath, and Conrad Vernon. These three all do a great job of keeping the story together. There is never a boring moment in the film. They also do an excellent job of sticking to the story in the film and letting it control how the film goes.<br/><br/>As a family film, both the kids and the adults will enjoy it. The kids will get some enjoyment out of seeing the animals on screen. The parents will enjoy this for a good story."

","This is by far my favorite film of the Madagascar series.<br/><br/>It is insanely fast and very energetic. Very often movies have a great opening scene and then they settle into a slower pace or opt for a more grounded feel. In this movie every scene is snappy, every character is over the top, everything is always theatrical and it is fun beginning to end. <br/><br/>It is clever and it clearly makes a decision not to be heavy, not even for a moment. There is no moralizing and it totally disregards (even animation) ""reality"" for more fun, more stunning animation or more stunning 3D. It has a great tone and the lemur / bear on tricycle love story is just one of many great little extras that make you smile from beginning to end of this movie."
