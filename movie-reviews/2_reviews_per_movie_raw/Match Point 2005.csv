","Match Point just joined Brokeback Mountain and Cinderella Man in the top three films for me this year. Like Brokeback Mountain, however, it is almost impossible to write a reasonably intelligent review without writing a spoiler.<br/><br/>I have been a hot and cold Woody Allen watcher, but was only a fan during his comedic phase. So, despite hearing from a few reliable sources that this is Woody's masterpiece, I was skeptical and went in with few expectations. I am glad. Approaching the movie this way allowed it to creep up on me. <br/><br/>The NYC Jewish dialog is gone. The quirky sense of humor is nowhere to be found. the hypersensitivity is missing. Where's Woody? Well, he's in London, but the place and time, despite the opinions of some critics, are largely irrelevant in this film.<br/><br/>There is only one line in this film that indicates its origin - it has something to do with 'intertwined neuroses' and nearly made me laugh. <br/><br/>The first 3/4ths of this film is almost completely taken up with character development, but also contains all of the basics of the inexorable plot that truly unfolds near the end. The characters are all quite likable, and, if you're like me, you will yearn for a happy ending. Watch out! - you've just been hooked and Woody's about to reel you in! <br/><br/>Match Point draws its audience in quietly and slowly at first, defining its territory as a smart, hip, and sophisticated character study early on (in no way unexpected for Mr. Allen), but then it takes an irreversibly sinister turn as one man threatens to bring everybody we have grown to love and respect down with him. <br/><br/>The performances and cinematography in this film are all-around the best I've seen this year. Allen uses a lot of very close-in face shots, and his cast handles it with ease, performing their parts with accuracy and no lack of passion. Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Emily Mortimer, and Scarlett Johanssen are all excellent, and the rest of the cast lends excellent support. I found no fault in the pace or the plot - this is easily Woody's most plot-heavy film, and you can tell that he had a great time putting it together. <br/><br/>The story line of Match Point is powerful, disturbing, and exceedingly clever. Philosophical folks will likely want to talk about it afterward. Some will find it frustrating and others will find it pretentious. Still others will point to Woody's own life and claim that this film is some form of perverse confession. Well, from my perspective, it is simply damn good story-telling.<br/><br/>Highly recommended for adult audiences."
"trevormerrill","9","313","438","3 January 2006"," a terrific film
","Match Point is a cool, classically elegant and concise film that addresses all of the big questions--love, morality, death, fate, chance--without ever seeming heavy or self-conscious. I've never seen a Woody Allen film to match it. As a matter of fact, I can't remember another film of late that I thought was quite this good. From the opening shot, the film draws you in and doesn't let up, moving from shot to shot with a fine sense of rhythm and a narrative drive that builds the viewer's curiosity through a series of unexpected switchbacks. Rhys-Meyers is superb as an ex- professional tennis player from a poor Irish background who has turned social climber. Too proud to accept a favor from his upper class friends without immediately offering to pay it back, he affects an interest in opera and Strindberg. The viewer at once sympathizes with him and winces as he strains to seem refined and self-assured. Allen has put together a superb cast of young actors who bring his near flawless script to life so convincingly that one almost immediately suspends disbelief and becomes absorbed in the story. The shots of London are luxuriant and spacious, never self-indulgent. Few films, novels, or plays manage to form such rich dramatic material out of characters' inner obstacles. A classic piece of drama that reaches toward the likes of Shakespeare and Dostoevksy, every facet--from structure to dialog to editing to sound--is brought off with panache. This is not only Allen at his best but an example of what the cinematic medium is capable of when properly exploited."
"lauriemar","9","248","346","15 January 2006"," Ignore the UK paper reviews, this is terrific
","What a throughly engrossing evening Woody Allen has provided. This film has been, by and large, poorly received by the British critics. I cannot understand why. Yes, it does have the strongest echoes of Crimes and Misdemeanours, but if a director/writer can't borrow from his own product, who can? This isn't funny Allen -- there are few laughs -- but it is an extremely intense and successful serious Allen.<br/><br/>Does Allen's magic transfer to my home city? You bet it does; lovely locations; Notting Hill, the Tate Modern, the ""Gherkin"" in the City, all look great but are also entirely relevant. Many critics said he didn't have an ear for British dialogue. I simply don't hear that -- it may be a bit stagy at times, but the writing is spare, to the point, and literate. Few trans-Atlantic clunkers.<br/><br/>Yes, there are some silly bits; bits where you wish any half-intelligent Englishman had watched the film and said ""Wood, old son, this is cobblers"". British detectives don't call themselves ""Detective so-and-so"". They might be Detective-Sergeant or whatever. The force that polices London is the Metropolitan Police, not the ""London Police"". Perhaps Allen didn't realise that his main copper, Ulster actor James Nesbitt, sounds a parody of the amusing roles he plays in some widely-seen British Yellow Pages adverts. Little things, so easy to iron out, that detract just a touch from credibility.<br/><br/>Scarlett Johannsson -- what an actress, is she really only 20 or whatever? She packs huge power and stunning looks, if occasionally getting a trifle near Glenn Close in Fatal Attraction. Jonathan Rhys Myers does his forlorn sports coach bit, as from Bend It Like Beckham. The solidly Brit supporting cast is entirely believable, even if their effortlessly affluent lifestyle takes a bit of swallowing. Genuine surprises at the end. This is a thoroughly satisfying evening at the movies."
"nycritic","10","140","195","14 January 2006"," In the Realm of Film-Noir
","Would it that this film had been made in the Forties or Fifties when film-noir was at its high point! Woody Allen, one of America's best directors pays his homage to the genre in his latest film about romantic obsession, and if his name weren't in the opening credits you wouldn't know he directed it. Taking a break from filming in the city he loves the most, deleting every trace of the well known neurotic hoots and clicks from his main and supporting British cast, and even removing the trademark reference to his own persona from Jonathan Rhys-Meyers' performance, MATCH POINT becomes a very European film that starts out deceptively as a character study with comedic tones and ever so subtle moves into the darker side of love, echoing THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE and of all films, FATAL ATTRACTION.<br/><br/>A love quadrangle, the oldest plot device, is Allen's focus this time: Chris Wilton (Rhys-Meyers), a retired tennis player, becomes an instructor to Tom Hewett (Matthew Goode). Both find that they have similar interests, such as the love of opera and the works of Dostoyevsky. (They have another similar interest, but I'm getting there). Tom invites Chris for an evening at the opera and introduces him to his family and sister Chloe (Emily Mortimer), who falls for him and who later on signifies familial safety in all forms. Sensing an opportunity to climb the social ladder he starts seeing her just as he meets Nola Rice (Scarlett Johanssen), an aspiring American actress, whom he openly flirts with until he realizes she's Tom's girlfriend, but an outsider in the Wilton household. A clandestine affair between Chris and Nola begins tentative at first -- she advises him against it since it would ruin his chances to become a success and she is engaged to Tom -- but turns deeper. However, a turn of events transpire, taking Nola out of the picture, having Tom marry another girl and Chris marry Chloe, and start to get complicated once Chris tracks Nola down.<br/><br/>Like I said, would it that MATCH POINT would have been filmed 60 years ago because everything in it smolders like the plot elements of the sleekest of noir films. With a deliberate pace that begins taking a sinister shape after the second half, Allen misdirects the audience to the very core. Allen avoids any trace of romantic melodrama, though, and in showing what actually transpires between a couple ensnared in an affair -- their initial bedazzlement, their passion consummated, turning into routine and then its painful decline -- is true to life. Nola, initially seen in white much like Lana Turner in THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE seems to be in total control until Allen deftly pulls the rug out of her feet and has her do a slow collapse into her own trap, dressed in darker and darker colors. Chris, at first, so lusts after her it's a question if he can choose her love over social status and this becomes the crux of MATCH POINT: whether the tennis ball falls over the net or not.<br/><br/>There are moments when you think that a director who once had his audience eating out of his hand has gone into autopilot or entered a point of no return. Up until recently, Woody Allen had had even his most hardcore fans put through the ringer with film after film of a disposable nature. With this film, which has a strong connection to CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS, he shows that he never was gone. In erasing all references to his staccatto style, he wins over a new audience willing to accept his work with ease and this is at times necessary: like Hitchcock's self-effacing FRENZY, MATCH POINT is an excellent movie showcasing a director in full control of his ability to tell a visual tale. Maybe not up there with the best of his roster but pretty damn close, and that's saying quite a wallop."

","...and what a great stroke of luck it is to have sat through Woody Allen's latest, ""Match Point."" Fans of Woody could sense his comeback in the tragedy half of his last effort, ""Melinda and Melinda."" It was far more compelling than the comedy half, and the philosophical ideas it brought up were the best Woody Allen had given us in a long while. Here with ""Match Point"" he explores the notion of luck and gives us his best film since....well, since I don't know when. He proves here that when he leaves himself out of the cast, and changes locations (the transition from New York City to London is as flawless as it is invigorating), he can deliver the goods. This film, free of all the typical Allen shtick, and full of noirish twists and surprises, is every bit as good as Robert Altman's ""The Player"" or ""Gosford Park,"" and like those two films, it's the best kind of return to form you could hope for from a past master.<br/><br/>Chris Wilton (played moderately well by Johnathan Rhys Myers, who comes across as a more handsome Joquin Phoenix) is a failed tennis pro from Ireland who gets a plum job at a snobbish country club in London where he meets up with Tom (an appropriately British Matthew Goode), woos his sister, Chloe (an adorable Emily Mortimer), and has an affair with Tom's flighty fiancée, a struggling American actress named Nola (a ravishing Scarlett Johansson). The film starts off like a more refined version of last year's tawdry affair, ""Closer,"" with Allen exploring the love lives of semi-bored, over-educated filthy rich Brits who when not hopping in and out of each other's beds are hob-nobbing at the opera, the latest art exhibit, or lounging around their lavish estates reading and drinking. There's also a hint of ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" in its exploration of the class system and Chris' obsession with infiltrating this exclusive and beguiling society. Thankfully, we're spared all of the weirdness of an atrocity like ""Ripley,"" as Allen keeps it all very clean, sheen, clever and classy.<br/><br/>The film takes some dark turns and has some operatic overtures, spiced with some Dostoevsky references and plenty of pondering on luck. Allen here doesn't seem to be writing off the need for hard work completely, but to achieve a truly privileged life, where one can get away with just about anything, you better have a lot of luck."
"evo8mr","10","136","196","10 January 2006"," Quite possibly... (IMO)
","The best Woody Allen movie in about 15 years. I would've said that a couple of months back about 'Melinda and Melinda' but this is a far better cry than Melinda and Melinda. Don't get me wrong, I think Melinda and Melinda is a good movie, but 'Match' is more fulfilling.<br/><br/>Jonathan Rhys Meyers plays Chris Wilton, a former tennis pro turned tennis teacher who is of Irish lower class. He is shocked to find out he got a job as a tennis instructor in a high class country club. There he meets Tom Hewett played by Matthew Goode in a very strong performance. What Rhys Meyers does is unbelievable, he showcases what he is really made of in this movie. Chris sounds like a simple person but what Rhys Meyers did was make him a person of complexity. From the moments of solitude when he's in the same room as his family, the way he grieves for what he's doing and what he is about to do is very convincing.<br/><br/>Emily Mortimer plays Chloe Hewett Wilton, Chris' wife and Tom's sister. Also what Mortimer does is also outstanding, even though she isn't given much to make Chloe a person rather than a persona, Mortimer makes Chloe a person with ease. In my opinion, I think Emily Mortimer does a better job of playing her character than Kate Winslet would've done had she been attached. She has the right notes and chemistry with Jonathan Rhys Meyers to make their marriage and romance very believable, and what Mortimer does in the moments of denial and solitude she is given, she makes Chloe a complete person. This performance should make her a star.<br/><br/>Scarlett Johansson gives, in my opinion, maybe her 2nd best performance in this movie. Johansson is OUTSTANDING as Nola Rice, a struggling actress. Johansson shows us her range to play this character, the epitome of tragic beauty, Johansson combines elements of sexuality, desire, nostalgia, in one being. Though this performance may not be as good as her performance in Lost in Translation, its still good enough to get her an Academy Award Nomination.<br/><br/>Match Point starts off as a drama and works its way into being a very tense psychological thriller, and Woody Allen shows he is still in top form by trying something daring, and pulling it off. This movie is a silent masterpiece."
"Buddy-51","8","116","166","12 January 2006"," engrossing tale of adultery and obsession
","In ""Match Point,"" Woody Allen, caught in one of his more ""serious"" moods, takes a simple tale about marital infidelity and turns it into something complex and fascinating. Although he leaves a trail of clues implying that this is to be another of his homages to Fyodor Dostoevsky, the film really turns out to be Allen's own version of Theodore Dreiser's ""An American Tragedy"" (albeit set in England, perhaps to throw us off the scent). The parallels between the two works are not perfect, of course - in fact they often seem to be intentionally inverted - but they are close enough to make us wonder if Allen did, indeed, do it all on purpose.<br/><br/>Jonathan Rhys-Meyers plays Chris Wilton, a down-on-his-luck social climber who marries into wealth but longs for the passion he finds with another woman. Chris is a professional tennis player who decides to leave the circuit when he realizes he hasn't the skill to compete with the real pros. Taking a job as an instructor at a posh, highly exclusive tennis club, Chris finds himself wining and dining with the rich and famous after one of his pupils, Tom Hewett, takes a liking to him and introduces Chris to his snooty but accepting family. Chris begins to date Tom's warmhearted sister, Chloe, but he is really smitten by an aspiring American actress, Nola, who just happens to be Tom's fiancé. Chris makes the mistake of marrying Chloe before Tom and Nola call off their engagement and go their separate ways. The fact that Nola is free but he is not doesn't deter Chris from pursing an affair with the woman who provides all the passion and excitement his loving but boring wife cannot. But Chris soon discovers that carrying on an affair can result in a life filled with secrecy, lies, guilt and self-loathing. And when the going gets to be just a bit too much for our hero to handlewell, there's always that ""final solution"" lurking in the wings, as many an earlier adulterer has discovered to his everlasting regret.<br/><br/>""Match Point"" starts off very slowly and seems at first as if it will be just another tale of adultery and unrequited love. Yet, Allen really knows how to draw us into Chris' predicament, so that, by about halfway into the film, we feel as enmeshed in his seemingly irreconcilable dilemma as he himself is. Torn between the wealth and position he has as Chloe's husband and the love he feels for the relatively impoverished Nola, Chris is frozen into a state of paralyzing indecisiveness, his every waking moment a tormenting hell of fear and gathering dread as he keeps waiting in breathless anticipation for that other shoe to drop. It isn't until the ""other woman"" becomes more of a burden than his clinging wife that Chris can finally launch into action. This turnabout in the screenplay might strike many in the audience as arbitrary and implausible and there is certainly a case to be made for that. But if you can go with the flow, you will be delighted by all the little ironies Allen throws at us in the final stages of the story, which help to underline the filmmaker's thesis that, for all the efforts we make to control our lives, The Fickle Finger of Fate - or in this case a tennis ball precariously balancing on the top of a net trying to figure out which way to fall - always has the final word.<br/><br/>Allen has written dialogue that is incisive, intelligent and literate, and the performances he's drawn from the likes of Rhys-Meyers, Goode, Emily Mortimer, Scarlett Johannson and Penelope Wilton are superb down to the tiniest detail. Allen keeps his camera tightly focused on his characters, rarely pulling away from them much beyond a middle distance, keeping us firmly locked in the near-claustrophobic drama. Here is a movie that demands patience at the beginning but that really sneaks up on you the longer you watch it.<br/><br/>Guided by the hands of a master, ""Match Point"" is one of Allen's finest films in years."
"gpmovie","10","428","662","27 May 2005"," Masterpiece
","I was lucky enough to see this film at the Cannes Film Festival recently where it screened out of competition. Being a Woody Allen fan, I was just hoping the film would be OK and not a disaster like some of his most recent films. Boy, was I surprised! MATCH POINT is easily his best film since CRIMES AND MISDEMEANOURS and once of his best ever. In his first foray out of Manhattan and into London, you would have thought he had lived there all his life. This film is a masterpiece and is a sure bet to win critical acclaim and many awards. Jonathan Rhys Meyers is a revelation and finally lands a role of a lifetime as a young man who enters the world of the wealthy elite and would do anything to stay there. Scarlett Johansson has never looked as sultry and sexy as she does here playing the cool femme fatale. The film is beautifully structured and the performances by all and sundry are exemplary. Emily Mortimer and Brian Cox stand out among the supporting cast. The film has so many layers and so many unexpected twists that this is obviously the work of a genius director in full flight.<br/><br/>What can I say. The best way to see this film is without knowing too much about it as I did and you will come away from it declaring that Woody Allen is still alive and kicking and still able to make a masterpiece even after all these years."
"newjerseymoviefanrob","10","112","165","25 January 2006"," Allen discovers new terrain and creates his most ambitious film in years
","It's been said, but for a while one of the best filmmakers of the 20th century has been staggering with mediocre films not nearly up to his potential. But finally Allen has returned to the game with a subtle but perfectly done thriller which allows him to reinvent himself and discover new terrain like a brand new filmmaker.<br/><br/>Match Point offers a simple but powerful message that luck plays a huge part in everyday life which to a major extent is true. Luck plays a huge part in Chris Wiltons life when he gets a job as a tennis trainer at a fancy club and meets Tom, the son of a rich business man. Tom invites Chris to an opera where he meets Chloe, the sister of Tom. From there, Chris and Chloe start to date and Chris, a small and unwealthy man, gets introduced to high society life. He's offered a high stakes job, a personal driver, etc, just to bring happiness into the life of Chloe.<br/><br/>Chris is perfectly content until he meets the beautiful Nola, played by Scarlett Johansson. Nola is everything Chloe is not, exciting, extremely sexy, and unwealthy, which leads to Chris's dilemma. Nola and Chris begin an affair that leads to even more once Tom dumps Nola giving Chris the opportunity to live out all his sexual desires with a beautiful woman, but the high life of Chloe overpowers the little ambitions and lack of money. Match Point is about luck but also about choices made in life for personal enjoyment. Is it better to be rich and not completely satisfied or poor and happy? As a failure, Chris finds luck with Chloe's rich family willing to set him up with whatever he desires.<br/><br/>The film is very similar to Woody's 1989 masterpiece Crimes and Misdemeanors and it takes similar turns. Chris gets himself in the situation where he must choose from a small life with a woman he is satisfied and turned on by or choose a high society life with a woman he barely loves and lacks attraction to. I won't tell you what he chooses, but I will tell you the dilemma leads Allen to his most satisfying, tense, engaging film in over a decade.<br/><br/>It's great to see Allen take such a simple premise, used several times, and put all his trademark qualities into it mixed with a discovery of new terrain. Match Point is an engaging, entertaining film that gives you a taste of the high life and shows you what it can lead a man to. 10-10 for this excellent film by the great Woody Allen. Let's hope this is a revelation for Allen returning him to morality film-making."
"fdbjr","4","79","116","27 January 2006"," Masterpiece? Please!
","The first part of 'Match Point', about the drift of the hero into a passionate but adulterous affair, is pretty good. But even in these scenes there are problems. For example, there is a love making scene in a field in the rain. I guess it is supposed to resonate with unbridled passion - but all I could think of is how uncomfortable the lovers would be, in the cold English rain and damp prickly hay. I generally enjoy tasteful erotic scenes, but the concept is preposterous.<br/><br/>However, this is small potatoes compared to the utter idiocy of the criminal plot and subsequent police work. The hero steals a skeet gun belonging to his father-in-law to murder his mistress by staging a robbery. He kills a neighbor, and then his girlfriend, the notion being that she surprised the thief. Both times the gun makes a polite little pop. Did Allen or any of the critics who praised this movie ever consider what sort of sound a skeet rifle ACTUALLY makes? When fired indoors? The entire building would shake. The reverbations would be heard for blocks around. The murderer would be found out in two minutes. The whole concept is utter nonsense. Hitchcock never overlooked such realistic details in his movies.<br/><br/>But infinitely worse is the police work - the typical contempt of a New York intellectual for the solid common sense of everyday life. One of the detectives sees through the scheme. But he gives up when a drug addict is discovered with an item of jewelry from the theft. Allen actually believes the police are not going to wonder how such a derelict came to possess an expensive skeet rifle? Or what happened to it? Or will not run routine ballistic tests on the rifles the father owns, the hero's motive being known to them? That they will close out a double homicide on one flimsy, possibly coincidental bit of evidence? Do be serious. There is more thoughtfulness in the first five minutes of any 'Law and Order' episode than this.<br/><br/>This movie is a little better than Allen's recent stuff - the drift into adultery is really good. But the plot twist is just plain stupid. The critics are rooting so hard for Allen that they overlook the sheer dumbness of the plot. But it is indeed dumb - so dumb that it wreaks havoc with the movie."
"Quinoa1984","10","98","146","7 January 2006"," a serious channeling of Dostoyevsky via infidelity drama by Woody Allen
","Match Point is my favorite American-directed film of 2005. Woody Allen, coming off of hitting his stride again with Melinda and Melinda, goes back to his darker, dramatic side, and makes a story that may seem a little familiar, though not to his discredit. Woody borrows (some may say steal) elements from Fyodor Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment, one of the great novels of the 19th century (some may say ever written, I have read his work though not this yet), and transfuses it with subject matter that he's more than well acquainted with- the relationship drama. But un-like Love and Death, which was Allen's way of parodying the work of the author, this time he takes the work seriously, plunging the audience into the mind, conflicts, and outcome of the protagonist. That the performances by the actors involved, particularly the three main leads are top notch (Jonathan Rhys-Myers, Emily Mortimer, and Scarlett Johnasson in one of her best) brings full blood and flesh to Woody's strong skeleton of a film.<br/><br/>The story starts slow. Chris Wilton (Rhys-Myers) is an Irishman in London, a tennis instructor who could've gone pro. He meets Chloe (Mortimer) through her brother Tom (Matthew Goode) and they soon become close, close enough for marriage. Basically, he marries into an upper-class family where he's coaxed into becoming a businessman for the family. But during this he also meets Nola Rice (Scarlett Johansson), a struggling American actress, who's engaged to Tom. One thing leads to another, yada-yada, and Chris winds up in a big pickle as he's in a love-triangle between Chloe and Nola. Allen handles this dilemma with a powerful precision, by building up the relationships Chris has with each girl, and how there is not unbelievability in the set-ups. Nola is sensible and intelligent, if not altogether, while Chloe is caring and decent, if maybe too picture perfect for Chris. The dynamics are set-up so well, it leaves room for ample drama and suspense.<br/><br/>Allen, who has also been a playwright for decades, knows the way people interact like so, and how not to rush the situations and use tact with delicate scenes. There is also the element of Opera, which Chris sees with Chloe's family often, and the element of tennis. The analogies that both produce could possibly be very trite or cliché. It's not to say a couple of scenes are even cliché (ladies, you know you've seen quite a few movies with passionate kissing in the rain), but I even bought into those scenes. There is perhaps a certain manipulation that goes into these kinds of love stories, how much the audience can go with the inner conflict of our main character. But as the protagonist goes into a frame of mind that most may not be able to identify with, we're still with him all the way. And, perhaps, it's also because I love a good, solid infidelity story. Allen has here not only his best film in several years, but also likely his most suspenseful one.<br/><br/>Those who may not go with the sympathies &/or empathy for the characters may not like the film as much. Some have even criticized minor gripes with the film, like Rhys-Myers's unconvincing accent, or the over-usage of London's most famous landmarks. As an American, perhaps, I didn't mind certain things like these. When a filmmaker has this much trust in his script (and Woody, pushing 70 in making this, is not amateur), and has the right cast, it just takes off from there. To say I was on the edge of my seat through a good chunk of the third act is an under-statement and, at the core, was even cathartic in a way. It's the kind of film I would love to tell more people about, even if they think Woody is washed up after years of arguably less-than-great pictures. For some it might not even 'feel' like a Woody Allen movie, that at times it's a little 'slick'. It still is, however the work of an artist reaching further into his grab-bag with younger, exciting actors, and an interesting use of a (finally) new city."

Allen's British dialogues are refreshingly startling and I don't intend to spoil the pleasure of its perverse surprises by hinting at any of them. Just let me say that if you love cinema, rush to see it."
"shezan","1","154","245","5 December 2005"," Woody Allen has really, really, really lost it (mild spoilers)
","Well. And what a waste of 8 euros ""Match Point"" turned out to be. As it happens, Woody Allen couldn't get financing in the US, or at least without strings attached, so he's decided to go and milk the BBC instead. Which means, in effect, that he recycled a story he'd written for a New York setting straight into a London setting, without any attempt at any significant rewrite. And ""written"" is a loose term. ""An American Tragedy"" meets ""A Place In The Sun"" meets ""Room at the Top"" meets ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" meets (but let's not get carried away) ""Le Rouge et le Noir."" Ambitious poor boy courts aristocratic rich girl then gets torn between rich in-laws and poor girlfriend from the wrong side of the tracks. If you think this is too generic a summary, that's the whole point: ""Match Point"" is nothing but generic.<br/><br/>It's not just that Jonathan Rhys Meyers' young Irish tennis pro speaks like a 1950s BBC presenter without a hint of an explanation of how it came to him; it's that when he meets an old tennis acquaintance in the street, or when he bursts into a rage, his accent doesn't change. (Everybody in the movie speaks RP, except for the Scot-and-Cockney-coppers-as-comic-relief, and the property agent right at the beginning, probably because he was initially written as yammering in broad Brooklynese.) It's not just that sugar-daddy's country house is totally unconvincing if he's old money (wall-to-wall carpeting?), or his accent is if he's Alan Sugar. It's not just that somehow, I can't imagine a London copper calling someone a ""schmuck"", or a Sloane Ranger, however arty, mention that a couple is made in heaven because ""their neuroses match"". Or another Sloane boasting of getting good invitations because she was ""born in Belgravia."" Or that the country house set would welcome their daughter marrying a tennis instructor. Or that the cocktail-swilling son of the house, all public-school accent and Jeeves-and-Woosterish quips, could get away with calling even the hired help ""Hey, Irish"", meaning it to be affectionate. (Although the initial meeting between said son, played on automatic pilot by Matthew Goode, and JRM as his tennis coach at the Kensington Queen's Club, plays like nothing more than a gay pickup, all ""Oh, you like opera? My father gives a tonne of money to Covent Garden, can I take you to Traviata tomorrow night?"" for entirely too long for his sister to look like anything but a beard for the rest of the movie.) Or that even Richard Branson could just snap his fingers and said tennis pro becomes magically a business wizard. Or that a would-be American actress with only a commercial under her belt would audition for a part at the Royal Court.<br/><br/>It's that nobody has a real backstory, or even edges. (Scarlett Johansson does wonders with what little she's given. JRM is pretty - when he panics, you can't quite tell whether it's because he's afraid of handling a gun, or because he's just read the rest of the screenplay.) As for London, Allen tries for the postcard effect he perfected in ""Manhattan"" (complete with self-reference to the River Café shot), but he entirely misses the texture of the city: there isn't a single London scene set in a house, for instance, it's all flats (it's summer but Allen's London practically has no trees); people shop in Mayfair (at Aspreys and Ralph Lauren, natch), not Sloane Street; and when JRM, early in the movie, takes his posh totty for a romantic walk, it's to watch the changing of the guard at Buck House.<br/><br/>To be honest, there is a lovely plot twist right in the last five minutes.

","SJ and JRM obviously needed at least some direction from Woody Allen to develop their characters past the point of a teenage crush gone wrong. In their defense, it must be said that the plot was clunky and full of holes and the dialog was amateurish so they didn't have much to work with. Emily Mortimer and Matthew Goode did as much as they could with their one dimensional characters which was to be charming and sweet.<br/><br/>Woody Allen has done some less than great movies in recent years, but now he just seems to be going through the motions. Where's the clever dialog, the deep character studies and the intriguing plots and subplots that are hallmarks of his better work? The script and the direction seemed like the work of a college film major with a big budget. <br/><br/>The critics who are giving this movie over the top great reviews should watch ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" to see what a masterpiece by Woody Allen is really like."

","This film at first doesn't seem like a typical Woody Allen film but at the end you know it's one and why. While the story and theme is familiar, Mr Allen brings new perspective and avoids clichés. He goes to the themes he explored in ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" but without the Ingmar Bergman homage. Instead it's more fun and exciting to watch. I guess the young hot cast and new location doesn't seem like the usual Woody Allen film, even though he used young hot talents before. This one belongs to his best films which is good news to his fans. The cast is excellent but the supporting cast outshines the leads somehow. Matthew Goode made a strong impression and sure to become a star in the near future. I'm glad Woody Allen changed locations and used some of the best British actors for a change. I guess people who will read this comment, will already know about the plot, so I will avoid it. I watched the film at Cannes where it was well received by critics and the audience."

","I too am a great Woody Allen fan, and was very nervous about seeing his attempt at a 'serious' work. I'd read mixed reviews like everyone, and went fairly open-minded. After seeing this film I can not understand how it could garner a single positive review. Featuring the worst central performance I've seen in a long time (Rhys-Meyers) who gave his most wooden performance yet (and that really is saying something). A pretty boy and nothing more. The plot was bizarrely simple and well-worn, one-dimensional and utterly unengaging. Scarlett Johansson, bless her, tries but just looks ridiculous bringing such over top sultriness - the first time we see her, lighting a cigarette and giving the camera a Look made me laugh out loud. Completely devoid of humour, Allen has made a film about English Upper Class that he obviously knows nothing about. Attempts at intriguing themes of luck etc fall flat on their face with a big thud. For God's sake, don't encourage him to make more of this kind of cinema."
"Dan1863Sickles","3","52","81","27 January 2006"," Woody Allen Is A Serious Artist -- And We All Must Pay!
","A sleazy, blue collar tennis pro marries into a wealthy family -- only to risk it all for back-alley passion that swiftly turns to horror.<br/><br/>Woody Allen is telling an old story. Not only does he borrow shamelessly from Dreiser's classic novel An American Tragedy, (1925) but from modern films like MASQUERADE (1988) and THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY (1999).<br/><br/>Problem is, the cast and the script are not good enough to make the familiar material seem fresh, let alone gripping. When you watch THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY, the lush Italian setting and the casual cool of Jude Law's ""Dickie Greenleaf"" really sell you on the idea that the good life is worth killing for. But in this movie, the rich family are such a one-dimensional collection of yawning British stereotypes it's impossible to imagine any poor boy being tempted -- let alone captivated -- by their listless pleasures and sleepy little lives.<br/><br/>Then there's the hero. Jonathan Rhys Meyers is a total Joe Blow. He fails to make this creepy little social climber even remotely interesting. When Matt Damon played Tom Ripley, he did a brilliant job of making Ripley seem sweet and helpless at first --so you could like him, and also so you could see why he reaches his breaking point and starts fighting back. Even Rob Lowe in MASQUERADE was able to summon up a certain easy cool. His gigolo was a rugged sailor, a true competitor, and he fell in love with his target for real. (Very romantic.) More than that, he was a guy who got off on thinking fast and fooling the rich folks. But Joe Blow can't do that. He has zero sexual allure, zero danger, no soul. Just a blank stare and a pout.<br/><br/>Things only get worse when Scarlett Johanssen makes the scene. Not since Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman were scorching up the screen in their STARS WARS abomination have two sulky young stars so utterly lacked any sexual fire or intelligence. The difference is that George Lucas never said he understood sexual passion. And he never built his stories around desire. But in MATCH POINT everything depends on the idea that Joe Blow is willing to throw away everything --and I mean EVERYTHING -- just for more hot sex with his secret girlfriend.<br/><br/>Poor Scarlett Johannsen! She's not really that bad an actress. But she's in the hands of a director who is so old and tired and bored that he can't even begin to think about helping her create a character. Woody's idea of making a young woman ""sexy"" is to have her light up a cigarette. So disgusting! And worse than that, so out of date!<br/><br/>Scarlett's Nola Rice is nothing but a plot contrivance. One minute she's a crude, trash-talking slut, a gold digger bragging that she can bag any man. Then suddenly she's a good girl, toiling away in a cozy little shop and aching for her man to come ""home"" to her instead of going back to his wife. Huh??!??! Did Woody even TRY to explain this character to Scarlett? I don't think so, because she looks really confused (and sleepy) all the time, like a young actress who's been partying a bit too hard while shooting overseas.<br/><br/>At any rate, the movie all boils down to Joe Blow suddenly being so desperate and obsessed that he just has to kill someone. Now, the truth is he could have killed the ENTIRE CAST by the last half hour and the whole audience would have just turned over and snored. Or stood up and cheered. But there are a couple of surprise twists at the end -- worth seeing just for the way they make you think. But on an emotional level, they don't involve anything sexy or exciting, like a happy ending. Woody Allen is above that sort of thing.<br/><br/>Woody Allen is a serious artist -- and we all must pay!"

","1) As the film progressed it became hard to believe that the main male character, Chris Wilton,as portrayed by J.R. Meyers, was so complex and driven that he would murder two people to sustain his life. I think the script was OK on this but the casting wasn't. 2) The planning/execution of the murders as filmed was a class b movie. The suspense! Will he get caught in the planning or the act!? 2a) During the murders, committed with a shotgun (loud noise folks!), no movie neighbor could hear the gunshot. Why? Because the soundtrack was playing operatic music quite loudly. BUT FOLKS, THIS WAS THE SOUNDTRACK, NOT REAL AMBIENT SOUND. A Monty Python influence perhaps? 3) Without explanation the killer carries incriminating evidence with him from the city to the country He couldn't go to the Thames at night and dump the stuff? 4) With poetic license heavily imposed, the killer finds the ring of a victim he's killed and doesn't do a good job throwing it into the river. It bounces on the river's railing (tennis anyone?) and ends up on the walkway. WHERE A TO-BE MURDERED JUNKY FROM THE EARLIER SCENE OF THE TWO MURDERS MIRACULOUSLY FINDS IT. My goodness, what a coincidence! Miscellaneous: a)Other critiques have mentioned the initial Chris and Nola sex scene and I would underline their criticism: in broad daylight, during that rainstorm, would even that kind of passion permit the two of them to Let's Do It In The Road? Without a fear of being seen? I don't think so. b)Tired, tired, tired was the Son-in-law Also Rises cliché. What the hell did he do at father-in-law's firm? c)The two cops at the end were almost cartoon-like in being added to flesh out the ""irony"" of the story. Reminded me of Bugs Bunny cartoons where Bugs reaches into a pouch and pulls out a deus ex machina-like invention.<br/><br/>But other than the above I loved the movie."
"shanejamesbordas","1","37","57","24 August 2006"," Woody, It Might Be Time to Go Out to Pasture...
","A problematic film for long-time Woody Allen fans.<br/><br/>Essentially, this is the Hallmark card version of Crimes and Misdemeanors (via An American Tragedy, A Place in the Sun, Room at the Top and many others) which provides as much sustenance as gorging on angel-food cake. There are so many miscalculations and misjudgements that the mind reels in the attempt to list them. For starters, how can a director as experienced and spoilt for choice as Woody Allen frame an entire film around a performer who can't act? Jonathan Rhys Meyers is so unsure of himself that even his accent isn't credible although he's only required to play an Irishman which, in reality, he is! It's logical that an aspirant attempting to ingratiate himself with the Upper Class (which he seems to manage in just a few seconds, at most) would purposely modify his accent to fit in but anyone with half an ear will be distracted by the strange melange that issues forth even in the earliest moments of the film. Put that together with the numerous pouts and bizarre facial ticks that Allen's camera devotedly captures (again, why so many long shots and close ups on a performer who can't deliver the goods?) which supposedly constitute for projection of deep inner conflict and you have something approximating an automaton being controlled via faulty wiring. This is a deeply embarrassing and misguided performance that some might see as mysterious or enigmatic but, to the perceptive viewer, remains woefully inadequate. Scarlett Johansson fares somewhat better by at least consistently sounding like the New Yorker that she is but the role does seem out of her current emotional depth. Allen's view of her character, at least, is the most three-dimensional in the film possibly because he is writing about things closer to home. The rest of the cast consist of reliable British actors who have severely underwritten and badly observed parts (Brian Cox's monotone father tends to grate, as does the ludicrously plummy brother and sister) or distracting cameos by well known TV performers who have seemingly wrangled themselves a bit of immortality by being in a Woody film.<br/><br/>London itself is reduced to a cardboard cutout Manhattan-like island where people always bump into each other (whether it be in Mayfair shopping for Casmere jumpers or casually hanging out at the Tate Modern), and every move made includes the incorporation of some major landmark in the background. If Woody had decided to pay homage to Rene Clair's wonderful surrealist film 'Paris Qi Dort' (about a man who lives at the top of the Eiffel Tower) by having his main character find a great flat inside Big Ben, I wouldn't have been any less convinced.<br/><br/>As for the dialogue, the less said the better. A major point (not much discussed in other reviews) is that, at over 2 hours, this is his longest film. He also, pretty much, has the least to say in it. It's a long way down from 'Another Woman' and his other idea rich 'serious' films which barely approached the 90 minute barrier. Possibly the only way to endure this particular turkey is to imagine it's a 'Love And Death' style comedy and that Woody is actually sending the whole thing up. <br/><br/>Enthusiasts of Woody Allen's work will be severely shell-shocked to see how badly their idol has fallen, even in light of his post 'Sweet & Lowdown' (the last major work) output. Woody, please, either wait till you have something to say (and know how to say it) or take up gardening or something. Please!"

","I watched this film in Dublin. Where to begin, with criticism? Perhaps the first point to note is the atrociously stilted dialogue. Is that what was intended? Did Woody Allen think it was supposed to be funny/ironic? All I can say is that the few laughs that this movie did get were of a very uncertain nature; the audience--more often than not--didn't seem to know whether they laughing with the movie, or at it.<br/><br/>The crime that occurs is so out of character that it is really quite absurd. But Roger Ebert says: ""Let us talk instead in terms of the underlying philosophical issues. To what degree are we prepared to set aside our moral qualms in order to indulge in greed and selfishness?"" Now, that really is making a silk purse out of a sow's ear!<br/><br/>The critics who have praised this movie seem to me to have read far too much into it. It seems to me that the whole thing was a shaggy-dog story that led up to one big joke at the end, and it wasn't worth the wait as far as I was concerned. However it is clear that most reviewers in IMDb think otherwise. Has the world gone mad?!"

","After reading all the hype about this film, I had very high hopes for it. Unfortunately, the end result was very, very disappointing. First of all, the plot is an extended variation/rehash of the tragic plot line of Crimes and Misdemeanours. So despite the London backdrop to the story, again nearly nothing new under the sun. Secondly, the movie is SLOW. Almost nothing happens for a very long time, and there are several extremely short scenes which could have been removed without the slightest impact on the storyline. Some scenes have dreadful explanatory dialogue, while others do sparkle (the ping-pong scene, for instance). Third, Rhys-Myers is extremely uneven. Sometimes his performance is riveting (epescially during the third act), sometimes it is stilted and mannered to an extreme. I kept expecting this to be for some sort of story reason, but no such luck. Four, the potential of the plot is underdeveloped. There were tons of possibilities for further complications and obstacles to confront Rhys-Myers with, but they were all ignored. Just when the film becomes interesting, it ends. Five, the resolution of the plot is not believable. And this mainly due to exceptional stupidity from the London Police. In real life, a cop like James Nesbitt would not give up his investigation immediately - he would stay on the scent, try to trap his suspect, look for clues (DNA, gun) etc. Allen wants the punchline about the role of fate to drive the entire film, and sacrifices both character and suspension of disbelief to this end. That's lousy writing. Six, Scarlett Johansson's character becomes intensely unlikeable, although her expectations and desires in the story are justified and basically honest. <br/><br/>In short, Woody Allen is nowhere near on top form again. The sad reality is that he probably never again will be..."
"perica-43151","9","8","10","6 January 2019"," A very personal Woody Allen film
","Woody Allen has made a very similar movie in the past, Crimes and Misdemeanors. Both movies are essentially this author's take on Dostoevsky and his ""Crime and punishment"", and might be called ""Crime and no punishment"" and contain a nearly identical pondering on the nature of conscience and how easy it is in fact to live with murder, as many people in the west, especially in the upper echelons of society, indeed do, both figuratively and, in many cases, literally, weather it is in the world of politics, military aggressions (the word ""collateral damage"" comes in this movie in the end spoken by one of the victims) or ordinary life, with extreme western hypocrisy as a great ""resource"" to ease the way. The similarities of the two movies (almost the same murder situation, and the same result, similar motives), and the director's penchant for autobiographical elements as inspiration, makes one wonder what aspects of his shady past gave rise to this story redone like this again and again. This movie follows more closely ""Crime and punishment"" and there is even an old (but being he is anti-Dostoevsky, a poor one) lady that gets offed like a rat in a peanut butter trap.<br/><br/>The characters in this story involve some rich inbred British people, an Irish protagonist (fittingly), and a femme fatale in its American version (Scarlet ""Lucy"" Johansson), a failed actress but worth every cent in other, less reputable, domains, according to her own words. Faithful to the stereotypes, Irish turn out to have terroristic inclinations (movie was sponsored by BBC after all), American is ""innocent"" and ""likable"", British are boring, and there is even a Scottish detective (of Scotland Yard?!) who figures it all out, but to no avail, because blind luck was on the side of happiness of the elite British cream (who had been joined by another worthy member set in their standards of ""morality"").<br/><br/>This, at last, is a new element to the story. Luck. In the beginning, we have a scene where a tennis ball hits the net, and which side - by luck - it ends up on, determines outcome of the game. Very similar scene in the end in turn also determines the final outcome, i.e. ""happy ending"" which is in fact a more realistic version of most ""happy endings"" and ""missions accomplished"" in the culture that did not bring us Dostoevsky, but did come up with infected blankets and rationalizations, conformism and hypocrisy to make it easier to quell whatever conscience is left in whoever is still not a sociopath. And brought us Woody Allen, with brilliant wit and experiences to match the point."

Scarlett gives probably the worst performance of her life, and the 10 minutes of actual interesting footage is not enough to pull it off. Much of the dialogue between characters is not necessary, and has nothing to do with the progression of the film.

","As a long time Woody Allen addict, I never thought I would complain that he had made a bad movie, but sadly that day has arrived. I heard him interviewed on the BBC saying how easy it had been to relocate from his familiar territory in New York and the Hamptons to London and the Home Counties, and I suspect that is where the problem lies. He has delivered a shallow, picture postcard view of England, and an outsider's half-baked idea of social class in England. As a Londoner, I say that if he would stick to the NY settings he knows so intimately, we Brits would continue flocking to his movies and loving them. What's worse (and probably connected to the first problem) the acting and direction feel painfully slow and stilted. And why, in the scenes at the Opera House, were the performances accompanied by a piano, not an orchestra? Would the budget not stretch to paying the orchestra? A trivial point, perhaps, but it distracted me. Redeeming points: a nice performance by the lovely Scarlett Johansson and an interesting plot twist towards the end. But I have rarely left a cinema feeling so deflated!"

","Unlike many of Allen's movies, I cannot say that i found watching match point continuously enjoyable. Instead, it was an intense experience. However, since watching the film, i have found myself unable to stop thinking about the story and the characters in all its layers.<br/><br/>The start was disappointing. I was beginning to suspect that perhaps the film was being sponsored by the tourist board. Most Londoners would cringe at the picture postcard name dropping, such as the Saatchi gallery and the Tate Modern.<br/><br/>I was particularly impressed by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, who i had only seen before in a minor role in the Beckham movie. He was extremely believable and had excellent chemistry with Ms Johansson. He came across as good looking yet shifty, passionate yet cold, his speech was articulate yet artificial. Emily Mortimor, Brian Cox, Matthew Goode and obviously Scarlett Johansson were also very good.<br/><br/>There was no hint of overacting or over-dramatisation. There was virtually no dialogue or scenes in the film that were irrelevant to the plot.<br/><br/>The film explored Allen's usual topics of love and fidelity, replacing the New York set with upper class society. He also explored the concept of luck versus skill as well as nepotism and the English class system.<br/><br/>I don't think that Jonathan's character was intentionally either bad or social climbing. Events were happening to him as much as he was making them happen. He did not seek the good life and for much of the film was battling between the wish to maintain it and his feelings for Nola. The point where he made his decision on this was believable but his solution was a bit of an overkill. Despite his calculating act, i cant believe that many viewers actually wanted him to get caught.<br/><br/>Match Point has obvious similarities with Crimes and Misdemeanors. Both Martin Landau and Jonathan chose the dangerous yet lazy option of dealing with the other woman who is getting desperate and threatening their perfect lives. In both cases this is an extraordinary act committed by ordinary people. As we entered the final third of the film, Woody Allen fans were left wondering whether he would let the criminal get away with it again. I don't know what it says about Allen or his view on justice that he has done this in two films. Maybe this is a more realistic depiction of crime, where there is not always a Poirot or Columbo following you; break in, drugs taken, case closed.<br/><br/>There were a few tricks at the end to put us off the track. Bumping into a neighbour on the way out of the house. Assuming that the ring falling short of the Thames was bad for Jonathan. Hints about the father in laws shotguns that could have easily been forensically tied to the murder and of course the dynamics between the two detectives.<br/><br/>Overall, a refreshing change of scenery and theme from Allen.

","In this film Woody Allen does for present day London roughly what Dick van Dyke did for cockney chimney sweeps in Mary Poppins - that is, strike an almost unending series of false notes. Jonathan Rhys Myers plays Chris Wilton, a tennis pro whose every gesture suggests privilege; we are asked to believe he comes from a poor Irish background. The Hewitts, the family with whom he becomes involved, do not work as individuals, and do not work as a family. So many little things aren't right. Mrs H dresses like a woman a couple of social classes below her, for example. The portrayal of business life is also a travesty. Mr H has the general demeanour of an antiques dealer, but the plot has him run a string of companies (called Hewitt Inc, though of course British firms are plcs) where he has no problems installing his son-in-law and giving him the sort of car and chauffeur that would not normally go to anyone below board level in a FTSE-100 firm - if then. Daughter Chloe simply sets up an art gallery in one of the smartest parts of London - Emily Mortimer who plays her and comes from this sort of milieu really should have known better.<br/><br/>As for the plot, others have commented on its shortcomings. Still, however hard to believe, it did carry me through to the end. And some of the cast and settings were nice to look at, and the sound track wasn't unpleasant - though I couldn't really work out the justification for it.

I was not prepared for the flat, slow, boring, by the numbers script, that Allen lays out in Match Point.<br/><br/>It's as if a guy suddenly decided one day to write a show about 'rich people', but had never met one outside of a drawing room comedy. Allen simply has no interest in a film noir or erotic thriller or whatever you wish to call this trifle. The lighting is never moody, on the other hand, it's bright and sharply lit. The tension is certainly lacking in the acting. It all seems to be happening on a bad, old TV show. Wow are some people jumping up and down about the film? I think maybe the fact that Allen tells a story, albeit a very structured, limp one that he has no feeling for. It remeinds me of Kubrick's last film, Eyes Wide Shut. Kubrick couldn't or wouldn't shoot in NY, so he just built in the UK. Allen goes to the UK, but he might as well have stayed in NY. It's a crazy movie. The audience is always nine steps ahead of the doddering characters. What exactly is Brian Cox playing? He got rich by constantly giving away his money and having zero ability to gauge character? It's like a character in an earlier, funnier Allen film, suddenly forced to play it straight.

","I had not read any reviews or seen a trailer before watching the movie, so I was seeing it with an open mind. I suppose my overall impression was that it was an interesting concept, and it certainly held my interest throughout, but there were certain annoying details which grated a little:<br/><br/><ul><li>First of all, the main character is supposedly from an Irish working class background, but speaks with an English upper-class accent, and it is never explained how this came about. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Although he's supposedly charming, you just don't see enough of him actually being charming to make it at all credible that his albeit naive wife doesn't realize he's having an affair.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>He works in a company closely connected with his father-in-law yet somehow manages to get away with using his work as a series of excuses for his absence, despite having a secretary and a driver who must surely have realized he was up to something. Perhaps he was charming or bribing them but again we never see this explanation.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>His mistress somehow fails to spot that he's using every cliché in the ""man not really intending to leave his wife for his mistress"" handbook.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The scene where the two policemen discuss their thoughts on the crime seemed incredibly unrealistic - Woody Allen could have done with watching some of the numerous cop shows on British TV to make this dialog less clunky.

It was only beaten by the dialogue - usually a sure thing in WA movies - which seemed to have been written by some fantasising 15 year old. <br/><br/>Normally we find IMDb ratings to be a fair indication of whether a film is worth the time, but on this occasion cannot understand who would rate this film highly. My only thought is that it can only be getting votes from people who would love to come to England and think this is what it is really like over here.<br/><br/>Woody Allen should stick to playing his saxophone and watch his old classics on VHS.

","This film is horrible. There is no chemistry between any of the characters. It is dull and there doesn't seem to be any meaning at all, or reason. It's hard to care about any of the characters. The dialog is so written, as in, it seems as if the actors are reading written lines. The entire film seems as if it's a rehearsal rather than a film. The story centers on a young man who is a tennis instructor for the rich and then he marries into a very nice (much too nice) rich family. He then, for no apparent reason other than lust, has an affair with an American actress, girlfriend of his brother-in-law. Then she starts to get clingy and so he kills her. That's that. First though he kills an old lady and then he kills her to make it seem like a robbery. But we get no idea, or real reason, why he has to do all this just to keep his marriage, since he seems, throughout this entire overlong movie, to hate his wife. This film is compared to 'Crimes and Misdemeanors' because of the basic theme, and that is a travesty. 'Crimes and Misdemeaners' is one of the best films of all time, while this film is one of the worst, by Woody or anyone. It's just a horrible, boring nightmare. And we have to sit through the exact same dialog and themes that Woody has put into way too many films, things like: luck is the meaning of life, faith is meaningless, and science dictates everything we know. It just gets tiring, especially hearing these deep themes being spoken by people in their twenties, who would never, ever, ever speak this way. Woody's dialog seems more fit to sixty year old Aristocrats, not twenty-something rich airheads. This movie is horrific. Avoid it at any cost."

","Sorry, just thought this was awful. It was obviously trying to make some points, but trying way too hard. For example, the scenes with the detectives felt like they were talking directly to the camera. You could summarize the whole film with ""the upper class live privileged lives."" The body of the film was various actors mooing along these lines. And I would have found it a much better film if it hadn't been a murder film, which is cheap to resort to for making a point.<br/><br/>I like Woody Allen's work (even when he plays the same neurotic character over and over again), but every time he tries to make a serious crime film, this happens.

"TheLittleSongbird","7","3","3","23 March 2014"," A good if not great Woody Allen film
","Along with Interiors(in a way), Match Point seems to be one of Woody Allen's most divisive films and that's understandable. With me, it is good but not great, interesting but Allen has done better(much worse as well). The ending was surprising which wasn't a problem, but it was also much too rushed and ambiguous, at odds with the rest of the pacing of the film. Jonathan Rhys Meyers and the script also didn't come across as consistent to me. Meyers is handsome and does make for a creepy sleaze in some parts of the film but at other points he underplays so much that he comes across as one-note. The script does have a very neat and healthy balance of sporting analogies and psychological questions, beautifully observed in distinctive Woody Allen fashion, unfortunately there are some clumsy moments and some out-of-place mordant humour(if anyone disagrees that's fine, it's just personal taste). The London locations, it's entertaining spotting the familiar ones, look splendid though and the filming reflects the dark, gritty nature of the story very effectively. The score is haunting, giving an ominous tone to scenes in need of it, and opera enthusiasts will love the healthy dose of opera excerpts throughout(though you wished they had a grander approach). The story even with the clear influence of Allen's 1989 masterpiece Crimes and Misdemeanours(a much better film) is an absorbing one, despite much of it being a slow-burner. Especially in the second half which takes a more violent turn without feeling mismatched. The gritty atmosphere worked in the story's favour as did the neatly interwoven plot points and story layers(the romance did have some resonating moments), and the characters as ever with Allen had a fair amount of realism though Chris was not very easy often to root for. Allen directs with control and assurance, though he's at his best in comedy-dramas like a lot of his films from the late 70s all the way through to the early 90s. With the acting, while Rhys Meyers didn't always convince, the largely British do some fine work, especially Matthew Goode and Brian Cox- James Nesbitt has been much better though- and Scarlett Johnansson in sultry, compassionate mode is superbly cast. Overall, interesting film and a good one(at its best even very good), but not great, Woody Allen has done better. 7/10 Bethany Cox"

","I haven't seen many of Woody Allen's movies, this was actually my third, after the classic Annie Hall & the more recent comic mystery Scoop, but i can already say that every single movie was entertaining & yet thoughtful from a certain angle, harmonizing the two is a difficult task for most story tellers, but Woody Allen does it with the ease of a maestro. The way the story builds, from innocence to sin & then an almost surreal sequence toward the end of the movie, is intriguing to watch. Its never predictable, even if anyone watches the movie knowing how it would end,they wouldn't really know or believe how it goes. Full entertainment, yet not cheap or conventional, neither is it over intellectualized. This is good cinema."
"ThreeSadTigers","Null","3","3","29 December 2007"," Crimes and Misdemeanours, revisited.
","Match Point brings Woody Allen back to the dark, dramatic, moralistic territory of his best film, 1988's Crimes and Misdemeanours, as he weaves a bleakly bitter tale that is one part Dickens and one part Dostoyevsky to look at the notions of luck and the luckless. Many have viewed it as a return to form for the filmmaker - citing it as his best film in more than a decade - whilst others have seen it as an unmitigated failure. Where you stand on the issue will really be down to personal taste. If you tend to check your watch when a film goes ten minutes without a car chase, or roll your eyes at scenes of characters (get this) talking, then you might want to give it a miss. However, if you like a film to offer a deep and dramatic set-up that isn't afraid to put aside notions of entertainment to get across a serious message then by all means, read on.<br/><br/>The film deals with ideas of class and what it takes to negotiate the class system in order to scale the social ladder. The central character is Chris; a working class lad from Ireland, who began his professional career as a teenager, washing cars for a local business man. Eventually, he bluffed his way onto the tennis courts where he managed to become a fairly gifted and much-talked about newcomer. After a few decent match performances, he returns to London and establishes himself as a coach at an upper class spa. Here, he meets Tom Hewitt, the only son of a wealthy Industrialist. The two become friends and eventually Chris meets Tom's sister Chloe. He also meets Tom's seductive American girlfriend Nola. Here the central narrative ark of the film is developed, with Chris entering into a proper relationship with Chole - whose father makes sure he gets the best job, the best apartment and a guaranteed shot at an all together more comfortable way of life - as well as beginning a secret affair with the sexual and sensual Nola. As the film moves toward its final act, Chris has to decide whether to stay with a wife he is only mildly attracted to (and remain in the life he has subsequently become accustomed to) or go for the more exciting Nola (and thus, sacrifice the trendy flat, the chauffeur, the good job and high salary, etc).<br/><br/>Amongst this central story there are the aforementioned allusions to the class system, to the nature of love and morality, and more importantly, the central notion of luck and the luckless. The film takes a turn for an altogether darker tone towards the end, which again, is in keeping with some of Allen's best work, for example, his flawed though no less interesting dramatic trilogy of Interiors, September and Another Woman, as well as masterworks like The Purple Rose of Cairo, Crimes and Misdemeanours, and Husbands and Wives. Unlike those films, which used cinematic conventions and references, Match Point tends to use literary conventions. The central allusions to Dostoyevsky are extremely pertinent, particularly in the self-conscious and self-aware ""twist"" towards the end of the film, which, I suppose, could easily be seen as something approaching a 'deus-ex-machina', as Allen (without giving too much away), twists the acceptable course of events to set up a different way of thinking (again, without giving too much away, I'm talking specifically about the police officers who appear at the end) that helps to further his philosophical discussion, as opposed to ending the film on a dramatic or entertaining note.<br/><br/>As I noted earlier, this won't be a film for everyone. The dialog has intent, so therefore can be a little stagy to those expecting something more naturalistic. Also, the characters are very cold, as is the world that they inhabit. In this respect, the film was reminiscent of Stanley Kubrick's final film Eyes Wide Shut, in the respect that both films unfold in strangely cold and clinical environments that seems more like a subconscious fabrication; and that's not mentioning the narrative similarity in tracing one man's journey into his own (dark) subconscious (incidentally, if you hated Eyes Wide Shut, you may very well hate this). Unlike most viewers, the depiction of central London, whether a distortion or not, matters not to me. I love Godard, but certainly don't expect the Paris depicted in Breathless or A Woman is A Woman to have looked anything like the actual Paris of 1961, just as I don't accept any of Allen's more characteristic New York movies to be indicative of life in that particular city. This is not a documentary; it's a film and a film with a moral message.<br/><br/>Allen, throughout, makes a number of valid points about the role of luck in relation to the philosophy that we ""create our own good fortune"", with the closing twist only highlighting a glaring miscarriage of justice which sadly, happens all too often in everyday life. Match Point is a film in which everything seems deliberate and nothing is accidental. The walking stereotypes that masquerade as the English upper classes are right out of an Evelyn Waugh novel, which is intended to juxtapose against Nola's exotic, trailer-trash Americana and Chris's romanticised ""James Joyce meets Tom Ripley"". Artfully shot, austere and deliberately paced, Match Point seemed to me like the kind of film that could have been made between 1966 and 1975 by filmmakers like Jean Luc Godard, Rainer Werner Fassbinder, or Lindsay Anderson. As I've said before, it won't be to all tastes, but those interested in real cinema that doesn't pander to notions of entertainment or generic convention might want to give it a try."
"billion_mucks","6","3","3","27 November 2007"," Least Personal Allen Plays Smart
","Woody Allen has defined a genre that might well suit the writer's catharsis, a little bit more outrageous with Charlie Kauffman, in which characters digress into their feelings and avoid all kind of physical action. Woody used to depict in scene his alter ego to structure and open all what he has in mind in more than an intellectual recipe. Cinematographically in his sunset (or not so) he shines a smart, well crafted story about an ex-tennis player that is involved in the London elite as well in trouble and dead ends.<br/><br/>His film may pass reliably as a true story, filmed in the moment as things are factual and the filming is just a witnessing in the story. He plays fairly well with that perspective: he makes it credible thanks to great, felt performances and a script that makes it's way through rigorous drafting to look natural and improvised. Allen here has the time to impose succulent in betweens and innuendos, fantastic metaphors and intelligent, thoughtful ramifications of the human condition. His cinematography is slow moving, yet smooth, just like drinking wine. Elitesque and superb. There is fire between the young couple of mains, where Woody tries to stay fresh no matter the years. <br/><br/>""Match Point"" is Woody's most commercial film, and he defined him as his best. He may be proud all over his meditated script and his first rate direction, but maybe audience (us) will prefer his innovated, spicy and emotional older pictures."

","Story is about a poor boy who came to London for being a successful tennis player,instead he made a romantic,Criminal living. Allen did an outstanding job making the whole story about relationships of an Irish young man with 2 girls,one of them is his wife and the other got a crush on. I think these kind of romantic films should emphasize on the sex scenes which Match point did not,Match point was a PG 13 about life and sex for example when Chris(Jonathan Rhys Meyers)is Doing some massages to nola(Scarlett Johansson),Camera just goes for another angle and break down the mood of that particular scene. Being Lucky a is Prosedure which happened to Chris And i think that was the bright side of the movie because some parts of the screenplay had talked about it. There's a point which is not great,story begins with a Match point stuff in Tennis,it's kind of related to the movie at some point,although it's not. in my opinion The whole thing Ends up in Nonsense,I mean there is not any Moral fiber that avoids me or anyone else to do the same thing that Chris Was idiotically done.and one thing more is Chris and his wife were both boring and played unnaturally,Chloe was senseless and annoying. but in a general look that was the best that Allen could have done and I liked that."

Nola reappears and Chris begins an affair with her promising that he will leave his wife. This goes on for a while and then the movie made a fantastic turn which is the reason I gave it seven out of ten stars. For the last hour or so of the film I was on the edge of my seat, biting my nails having absolutely no idea what to expect next. I would not say it is the most original movie I have ever seen but it is certainly very entertaining and suspenseful. Before I got married I found myself in similar situations wherein I was involved with two women trying to keep one from the other. These always end bad and it always blows up in your face which is one of the reasons why its better to leave someone then to have an affair. For Chris on the other hand, things work out a little differently. For what it's worth I liked this movie."
"Mashi69","7","3","3","26 July 2006"," A crime without punishment and a Woody Allen without wood
","I'm being fair with Allen's movie and voting a 7 just because he's been able after so many attempts to FINALLY ""elaborate the mourning"" for his wrecked marriage and difficult life over the last decade in the manner that real artists do: by hiding, rather than showing.<br/><br/>He really was off the target in his last... how many? 4? 5? 6 movies? when he showed unable to abandon his by now stereotyped querulous, paranoid and irritating character who talked and talked without getting never to the core of things.<br/><br/>Yet of the three keywords he's been only able to show the ""obsession"" part. Btw, what have you perceived to be the main character's obsession? Scarlett Johansson or Emily Mortimer? I believe it is Rhys Meyers' wife and her craving for pregnancy that becomes the real obsession. A life in the form of a gilded trap for a honest and candid Irish Paddy. Both Passion and Temptation are more or less left on the background.<br/><br/>A huge note of blame for the way Allen tries to stick by force some Dostoevskji in the story. It takes more than showing the cover of a book and kill two women to even scratch the surface of that endless research of Good and the struggle between ideas and deeds that obsessed the Russian titan throughout his work.<br/><br/>What is Rhys Meyers ""higher design"" that he mumbles when dreaming the women he killed? It is not clear... perhaps the fact that he will pretend to love his wife to make her happy. Only in this sense Allen becomes Dostoevskjian: ""Crime without punishment"" read wrongly one of the DVD extra... wrongly because his punishment and redemption is there; his wife."
"Kevin_Maness","6","3","3","8 June 2006"," almost, but not quite, the Woody Allen we know and love (and miss) so much...
","I heard a lot of hype about Woody Allen's most recent film, Match Point. So I was really looking forward to watching it. Finally, I did, but although the film was OK, I was rather disappointed.<br/><br/>First, let me say that I am a Woody Allen fan, although I've lost interest in his recent work. I think I've seen most of his movies up through Small Time Crooks, but that one was so bad that I decided to read reviews of his next several films before investing the time and money in seeing them, and until Match Point I never saw a review that made me think I'd return to Woody. Melinda and Melinda seemed like a possibility, but I never got around to it. So, when Match Point made its way back to Oscar contention and scored on many critics' top movie lists for 2005, I decided to give it a go.<br/><br/>It wasn't bad. Overall, I liked the style and the acting, and there's no doubt that the story was fairly taut and suspenseful. I mean, I always felt pretty sure I knew what was going to happen, but at the same time I was aware that I could easily be surprised, so the tension mounted nicely as I watched the plot unfold slowly over 2 hours. That part I liked, and perhaps this is partly what makes some critics call the film Hitchcockian (that and its exploration into how evil a normal, everyday person can be).<br/><br/>But the film seemed to fail in several respects. For one, it seemed somewhat derivative. I've seen this movie before, not least in Allen's own oeuvre. I kept feeling like I was watching Crimes and Misdemeanors with younger characters, less overt philosophizing, and no comic relief. SPOILERS COMING UP, SO STOP READING IF YOU WANT TO PRESERVE THE MYSTERY. I mean, guy has affair, the ""other woman"" threatens to tell the wife, so the guy is finally backed into a position where killing the ""other woman"" seems to be his best bet since his legit life is too good to surrender. Along with this basic plot comes C&M's question (less overt here) about whether it would be better to be caught or to get away with such a crime.<br/><br/>Another movie that came to mind was the Talented Mr. Ripley. I actually liked that movie--perhaps more than it deserved--partly because I think Jude Law was quite good in the film, partly because I think it was an homage to Hitchcock in many respects, and I think it worked on that level. When I saw Chris Wilton reading up on Crime and Punishment (and its Cambridge Companion) and then heard that he used that material to get in with his girlfriend's pop, I thought, here's the poor kid conning his way into a wealthy and powerful family. It was clear that he didn't really care that much about Chloe at any point in the movie (I found this particularly affecting because I thought she was lovely, bright, and joyful--I would like to marry her myself!), which just emphasized his cynicism and ambition. But this aspect of the plot is strangely neglected. We actually come to know very little about Chris's background or his aspirations and intentions. So the murder plot is all we're left with, and although it works, it is not particularly interesting in and of itself.<br/><br/>Finally, there's Scarlett Johansson, who was very sexy in the movie, but that was more or less it. She seems to be getting a lot of attention in the movie world these days, but I have yet to see her act in any way that would merit that attention. I feel like her allure is more in the Lolita sense (after Lost in Translation)--she is alluring and provocative, but doesn't seem to have much range. Most of her lines were delivered in a husky monotone that left me a bit drowsy. The only thing about her character that I found easy to believe (aside from the notion that someone might want to shoot her with a large gun) was that she was having trouble finding work as an actor. What is it with her? What do people see in her besides another pretty face--one that is slightly atypical in its allure? Like I said, this movie is not bad--it's just not quite the great work that I was expecting after hearing the hype. Perhaps some of the critics, like me, are longing for the return of Woody Allen so deeply that they invested this movie with a little more import than it actually possessed. I'm still waiting for the real Woody Allen to please stand up."

I've never seen a Woody Allen film before in my life, so I wouldn't find myself being biased just because of the name behind the camera... and because of that, I can say that while the film was OK, it's nowhere near perfect.<br/><br/>The only thing I will really say about this film, without giving too much away is that what keeps this film from being truly great, is character and plot development. When I watched it, I felt that everything moved along a little bit too cleanly, and a little bit too much like a movie. Maybe that was the point... maybe it wasn't supposed to mimic life as much as I would have liked it to but, with the exception of the last 30 minutes of the film (which did keep me wondering what would happen... and held my attention), everything's cleanly cut, cleanly shot, and is the same married man has affair story... needs to/wants to end it....and not much more.<br/><br/>For a more interesting twist on this particular plot, and the consequences of it, see the masterful Diane Lane in ""unfaithful""... it's more raw, and hits the viewer's core a bit stronger than this piece, which might have worked better if released about 15-20 years ago."

There is a development, toward the end of this movie, that was so very Un-Allen that I never thought it would happen.

Allen has masterfully directed and composed this film so that we share in the fun and also in the discomfort that comes when the tale of adultery begins to unfold. Subtle touches abound, hints that mislead you here and there a-plenty. Finally, the scoring of the film is brilliant, though other than opera buffs may not catch the clues. Setting mostly recorded songs and arias of the great tenor, Enrico Caruso, the lyrical content and the mood of the arias perfectly expand the mood of the film at the moment of action. skillfully returning to developing ""verses"" per se as the lyrics become even more appropriate is a very clever tool indeed. My best example is the recurring aria from ""L'elisir d'Amor"" (Una furtiva lagrima) sung almost painfully slowly by Caruso adds to the viewer's discomfort as the uncomfortable story develops.<br/><br/>All in all, highly recommended and a very pleasant surprise!"

Due to Nola being engaged to Tom, nothing really happens and Chris marries Chloe. Then Tom and Nola break off their engagement and Chris starts a relationship with Nola, with disastrous consequences...<br/><br/>A rare murder-drama from Woody Allen. His first of the genre and certainly his darkest movie. Quite a departure for him: while most renowned as a comedy writer-director, even his dramas of the past had a lightness to them. This is nothing like anything he has made before, or since, and is fantastic.<br/><br/>Great plot. A slow-burner that starts as a harmless relationship drama and gets darker and deadlier the further it goes. This is not to say that it is dull to start off: even before it ramps up it is a great character study.<br/><br/>Some excellent twists towards the end with a superb ending. Quite profound too.<br/><br/>Solid performances all round. Nobody puts a foot wrong. Emily Mortimer is a tad irritating as the mousy, clingy Chloe, but that is probably intentional on Woody Allen's part."
"tfrizzell","Null","5","6","18 March 2006"," I Know the Score of That Game----40 Love.
","Woody Allen goes totally out of character with this provocative and nearly outstanding dilemma of a movie. Former tennis pro Jonathan Rhys Meyers immediately falls for the sister (Emily Mortimer) of one of his ridiculously wealthy clients (Matthew Goode). All seems well in jolly old London until Rhys Meyers meets Goode's seductive American fiancée (another stunning turn from Scarlett Johansson). Interest turns to intrigue and then to lust and then perhaps to love or maybe a little obsession. Rhys Meyers begins to forget about Mortimer and fall into a twisted web with Johansson, but what happens when the plot does not go as planned and relationships become blurred? Allen's Londoners are just as fascinating and messed up as his New Yorkers. The change of venue is a refreshing alteration of pace for the famed film-maker and he nearly makes the whole project work with crazed symbolism and a reincarnation of that new-age style that dominated the European cinema of the 1960s and 1970s. The pacing is a bit off as the picture runs too long and Brian Cox (as Mortimer and Goode's father) is not around near as much as he should have been. Still ""Match Point"" finds enough momentum to climb over that pesky net. 4 stars out of 5."
"risingsun40","6","8","11","5 May 2009"," Solid enough; delivers where it counts...
","One of Woody Allen's most polarizing films, so far as I can tell, there seems to be very little neutral feeling on Match Point: viewers either hail it as a late-career gem, or deride it as an absolutely miscast, poorly-scripted farce. It's neither, really; what the film demonstrates best is that anything 'new' in Woody Allen films is essentially the Emperor's new clothes.<br/><br/>The novelty in Match Point is that the director has found a new playpen to cast his sophisticated characters and their discussions of high art and snobby social, um, concerns (in this case, London). Chris, an Irish semi-pro tennis player, earns the trust of a rich upper-class English family and marries into it. Then there's his jealous mistress, Scarlett Johansson, a struggling American actress, on the side. Their emotional dramas are played out through visits to the opera and art gallery, in which in one line a character is marveling at the intensity of an artist's brush-strokes and in the next are talking about having an affair or getting knocked up. It all sounds rather pretentious on paper, but here Allen's talent (as a writer and behind the lens) takes over and makes it all somehow believable, even compelling for a good hour of its runtime.<br/><br/>A common complaint with the film is that the attempts at British speak are risible and stilted. I'm not English, myself, so I'm not sure how accurate these criticisms are, but there are patches of dialog that are either clumsy or too obvious: Allen seems obsessed with tossing foreshadowing into his character's dialog, a trick that lends the production a feeling as artificial as the mechanics of his storyline. The whole tennis subplot is weakly written as well as executed, and could do with being excised. In terms of acting, Jonathan Rhys Meyers severely underplays his calculated lead character, appearing generally disinterested and sleepwalking through his part, and Scarlett Johansson is very good as his love interest, with a screen presence that makes the relationship between the two work - on that note, it's doubtful whether there's been a director as obsessed with his blonde star since Hitchcock. The supporting turns from Emily Mortimer, Matthew Goode and Brian Cox are all convincing, and the direction is generally good.<br/><br/>The problem with Match Point is that there's a nagging evidence of pretension and patchiness that prevents the film from being entirely absorbing even when it's at its best - not usually a recommendable combination. In addition, Allen takes a serious wrong turn in the last third or so of his drama. Depending how you see it, what unfolds is either a plot twist or an aspiration for the sort of high drama you get in operas (get it? because the characters all love the arts so much!), yet it casts a 'wtf' shadow over the whole film. And then proceedings get weirder still, via ghosts hallucinations, and more clunky dialog... I felt cheated.<br/><br/>Misgivings aside, Match Point winds up a competent film with all of Woody Allen's expected trademarks, and is worth seeing for Scarlett Johansson's performance. Despite being muddled, it provides - despite its high-art focus - fairly decent, trashy entertainment."

"MovieManMenzel","8","14","22","6 January 2006"," Scarlett Johansson and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers give brilliant performances in Woody Allen's new film Match Point.
","When I first saw the trailer for ""Match Point"" a few months back, I knew this was a movie I had to see. What surprised me about it most though was the fact that it was a Woody Allen film. I personally like Woody Allen but lately his work hasn't been very good. And ""Match Point"" didn't look like a Woody Allen movie but t was about time that Mr. Allen tried some new material and it looked liked this was the answer. Today, ""Match Point"" opened in limited release and I ran to the theater to see it at the first showing.<br/><br/>""Match Point"" is about a former tennis pro named Chris (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) who has just moved from Ireland to London where he teaches tennis at a local country club. One day he meets Tom (Matthew Goode) and they hit it off not only because of their love for tennis but also their love of opera. Tom introduces Chris to his sister Eleanor (Emily Mortimer) who falls for Chris. Chris and Eleanor start dating and everything is going great until Chris meets up with Tom's fiancée Nola (Scarlett Johansson). After Chris meets Nola he begins to have an obsession with her and can not stop thinking about her. But it isn't long before this obsession turns into a very serious dilemma than can ultimately make him or break him.<br/><br/>""Match Point"" is mainly a movie about love vs. lust and the power of obsession. The film also has a subplot that deals with luck and how lucky a person can be. The film is definitely for a select crowd and I can't see the majority of mainstream movie-goers going to see ""Match Point"" and leaving it happy. It's definitely for more of an artistic, mature or older crowd.<br/><br/>For me, well my eyes were glued to the screen throughout this entire film. The performances were excellent especially Johansson and Rhys-Meyers. The story was entertaining, interesting, and exciting. And finally the direction by Mr. Allen was perfect. This movie is definitely worthy of some Oscar attention just for the performances and direction alone.<br/><br/>The only problem I have with the film is the ending but unfortunately I can't really discuss that here without spoiling the entire movie. But I will say that this movie is a near masterpiece up until the ending where there seems to be a huge plot hole. Some will say the ending is the whole point of the movie, which does seem to be the case; however it still bothered the heck out of me because the plot hole was way too big to be believable. Also I have to mention that while the film is a great movie especially for this day and age, it has the same plot and storyline of a 1951 film called ""A Place in the Sun."" This film is basically a remake of that film with an alternative ending. But other than the ending, I really enjoyed everything about ""Match Point"" from the performances, to the directing, to the score. It's a very well done movie.<br/><br/>So in conclusion, I can definitely see where this movie is getting its buzz from not only because of the performances but the fact that Woody Allen has finally left his rich New York comedy setting and moved to London to make an engaging thriller. This movie is definitely one you want to see with someone because it involves quite a bit of discussion after wards. It's a movie that sticks with you and one that you won't soon forget. That's a pretty amazing accomplishment for director Woody Allen who hasn't had a hit in several years. I highly recommend ""Match Point"".<br/><br/>MovieManMenzel's final rating for ""Match Point"" is a 9/10. The performances and direction are worth the price of admission alone. Woody Allen is back with a vengeance."
"Gyran","1","17","28","22 February 2008"," Shoot The Pianist
","Having run out of backers in the USA, Woody Allen came to England to shoot this film for the BBC. Maybe his paymasters influenced the treatment because this film turns out to be exactly like the sort of pap that the BBC serves up every every night of the week and particularly on Sundays. After a hard week's work you let your brain have an early night and settle down to watch a BBC drama with implausible plotting and cardboard characters inhabiting an English middle-class never-never land. One is tempted to think that Woody is having a joke at his paymasters' expense but that is probably being too charitable.<br/><br/>Some critics have complained about the wooden acting but, again, it is no worse than you see on British television. Anyway, the dialogue is so implausible that it is best delivered by mediocre actors. Saddest for me was seeing the embarrassment of a great actor, Brian Cox, having to deliver lines such as ""He's right Helen  I think you've had one too many G and Ts"".<br/><br/>The theme is loosely based on the plot of Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment. In fact we see the protagonist Chris reading this novel early on in the film. It reminds me that one of Woody's greatest films, Crimes and Misdemeanours also took the Dostoevsky novel as its starting point. What really upsets me, seeing this phony film, is the thought that, maybe, all Woody's wonderful Manhatten-set films are equally phony and I only think they sound authentic from my ignorant English viewpoint. That gets me thinking that, maybe, many of the masterpieces of world cinema that I so admire are phony too. It's a sobering thought. Woody has a lot to answer for.<br/><br/>Plenty of other reviewers have given examples of Woody's ignorance of all things English in making this film so I will end with just one. On several occasions we see our middle class family in their box at Covent Garden and twice we get a glimpse of the performance on stage, of La Traviata and Rigoletto. On both these occasions, the opera is accompanied solely by a badly played piano. I know British opera houses are a bit strapped for cash but I have never heard of one having to put on an opera without an orchestra."
"shabbs-1","1","17","28","9 January 2008"," This is NOT Woody Allen
","I have never written a comment on a movie site before because I'm a great believer in the personal relationship between a piece of cinema and a viewer.<br/><br/>But having seen Match Point last night, I'm here to express a kind of horror I never thought I would get from a Woody Allen movie<br/><br/>I knew there would be no comedy, but I did not expect to see every single rule in the world of dialogue-driven drama to be trampled on in such a crass, juvenile, my-first-film-studies- project kind of way.<br/><br/>Woody Allen expresses emotion, creates suspense, exudes meaning  he DOES NOT SPELL THEM OUT!<br/><br/>I couldn't believe I was hearing lines such as 'I'm so anxious'. No, in movies, you show you're anxious, you don't say it dammit. And how many times did we have to have the details of the burglary spelled out to us? And would someone as fesisty as Scarlet's character really say 'Why can't I have the baby?' Every action and emotion had to be voiced and confirmed just in case the viewer didn't get it!<br/><br/>And what was there to get? A thoroughly unlikable protagonist devoid of the charm of Allen's usual protagonists that make the viewer relate and feel for him, followed his lust and pursued his goals and then had to choose between a secure future with his rich wife and a girl he used for sex for a bit. Big deal. It happens to people all the time. Especially when the girl in question is a broken figure like Scarlet's character as opposed to a genuine threat like, say, Glen Close in Fatal Attraction. <br/><br/>And more importantly, people know what they'd do in this kind of predicament precisely because this situation is so common  be nasty to her and she'll just go back to America again - there are plenty of ways to let your mistress down, and that does NOT include going for the shot gun!<br/><br/>There was no great love between the two characters (the sex scenes are so old man's fantasy  in the rain, ripping her top off, baby lotion and blindfolded by a tie for god's sake), no tension (if you didn't see Scarlet would get pregnant, you should be ashamed of yourself) and the incidental characters worked as nothing more than warm props  unthinkable in Woody Allen films where the small characters always make the big picture.<br/><br/>The film is called Match Point. Why? There are so many tennis analogies to be played on here  it doesn't have to be as profound as the way chess is used in Seventh Seal - but there was no one-upmanship (there could have, should have been between the two men), no showdown, no comeback  just luck. And boy did he drive that point home. If I'm ever insane enough to watch this movie again, I swear I'll need to borrow all your fingers to count how many times the word LUCK was driven down our throat.<br/><br/>You can't script a movie based purely on luck, especially when the events (and the quick shift that saw months and years go by without anyone changing their haircuts was ridiculous) relied on pure luck and not design time and time again. <br/><br/>And why on earth did everyone have crisp, clear-cut English accents? Even the doorman for god's sake. This is an American's understanding of what all British people are like, with clichés so stereotypical it makes the watcher violent. I just can't believe that American is Woody Allen.<br/><br/>Someone please tell me the real truth is Scarlet Johannsen really wrote this and he agreed to put his name to it because he fancies her. <br/><br/>For the love of god"

Nothing fancy, really, but it works. But the characters leaves sometimes much to be desired. It is not a chick-flick (unless some girl out there likes to watch plain stupid ""male behavior"") nor is it a guy movie (unless someone likes a nice car, there are one, hardly visible for 2 seconds in the middle of the movie, in the background...far, far away).<br/><br/>Take my advice.

"katelyn-bogacki","9","57","112","18 November 2005"," ""Match Point"" - A Triumphant Return for Woody Allen
","This past Wednesday I was able to catch a pre-screening of ""Match Point"" in NYC. I must say that I found the film to be absolutely captivating, taking a plot that easily could have been cliché and instead shaping it into a memorable and poignant piece worthy of intense afterthought and conversation. Think ""Closer"" mixed with one part ""Unfaithful"" and one part pure Woody idiosyncratic style. Mr. Allen has certainly made a bold comeback from the downward slide he's taken in the past few years(""Melinda & Melinda"", anyone?) For me, ""Match Point"" was most striking in the two main oppositions that it called attention to: love vs. lust, and more importantly, luck vs. hard work. As you probably have already read, Jonathan Rys Meyers is cast as a phenomenal tennis player from Ireland who comes from poverty but aspires toward climbing the democratic and capitalistic ladder that we're all so familiar with in the Western world. While working as an instructor at a swank London country club, Rys Meyers is fortunate enough to become involved with an upper class family, dating and eventually marrying their daughter (Emily Mortimer) and of course being set up with a steadily ascending position in their father's corporate office. The conflict arises when he becomes tempted by and involved with Scarlett Johansson's character, who is the American girlfriend of his brother-in-law (Matthew Goode).<br/><br/>A life of Aston Martins, corner offices with views, and bottles of Dom Perignon is, needless to say, a secure and comfortable one for Rys Meyers. However, his attraction to Johansson is so potent that he ultimately must make the choice between a modest lifestyle with the sexy, enigmatic Johansson - who plays a struggling actress - or a safe and privileged one with the more demure Mortimer.<br/><br/>To me, one of the more interesting scenes in the film comes when Mortimer and Rys Meyers are discussing the idea of good fortune. What's ironic here is that Mortimer, a trust fund baby, sides with the idea that luck has little value relative to hard work, while Rys Meyers, who comes from nothing, opposes her argument by stating that fate is what carries one to high places. Personally I felt that this sequence placed a negative marking on Mortimer for the remainder of the film, not because of her performance (I thought her's was one of the film's more brilliant appearances), but because from this point on we cannot help but think of her as overly naive and therefore unfit for Rys Meyers' darker, more conflicted demeanor.<br/><br/>Is it better to be lucky or good? Moreover, is Rys Meyers in love with Johansson, or is he simply addicted to her tempestuous sexuality? It's difficult for me to answer either of these questions. I would love to see the film again in order to be able to reevaluate what Allen has put out there for us. I would love to hear others thoughts on this and on the film in general...go see ""Match Point"" as soon as you possibly can - it's been a long time since a fictional film has left me thinking as much as this one did, and I'm confident that most will agree."
"diego-gambetta","9","50","97","15 November 2005"," Perhaps Allen's best film?
","Allen takes two unusual steps in this film, both of which have positive effects. He is not acting in it nor does he try to make an actor play an Allenesque part in it. The other is that the film is set in London and the English countryside, rather than in New York, and is effectively and accurately laced with the British social class obsessions and related accents. But it could happen in any society and at any time in which there exists matrimonially driven social mobility, and polygamy is not an option.<br/><br/>The plot is reminiscent of Stendhal's ""Le rouge et le noir"", in which a very bright and ambitious young man, Julian Sorel, ends up shooting - but only wounding - a woman with whom he had had an affair and who is threatening to ruin his prospects of a highly desirable marriage with a woman of the French aristocracy. Sorel, however, is punished for his deed and, even if genuinely repentant, ends up on the guillotine. The reverse of what happens to the hero of Match Point.<br/><br/>The philosophical message is that luck can trump justice. This may appear to be a truism for those of us who cannot bring themselves to believe either in the infallibility of human institutions or in the existence of a justice-driven divine design, but it is still hugely engaging to get a parable narrated at such high level of cinematic quality to remind us of that message. Consolation is not what this film has to offer.<br/><br/>The pace of the film is quick and even, and all absorbing. Allen shows a great ability for concision, and the editing is masterful. There is not a single fodder-shot that I could detect -- as good as Chabrol's best thrillers.<br/><br/>The choice of actors is close to perfection, and, assisted by a polished script, they all deliver with great professional skills easing the audience out of disbelief effortlessly and within the first minute of the film.<br/><br/>The film succeeds as the fiction classics do, by forcefully integrating many aspects of life into a single story. A sign of how much I liked it is that I have never written a film review before this one."

","Words almost fail me, but the message I must give is important for any Woody Allen completist planning to spend any time or money on watching this clumsy, tedious, and simply irritating movie. PLEASE DON'T! And if you're not a Woody fan - WATCH SOMETHING ELSE!<br/><br/>I am a big Woody Allen fan; I was looking forward to this film being a worthy addition to his tremendous, if variable, portfolio. And I respect Woody for trying something new here, by crossing the Atlantic to make a film with a cast made up almost solely of English characters based in an around London. But the result is truly execrable! It pains me to give such a low mark to a film by such a great film-maker. <br/><br/>I'd say that the fact that this film has made many millions of dollars at the box-office must be based entirely on his reputation, but all of Woody's other recent films have done far less well - why?? This is one baffling aspect of this movie. But the most baffling aspect is just how/why did it turn out to be such a stinker?<br/><br/>Where does it all go wrong? Well, the central story is just about acceptable if you're happy to accept yet another very run-of-the-mill hokey story about a crime of passion that wouldn't have vexed the minds of thriller fans in any era. It's nothing special story-wise, but nothing too awful. <br/><br/>What murders this film stone-dead from the earliest scenes is the poor dialogue, and in particular the appalling series of lines painfully delivered by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers as Chris, the central character who (unfortunately for the viewer) appears in virtually every scene of the film. Now as the film wore on, I became increasingly concerned that JRM is simply not a good actor. I'd be very happy to be proved wrong, I've no problem with his other work, but his peculiar transatlantic accent and extraordinarily stilted manner combines with the humourless, charmless dialogue that he's given by Allen to kill every scene in its tracks. <br/><br/>More? There is no humour or levity whatsoever, at any point in the film. Despite this, a whole host of fine British comic actors make sadly wasted appearances, presumably drawn to the fake aura of Woody. The office scenes, at Chris's workplace, are risible. JRM's amorous clinches with Scarlett Johansson's American character (tellingly the most convincingly written part here) are frankly embarrassing, really quite bizarre in their inept staging and performance. <br/><br/>Woody received an Oscar nomination for the screenplay! How???<br/><br/>Enough already! Just don't be tempted! DON'T!<br/><br/>If you're a Woody fan yearning for new material, watch Julie Delpy's ""2 Days in Paris"" - infinitely better than anything the man himself can muster nowadays ..."

","What if I'd praise this film - which is about a traditional love triangle (a handsome man, a beautiful and passionate young woman, a sweet and care-taking less-young wife) - as original? Would anybody believe me? And what if I added that it explores the tormented doubts of a husband, facing a crisis fought by an affectionate wife giving him a ""choose a life""-Trainspotting-lifestyle on one side, and a lust affair, adding - again - a praise for its originality? Would anyone believe me? How many hundreds of films like this have already been written? Well, the first part of the film is all about this and, in fact, is NOT original at all. It is simply well filmed and directed and acted. And that's the strength of the story: the non-originality, the already-seen, which compel the spectator to wait for an equally non-original and obviously already seen twisted plot made up of divorces, break ups, etc etc. BUT the spectator is going to find something very different from the expected, and is thus trapped by an anguish which I'd never expect from a Woody Allen's film. He caught me by surprise.<br/><br/>It's a film terrifically different from all his other works. A murder! Oh well, yes, there was ""Manhattan murder mystery"", but it was clearly a funny comedy. And there was ""Crimes and misdemeanours"", as tragic as it could be, which however threw a totally different ethical responsibility upon the author of the crime. Match Point is a film about luck, which wickedly determines whether or not a homicide shall be punished. A question of fraction of millimetres, in a wedding ring which hits a railing as well as a tennis ball hits the net.<br/><br/>Technically, I had the impression that Woody took longer than usual in the ""introduction"" of the film, for the presentation of the characters. In the same way and time, I had the impression that he needed to ""introduce"" an unusually new character for him: London.<br/><br/>As for the comic side, I'll cite Trainspotting again, because Woody chose its Ewen Bremner to give us one of the few tiny (and great) spots of comicity in Match Point.<br/><br/>Enjoy the film - and good luck!"

","""Match Point"" is reminiscent of Film Noir of the 40's like ""The Postman Always Rings Twice,"" ""Double Indemity,"" and ""A Place In the Sun."" Like those films, it is a story of an ordinary nice guy who get lured to the dark side by lust and money.<br/><br/>While the story might borrow more than a little from James M. Cain, what really sets ""Match Point"" apart from the older films is the excellent dialog and it's use of irony.<br/><br/>A lot of people are not going to like this film because it is very dialog heavy and you have to really pay attention to every word to fully appreciate it. Since most people are used to CGI and short sentences, it is probably going to have a hard time finding an audience. For people who put forth the effort, it is very rewarding.<br/><br/>Opera fans will be happy to know there is opera singing throughout a large portion of the film, mostly from old recordings of Enrico Caruso. Opera is mostly about sex and murder, so it fits into the themes of the film. An additional point of irony in the film is that the most commonly played aria, ""Una furtiva lagrima,"" while sounding dramatic, is from the opera ""The Elixer of Love, which is a comedy; the irony being that this suspense film is written and directed by a film maker usually associated with comedy.<br/><br/>The acting is very good all around, especially Scarlett Johansson who plays a sultry femme fatale. She shows a side I've not seen in previous films.<br/><br/>""Match Point"" is not an easy film to watch. You have to pay close attention and listen to every word of the dialog.

","There comes a point in a tennis match where the ball hits the top of the net. It bounces straight up in the air and, with a bit of luck, it falls your way. Woody Allen's ""Match Point"" explores that moment of luck and all the consequences of it. Is it all just a series of random events? Are some of us just luckier than others? Sometimes, the bounce we want is not the bounce we need.<br/><br/>Woody Allen is an awkward barometer of taste. You either like his writing or you don't. But even his most loyal fans have been restless with his latest offerings, chomping at the bit for him to try something other than a Manhattan relationship comedy with a neurotic lead male and a fine young thing as his muse.<br/><br/>""Match Point"" is exactly what his fans wanted... A break from the routine as he delves into film-noir, class distinction and romantic thriller genres, all the while delivering the same brilliant, pitch-perfect dialog that has come to define his work over the past thirty years.<br/><br/>This film evokes that nervous laughter you feel when the tension is almost unbearable. It is paced so relentlessly toward doom that you just want to scream something at the screen to help the characters avoid their inevitable fate. At one point, when the actions of the lead character are at a boiling point, I was practically begging that character to reconsider.<br/><br/>The screenplay is essentially a six character play. Chris (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) is an ex-tennis pro who meets a wealthy family while teaching at an upper-crust London country club. He soon drifts into a pleasant relationship with the daughter Chloe (Emily Mortimer). There is nothing tremendously passionate about the two of them... It all just seems to fit.<br/><br/>Chloe's brother Tom (Matthew Goode) is engaged to Nola (Scarlett Johansson), a voluptuous and sexy American who is extremely aware of the effect she has on the men around her. Her impact is immediately felt by Chris, and the sparks fly as they secretly rendezvous behind their wealthy loved one's backs.<br/><br/>The final two characters are the stinking rich parents (Brian Cox & Penelope Wilton) of Chloe and Tom, who are virtually trying to buy the future happiness of their children.<br/><br/>I won't detail the ingenious plot in much detail, but needless to say, relationships boil and cool, people leave and come back, suspicions are ignited and extinguished. And we simply watch as Chris tries to juggle it all with the sole aim of landing on his feet safely.<br/><br/>It is a clever little story that will have your jaw dropped and your head scratched on more than one occasion. And the film does not compromise. It leaves us in the way a French thriller would... With more questions than we started. It is definitely a film that you will have fun discussing.<br/><br/>Woody delivers his best film in years. He does it in a genre you won't expect. And he does it with a cast that is so acutely precise with every word, every undertone of innuendo, every movement and glance. This is easily one of the best ensembles of the year.<br/><br/>""Match Point"" is not a film where you will find likable characters... Hardly anyone in the film comes out clean on the other side. More than anything, this film will have you questioning the bounce of a ball as the key to it all. Is life just a series of fortunate or unfortunate breaks?

","God bless Woody.<br/><br/>He drives me nuts. <br/><br/>He told us his psychiatric diagnosis 25 years ago. He ""Zelig,"" someone who bends to the strongest influence he encounters. He's often able to become master of whatever tradition he falls into, though we always seem to judge him on some past project we like. We think we know the man: well, we know a few things. He wears Manhattan. He has a stuttering mask of indecision. He loves not women but how they slide between what is and what they wish for us and them. <br/><br/>But as an artist, we know nothing. Everything is a new experience, a new adventure and even the framework for exploration or experimentation shifts so there is no way to describe what we have. Anyone who purports to misses the point. The man as an artist must be taken as the quantum blur surrounding the poles of what we have encountered.<br/><br/>When he makes a film, it rarely matters as a film. Oh, some do. I would value ""Sweet and Lowdown"" and ""Annie Hall"" even if we had nothing else, and I would pay dearly to see the three hour mystery cut of ""Annie Hall."" But even those adventures pale when considering the vast, deep wander through cinematic ideas he's taken us.<br/><br/>So when I sit through this mess, and wonder why, why could someone do something so mindless, so lacking in richness... I wonder what, is he dead already? This has no elaboration, no noir agency, no complicating perspective, no folding, passion. It isn't even what it shows, an ad hoc inventiveness to pleasure, contrived at the last minute. It does have some introspection on the unlikely existence of itself  accident.<br/><br/>But it isn't accident. Its yet another street he's wandered down, another Tourette's utterance. It has no value in itself as a movie for me. It doesn't have to. Its another, different page in a life that has become a larger movie for me. And is there any better thing to say about a life as an artist?<br/><br/>The lovely thing is that the films are essentially all most of us have about the man, and each can be used as a window into the others.<br/><br/>One thing about each film is that it is a lover that he abandons, probably already on to the next one.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements."

","Having avoided Woody Allen's last two films, and because of recommendation from a friend, we decided to give Mr. Allen another chance. With this new film, Mr. Allen seeks to regain his loyal fans by taking them for a ride to England, where probably most of the money for the picture was found. The results are mixed, but not a total failure. It's by no means, the great movie most people are telling us it is.<br/><br/>Chris Wilton is a lucky man! As an old tennis player, he has had it. But like other men in his position, he finds a job in a tennis club as a pro. Since this is a place where the English upper classes go to, it's no surprise he meets Tom Hewett there. Chris has settled in London in order to take advantage of the cultural life there, something he has been lacking of. Tom is instrumental for introducing Chris, not only to the opera performance, but to his family, who accepts him as one of their own.<br/><br/>Chris doesn't appear to be a social climber. It's just that he is at the right place, at the right time. The opening sequence of the movie sets the tone for what will follow. An explanation is heard, about how in a tennis game, the ball that bounces over the top of the net will determine who wins the match. In the ironic twist of fate at the end of the movie, something similar happens, although not related to a tennis match.<br/><br/>Mr. Allen has gathered an interesting cast of mainly English actors that do good work under his direction. Jonathan Rhys-Meyers is Chris, the lucky man who charms the pants of the Hewetts. Scarlett Johansson, in one of the sexiest parts she has played, makes a valuable contribution as the American aspiring actress. Emily Mortimer plays Chloe, who becomes the wife of Chris and his entry ticket into a world of money. Brian Cox and Penelope Wilton are seen as the older Hewetts. Matthew Goode appears as Tom. In minor roles we see the wonderful Margaret Tyzack in a pivoting role and James Nesbitt as a police detective.<br/><br/>One of the best things in the film are the wonderful opera arias by Donizetti, Bizet, Rossini, and Verdi. We are even treated to a song from Andrew Lloyd Webber's ""The Lady in White"". Remi Adefarasin's cinematography serves the movie well.<br/><br/>One can only hope Mr. Allen has left the neurotics back home in New York!"
"aharmas","9","8","12","2 January 2006"," Insightful, Intelligent, and What a Thrill (Especially the Ending)
","When Woody Allen is in top shape, the man knows no fear. In ""Match Point"" he treats us to a tale that is supposed to teach us something by exploring the illicit adventures of a not so bright but lucky chap. He just happens to always be at the right place at the right time, and in most cases, he succeeds in spite of that force of nature played by Scarlet Johanson.<br/><br/>In fact, part of the fun, is watching his journey through a mine field he creates himself. He knows what is best, and yet he surrenders himself to passions he understands but has little moral fiber to fight. This film takes to England and explores how the upper classes live, how they interact, and what they offer to people who get lucky to interact with them. Woody Allen subtly offers an insight into how breeding affects your social maneuvers. For example, he does wonders with the cast, and that's what makes Johanson's Nora so interesting and dangerous. She recalls Glenn Close's Alex in ""Fatal Attraction"". Is she a character that is too emotional for her own good? or Is she a victim of circumstances beyond her control? or Is she the victimizer? There is a very strong performance here, and it should come with a warning for this actress brings intense carnality to the screen. She is an object of desire, and she plays it to the limit.<br/><br/>Rhys-Meyers gives a solid performance as the man who is able to move up in the world, with the approval and support of his newly found benefactors and a devoted wife. Along with Johanson, they keep the film going, and their interaction perfectly supports the tightness of Allen's script. It's through their history that we learn our lesson, and that lesson should be a point of contention between many members of the audience. It's a solid film, with much intelligence, much entertainment, and a return to greatness for a man who has explored the complexity of the human soul before, and who knows what weak creatures we are."

","Great work, expectations were met. :-) I really can't add much to my predecessors. Only one thing: The movie would have been a masterpiece (as far as I can judge), if it would have ended when the wedding ring bounced off the bridge's rail. Thus, the viewer could have imagined an ending according to the message implicated in the analogous beginning (luck <-> determination). The last 15 minutes were unnecessary in my opinion. They didn't fit in with the rest of the atmosphere anyway (chit-chat at the police station etc.). The bouncing of the ring off the bridge's rail would have closed the circle perfectly with the tennis ball bouncing the net in the very beginning."

","The entire plot of this movie has been played out before, often in much better movies. And virtually every scene has been done much better in other movies. Best summarized as the Talented Mr Ripley meets Monty Python's Upper Class Twit of the Year.<br/><br/>Where to begin...<br/><br/>The villain is supposed to be Irish, but doesn't sound remotely Irish, despite having what we are to believe is an impoverished upbringing.<br/><br/>The other male lead comes across as being every North American's image of what an upper class Brit looks and talks like. He's such a stereotype, it's comical.<br/><br/>Scarlett Johannsen's character starts out as a sexy femme fatale, but ends up looking acting like a shrieking teen demanding that the boyfriend who knocked her up marries her. It's like two different characters.<br/><br/>And the plot holes are enormous. The shotgun blasts that no one hears, the laziest, most gullible police force probably in the world. A homicide detective would not tread lightly to spare someone embarrassment about an affair. They'd have a warrant for the father in laws house in a second, feelings be damned.<br/><br/>The attempts at creating tension are laughable. The main protagonist is stealing a shotgun...and at that instant, his insufferable wife comes looking for him. And when he is putting it back, at that instant, she has to find him again. This is the best they can do? In all, a boring, implausible, limp movie that's not worth seeing in the theatre. Rent it some time, maybe, if you are home with the flu."

","Anyone who laments the fact that Alfred Hitchcock is no longer alive to make thrillers can rest easy---the Woodman is on the case.<br/><br/>""Match Point"" is a ghoulishly entertaining movie that threatens to become a rip-off of ""An American Tragedy"" mixed with ""Crime and Punishment,"" until Woody jerks the film in a totally different direction and makes it utterly original.<br/><br/>For about the first twenty minutes of the film, I was thinking how ironic it was that Allen's best movie in a long time (and even in the first twenty minutes you can tell it is indeed going to be that) should also be his most unoriginal. The plot is cliché, and is not helped by the fact that Allen borrows heavily from Theodore Dreiser in setting up his main character's dilemma. However, once the protagonist (for want of a better word) sets out to plan the ""perfect"" murder, inspired by ""Crime and Punishment"" (which you see him reading early on in the film), the movie becomes an anything-can-happen nailbiter, and had me on the edge of my seat.<br/><br/>Scarlet Johannsson is remarkable as an emotionally unstable love interest; Allen uses her sultry good looks to perfect effect, and he includes her in some of the most erotic moments he's ever filmed. Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, who I can't decide whether or not I like, also equips himself well as the ex-tennis pro who finds himself torn between a life of privilege and his lust for the object of his desire. And all of the supporting players are excellent, though I expected no less from a Woody Allen film.<br/><br/>Allen shows complete mastery of a genre he's never tackled. This doesn't even seem like an Allen film at first glance, but many of his recurring themes are here, and his usual knack for writing such strong characters with such believable motives adds much to the suspense and effectiveness of the film overall.<br/><br/>A true stunner of a movie, easily one of the best of the year.<br/><br/>Grade: A"

"MartinK75","10","12","20","9 January 2006"," Woody at his best
","There are moments when watching the best Woody Allen films when I feel that they're so good that Woody seems to be operating on a completely different level to any other filmmaker alive. I had that feeling again when watching Match Point. It's a serious film, Woody's first in quite a while and opens intriguingly with a shot of a tennis ball hitting the top of the net and getting suspended in mid-air, leaving viewers wondering whether the ball will drop in front of or behind the net. This nicely sets the tone for a film dealing with luck and making the most of lucky breaks which fall your way as well as the age old question of love vs money. Jonathan Rhys-Meyers is Chris, a young working class tennis instructor who, after landing a job at a posh London tennis club, befriends Tom, an upper class pupil, who introduces Chris to his family. Chris starts seeing Tom's sister, Chloe, who quickly falls in love with him. Chloe's father secures a plum job for Chris within his company and the couple proceed to marry. It's really a marriage of convenience for Chris who recklessly starts an affair with Nola, Tom's fiancée, a poor but sultry young actress from America and this intensifies after Tom and Nola split up. Chris seems happy enough juggling both women until Nola drops the bombshell that she is pregnant and Chris is suddenly forced to choose between the two. Nola urges Chris to leave Chloe. Chris' relationship with Nola seemed to be primarily sex-driven but it's now clear that they have feelings for each other which run deep. Chis does want to leave Chloe, who he has never really loved, but can't bring himself to tell her. There's a brilliant and very tense scene when Chloe actually asks Chris if he's having an affair; it's the ideal moment for Chris to confess to Chloe and he almost does, but backs out at the last moment. With matters threatening to spiral out of control, Chris resorts to murder to eliminate Nola and their unborn child. Why does he do this? The simple reason is money. As Chris reveals in a heart-to-heart with a close friend, he's gotten used to a certain lifestyle. Ultimately, Chris chooses his glamorous job, chauffeur-driven car and penthouse flat overlooking the Thames over a financially uncertain future with the woman he loves. There's an interesting scene towards the end of the film where Chris throws a ring linked to one of the murders he's committed towards the Thames in order to dispose of the evidence; his throw isn't good enough and the ring strikes the top of a barrier and floats in the air above in a mirror-image of the opening tennis ball scene. When it lands on the ground instead of in the river this seems to be a bad omen for Chris but luck intervenes and it actually ends up helping him considerably. By the end of the film Chris has literally gotten away with murder and his marriage and lifestyle are intact. It's definitely not a crowd-pleasing ending but it's entirely in keeping with the film's message which is that bad people can and do profit from luck just as much as good people. I thought the film's ending was both different and refreshing given that the murderer predictably gets caught in 99% of movies/TV/books. The film's faults are pretty minor - the dialogue sounds occasionally stilted (probably due to Woody being more used to writing for American characters) and the speed and intensity with which Tom's wealthy family embrace a nobody like Chris is somewhat unrealistic. That aside, this is an outstanding film, totally gripping from beginning to end and a reminder of what a truly great filmmaker Woody Allen is."

","The Irish former professional player Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) from the lower class gets a job as tennis instructor in an upper class club in London. Chris becomes close to his student Tom Hewett (Matthew Goode), who introduces him to his British upper class family, and Tom's sister Chloe immediately falls in love with him. The ambitious Chris keeps the relationship with Chloe, feeling lust for Tom's fiancée, the American aspirant actress Nola Rice (Scarlett Johansson), and they have a brief affair. Chris gets married to Chloe and climbs to a high position in a company of the Hewett's family, while Tom breaks his engagement with Nola. When Chris meets Nola by chance, he becomes obsessed for her and she becomes his mistress. When Nola gets pregnant and presses him, he balances the financial advantages of his marriage but he has to take a decision in his life and choose the woman he wants for his companion.<br/><br/>The great director Woody Allen moved his landscape from Manhattan to London to present a totally different movie, actually a film-noir. The amoral story of ambition, love, desire, obsession, lust and crime is totally different from his previous works and I really liked it a lot. His screenplay and direction are excellent and deserve the wins and nominations listed in IMDb. I loved the quote ""The man who said I'd rather be lucky than good saw deeply into life"". Scarlett Johansson is incredibly sexy as I have never seen before and has another outstanding performance in the role of Nola Rice. Jonathan Rhys Meyers has his best character and performance in his career. The movie begins with Chris reading Fyodor Dostoevsky's classic ""Crime and Punishment"", and ends with him living ""Crime and (Un) Punishment"", by Woody Allen. Even if you do not like Woody Allen's films, see ""Match Point"" that you probably will like it. My vote is nine.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Match Point"""
"ferguson-6","9","10","16","7 January 2006"," Luck and Deceit
","Greetings again from the darkness. Despite his lack of box office pop, Woody Allen has always been a terrific writer of relationship chaos. He also has recorded his love of New York City on film for the past 30 years. In what is his best work since ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"", and belonging in the same high class as ""Manhattan"" and ""Annie Hall"", ""Match Point"" has Mr. Allen exploring these same relationship topics within his newly discovered Britain setting.<br/><br/>With the recurring theme of luck (the word is used at least 11 times in the script), the film takes Chris, a former Irish tennis pro (""Bend it Like Beckham"" coach Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) and tosses him into the upper crust of the British elite. Surprisingly enough, he fits right in. Not so surprisingly, he falls in love with wealth and its privileges. An Allen staple, the twists and turns of relationships and family life develop into quite a mess for our tennis boy. Married to, and adored by, rich girl Chloe (played exceedingly well by Emily Mortimer), Chris also falls hard under the spell of sultry, struggling American actress and seductress Nola, slightly overplayed by Scarlet Johansson. Some of the best scenes are the ones exhibiting the entire family, including Chris' in-laws played by Brian Cox (who is the new Gene Hackman - seemingly in half the movies released) and Penelope Wilton (""Pride and Prejudice"" ""Calendar Girls"") and a self-indulgent Matthew Goode (the chasing agent in ""Chasing Liberty""). Quite often these scenes occur right before and right after a passionate (way beyond the norm for Allen) tryst between Chris and Nola creating quite the tension for the viewers.<br/><br/>The canvas of London is surprisingly similar to Manhattan as seen through the eye of Allen and this is quite a compliment. Another Allen trademark is his use of music, and opera is the call here. The blending of opera both visually and through the soundtrack provide the tempo and feel that Allen wants us to experience. An interesting side note is that Chris' driver is played by John Fortune, a British TV star.<br/><br/>For those of us who love multi-layered stories and watching people attempt to dig themselves out of their own mess, ""Match Point"" is a gem. For those looking for any old fashioned Woody humor, head to the video store. This is a grown-up story with twists and turns and is very dark in nature, and I consider myself ""lucky"" to have seen it."

","If Raskolnikov had not had a soul, he might very well have perished into literal and psychological hell.

Just as OJ Simpson got ""lucky"", so too this young Irish tennis star become exec gets away with murder. The collateral damage is just as insignificant to the world as Raskolnikov's landlady. But we can see ""the blood crying in his ears"" (Dostoevsky).<br/><br/>Well acted, well directed, we are prodded into liking the landed gentry so extraordinary and proper and happy in their extraordinary world. But ordinary Irish does not fit in really and we all know it. Except he IS lucky.<br/><br/>It is a great WA movie. A must see even though my eyes had to avert the cruel scenes. The final close up of the new father unable to smile during the toast to his new born son revealed more pain and yes, the urgent need of a lover/confessor whom we know isn't listening anymore."

","More often than not, I dislike Woody Allen's movies. Match Point, however, is a brilliant film. The ""un-Woody-Allenness"" of it that many notice in fact suits it very well. On some level, it's a serious - even disturbing - movie, considering what I felt is one of its main themes -- the unhappiness that lies ahead no matter what the life choice may be. Its somewhat stifling dialogs and acting are possibly intentional and therefore can be ""forgiven"". It's really made up of two films - the lust and affair drama, followed by a Dostoevsky roller-coaster - but it's remarkably consistent, as the deep emotional connection with the characters switches its focus, but does not wane."

The script made me feel as if I was there and the actions taken by the characters were interesting and gripping.

","All this talk about ""Match Point"" being something completely different than anything Woody Allen has ever done, something fresh and surprising, it's true. Allen reinvents himself with this movie. There's no shaky camera, no jazz music and no frantic, quirky dialog. Allen's message is the same, but instead of playing the lovely, cute & clumsy neurotic-card like he did so often, this time he says what he wants to say in an earnest and compelling way. ""Match Point"" is highly sophisticated cinema without any pretensions (if you overlook the fact that all characters are so smart and educated they could have jumped right out of an Oscar Wilde play). I will admit that although most of Allen's earlier movies are not my cup of tea, objectively speaking some of them have been very important in their own right. It's all the more impressive that after all those movies that made Allen one of the most original filmmakers ever, he's able to redefine himself not only as a director, but also to come up with such a perfect, clever script. I won't go into detail about how gloriously Allen's framework of pictures and monologue works here. It's not too subtle, anyway. What I admire most is the way Allen always puts the events of the story in the foreground with the real, recurring message that our life is arbitrary without sense or meaning hidden between the lines. ""Match Point"" never bores you and at the same time it appeals to your intellect. How very rare a mixture like that has become these days!<br/><br/>After all these years, Allen has become a master in modeling believable characters and situations. Needless to say that the acting is brilliant, too. Allen simply refuses to work with anyone but the best. Scarlett Johansson is everybody's darling right now and rightly so. Her eroticism is natural and her performance leaves nothing to be desired. The rest of the (mostly British) cast is just as great. It's good to see Johnathan Rhys-Meyers making a worthy ""comeback"" after he's already promised so much in ""Velvet Goldmine"".<br/><br/>Well, what more can I say than that this movie has even convinced a guy like me who's always had a disliking for Woody Allen and his movies. ""Match Point"" is just too damn good to hold a grudge. Let me put it this way (and God, I wonder how many reviewers have already used that term): Game, Set & Match: Allen!"

This proves to be his one flaw as he obtains a job as an instructor for a supremely private resort club where he befriends one of his charges, Tom Hewett (Goode), whose shared love for opera has him inviting the unassuming Chris to a performance where his family has a box seat reserved. Here he meets the rest of Tom's family: respected businessman Alec (the ubiquitous Cox), tipsy mum Eleanor (Wilton) and engaging sister Chloe (the wonderfully sublime Mortimer) who falls deeply head over heels in love with Chris almost immediately. Chris too finds himself in love with Chloe and before you know it is taken in by the wealthy clan as one of the family.<br/><br/>As the story progresses Chris finds this sudden shift in his life moving along nicely and to his agreement accruing a position in one of Alec's many business ventures as an apprentice seller and weekends at the sprawling estate of the Hewetts. It is there he also meets Tom's gorgeous American fiancée, Nola Rice (Johansson giving one of her better performances to date), a fledgling actress who beguiles Chris immediately and he is smitten by her, intoxicated by her very presence that the two wind up in a countryside embrace leading to a moment of unbridled passion. While Nola makes light of giving in to their primal desires as a lack of clarity on her behalf, Chris cannot get enough of her; Nola explains this desire is temporary and that she is getting married to Tom; end of story.<br/><br/>Chris tries to do what's right and eventually marries the unsuspecting Chloe and absorbs himself in work until one day while playing a set with Tom he is informed that Tom has dumped Nola and is in love with another unknown woman. The fire is re-ignited in Chris' soul and the determination heightened as he becomes infatuated in finding Nola again to seduce her once and for all. <br/><br/>Allen allows his talented class plenty of room to act up a storm but not overact the seemingly straight-forward melodrama at hand but what makes it rise above the norm is the way his leads make their seemingly unsympathetic characters empathetic. Rhys-Meyers remains cool as a cucumber until the predictable complication ensures his affair with Johansson will lead to an unlikely scenario that borders ridiculous mystery theater affair however maintains a balance of dread in when the couple will come to a head. Johansson mixes the smoky cadence of her Kathleen Turner-like vocals into a come-hither-insouciance not before experienced and has the tricky task of making her Nola's head case come to fruition with believability; she succeeds succinctly.<br/><br/>Allen's screenplay is literate, clever and crafty and at once familiar with a few of his trademark quips tossed in with élan that his upper crust characters make the most of what they can with a dry bright witticism here and there. The storyline flows evenly amidst its choppy third act that feels a tad rushed yet when the darkness comes it echoes ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" which it has a lot in common with but never trespasses entirely. This is Allen's most adult film in sometime and not to besmirch it perhaps his most challenging one to date. Thank God Woody is back in fine form, not unlike an old tennis pro on the senior's tour with a wicked backhand."
"ijha92","Null","19","35","28 December 2005"," Woody: an actor's dream come true
","Over the years, Allen has shown himself as superlative as a director of actors. He gives them scope to explore the wide range of human frailty. This is true in his outright comedies(Annie Hall, Manhattan) his ""problem plays"" (Hannah and Her Sisters, Crimes and Misdemeanors) and here, in his great, dark drama MATCH POINT. What scene would any of you like to choose for discussion? Is Allen's perception and keen ear for human weakness evident in almost all of them? Witness, to chose but one example in a hundred, the scene in which Nola bitterly reviews her miserable youth and her mother's alcoholism whilst downing far too much wine? Yes, part of it indeed is Johanssen's innate talent, but there is here -as before with Keaton, with Caine, with Farrow, with Wiest- the steady hand of a master who knows how to get the best performances out of his actors. Whew, what a tour de force."

","Match Point is a UK-USA-Ireland-Russia Co-production, mostly shot in London, and directed by Woody Allen.<br/><br/>The story revolves about a love triangle between young retired tennis player turned businessman Chris Wilton (played by Jonathan Rhys Meyers), his wife the sweet good-hearted rich girl Chloe Hewett (Emily Mortimer), and the bombshell struggling actress and Tom Hewetts' girlfriend Nola Rice (Scarlett Johansson).<br/><br/>This is one of those stories we have seen brought to the big screen many times, a Hitchcock's theme in a way, the love triangle, the crime, the coward who prefers his boring loveless wealthy life to start afresh with the woman he dreams about. The first scene of the movie is very philosophical and it is a good premise of the drama that will unfold:<br/><br/>The man who said ""I'd rather be lucky than good"" saw deeply into life. People are afraid to face how great a part of life is dependent on luck. It's scary to think so much is out of one's control. There are moments in a match when the ball hits the top of the net, and for a split second, it can either go forward or fall back. With a little luck, it goes forward, and you win. Or maybe it doesn't, and you lose.<br/><br/>Luck is more important in life than you can ever expect, and it is always unpredictable and fanciful. In fact, the story is all a story of a very good luck for Chris's character, especially at the end. However, this is a romantic psycho-drama with a predictable plot, so the interesting premise gets diluted very soon. In other words, the movie is too mundane to be philosophical, and pretending the contrary is... pretentious.<br/><br/>The film is shot in a very fresh way, has a nice bright artsy atmosphere and hints of Allen's sense of humor (especially in the policemen's conversations at the end). The actors do a good job in their respective roles, although this is a mini-coral movie. Meyers has a good chemistry with both Mortimer and Johansson, and he's able to portray with believability the double face of a cheater, and also the difference between love and passion. Emily Mortimer shines as a very believable sweet bland woman who is blind to anything she does not want to see. Johansson also shines in her femme fatal role, which she always nails.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is formed for a mix of modern and old opera arias. Carusso's old records are intercalated in the middle of the movie to highlight the actions of the characters. Modern performances are played while the characters attend performances in the theatre or hear some records.<br/><br/>The movie has a nice feel about it, is well filmed, decently acted, and has a good direction. However, the movie does not add anything new to the genre, is too predictable, has a poor script and important flaws in the murder story. A bit dull but enjoyable the same."
"Wuchakk","8","4","5","28 January 2011"," 'Fatal Attraction' for the new millennium (sort of)
","DIRECTOR/WRITER: Woody Allen. RELEASE DATE: January 20, 2006. GENRE: Psychological drama. RUNTIME: 2 hours, 5 minutes. LOCATIONS: London and the English countryside. <br/><br/>THE PLOT: Chris (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) is an ex-tennis pro from Ireland and Nola (Scarlett Johansson) a struggling sultry actress from Colorado; both are (unconscious?) social climbers attempting to marry into a rich English family. Chris marries Chloe (Emily Mortimer) even though he passionately lusts for Nola, the latter whom ultimately breaks from the family and the UK. When she returns to London Chris reignites their passion, which can only lead to tragedy. And only luck can save him. <br/><br/>""Match Point"" is the antithesis of the modern 'blockbuster' and all it's moronic trappings -- there's no quick editing, no CGI, no goofy one-liners, no explosions and no promise of $400 million at the box office. No, ""Match Point"" is movie-making based simply on good writing and cinematic storytelling. The first hour plays out like a nigh tedious drama but the second builds momentum like a snowball slowly morphing into an avalanche. Be forewarned, if you don't have the stomach for an hour of soap operatics avoid this movie. For those who do, however, ""Match Point"" is rewarding, unpredictable and original. <br/><br/>Underpinning the drama is the theme of luck. The film starts out with a tennis ball hitting the top of the net; at that point the ball will fall on one side of the net or the other, depending solely on the luck of the player. At first, this seems unrelated to the story, but wait till the end and you'll see everything connect. It's amazing how good writing & storytelling can create a 'Wow' reaction much more so than the most elaborate overkill action sequence with all its requisite cgi and explosions. <br/><br/>I sensed a somewhat sad emptiness in the characters; most of them are neither likable nor unlikable (although Chloe is super-sweet albeit naive), they're just human beings trying to find meaning and fulfillment despite their physical riches or lack thereof. Their innate moral compass has been lost with the passing of religious faith and they search for meaning in the secular world of Dostoevsky, Sophocles, the visual arts and Verdi's operas. Only the mother and main protagonist, Chris, come off unappealing; the mother is just annoyingly snobbish, whereas Chris is so blatantly selfish and flat (not to mention devious) I find it hard to believe any of the characters in the story would find him appealing, let alone worthy of marrying into the family and becoming a prominent part of the business. But this just reveals that they're out of touch with their ""spiritual compass."" <br/><br/>What's ironic is I strangely found myself rooting for Chris in the final act, which doesn't make sense since I'm completely opposed to his (lack of) character and what he does (I can't say more because I don't want to spoil the film). This testifies to Mr. Allen's greatness as a filmmaker. Or maybe I temporarily rooted for him because, regardless of the outcome, I realize no one ultimately ""gets away"" with anything in life -- lucky or not. <br/><br/>The love, I mean lust, scenes between Chris and Nola struck me as ultra-steamy and authentic. This is exactly how a man and woman in illicit passion would secretly go at it. Case in point: the 'rain scene' is potent. Needless to say, ""Match Point"" is a must for Scarlett Johansson fans. <br/><br/>As to the ""Fatal Attraction"" reference: No, you don't have to worry about psycho slasher clichés. ""Match Point"" is smarter and more subtle than that.<br/><br/>GRADE: A-<br/><br/>***SPOILER ALERT*** <br/><br/>Someone offered this insight about the story: ""Tennis is a game designed by a creator with a set of rules. You win the point if the ball goes forward or lose the point if the ball falls back. The ring doesn't bounce forward across the other side and into the water and you immediately think Chris has lost the point and will be found out. But since life itself has no designer, and there are no true rules, it turns out that it was actually good luck for Chris because the ring was found by a bum with a history of petty theft and therefore he, not Chris, was thought to be the murderer.""<br/><br/>While this is an intriguing insight and legitimate interpretation, it doesn't rule out a Creator or the fact that there are intrinsic moral laws in the physical universe. For instance, if there are no such laws why does Chris almost have a nervous breakdown after committing the murders? After all, if no such laws exist then it's impossible to break them and meaningless to be upset about it if you do. Why does he see non-literal ghosts of the victims? Obviously he broke an ironclad moral law and was now experiencing the guilt thereof. Yes, luck worked in his favor at the end of the story and this is in line with the insight of one of the wisest persons who ever lived: ""I have seen something else under the sun: The race is not to the swift or the battle to the strong, nor does food come to the wise or wealth to the brilliant or favor to the learned; but time and chance happen to them all"" (Ecclesiastes 9:11).<br/><br/>Yet, this doesn't preclude the existence of God or that there will be a judgment day in the Supreme Court of the universe. As Christ said, ""There is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed, or hidden that will not be made known. What you have said in the dark will be heard in the daylight, and what you have whispered in the ear in the inner rooms will be proclaimed from the roofs.""<br/><br/>Simply put, the idea that evil people ""get away"" with their crimes is an illusion."

Generally I think that it's a very good movie, maybe not great though, but something different from what one has come to expect from Woody Allen.<br/><br/>In a film as good as this, there is one thing that is quite ridiculous (although of no importance to the plot or the film in general): we are told that Tom's father donates generously to the Royal opera House, but twice we see the protagonists at performances accompanied by piano! Has the orchestra gone on strike or is the generosity of Tom's father still too modest in scale? In the third performance the orchestra is already present."

","I was disappointed to find out after watching this film that it was a Woody Allen film. Woody must have saved money on researchers and just based the characterisation in this film on British Stereotypes from the 70s. The dialogue was awful and the editing at the beginning felt like they had gone 2 hours over length and had to cut severely. I almost turned it off, but was only appeased finally by the story turning a little dark, with a reasonable twist. Despite poor material the actors made a reasonable job of interpretation.

","Really weak plot, uninspiring dialog, predictable acting. Woody is just not very good at drama and he proves it once again. The forced parallel with Crime & Punishment is a drag and Chris Wilton is sure no Raskolnikov. The plot may have worked as a cream puff romantic comedy, but it's not funny, save for the unintentional comic effect of the badly written characters spewing banal truisms with tragic facial expressions. The attempts at depth and wisdom are so weak, dishonest and lazy, it's the level of high-school poetry. It may have worked as a crime movie, but it's not very exciting. Just predictability all around. Even the twists in the plot are not very surprising. Oh, and the dialog. Just dreadful. Plain dreadful.<br/><br/>Don't waste your time on it."
"allfallup","Null","4","5","29 April 2006"," To be tried by Ghosts
","The ghost scene in Match Point is neither dream nor reality; it is allegory. Allen employs an allegorical mode in which the characters become abstract representations of themselves to justify the philosophy behind the film. This is a mode of drama outside the constraints of realism. The audience is not witnessing an actual event. They are being presented with a justification of the protagonists actions according to the dark nihilism (and all its dehumanizing effects) that the director has otherwise publicly embraced. Therefore, such a mode is a tool for the director to speak through his characters.<br/><br/>Indeed, for all his flights of comedy, Woody Allen inhabits a dark universe that is random, meaningless, and amoral; there is no inherent value or meaning to the universe. This is the message of the film. (And an insight into the man: do we laugh to keep from crying?) <br/><br/>Personally, I preferred Allen's version of this story over that of Theodore Dreiser's original novel, dramatized for the screen as A Place in the Sun (1951). There, the protagonist is caught, tried, and sentenced to death (sorry folks). There is something corny about such a clean morality. Oscar Wilde remarked that the meaning of fiction was that the good prosper and the bad are punished. There is no moral Justice operating behind the random universe of Allen. As an aside I must point out that, for all the talk of Hitchcockian influence upon Match Point, in Hitchcock's universe no one ever got away with their crime in the end. Though in Hitchcock justice is often duplicitous; meaning everyone is punished in the end, the good and the bad.<br/><br/>To juxtapose such a literary mode of film-making (to be tried by ghosts is the stuff Greek tragedies are made of) with the almost slapstick of the next scene, in which the Scotland Yard detective awakens in his revelatory sleep, certainly speaks in a most general manner to the content of the detectives dream; however, it seems more to me that Allen is merely being playful."

","I had many good expectations on this movie, but I ended up a bit disappointed when I saw it. I thought it was going to be a masterpiece,but it didn't seem so to me. The most important thing for this story are the characters, and the problem is that the performances, in my opinion, are not powerful enough. I don't mean that Meyers and Johansson are bad actors, but I think that I may have enjoyed the movie better if it had a different cast. There are other movies which have the same themes as this one and are definitely better, as for instance, ""The talented Mr. Ripley"", in which the actors, for me, are outstanding, whereas in ""Match Point"", they can't awake almost any feelings in me. Besides, the dialogues are not very original,they are a little artificial. Anyway, the movie is worth seeing: it makes you think about the consequences of your choices, and that is always an issue which is important to approach."
"GloriaT","9","4","5","9 February 2006"," Group Portrait with Evil
","Woody Allen's latest, ""Match Point,"" offers some breathtaking views of London and the country estates of its super rich, but the movie itself remains a dark tale of the moral bankruptcy of today's affluent society.<br/><br/>A washed-up professional tennis player, Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) has chucked the Grand Slam circuit in favor of the ""big fish in a little pond"" lifestyle of a tennis pro at a series of posh resorts. At the story's beginning he sits knees together, an apparently obeisant supplicant in a job interview for a spot at an exclusive London country club. His subdued appearance betrays no vestige of the alpha-male pro athlete.<br/><br/>Chris gets the job and befriends a wealthy young man, Tom Hewitt (Matthew Goode), whom he meets there. Soon Chris is enjoying nights at the opera and weekends at the Hewitt family's bucolic country estate, where shooting clay pigeons and drinking are the preferred activities. Tom's sister Chloe (Emily Mortimer), who is portrayed as sweet and singularly awkward among this high-class race of smooth operators, falls for the former tennis star, who accepts her attentions with the same polite enthusiasm he displays for opera tickets. He beds her in his shabby London flat, where he otherwise spends his time reading Dostoevsky and listening to ""serious music,"" as if exposure to high culture could inoculate him against his baser origins.<br/><br/>When he meets Tom's serious squeeze Nola (Scarlett Johansson), Chris immediately shows signs of ruthless desire, revealing his truer, primitive self. Nola's tragic flaw is that she sees herself as a Lola whom no man can say no to (unless he is casting a movie). She is an American from a broken home, an aspiring actress specializing in lousy auditions, and like Chris, who came from Irish poverty, she is out of place in the drawing rooms of the rich Brits. Nola readily admits that her relationship with Tom is nothing more than the result of his good looks and the amount of gifts he showers upon her. Eventually, when even a downpour fails to quench the animal attraction between them, Chris and Nola have an old-fashioned roll in the alfalfa.<br/><br/>The Hewitts and their hangers-on seem to glide through their conspicuously consumptive lives. But for Nola and Chris, who were born sans the silver spoon, the sojourn among these rich dawdlers threatens to be a fleeting proposition.<br/><br/>Chris punches his own ticket by marrying Chloe, taking a job in her father's business and climbing the corporate ladder, buoyed by his father-in-law's imprimatur and a natural facility for bossing secretaries and abusing expense accounts. Still, newlywed Chris is determined to have his (cheese)cake and eat it, too, and he pursues Nola, who has been dumped by Tom in favor of a blue-blooded bride.<br/><br/>The pressures, which Chris's clandestine affair inflicts on this working-class parvenu in the rarefied air of London's highest social strata, bring him to the verge of a crack up. Now the pace of the film accelerates, as we watch Chris's high society shell hatch a heinous Mr. Hyde in order to untrammel his illicit romance. Later Chris has a good cry and slips back into the routine of his well paid sinecure-cum-chauffeur and saccharine family life.<br/><br/>The police procedural scenes near the film's end are truly the saddest of the movie, since they effectively destroy the dreamlike lifestyle we've been vicariously living for an hour in the dark. The submissive attitude Chris assumes vis-à-vis London's finest is reminiscent of his job interview at the movie's beginning. We wonder if Chris's lucky streak will hold.<br/><br/>The snappy jazz soundtracks that have been an Allen staple are replaced in ""Match Point"" by an elegiac operatic score which takes on an additional dimension as the story unfolds. <br/><br/>Woody Allen never appears in front of the camera in ""Match Point,"" but his screenplay has earned the prolific writer/director his latest Oscar nomination<br/><br/>Also absent here is Allen's signature intellectual dialog. When Chris and his in-laws come together, it is whisky, not wit, which sets their tongues wagging. And their banter belies no purpose other than self-contentment and no belief in anything greater than luck, as perhaps befits those born into enough wealth to isolate them from the vicissitudes of life.<br/><br/>What becomes of morality in a society blessed with an abundance of all creature comforts? What is the use reading yourself to sleep with Dostoyevsky if you fail to grasp that the Russian author's nihilism is a plea for spiritual direction in the world? Woody Allen shows us the vapid lives of these affluent characters toward a similar end: Who needs lessons learned, if Lady Luck trumps all? <br/><br/>At the film's end, the happy Hewitts celebrate their family's newest arrival: Chloe's and Chris's baby. Floor-to-ceiling windows fill the couple's flat with glorious ambient light and provide a spectacular view of London and the Thames. Through this happy diorama, one somber figure shuffles: Chris, dressed in a dark suit, is like an inexpiable sin on the soul of society."
"roland-104","8","4","5","22 January 2006"," Scarlett Johansson & Emily Mortimer shine in this tale of lust, ambition & luck
","A drama about lust, ambition and luck, this is the first of Woody Allen's urban adventures to be set outside New York City, i.e., in London, and with the exception of one performer, all the actors hail from Britain or Ireland. Chris Wilton (misty-eyed Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) is a former lower rung touring tennis pro from Ireland now trying to scrape by. He lands a teaching job at a toney private tennis club, where he is befriended by the handsome young Tom Hewett (Matthew Goode), who comes from a wealthy family. Chris comes round the Hewetts' house for drinks and dinner, meets Tom's sweet but marginally attractive sister Chloe (Emily Mortimer), one thing leads to another, and they marry.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Chris has met Tom's fiancée, the struggling American wanna be actress, Nola Rice (Scarlett Johannson). For Chris, meeting Nola is lust at first sight. But she is off limits, until Tom breaks up with her in favor of another woman. Now, despite being a virtual newlywed, Chris pursues and impregnates Nola. The narrative then proceeds along a well worn path: Chris must somehow dispose of his predicament without sacrificing his marriage (he does genuinely care for Chloe, never mind the family fortune). Bad things happen. I cannot say more about the resolution without shamefully spoiling things for you.<br/><br/>This film is a mixed bag. The basic theme is formulaic. We know it from such classics as ""A Place in the Sun"" and ""Room at the Top"": poor boy meets rich girl and sees a vision of Paradise on earth. The trouble in ""Match Point"" is that the (anti-) hero is not nearly as sympathetic as the principled, brooding Montgomery Clift was in ""Sun."" Rhys-Meyers is frosty, cool, and way too untroubled until close to the end. Nor, on the other hand, does he have the slick, psychopathic charisma that Laurence Harvey mustered in ""Room."" Rhys-Meyers instead comes off as an unconvincing kid, for all the daring his course of action requires, in the same sense that the boyish Matt Damon did not seem up to the title role in ""The Talented Mr. Ripley""; ditto for Leo DiCaprio in ""Catch Me if You Can"" and ""The Aviator."" (Regrettably, box office appeal is a very different matter than proper casting.) <br/><br/>I thought that Brian Cox seemed lost in his role as Alec, head of the Hewett clan; Penelope Wilton fares better as Hewett's wife, Eleanor. This brings us to the female co-leads. Ms. Mortimer is excellent as the pigeon-toed, plain but endearing, trusting Chloe, strained by her infertility and riffs of disaffection from Chris. She nails the complexities of this role beautifully.<br/><br/>Ms. Johansson is simply marvelous. As ever a luminous visual presence on the screen, she also shows once again her impressive range in convincingly inhabiting her characters. Her American girl here is small town coarse, provocatively seductive, and more than a little desperate. How different from her pensive, measured, well-educated, retiring character, Charlotte, in ""Lost in Translation."" And both so different yet from her nearly mute, servile yet perceptive Dutch maid, Griet, in ""The Girl With the Pearl Earring."" Ms. Johannson is not only a rising star, at 21 she is already a splendid actor.<br/><br/>The photography and production design are lush. I especially enjoyed the brief scenes shot at Covent Garden, though the operatic theme in general is somewhat mystifying. Is it the affectation of the rich seeming to dig opera that counts? Is there some special significance to the recurring use of ancient scratchy recordings of Caruso arias? If so, Mr. Allen has kept entirely quiet about it amidst his other comments at the film's website. The best things in this movie are its ""luck"" theme, its visual delights, and the two female leads. The rest is just OK. My rating: 8/10 (B+). (Seen on 01/18/06). If you'd like to read more of my reviews, send me a message for directions to my websites."
"thepythia","10","16","29","8 January 2006"," The Best Film of 2005
","Many will claim to be disappointed that this is not ""a Woody Allen movie."" Such is the remark of a lazy viewer. Nevertheless, it is a film made by a competent director who pointedly executes each element. The actors, all typecast, establish themselves early on in their respective parts; and from the beginning, the ball is in motion. What is a tennis game after all? A series of strokes that change the inertia of a ball. What is a match point? It's the play where the score is either reset to deuce, or upset making one player victorious. This one play is the thin thread between the end or another beginning.<br/><br/>Chris (Rhys-Meyers) knows the rules of the tennis game and so he knows that every play in life rests in the hands of luck. And he is lucky, and arrogant enough to deem ""lucky"" substantial enough an identity. Nola (Johansson) is his pawn, and with a little luck, she is usable and disposable. And the kind but wealthy British family that Chris has infiltrated are also unlucky enough to be used by this tennis pro.<br/><br/>Even though Chris is an adulterer, he is not ""a Woody Allen."" In fact, Woody Allen, as a character, is nowhere to be found. And what follows from that understanding is a fantasy: a fantasy in which luck rules, and if the protagonist is lucky, he can have it all. He gets his lust and greed fulfilled and he lives happily ever after, if...<br/><br/>This is not a Woody Allen movie, but Woody Allen has crafted a perfect film. The dialogue hits every note, the actors play their games with each other, each with his or her own motivation toward a single prize, and the cinematography captures long and meaningful observations of their faces, thus their deepest thoughts and feelings. Watch Allen's other non-Allen movies like ""Another Woman"" and ponder the similarities to his hero's work, the films of Ingmar Bergman. Consider that the best work of a filmmaker may be the one from which he or she is able to extract his or her own ego. Think about what it felt like to see your first tennis match. Did you cringe in your seat wondering if the wind might blow luck in the other player's direction? Hats off to 2005 for a terrific year in cinema! However, if you are a learned intellectual, there is one film that will give you enough fuel for discussion over an entire glass of wine and this is it."
"bbethany-1","10","21","40","13 November 2005"," Allen's best film ever. May be spoilers.
","It is extraordinary that a film maker as skilled and experienced as Woody Allen has after 36 years and some 40 movies as writer/director, made his Masterpiece. Hannah And Her Sisters, Crimes And Misdemeanors, Husbands And Wives, Annie Hall are undeniably superb, but with Match Point, Allen has risen to a very high level indeed. <br/><br/>Two things immediately set this film apart from his others: He doesn't act in it, and he has chosen London--not his beloved New York or Paris--in which to unravel this story of steaming lust, lethal ambition, and numbing irony. Johnathan Rhys-Meyers is Chris Wilton, a tennis pro who will never reach the top and has thus insinuated himself into the upper-crust world of Chloe Hewett (Emily Mortimer), daughter of a very successful business man (Brian Cox). Her brother has an American girlfriend, Nola, (a brilliant Scarlet Johansson) who is voluptuous, reckless and willful, and who is drawn to Chris. They have a brief fling, but the ambitious Chris goes on to marry Chloe and to take a position in her father's company. He's beyond his class but adapts quickly and has some success. Chloe badly wants to have a child but they have trouble conceiving. Nola, a budding actress, breaks up with Chloe's brother and disappears into her theatre world in London until a chance encounter with Chris leads to an entangled affair that leaves him desperate to find a way out. This is further complicated when Nola becomes pregnant. What ensues is intense, gripping, and bizarrely logical.<br/><br/>Woody Allen has captured the louche flippancy and fluent ease of the rich and privileged while punctuating this tale with a dark undercurrent rarely seen in his films. There's a wonderful foreshadowing scene early on that resonates ironically in the fevered machinations of Chris to extricate himself from the Hell he has created. The script is seamless--not a word is out of place--and the music frames the story around visits to the opera. For once Allen forsakes vintage 30's jazz for passages from Verdi and Rossini. The settings and costumes are spot on and the pace of the film is impeccable. Brilliant editing.<br/><br/>I think the writing and directing are Oscar caliber, as is Johansson's performance. I saw Match Point here in France. I'd like to be in New York when there will be (Nov. 29) a special screening at Lincoln Center with Allen fielding comments and questions from the audience. This should create quite a buzz and stir for old Woody. Imagine: at 70 years he's done a job that Hitchcock might envy."

","If you're going to see this movie expecting the story of a neurotic character and lots of laughs, you'll be disappointed. Match Point is Woody Allen trying something different with a great plot and script and a wonderful casting.<br/><br/>I'm biased, OK. I've been a Woody Allen fan for years, although I haven't liked all his movies. In his late films I was missing the mood I loved about Crimes and Misdemeanors or Husbands and Wives, and Match Point recovers it in some way, even though it's a completely different movie.<br/><br/>Another difference is the location. It felt strange to see an Allen movie where characters don't walk in Manhattan coming or going to a diner. Since I'm not British I can't tell if locations are good, but it sure looked very British high society to me. I mean, if it is cloudy and rainy 90% of the time and people play tennis and speak English with a strong British accent, where are you? And finally i'd like to mention how good actors are in this movie. Jonathan Rhys-Meyers and Scarlett Johansson have a intensity that fills the screen. I'm glad to see that not all the raising good actors are talentless Hollywood stars. There's hope for cinema."

There is no Hollywood softened plot and rationale, but real, fresh and dedicated acting. It is hard not to fall in love with Miss Johansson and I believe Chris Wilton when being torn. In general the psychological layer is very rich. Less epic and less ""funny"" than other films by W.

Shot in London, the atmosphere feels very different than that set up in the rest of his films - even Melinda and Melinda, a very recent film and a personal favourite of mine - feels to have belonged to a different director. This was slightly off-putting for me in the beginning but as the film progressed I realised that Woody Allen has reached the point where he can produce any kind of masterpiece even if that means unbalancing the notion of what has been perceived and eagerly acclaimed as his ""style"". The dialogue is excellent for once more, the plot ingeniously conceived and developed. The theme of crime and punishment along with that of luck and its relation to life are both persistent throughout the film. A lot of wisdom and a lot of opera that helps build the tension.

","I was misled by the trailer of Match Point, which overemphasises commercial elements, so that initially I decided not to see this film. <br/><br/>Then I feel lucky that I have watched this film. It is actually essential Woody Allen: the protagonist driven by the surroundings, the absurd existing, the mismatch and the black humour. The interesting things are in the languages, a typical Woody's way to make the the unreasonable reality explainable. The originality is satisfying.<br/><br/>The cast do their roles precisely, sometimes they look like incarnations of Woody himself. The music and the colour of the film place the story in a nostalgic atmosphere, yet coupled with the reference to a stark urban realities. These bring me a few broadened thoughts which I quite enjoy. <br/><br/>In short, a rewarding watching."

","This is a great film. One of Woody Allen's best. There are many, many people who complain of plot holes in this film. What they are talking about are not really plot holes. They are LIFE holes. The events such as the police not investigating Nola's (alleged) pregnancy is maddening.<br/><br/>That however, is not a shortcoming of the film, but instead one of it's strengths. Chris Wilton was a very, VERY lucky killer in that there were many ways he could - and should - have gotten caught. But, due to a seemingly open and shut case, and a lazy police department, he emerged completely unscathed.<br/><br/>In a way, Woody Allen's manipulation of the audience to an almost angry state over this fact is the mark of a master.<br/><br/>To those who see similarities in this to Crimes and Misdemeanors - yes there are. The endings are somewhat similar. However, in the vast scope of films that have been produced, so many films resemble so many other films, that to criticize them for that is ridiculous.<br/><br/>Would you talk down to Hitchcock for always directing a suspense thriller? Or Keaton for a slapstick comedy? Allen, like many great filmmakers, has his little magic bag of themes. Because he is so prolific, people tend to notice them more than other filmmakers.<br/><br/>Match Point is another notch in Allen's belt of magnificent, intellectual, and thought provoking films.<br/><br/>See it, you won't regret it."
"jonross31","10","11","19","18 January 2006"," Imagine Crimes and Misdemeanors with a Hitchockian flare and the cinematography of Manhattan...
","To no surprise, Woody Allen has once again created a classic, what is surprising is that the film is set in London.Allen's cinematography captures the city very well, similar to the way he filmed Manhattan. Allen, sets aside his comic mastermind and instead takes the audience into a crime drama through the eyes of a tennis pro who has just moved to London. After retiring as a touring professional, Chris Wilton (as Jonathan Rhys Meyers), has taken a job as a club professional at a prestigious tennis club in London. His friendship with a student will lead Chris into a life of aristocracy, love, lust, and sacrifice. Match Point is a fitting title to the story it tells and Woody Allen has certainly served up a film everyone will enjoy."

"drakejake","2","10","17","31 January 2006"," Only Caruso Provides Passion in Pointless Match Point
","I just returned from a disappointing viewing of the new Woody Allen movie Match Point, said to be ""his best film in years."" If this is true, I have not been missing much. I am actually a big fan of Woody's best work, such as Broadway Danny Rose, Manhattan, and A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy, but in Match Point Allen reveals that he has nothing to say and nothing to do but pile cliché upon cliché in a pitifully poor script and do laughable imitations of countless dopey domestic melodramas from past decades. Most of the movie gives us a meaningless triangle of man, wife, and lust-mate, the horribly stale story of a man whose work is hurt by his romantic infidelities, and an afterthought of callous murders and an O'Henry final twist that would hardly be enough to justify a short, short, short story.<br/><br/>Naturally I loved the gorgeous singing of the young Caruso (obviously a cynical pandering to the vast number of people who like scratchy records) and was intrigued to learn what lyric tenor was trying to sing Otello (Lotric?). I guess the budget forced the director to have operatic scenes at Covent Garden performed to piano accompaniment rather than with orchestra. <br/><br/>Woody casts very beautiful people, lights them flatteringly, and gives them endless super closeups. Woody loves the cloudy London weather and supplies lots of beautiful scenery, inside houses and in the countryside. But the script is so poor that the photogenic actors--most of whom possessing very limited talent--cannot help being trite and even ridiculous. The very lovely Scarlett Johansson is given the phoniest lines in the most hackneyed situations and cannot rise above the tripe of the script.<br/><br/>Go for the music and the pretty pictures, but don't expect anything new, clever, or worthwhile from the script."
"pagonisg","3","10","17","31 January 2006"," A missed opportunity
","I think Woodey Allen missed the opportunity to convey the importance of the central point of his film...the role of luck in our lives even in the creation of the universe which is a really subversive idea indeed. Not a single spectator focused on that idea, which after all inspired Mr Allen to make this film. It is I believe a lost opportunity. After all, everything around us (religions, philosophy, ideologies, politics etc) is based on the assumption everything is there for a reason, that we all get what we deserve etc. What a great opportunity to challenge all that and make an unforgettable movie! What a wasted opportunity! I can only give him some credit if this is a self sarcastic film....how luck helped in him being considered such a great director (by some anyway). If this is the case then he managed to direct himself and his obsessions once again. Other than that, a film of Woody Allen versus Dostojevsky is really ridiculous! It takes a lot more talent and effort to stage such a confrontation; and to avoid any misunderstandings,I myself really believe in the element of luck and certainly not that ""we get what we deserve"" in life. The other weaknesses of the film are not that important, such as the dialogs that seemed to be so unrealistic, or the all too American fascination with England (I mean scenes of the changing of the guards or the Parliement building!!!!). We were not out for a sightseeing tour of London! Not to mention the British family the protagonist joined that looked so suspiciously American. The ghosts scene (coming out of nowhere) was not quite Macbethian even though you could see the reference. Making references of Shakespeare in a film doesn't make you Shakespeare (not Orson Wells for that matter). The transformation of an ambitious young man to a murderer was not convincing at all. In conclusion I was really disappointed. Oh...the actors were good all wright but I think they should think again before working with Woody Allen. Incedently I think Mr Allen is fascinated by Miss Johansson...again one more argument that he directs his fantasies!"
"february2nd","7","10","17","13 January 2006"," Luckily for us, what might be Woody's swan song is a lean and powerful effort
","(Note: I added ""may contain spoilers"" because I briefly describe how the plot is set up, but I don't discuss it's resolution.)<br/><br/>Even though I'd heard beforehand that this movie was reminiscent of ""Crimes and Misdemeanors,"" it still didn't quite prepare me for all of its twisting plot. Yet it's actually a very simple story. A man falls in love with two women at the same time. The one he's most passionate about he can't have, so he ends up marrying his 2nd choice. It doesn't hurt that his lesser love is part of a very rich family, and that he'll never have to worry about money again for the rest of his life as long as her father sees that his daughter is happy with him. But he can't deny his passions, and starts up an affair with the girl he loves more. The affair takes on a life of it's own until one day it gets serious enough that he is forced to make a choice: give up a life of chauffeurs, mansions and a wife he describes as ""sweet,"" or forsaking his deepest passion forever for a safe and comfortable existence. What he decides is something I won't give away.<br/><br/>This is lean and powerful Allen. There is no amusing nebbish at the core of this one; all the pain and uncertainty that ""the Woody character"" would usually deflect so deftly with humor is stripped away here, and what's left is a more satisfying display of raw emotion from the two gifted leads, Jonathan Rhys-Meyers and Scarlett Johansson. Equally as satisfying is that Allen's theme about the roll of luck in our existences ended up being as strong as any of the performances. For good or for bad, you really leave the theater questioning just how lucky you or the characters you've just spent two hours with really are. Maybe the only thing everyone who can appreciate this film can agree on is how fortunate we are that Woody Allen (who turned 70 this past December) can still put together a small masterpiece like this."

"Chrysanthepop","Null","5","7","3 January 2009"," A Murderous Mismatch
","Unlike most of his films which are usually romance or comedy or both, 'Match Point' is a suspenseful character-driven thriller. Woody Allen adopts a very Hitchcockian style in 'Match Point'. It isn't like anything he's made before. His fascination with England is interesting and you do see that he makes a lot of use of the English sights (though some may think the showing of monuments etc are clichéd). His other fascination seems to be actress Scarlett Johanssen whom he has already cast in his more recent three films. Though I have never found her convincing as an actress, here she actually does a fine job but the film clearly belongs Jonathan Rhys Meyers. Many seem to complain about his accent or his restraint but, in my opinion, he does a wonderful job playing a complex and difficult character. An adorable and vivacious Emily Mortimer shines. She is a scene stealer and it is good to finally see her in a role that exposes her talent. It's also good to see Brian Cox in something different for a change and Penelope Wilton has always been a dependable actress. Allen does a superb job in building the suspense by following the lead character and exposing his thoughts. The film is said to be loosely based on Dosteyevsky's 'Crime and Punishment' and there are several references to his works. Opera music is cleverly used in the story as the characters are shown to be deeply drawn towards it. Lastly, 'Match Point' is another one of Allen's winners. It's impressive that at this age, and after so many duds, he could make a film that looks so modern and feels fresh."

And this is what is really surprising. Woody Allen usually does the best movie, or the worst, or an average one, on the various themes of Woody Allen movies, but he hadn't made so far a movie that could actually compare with the usual standards of cinema. Now it's done, and Woody wins hands down. All the cast is superb, while Matthew Goode is absolutely unbelievable. The script is light, sharp and original.

","Woody Allen at his worst I'm afraid. The main problem with this film is the unconvincing central performance of Jonathan Rhys Meyers - and you would have thought a director of Allen's stature could have coaxed a better performance than this. Scarlett Johansson and Emily Mortimer are good but wasted next to Meyers who seems to be trying to be the kind of Englishmen Americans imagine rather than going for any veracity.<br/><br/>The plot itself works in that disjointed way Hollywood deals with time and has some merit with the final scenes at least raisng the interest but the changes in tone make the film inconsistent - an odd mix of uptight stage play and supposed thriller.<br/><br/>If you want a dark treatment of relationships over time you would be much better off going for Closer.<br/><br/>Disappointing."
"gonewilde","8","9","15","9 January 2006"," Match Point movie review
","Woody Allen's new film Match Point has received a lot of praise and accolades. Most of them are deserved. Most assuredly some of them are not.<br/><br/>The movie is the story of the young protagonist, Chris, played by Jonathan Rhys-Myers coming into a world of privilege and circumstance after befriending Tom played by Matthew Goode. Chris begins to date Matthew's sister, Chloe, played by Emily Mortimer and is ushered into the family business. All goes well until he meets Tom's sultry fiancée, Nola, played by Scarlett Johansson. And that's all I'll say in direct respect to the plot.<br/><br/>In general, the acting quality leaves something to be desired, though some of the actors give stellar performances. Emily Mortimer gives an amazing performance as the vulnerable and sympathetic Chloe. Matthew Goode also does a great job as the clueless brother, unaware of the storm brewing below the sanguine exterior of Chris. Unfortunately, the film's two biggest stars Rhys-Myers and Johansson, though emphatically beautiful and pleasing to the eye, give robotic performances. Both are unconvincing, delivering the dialogue which, at times, seems just barely memorized before shooting.<br/><br/>The film is a little slow to start. The dialogue is not immediately engaging, but what the film lacks in performance is more than made up for in the writing of the screenplay and the cinematography. The film is visually striking from the opening shot. The interiors and exteriors and sumptuous and exquisite.<br/><br/>And the screenplay is perhaps one of Allen's best, existentially brooding on the role of luck versus hard work in life. The film is essentially a meditation on which plays the greater role. The drama is heavily influenced by opera with its dramatic themes and plots. The majority of the score is primarily derived from various operas, which helps to enliven the performances when they are a little lacking. The operatic quality also influences the characters and tone of the drama. From the first opening notes, you know that this isn't light fare.<br/><br/>The movie moves along at a steady pace and takes its time to unwind. At points, it seems that the movie is merely going through the necessary motions to move the plot along, but these moments are sporadic and short. The tension builds to the very end and just when you think it is over, it's not. The ultimate conclusion left me breathless and (literally) applauding Allen's cunning in creating a movie that glosses over current fixations and taps into more ancient dramas: infidelity, power, the lengths one will go to secure their position and privilege, and the consequences of our actions.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this film for anyone interested in quality cinema. I hope that Allen receives at least a Golden Globe, if not an actual Oscar. I am aware of his reasons for using two of today's hottest stars who end up giving only mediocre performances--he wants money and recognition. Who doesn't? Hopefully, next time he can convince his actors to give better performances or just hire better actors, who just might not be as famous."
"janos451","8","9","15","5 December 2005"," Woody at 70: Opera and Tennis
","Woody Allen's new film ""Match Point"" has five large themes, three of which are among my principal passions: opera, tennis, London, murder, and a thesis that sheer, dumb luck is not only the origin of life, but also its most decisive element.<br/><br/>Except for a bit of a sag halfway through it, ""Match Point"" is one Allen's best films, a significant claim to make considering his involvement in the making of about as many movies as his age - an amazing accomplishment for Allen Konigsberg of Brooklyn, born on Dec. 1, 1935.<br/><br/>""Match Point,"" about the spectacular rise and ""Crimes and Misdemeanors""-like un-fall of a young tennis pro (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, in a career-making performance), opens and closes with Caruso singing ""Una furtiva lagrima,"" it contains a virtually nonstop series of opera excerpts, and its long climactic scene is accompanied by the finale of Verdi's ""Otello."" Why the switch from jazz to opera? ""The story is operatic,"" Allen has said. ""It deals with the kinds of things that opera is so often about: love and lust, passion and jealousy, betrayal and tragedyand, of course, the confluence of fate and luck."" <br/><br/>Always excelling in casting (even in his many weaker films), Allen has outdone himself in ""Match Point"" - Scarlett Johansson, Emily Mortimer, Matthew Goode, Brian Cox, Penelope Wilton, and others all turn in topnotch performances, almost all playing characters that are different from previous movie (if not stage) roles.<br/><br/>Glory be: ""Match Point"" has no whining, no Woody-isms, it may be fully enjoyed by those who have developed a kind of allergy to Allen's increasingly bothersome mannerisms over the years. Almost uniquely among his films, this has neither him nor a ""Woody Allen character."" The tennis is so-so, but London (a new venue for New York-bound Allen) is marvelously real and alive. All this and lots of Caruso - what a treat!"

I would not advise anyone to rent or purchase this flick...waste of time and money. Woody Allen has always been a brilliant actor but I am beginning to doubt his writing/directing/producing skills. The story begins sweetly, leaving you wanting to know more of the characters relationships. As the movie wears on you start to snore.

This movie does not need any kind of extreme exaggeration - must be ""typical"" British understatement.

He didn't run into a dry spot creatively in the last few years. He's a genius and people seem to forget he knows what he is doing and no one who spends any time on this side could ever match him. People have said anything else and celebrity were lackluster movies. Celebrity was hilarious. Anything Else was only the beginning of Woody's new style, which I have no idea as to where it originated. Just some impromptu spout of imagination and all of a sudden he's movies have some of the best cinematography in film history. That was followed by Melinda which was just amazing. He isn't making movies in order for his audience to be on the edge of their seats. He is no panderer.Those films were both fantastic. And now match point.

And he didn't came alone. He came with Johnathan Rhys Meyers, Emily Mortimer, and the BIG, SEXY and PROVOCATIVE Scarlett Johansson. 'Match Point' is the story of Chris, a lucky guy that becomes rich from one day to other, just marrying a rich woman, Chloe. The problem is that he's in love of her sister-in-law, Nola Rice. The rest is pure cinema, it's like if you mix Hitchcock and Woody Allen in a same cooking recipe. The result is perfect and you're glad anyway even minutes before the fantastic and awaited end. I'll tell you that Scarlett is the best of the movie. Her femme fatale role is so perfectly written, and she's got a look so sexy, hot and provocative that gives you Out of Kombat when the movie ends... She's pure Oscar WINNER."
"poppedculture","7","6","9","22 January 2006"," Allen Hithcock
","The audience wasn't expecting anything quite so restrained from Woody (they were so anxious to laugh they howled at lines such as ""Maybe you've had one too many G & Ts,"" not exactly a zinger by Allen's standards) who proved with Match Point that when he's pushed, he can still hold his own with the best. It seems Allen couldn't get U.S. financing to his liking so was forced to go across the pond to finance this one. Nothing stirs the creative muscles quite like wanting to show others they've made a mistake. Hopefully, Americans will stop financing his films altogether so that Woody can make films in Paris (Everybody Says I Love You doesn't count), Sydney, Berlin, maybe even somewhere in Africa. Of course, the one thing missing when Woody sets his films in other cultures are the witty one-liners he's so famous for, but if the tradeoff is better films for fewer one-liners I support it. With this script, he accomplishes an interesting marriage of manners, romance and Hitchcockian drama, which interestingly enough is the most compelling part of the movie. Really terrific set-up of the ending, which really is ingenious. After watching the Matador on the same day I must say I think the filmmakers are starting to out think the audience again, making for some truly brain-teasing plots. Of note, also are the performances of the actors, who it must be said seem far more comfortable with improvised dialogue than their American counterparts in other Allen films. They seemed to interpret the material in a way that made them all seem colder, yet more interesting. Particular credit should go to the chap who played Tom Errett, who really could be a lead actor and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers who did a fine job in a difficult role. Scarlett Johannsson is brilliant as always, although her descent into craziness may have been a bit over-the-top. What was pleasing was to see a love scene in which the woman is not rake-thin and forced to contort into unnatural positions. She really is a treasure, and I hope the celebrity B.S. doesn't eat her up. She's well on her way to being a screen legend  look for her next in The Good Girl, another British/American manners drama. Woody takes a lot of abuse for not living up to his early promise, not being a genius, etc. I hope after this film, we leave him alone to make his one year a film then watch it and appreciate it for what it is: like a visit from our favourite neurotic uncle. He's still got serious chops, writing, obviously, but as a filmmaker, too. The reveal of the couple's loft and the slo-mo shots of the tennis ball and rink were real signature shots."
"hermione47","2","7","11","18 April 2006"," Match point...less (contains spoilers)
","I have always been a bona fide Woody Allen fan, but I'm losing hope... This film is a mixture between ""A place in the Sun"" and Allen's own much superior ""Crime and Misdemeanors"", but it's got none of the raw edge and desperation of the first and even less of the humour noir of the second. It is set in London but (and I live in London) it does not at all look like it. The wealthy British family depicted is a gentile white upper class family, yet the son and daughter keep referring to their father as 'papa' which I believe is the norm in Jewish families but certainly out of place in this context. Apart from this, the family is so preposterously unbelievable, that they all seem to come out of some urban fairytale. The acting is appalling, especially Rhys-Meyers' and Johansson's, who seem to be suffering from toothache rather than swept away by passion. The fact that a tennis pro with the looks of Ryhs Meyers would love opera and succeed in the City is laughable and makes the characters played by Rock Hudson in the Sirk movies positively neorealistic! It's a horrible film, badly acted, and worst of all, going absolutely nowhere and with nothing to say that is real, insightful or even ironic. A total miss, Mr Allen."
"animalmother05","3","7","11","27 March 2006"," Match Point of Our Love
","It's been a long, long while since we've been strung out on love; and there's no mask of a smile that can hide what we're thinking of. From your heart I hear only distant echoes of empty love. I guess this must be the match point of our love.<br/><br/>Those are lyrics from ""Match Point of Our Love,"" a Beach Boys song written long after most of their important work (except The Beach Boys Love You), which is built around a painful pun, and really doesn't have any right to exist. It has a lot in common with Woody Allen's ""Match Point.""<br/><br/>From the opening narration, which uses a tennis match as a metaphor for life to illustrate how important luck is (technically it's physics, but we won't dwell on that), the topic of luck is used as a painfully calculated motif. The worst is when a conversation between two investigating police officers is dragged on well past having any relevance whatsoever, so that one can ""casually"" remark that ""some people have no luck at all.""<br/><br/>How much of this film really does rely on luck, though? Sure, it was luck that Chris and Nola met again, but Chris' reactions to this were hardly luck. I suspect that Allen realized this, and that's why he put in two scenes involving ""Crime and Punishment."" But Allen does not play with that novel's ideas; he merely hopes that we've read it and relies on it to explain Chris' actions. Chris also quotes Sophocles at one point, in a blatant use of name dropping on Allen's part, as its relevance to the film is slight.<br/><br/>Mainly, my problem was with the screenplay. The performances were varied: Jonathan Rhys Meyers seemed like a more annoying, stupider Joaquin Phoenix, Scarlett Johansson played the femme fatale character better than any other actress her age could have, though the film's tone was off, and she became less convincing as her character was supposed to be more sympathetic. One of the police officers also gave an irritating performance, though that could have been the screenplay's fault; after waking up one night, he delivers the film's most laughably bad line. The other performances did not really draw attention to themselves. The mise-en-scene and cinematography are fairly good; together they manage to encapsulate the dullness of the British aristocratic life that Chris has accepted, and which has provided him with material items while leaving him more intangible things to desire. And while they show dullness, the dullness becomes interesting somehow. Unfortunately, the screenplay is bad enough that it is difficult to recognize these things.<br/><br/>A few final notes: Woody Allen is not Ingmar Bergman, despite what he seems to think (if you see the movie, you'll know which scene I'm talking about). And why do we see so much of Chris in his office? How is that at all important to the film? Is it just so that Allen can show that he knows how to say ""Thank You"" in Japanese? Allen san wa totemo atama ga ii desu yo! Yeah, right."

I just hope the next two - TWO! - films Allen's making in London with her are better than this pretentious crap.<br/><br/>And the dreadful dialogue between the cops - what the hell.

So one of the main problems is the script. Starting with the premise which can be summed up in two sentences. That's something you can do with a lot movies to give the audience a quick feel what it is about. But here you don't need to wrap your head around how to sum it up because it is so painfully simple which leads into the next point.
The premise or the setup of the drama is very simple but Allen takes an hour to get there. No joke you could edit this movie down 90 minutes and you would not loose essential information or details. Which leads into the next problem.
It is predictable until the last half hour. We will get to that. And if I say predictable I mean after 10 Minutes until minute 90 I can tell you everything that will happen which also isn't really much. Sometimes I can even predict the lines which leads to my next criticism.
The dialog is just horrible. I saw ""Vicky, Christina Barcelona"" and I remember the dialog to be alright. But here not only is it very wooden(no pun intended) and unauthentic it just feels functional. We have to say this to get to that. It feels like checking boxes and it is the cliche dialog that you wouldn't expect in an Woody Allen movie.
Let's get to the characters shall we. Well basically Jonathan Myers is the only one in this movie. I wouldn't dare to call the other one characters because there are just stereotypes. We got the nice but a little spoiled Emily Blunt who is a wonderful actress and she is really trying but here role has no range. We got the stereotypical rich parents and we got the sexy but a little screwed up affair. Scarlett is not to blame because despite being sexy Charlotte you can see here why she became the star she is.
So let's talk about the only character in this movie and also his performance. I think I have never seen Jonathan Rhys Meyers in anything and after Matchpoint I am not shocked. Don't get me wrong. He is not terrible but he never passes mediocracy. Two huge problems here despite his performance. What an odd casting choice. He comes across very arrogant. I would cast him for a villainous role which is a major flaw right from the beginning because we never feel for him.
Second point is that is character is just not believable which I think is both the fault of his acting and the script. He is the former poor boy now enjoying the good life which will make him do crazy things. With one big exception. He never seems to care about any of it. You never see one single scene in this movie where he actually enjoys his wealth which he will explicitly state later that he enjoys it. He feels like going through the motions. And we ask ourselves: You moron why would you live this live and not be with Scarlett. You don't seem to enjoy it one bit right from the start.
The last half hour I don't want to dissect to not spoil anything but it get's into not one bit believable mode.
There is much more to pick apart here like the big cliche rain kissing scene straight out of a Nicholas Sparks movie but at this point it doesn't really matter. Bad script, bad lead actor, no interesting characters, bad dialog in a story that is predictable and 40 minutes to long. This is bad bad film making and if you would replace the directors name by someone else the rating would be much lower. Ridiculous."

","I am sorry but 10 is too low a score for this fantastic film. What a script! If ever Woody Allan gets depressed again he should read these comments and think again. Masterly - words are not enough. Matthew Goode - What a find. Fantastic presence on screen - should be the next James Bond - unfortunately I do not have a daughter - but if I had he could marry her tomorrow. The Cast throughout were beyond reproach. I have seen some good films in my time - but this was fabulous. Congratulations to all involved. Worthy of the highest praise. It is far too good to talk about the plot - just go and see it. I shall tell all my friends - this is the first time I have ever made a comment on line but believe me it is a pleasure to write. Looking forward to buying the DVD for myself and other copies for my friends. Thank you to all involved. Congratulations and best wishes for 2006 and beyond."

","I am fortunate enough to have a neighbor who receives just about every single movie come Oscar time... I was only excited for match point. <br/><br/>Maybe this is a large reason why I loved the movie so much, but truth be told, it was definitely a movie of the 'classic' set, and not because I had such high hopes. <br/><br/>Acting was great. Scarlett Johansen gave the movie something I couldn't put my hand on, but overall, the casting was done in such a way that i felt an awesome contrast among the cast, with Scarlett at the head. <br/><br/>Directing was precisely to the point, not cloyingly arty like a lot of movies today. As far as the story goes... oh just see the movie, it was pretty damn good."
"mk20t6458","3","17","34","1 December 2005"," A total disappointment from someone who has done much better
","What a dreadfully trite little film. Its view of the rich high life in London reeks of a Cinderella story with no substance and its characters and situations hold no interest for this film-goer. For me they are unbelievable and one-dimensional and the performances by the actors are in complete harmony, the whole creating a soporific experience. Scarlett Johansson has done herself no favors by this appearance for I feel the lackluster writing has dragged down her performance. The other actors blandly blend into the background and I was left wondering if the male lead was chosen for the resemblance of his mouth to that of Scarlett! Even Brian Cox, who can be wonderfully acerbic or a thoroughly nasty piece of work given the opportunity, is asked to portray a character without spine or interest. The direction is pedestrian, the film only getting some pace towards the last quarter. It must be assumed that Allen aimed for the pedestrian pace but it did not work for me. I am a fan of Woody Allen but I feel that this latest effort is not up to his normal standard, although I have not seen his later works. The premise is interesting but its exploration is not substantial enough for this film and Allen does not do it justice in any event."
"Dr_Coulardeau","10","14","27","11 December 2005"," More brilliant than brilliant
","Woody Allen is better than ever in this British-American anti-detective story. It is purely brilliant. The whole film is built on oppositions. One American girl and a very English business family, one Irishman and the same English business family, the Irish man and the American girl, and of course the two outsiders of this family will fall in love and have a passionate affair. But the American girl is a social climber somewhere, just like the Irishman. But she uses her getting pregnant to force her men to marry her, first the son of the English business family, and then the Irishman who has married the daughter of the English business family in the meantime. Unluckily the Irishman is just as much of a social climber as this American girl from Boulder, Colorado and he manages to get rid of her. So far banal. Perfectly well acted and literally pathetic. But then, the situation having been flushed down the drain  go see the film to know how  Woody Allen gets into a clear denunciation of the English police and an enormous wink at us about Hercule Poirot, Agatha Christie, Ruth Rendell, Sherlock Holmes, and even Doctor Watson. Allusion upon allusion about this nil and easily satisfied English police. That's were the film becomes a satire and a farce, and that is absolutely funny indeed. If you have been to London some time in your life, you will recognize the Gherkin, this famous building overlooking the City and competing with Big Ben as for originality. But you will not take one double-decker and go down into the underground once. Sorry, Woody Allen is not a tourist guide after all.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, Université Paris Dauphine, Université Paris I Panthéon Sorbonne"
"leo1","1","10","18","8 February 2006"," A passable story ruined by miscasting
","Rhys-Meyers is talentless. I have never seen such a wooden performance in my life. It's not often that Allen makes such a disastrous mistake. Hopefully we will not have to endure this actor again. Even the usually captivating Johansson is left drifting in this movie as she tries to act against a wooden plank. The story is passable, and the movie is somewhat redeemed by the twist and turns at the end and great performances from James Nesbitt and Ewan Bremner in the last 10 minutes of the movie. However the otherwise strong British cast is inexplicably under utilised. Great character actors such as John Fortune, Rupert Penry Jones and Penelope Wilton are reduced to bit parts with no redeeming dialogue. I am disappointed to say this about a movie by the Master, but my heartfelt advice would be to avoid this movie at all costs. 1/5"
"rob-1185","1","22","47","28 November 2005"," Seriously bad
","I love Woody Allen, so I write this review as a pained fan. I just saw a special screening in London of Match Point, and sad to say, it's the worst film I have seen in a long long time.<br/><br/>The dialogue is terrible. It's unconvincing, hackneyed and laughable (not in a good way). The use of London is pointless, except to use shots of Tate Modern and a couple of red buses and other clichés. If Woody actually thinks people in London live and talk like this, he is sadly mistaken.<br/><br/>The film drags. It's about 30 minutes too long, and has an exceptionally boring plot. There is nothing to recommend this film, except for a few nice supporting characters and lusting after Scarlett Johansson, whose performance is acceptable enough.<br/><br/>Avoid."

","Ugh. Stay away! Woody Allen's attempt at serious cinema falls shorter than his height! The story is non existent and a rehash of a rehash of a rehash of a rehash. Allen hasn't had an original idea since Annie Hall. Time to retire, Woody. Half the time it's impossible to understand the Brits. The other half of the time, you are GLAD you don't understand them! This is a movie for people who want to kid themselves that they are intellectual. If you like this flick, you are a wannabe. There is nothing original or interesting in this movie. People talk and talk and talk and nothing of import or interest happens. If you want to be bored out of your gourd, rent this junk. If you want a real good flick, get an Antonioni.

","This has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It is poorly cast and poorly acted. It was not entertaining at all; more on the line of irritating. My wife and I agreed that watching it gave us knots in our stomachs rather than being a relaxing or amusing experience. The only possible redeeming part of the movie is Scarlett Johansson: because she is so pretty but the part she plays is such a bitch not even that makes up for it. I have been a Woody Allen fan for years and can't believe that a comic like him could write such a script.I think he should return to stories like 'Mighty Aphrodite' that will entertain and amuse viewers."

","""MatchPoint"" is film-making at its best. This is the triumphant return of Woody Allen to the forefront of America's best film directors after a drought of inferior films lasting several years. Smartly-paced, excellent script, beautiful art direction (London has never looked better) and wonderfully performed by a superb cast, this is Allen's finest film achievement in over twenty years.This ranks amongst Allen's top films (Manhattan, Interiors, Annie Hall and Hannah and Her Sisters).When watching it there is not a scintilla of evidence that this is a film by Woody Allen but there is abundant evidence that this is a film by a master filmmaker.For its genre, they don't make films better than this!"

"Kneazel","8","12","23","16 December 2005"," Honest, shocking and very interesting
","I saw this film last night and I really enjoyed it.<br/><br/>It seemed to me to be a commentary on several things, one being luck and one being morality. Both of these things seemed to dictate quite a lot of the lives of the two main characters. On the one hand, it made it perfectly, brutally honestly clear that one's success in life depends quite a lot upon how lucky one is. While hard-work is necessary, one will not get far without being lucky enough to have a few doors opened to succeed. A beautiful illustration of this is drawn throughout the film using a tennis metaphor.<br/><br/>Another point made seems to be that, no matter how lucky you are, when you go against your conscience, you set yourself up for eventual unhappiness, no matter how lucky you have been. <br/><br/>I agree with the poster who said to go in without knowing much about the film. I've seen some early reviews that spoil quite a few things. Be warned that it is a long film and slow at times -- but worth it.<br/><br/>If I had only a few words to describe it, I would say it was very honest, very shocking, very sad and very beautiful."

Who are these actors and why aren't they working more? The entire cast had a great chemistry that made the film work. The ending was definitely a surprise as was the entire plot. It unfolded with brilliance. The end justified the means. It started slow but I loved every minute of it. The settings were great, almost refreshing. I loved the foreign setting. The set design was awesome. But let's not forget the symbolism. This film is so metaphoric almost like poetry. It makes you think about karma and decisions."
"lulu18","1","14","28","31 July 2006"," Awful
","Well, Woody has hit rock bottom. How original: boy wants to rise to the top and marries boss's daughter and then falls in love with a would-be actress.<br/><br/>Now there's an original story only this time performed by two utterly inadequate actors: Johanssen and Rhyse Meyers. Boring as hell.<br/><br/>Now, I suggest you watch Alain Delon in Purple Noon as a man on the rise to the top and/or Michael York in the amazing Something for Everyone, truly a masterpiece that has been grossly neglected.<br/><br/>Skip this one. Watch Crimes and Misdemeanors, which is much better and with Martin Landau. But Woody's movies are getting quite tiresome and there is no spark, such as that in Love and Death, Zelig, Take the Money and Run, Bananas. Not to mention Hannah and Her Sisters. I think the emperor has no clothes and the critics cannot see this."
"dave1176","1","8","14","6 August 2006"," One to miss
","Was Mr Allen trying to prove that he can make a great film without smart dialogue, without subplots, without an ensemble class and without any wit or humour? He succeeds in all points apart from 'great'. The plot is starkly linear. Only one character has any depth at all (the main one, Chris). All the others are foils  whilst generally beautifully acted  for Chris to react to. None of the other characters develop or really relate to Chris much.<br/><br/>The film is slow. Whilst it the plot is not predictable, it often pauses clumsily to bang a point home ('Chris is troubled. Look how troubled Chris is here') in a frankly amateurish straight-out-of-drama-school kind of manner. In a film supposedly about 'luck'  the plot seems very forced.<br/><br/>It does have redeeming features. Apart from the lead role (good in places  hard to swallow in others)  the performances were charming. I felt that England was portrayed particularly well, both London and the upper crust, especially considering the director was a New-Yorker. Although totally one dimensional, the plot did go to unexpected places and avoided cliché turns (mostly lets not talk about the ghosts). And the story did raise a few interesting issues, though I am not convinced they were the intended ones.<br/><br/>Overall, I was hugely disappointed. Woody Allen has managed to break any moulds in his film-making, but by doing so made something that looked like a novice's first attempt.<br/><br/>Like some of the other reviewers, I am astonished that anyone found this film to be 'good' in any way whatsoever."
"garcia_ric","8","18","38","13 November 2005"," Allen is back, Marilyn Monroe too
","I've been an Allen fan for many years. Like many others I was suspicious that their best years were gone. It's not true. The best Allen is back and renewed. All the elements that make a good film are here. The description of the characters, of the city, the music. All is really superb including the leading role of Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, a great surprise and all the supporting roles. Emily Mortimer as the perfect wife is fantastic too. Scarlett Johansson deserves a commentary apart. What can I say about her. She is different interpreting a kind of Marilyn Monroe. Absolutely sexy but a looser. It's very remarkable how a 20 years old woman plays such a difficult role with such a maturity and power. Really incredible. The genius of Woody Allen achieving a kind of merge between Hitchcock and Bergman has to be seen."
"lennart-6","1","11","21","16 August 2006"," Worst Woody Allen movie ever
","It's boring, slow and for the most part heavily uninteresting. The plot is for all of the movie except the ending, completely and utterly predictable even in minor details.<br/><br/>Allen even failed in the direction of the actors. Jonathan Rhys Meyers says his lines as if he is reading them out of a prompter.<br/><br/>The movie picks up a bit at the end and the ending 15 minutes are not completely predictable, but it doesn't save the movie. Most of the excitement in the end comes from knowing that you don't have to suffer through any more of this half hour detective story stretched out to a numbing two hour movie.<br/><br/>See any other Woodie Allen movie but this one."
"simpletonistic","1","11","21","13 January 2006"," Match Point a Dud
","Too bad for Woody Allen, his earlier films set such a high bar for himself that one can't go into one of his films without expectations. I won't be the last to point out that he has delivered a few recent flops: ""Hollywood Ending"" and ""Anything Else"" to name but two. Nevertheless, hope springs eternal within Woody fans such as myself, and when I heard that his latest movie ""Match Point"" was garnering some critical acclaim that spurred me to get out to my local theater to see for myself if the buzz was apropos. <br/><br/>The story, an oft told Guy meets someone else's Girl and eventually gets Girl pregnant while Guy is married to another girl tale, is set in present-time London.<br/><br/>The Guy is Chris Wilton (played by Jonathon Rhys-Meyers), a failed tennis pro who enters the mix upon being hired at a tennis club catering to a filthy rich clientèle. Mr. Rhys-Meyers seems as likely a tennis ace as Danny Devito is a body builder. Bony as an English rock guitarist and sporting the tennis stroke of a grandmother, Rhys-Meyers fails on all levels to convince me that Chris Wilton used to give tennis all-stars like Andre Agassi a good game.<br/><br/>As for the Girl, she's a failing American actress named Nola Rice. Scarlett Johansson whose star is falling faster than a rejected American Idol plays her. While hoping to look hip or appealing Ms. Johansson comes off looking like a flailing porn star, what with her collagen-enhanced lips pumped up to 45 pounds per square inch. From what she tells Chris she appealed to her ex-fiancé, Tom Hewett (played by Matthew Goode), only because of his insolent need to play against his mother's desire for him to marry a girl suitable to the family's upper class standing.<br/><br/>That Nola immediately appeals to Chris is not surprising, as they are both underdogs cast into a society that only appreciates show dogs. What is surprising is that they hit it off so deeply upon their initial meeting at the Hewett manse. <br/><br/>In the scene Chris is led through the house into a game room within which Nola is playing Ping-Pong. Upon entering an old uncle is seen exiting with his tail between his legs, a victim of Nola's vicious game. After the uncle vacates the room Chris and Nola exchange one volley. That's all--one volley. As in, ping and pong. Subsequently, as Chris' Pong was a put-away shot of a poor, high-bouncing serve, Nola concedes to his superior skills.<br/><br/>The ensuing scene will cause you to squirm in your seat. <br/><br/>Its plotting is totally unbelievable while the dialog is sophomoric, loaded with bland tennis metaphors ill-conceived by Allen. Both characters speak of ""serves"" and ""taking chances"" and ""following through,"" getting closer and closer and closer while dispensing double entendre's culled from decrepit vaudeville routines. Mind you, they JUST MET within the prior SIXTY SECONDS and Nola's fiancé, Tom, is in the next room! Prior to this scene one has been given no reason to believe that Chris is such a skirt-chasing sleaze-ball. <br/><br/>The scene is neither racy nor intriguing, instead it is forced and distracting.<br/><br/>I could give you ten other examples of such ridiculous exchanges.<br/><br/>Throughout this film Allen's dialog, spoken by the tight-lipped, London-based upper crustaceans populating this film, is as palatable as freezer-burned ice cream. He might have been better served choosing London's lower gentry as players too. I say that because his actors play their parts to English stereotypes grafted from films featuring stodgy, fox-hunting English types. Thus, whatever laughs or innuendos might have been wrought from the dreadfully predictable screenplay were given short shrift by the tight-lipped Brits populating the cast. They speak the King's English as if competing in the finals of a speech contest.<br/><br/>Allen's choice of music has hit rock bottom in terms of his usage of soundtrack to cue our emotions. Throughout the film we are led from scene to scene via songs from the operas ""La Traviata"" and ""Rigoletto."" Having put forth such preposterous scenes as described above Allen's employment of dramatic overtures is, in fact, torturous, if not out-right, insulting. Had he written a screenplay capable of agitating our emotions he would not have had to resort to the trite usage of dramatic music to point us in the direction he sought.<br/><br/>With all that going against it, there is little wonder that ""Match Point"" has little entertainment value. The simpleton plot is stretched out tediously. Seasons pass while the obvious tension between Chris and Nola, and Chris and his impregnable wife, Chloe, remain static, unmoving. Never given the chance to evolve their disagreements or disputes, and often portrayed as either buffoons (Chloe, who never thoroughly investigates any suspicion she has of her husband) or ignoramuses (Mr. Hewett, the family patriarch who knows...nothing), there isn't one character that you evinces any emotional attachment.<br/><br/>Truly, by movie's end you want them all just to go away."
"loberant","1","10","19","16 July 2006"," Absolute Garbage
","This movie was absolute garbage. I know there are worse movies, but that's not exactly a ringing endorsement. This movie is nothing but a bunch of rich people sleeping with each other and acting as if being wealthy is some sort of curse. Then finally! something happens. Someone gets shot. Then some police officers who don't seem to be very keen on actually finding a murderer. Then its over. Ninety percent of the moving is complaining, whining and some sex scenes (and its not like they are that sexy). The characters have no character so its not as if character development could be occurring. And to those that have compared this movie to Dostoyevsky and other great writers have obviously never read any of those great writers. A book based on this movie would perhaps be all of fifty pages long, if that long. Skip this one. It belongs in the same category as ""White Chicks"" and similar...

","When the late great Johnny Carson did comedy, one of his adages was, If you buy the bit, you buy the premise. In Match Point, I couldn't buy the bit or the premise. Here are a bunch of characters that you cared very little for, including Scarlett Johannsen. What happens to her in the end was a relief for the audience. She is unpleasant and stiff with the portrayal. I found myself skipping chapters to get to the end of this thing. It takes forever to get to any plot development and you have to wonder why she was to be such a vixen or temptress to these guys. If she was there just for the sex, she was boring in that. No was no chemistry in any of the scenes that would warrant this guy to risk his job and marriage to her.

Scarlett Johansson is certainly an unbelievably beautiful woman but not since Helen Hunt have I seen a more misguided and talent-free actress pretending to be really into the ""craft."" I say that because you can almost see her acting wheels turning, thinking she's really sinking her teeth in here. Obviously she requires a director with a surer hand with actors. Maybe Sofia Coppola knows what she's doing after all, because Johansson was 1,000 times more erotic and captivating in that film. And she and Bill Murray had serious chemistry. Something missing in Match Point.<br/><br/>I hate to concentrate mostly on character development and acting, but they were so lacking in this movie.

","I am a huge Allen fan and own many of his movies and almost saw all of his movies (that's quite a lot!). Among them, there is the excellent 1989 movie ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"", starring a wonderful Martin Landau and Angelica Houston.<br/><br/>A user has written that ""Allen discovers new terrain"" with Matchpoint. Well, in which sense? Matchpoint has the same moral content and the basic plot is identical to the above 1989 movie.<br/><br/>Do not get me wrong: No one more than Allen deserves (also) commercial success for his movies, something that did not quite happened since the mid 80ies. But I think if you like this one, it's probably because the cast corresponds to what 20ies now recognize to be ""actors"". So do not laud this and ignore other, much more important gems from this brilliant genius."
"mojo282","4","5","8","17 August 2006"," Could have been good - unfortunately, the acting lets it down considerably (spoilers)
","I went into Match Point expecting a fairly good watch. I'd heard only positive things, so was looking forward to an enjoyable film. However, the moment the voice-over intoned: 'life is all about luck', or some such drivel, and the tennis metaphors began in earnest, I thought uh-oh.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong - Allen almost got it so right. Without a doubt, this story had the potential to be so great, but it more or less went wrong at every turn. The script felt forced; although in deference to Allen, that may simply be due to the mechanical; robotic delivery of the protagonists.<br/><br/>Rhys Meyers, in my opinion was simply unwatchable in the first hour of the film. It seemed to me he was concentrating so intently on mastering the upper class English accent that he forgot to act. Albeit, he is supposed to be from Ireland and thus would be trying to fit in in an upper crust world - and so perhaps that is a genuine character trait. HOwever, if that is the case, it is the only trait that Meyers deigned to imbue the character with. From the outset, he is simply boring to watch. You don't care what he does, or what happens to him, simply because he is such a dullard.<br/><br/>Johannson disappoints also. It was as if she couldn't be bothered. I have to confess, I'm not as enamoured with her as the rest of the industry; I think she is particularly overrated as an actress. However, I do think she displays an incredible naturalism in Lost in Translation. But I couldn't buy her as a vixen one moment; mother the next; desperate mistress the next. And the scene where she calls him a liar; well, I had to fast forward; it was embarrassing. Not in its melodrama, as I sense that was meant to be her character; simply because she didn't pull it off.<br/><br/>And the 'ghost / dream' scene?! It was like watching an A-Level drama play! That's not to say there aren't positive things; Emily Mortimer and Brian Cox and Meyer's wife and father in law respectively are predictably good. IN fact, Mortimer is one of the saving graces of this film. My only grievance is that her character is not developed nearly enough - even though she gets a lot of screen time, she is merely used as a plot device; where she could have been so much more.<br/><br/>The story also has so much going for it. But, to my mind, the lead acting is inexcusable, and makes a potentially great film distinctly awful. I'll credit Woody for one thing - as an homage to London, Match Point works. It made me miss my home town. But as a thriller / drama / intrigue? Match POint doesn't quite cut it."

Such a shame that ninety percent of this film is toilet.<br/><br/>Now, I am quite well read when it come to Allen and his films. I have books on the subject and have seen his films. This film was the first film in a while that I really wanted to turn off. The story premise is good, a nice idea and the last fifteen minutes are pretty good BUT, this is a big BUT; Jonathan Rhys Meyers's acting absolutely KILLS the film. His acting STINKS. All the other actors seem to be fine in there parts but Meyers just cant act. I have to point out that this probably has allot to do with Allens directing style and Meyers just is'nt experienced enough to handle the directors free-wheeling approach with actors. There is even a point in the film where it appears the editor left in a moment where he fluffs his lines. Its that bad. He's playing a man from a working class background who is a tennis coach (very American) but when he speaks he sounds like and upper class twit with piles.<br/><br/>Another bad point about this film is how American its views are. Some of he lines that the characters spout are very American in there language. Also the view of London. The capital, also my home I should add, is portrayed as it is on postcards. Full of white snobs, Horse Gaurds, designer shops, red phone box's, black cabs. I could go on. The view of London blinkered to the point I was offended by it. No sign whatsoever of the richly multi cultural London, REAL London. I suspect if there were scenes in Waterloo Station we would see steam trains and bowler hats.<br/><br/>The characters themselves are also despicable. I don't know if this is what Allen wanted but I didn't like any of them.<br/><br/>Not a disappointing film. Meyers's just kills it dead in its tracks and Allen's view of London is just so naive and offensive. The last fifteen minutes are good and the supporting actors are good.<br/><br/>Woody, your films are great! Go home! Please go home! For your own good!"
"markvc1","5","5","8","31 July 2006"," Autobiographical?
","I have questions about the ghost sequence. Is Woody Allen using the two ghosts characters to comment on his own life and work? Consider: 1) Before they arrive, he's apparently fallen asleep writing at his computer, wakes up, and then continues writing. What's he writing? He doesn't care sufficiently about work to be up writing emails. In fact, nothing we know about this character would cause him to write ANYTHING obsessively. Only someone who is a WRITER does this kind of thing, ie, someone like Woody Allen.<br/><br/>2) Just before the ghosts arrive, what's he doing? Looking in the mirror.<br/><br/>3) When the ghosts speak, they're looking almost directly at the camera and we can't see him - leaves it a bit ambiguous as to whom they're speaking to.<br/><br/>4) The things they SAY don't completely fit with the movie. Scarlett's character says prepare to pay the price, what you did was clumsy and full of holes. First of all, he doesn't pay the price, and second ""full of holes"" is not a phrase we use to describe how crimes are committed. It's a phrase we use to describe the plots of movies. When she says ""your child paid the price"", who's she talking about? These statements are a lot closer to being a commentary on the movie, which is a bit clumsy and full of holes, and on Woody's life, in which children have gotten hurt. Older women have gotten hurt too.<br/><br/>Is it possible that Woody's message to the world with ""Match Point"" is: There is no point to anything, and I don't have any more stories to tell, but I still have bills to pay, so here's another movie? And by the way, I haven't been much of a mensch in several ways, so here are two characters to read me the riot act?"
"bligeri","2","5","8","19 July 2006"," The Greatest Movie Ever? Or the Worst? You decide.
","OVERVIEW: Woody Allen finally does what no other screenwriter/filmmaker has ever even dared to attempt. Not only does he break every dark taboo, he simultaneously flirts with an idea which is bound to put him on the controversial side of the barbed wire fence: exploring the possibility that all men are not gold diggers, and that some men are attracted to women who are hot and sexy more so than they are attracted to women who are ugly and boring, despite their prominent fathers. I'll let the world judge him on that. I like my neutral image.<br/><br/>THEMATIC SPOILER WARNING: note: normally, you can mention a movie's theme without risking much spoilation, but because of the neoteric properties of this theme, just putting it out in the brisk of the air, we risk loss of nuance. Well, you've been warned, and without further ado, here are the two neoteric themes.<br/><br/>After committing a crime of passion (murder), you could be haunted by your crime, even up to the point where you might spill your wine glass near your laptop, even when your laptop is not in sleep mode. **don't you dare tell me THAT'S been done before, either, because I call bologna.<br/><br/>An opera aria can reveal a character's mood of tension, without the need for a direct line of dialogue for the actor which says, ""My mood is tense.""

","""Crimes & Misdemeanors"" in England - truly wonderful ensemble cast, sans leads: Johansson & Meyers. Incredible sets/locations!

Johansson saddled as the American 'piece of fluff', reprising Mira Sorvino in Mighty Aphrodite? An awful mess and no sympathy whatever engendered by the leads! Very hard to sit through without throwing up.<br/><br/>Do give it a miss."
"de-randolph","4","5","8","1 April 2006"," Woddy Allen should stay away from suspense
","This movie was great with one glaring exception: the plot is hopelessly flawed. Nola was pregnant and she kept a diary. The police couldn't seem to agree whether Chris was a proper suspect, yet doesn't anyone think that Nola's diary would have made mention of the fact of her pregnancy? And that Chris wanted her to abort and she refused? And that Chris would not tell his wife he was leaving her for Nola? And that Nola had threatened to speak to the wife herself if Chris didn't go through with his promised break-up? And of course, a jerk like Chris wouldn't leave his wife after he had married into all that money, him being from such a poor background. And the fact that he worked for his father-in-law, so his job goes away along with his inheritance if he leaves his wife, would further motivate him to do away with Nola in a discrete fashion.<br/><br/>Come on. A little suspension of disbelief might go a long way, but not nearly this far. The police should have been all over Chris like . . . Well, you get the picture. True, the two policemen grudgingly admitted Chris had a motive. Wow! What brilliant deduction! I cannot imagine a greater motive. Realistically, Chris might get away with it in the end, but only after the cops finish an exhaustive investigation of the affair and his married life and remain convinced of Chris' guilt while lacking the proof. But that would have messed up the theme of the movie--better to be lucky than good--because his wife's family would have seen Chris for the fraud he really was and there would have gone the good life Chris so lusted for.<br/><br/>In my opinion this movie was neither lucky nor good. So Woody,I think you should go back to making comedies about neurotic, lovable characters and leave Hitchcock to rest peacefully in his grave."
"Maciste_Brother","8","4","6","9 July 2006"," I enjoyed it
","Sure, MATCH POINT is sorta predictable and never really catches fire, like some early Woody Allen films, such as MANHATTAN or ANNIE HALL, but I actually enjoyed it more than I thought I would. What I liked (and I believe is the main point those who didn't like it clearly overlooked), is that the story is like Greek tragedy seen through the sardonic eyes of Woody Allen, which is what makes it so special.<br/><br/>It seems like the majority of the characters simply go through the motions here, chatting, being snobby, etc. But the bulk of the characters of the story serve as background to the grand tableau that Allen created here. Much of it is sorta trite but then again most of these folks are trite in real life. The main characters are mostly unlikeable but again, that's the whole point of the Greek tragedy aspect of the story. The story IS the main character and we, the audience, simply watch it unfold in front of our eyes.<br/><br/>What makes the movie so great is the ending. The conclusion is brilliant and gives weight and importance to what seemed before as somewhat superficial and melodramatic.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the ensemble cast (even though I believe Clive Owen would have been great in the character Jonathan Rhys Meyers plays), the movie looked great and I was pleasantly entertained. What more can a moviegoer ask for?"
"kenjha","8","4","6","25 June 2006"," Game, Set, and Match to Mr. Allen
","Woody's first film outside New York is like a breath of fresh air. Here he revisits the dramatic landscape of ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" with shades of ""Crime and Punishment"" and ""A Place in the Sun."" However, he masterfully blends all these familiar themes into something his very own, thanks to a clever script. Rhys Meyers, who played Elvis Presley earlier and certainly resembles him, is fine as a social-climbing tennis pro caught between two women. Johansson looks ravishing as the object of his affection and she gives a terrific performance as the other woman. In weaving his intriguing tale, Allen generates some suspenseful moments that would do Hitchcock proud."
"howard.schumann","3","4","6","15 May 2006"," Whatever Nola wants, Nola gets
","Match Point has been hailed as an example of a Woody Allen comeback. If this is the best he can do to remind people of his past glory, it's time to re-release Annie Hall. Aside from the standard Allen cynical and negative world view, this film has uninteresting, cardboard characters who exhibit a complete and utter lack of self-awareness. Allen is apparently so enamored of the British upper class that he endows them with a glamour and cultured elegance that borders on fantasy, and his depiction of women ranges from hysterical to clinging to morally insensitive. Allen's own philosophy is well expressed at the outset by the main character Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), a former Tennis pro who reads Dostoevsky but whose outlook on life is south of Samuel Beckett.<br/><br/>""The man who said 'I'd rather be lucky than good' saw deeply into life"", he philosophizes. ""People are afraid to face how great a part of life is dependent on luck. It's scary to think so much is out of one's control. There are moments in a match when the ball hits the top of the net, and for a split second it can either go forward or fall back. With a little luck, it goes forward and you win...or maybe it doesn't, and you lose."" So much for skill, experience, and the power of intention in life. Set in a London that is barely recognizable to most ordinary people, Wilton is hired as a tennis instructor and his first pupil is a member of the wealthy Hewitt family, Tom (Matthew Goode). Affable but rather vacuous, Tom is engaged to be married to the sultry Nola (whatever Nola wants, Nola gets) played by Scarlet Johanssen.<br/><br/>Chris can't take his eyes off Nola but falls under the spell of Tom's sister, Chloe (Emily Mortimer) who seems to be more obsessed with the idea of love, marriage, and children than with the reality. It is not long before Chloe gets her wish to make momma happy and Chris becomes part of the family, working for dear old dad in the business world. The two seem to share a love of the opera but in a way that is so detached and devoid of emotion they could just as well be addicted to hanging wallpaper.<br/><br/>Bored with the job and guilty about his inability to make Chloe pregnant (another run of bad luck presumably), Chris thoughts turn to the more appealing Nola but when Nola gets pregnant instead of Chloe (darn the luck), some serious decisions have to be made. Try as I might, I found no interest in the characters, their outlook on life, and little concern for how it all turned out. To say I found the ending as appalling as the beginning doesn't imply that I found anything worthwhile in between. The only plus I can allude to is that Allen does not appear on screen. Chalk it up to luck."
"joesorce","2","4","6","10 May 2006"," Woody Has Lost It
","The plot of this movie is totally absurd and overblown, like an idea that Woody had while sitting on the toilet. Basically a 2 minute joke-of-a-plot expanded to a 90 minute movie. Johnathan Rhys Meyers gives the worst performance since Mariah Carey in Glitter,and though Woody Allen is known for coaxing great performances out of his actors, Scarlett Johannsen has never been worse. There can be no other explanation. There's no way that the man who gave us ""Annie Hall"" and ""Bananas"" could have come up with this misfire. The critical raves are beyond me. This one must have been written and directed by Soon Yi, that's the only explanation that I can come up with for this boring piece of garbage."
"efitness","3","4","6","6 May 2006"," Crimes and Misdemeanors 2005
","*This Comment is ALL spoilers*<br/><br/>Have you ever caught someone doing something unethical, say, stealing something small from a workplace; they rationalize their motives to you, you let it pass, but every time they see you they feel the need to keep re-convincing you that what they did was OK? Well that's what it's been like watching Woody Allen movies lately. Ever since the Soon-Yi thing, Allen keeps making one film after another in which the point is stressed that morality is subjective (if it exists at all) and that there is no punishment or justice for the wicked, merely randomness and the healing blanket of time.<br/><br/>""Match Point"" is merely ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" with exclamation points and one wonders why Mr. Allen is shouting so loud and so often. Given the brittle framework both films are built upon (We HAVE to believe that no other options are available to the protagonists), one senses that perhaps he doesn't buy into the cold cynicism any more than I do.<br/><br/>Why make essentially the exact same film if one doesn't have anything new to add? As I was watching ""Match Point"" I was aware that I had been down this road before, but what kept my interest was my certainty that surely a new locale, a younger cast and the passing of 15 years (not to mention a director who had waded through his own ethical quagmire) would bring me to a new place at the conclusion. Not exactly. The biggest twist ending this film had for me was that there was NO twist ending! It was the same pseudo-philosophical clap-trap he'd fed us before (only better). Why didn't he just name it ""Crimes and Misdemeanors 2005"" and be done with it? <br/><br/>A couple of complaints: 1) I know that women get fooled by bad liars every day of the week, and judging by the throngs populating daytime talk shows, many are knocked up and abandoned by them as well. However, the women in this film are written as such dolts! She  ""Are you having an affair?"" He- ""No, of course not!"" Well, that settles that! Every time a man is accused of cheating he will break down and tell the truth when asked point blank. No need to trust your instincts or use your brain, just go exclusively by what your sweaty, pale and shifty-eyed husband is saying.<br/><br/>2) A thriller that relies on deception fails to be very engrossing when, in order for it to progress, EVERYBODY in sight has to be an easily duped fool. If the rich were this unsuspicious of the poor, then every pool boy, personal trainer and yoga instructor in Los Angeles would never mind.<br/><br/>Only rave: The film was beautifully shot and Scarlett Johansson was better than the film deserved."
"dgallagher-6","1","4","6","13 February 2006"," Wooden
","Not having seen a Woody Allen movie for many years I was lured in by a couple of big headline reviews. $10.25 later I wish I had had the Pasta dish instead. This heavy, wooden movie at least provided a scenic tour of London and part of the countryside. The actors mouthed dialogue like students in a high school production. Scenes were repetitive and clunky. And the attempts at Cinema-Theater were hammered into our heads. The plot contrivances require too much of a suspension of disbelief. And a few hints at backstory would help the characters gain our sympathy. The audience in attendance (3rd Av.and 86th Street) groaned as a chorus throughout. I suspect they were (and still want to be) Woody fans from way back. Keep plugging away, Woody. Better luck next time."
"poc-1","7","4","6","7 January 2006"," Too long and slow starting but rewarding in the end
","Slow starting and overlong, this movie lacked pace for the first hour. There was a plot building but so slow that I was starting to get bored. I liked the acting and the eye-candy (Johanssen and Rhys-Meyers) but the director could have made it move much faster. Some of the dialogue was stilted which is an unexpected weakness in a Woody Allen film. There also were several opportunities for more humour that were lost. Eventually the plot kicked off and it grabbed my attention back. The last twenty minutes and the conclusion were superb. Rhys-Meyers acting and accent also followed the same curve, at the beginning he really sounded awkward. I thought his Irish accent sounded wrong - until I realised he has a natural Irish accent. The clipped English dialogue and idioms were wrong for an Irish character. However, in the final twenty minutes he really delivered.<br/><br/>It is so much better when a movie starts bad but ends well than the other way round."
"ijackson-3","1","10","20","16 January 2006"," Very disappointing
","Within the first 5 minutes I was uncomfortable with this film. Poor script, shallow characters, wooden acting, weak story, abrupt editing -- it had it all. The best parts in the film were the opera sound tracks. I think the majority of the (Cambridge) audience agreed, and were often laughing nervously at the dialogue. I think Woody Allen has lost the plot. It looks as if he is trying to showcase London, and a certain privileged social class and it's shenanigans for the US market but has failed to make a convincing movie. There was simply no chemistry between the lead and Scarlett Johanssen, and the scenes in which they agonised over when he was going to tell his wife were very weak and unconvincing. In my view, save your money."
"linak11","2","10","20","6 January 2006"," Bad Woody Allen, Bad!
","I'm a WA fan. I must say that even Bullets Above Broadway is one of my favorite movies. I also saw Mighty Aphrodites and Everybody Says I love You, and that should have warned me that post-Mia Farrow Woody is a sorry juggler of banalities and clichés, but this pitiful attempt at making a meaningful statement about life was truly painful to watch.<br/><br/>No matter how hard they try, American filmmakers just can't make a good ""European"" movie. Not even if they film it in Europe and pile in it a group of first class European actors in secondary roles as the ""odd yet lovable characters"" - which these true professionals easily chew and spit out. This film is trivial, slow-paced, boring and unimaginative. Every step is predictable and borrowed from old European movies, especially French ones with a strong Alan Delon feel to them and some British ""perfect crime"" movies. But none of this was developed well enough to make a statement, to surprise viewers, or at least to delight them.<br/><br/>Jonathan Rhys-Meyers has striking good looks, but they wore off as his unambitious performance of a supposedly charismatic and charming character made me want to hurl my soda at him (several times). The typically ""European"" hints and connections that were supposed to tie this concoction together could not be any less subtle. As if Woody Allen was trying to scream at you - Look, look how cleverly I brought all of this together! Remember that scene at the beginning? This is where it all should become clear to you, people!!! Yippi Yey!! <br/><br/>The only dynamic and imaginative thing in this pathetic and unremarkable cinematographic event was the view of London and of different living conditions you can find there for very different prices. Apparently WA is working for the Home and Garden channel now. The before and after of Chris Wilton looked like an episode on ""Saved by Design"". This was also the only aspect of the movie that had significant range, unlike the leading man's acting ability.<br/><br/>Honestly, go see The Matador or anything else with Pierce Brosnan - him and Renee Russo in The Thomas Crown Affair were what Scarlet Johansson and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers should want to be when they grow up."
"scott_bernstein","8","10","20","15 December 2005"," A little long; a bit too much opera, but absolutely worth it
","Match Point is an excellent new film from Woody Allen. While not exactly a classic on the level of some of 70's-80's run of films, this one will surely stand out among much of his recent output.<br/><br/>The setup is pure Woody -- a love triangle where the protagonist falls for his fiancée's brother's fiancée. Like a train wreck, we cannot turn away as we watch Chris, a former tennis pro hurtling towards his destiny. His fate, brought about by his own passion-clouded choices winds up being one in which he eventually must choose between staying married to the woman who is ""cute"", ""nice"", sensible, and most importantly, filthy rich and (along with her Daddy who employs him) helping provide him with an affluent lifestyle he could hardly afford otherwise; or escape from his marriage to be with the ""other woman"" that he can hardly contain his passion for.<br/><br/>As the latest in Woody's long line of ""femme fatales"", Scarlett Johansson certainly fits the bill in this film. Clearly, Woody relishes having her on camera, which lovingly lingers over her features; and while she smolders in many scenes, she never quite ignites in any of them. In fact, she seems to be the only character who exhibits any passion at all in this screenplay -- most other characters barely show any emotion (though this might be a reflection of Woody's depiction of the Brits, who are notorious for keeping their emotions bottled up).<br/><br/>Set in London, this film is a first for Woody, since nearly his entire output has been set in Manhattan, and (as it's often been pointed out) New York City is often as much a character in his films as any of the actors are. London does seem to play a similar role as New York City has in the past for Woody here -- he seemed to enjoy playing the tourist, taking us to a number of well-known tourist locations (including a key scene in the Tate Gallery).<br/><br/>Similarly, another signature of Woody Allen -- the great classic jazz that he features in the soundtrack (probably related to his vision of classic New York City, whose history is inextricable from jazz history) has been supplanted with a soundtrack stacked from beginning to end with classic opera music (I guess Mr. Allen must similarly equate London with opera?). In fact, the opera soundtrack is featured in an extremely prominent manner in most of the key scenes. Personally, I felt like he went overboard in his use of opera music -- I'm not much of a fan, and while I can appreciate others' enjoyment of it; it's just not to my taste.<br/><br/>My only real complaint was that the movie was significantly longer than most of Woody's films, and did get a touch tedious in the middle (Scarlett's character Nola has a number of repetitious scenes) before a major plot twist shifted things into high gear. A few nips and tucks (along with a little less opera) would have made for a sublime movie with a bit faster pacing and could probably be done without losing any narrative flow."
"zayde5","10","10","20","14 December 2005"," Luck, in all its glory
","Match Point is the story of luck in our lives, and how it can alter any outcome so easily. The first line of the film says: ""The man who said I'd rather be lucky than good saw deeply into life."" And so the film is.<br/><br/>The brilliance of this film was unexpected, even though I do take pride in saying that I have loved EVERY Woody film and have seen all of them while owning most. My two cents: don't read reviews, go in not knowing a thing. It is too brilliant to be spoiled by outside minds. See it for what it is and be blown away. The shock and heartbreak and laughter and power go along way with this one. Don't be surprised if it takes home the Best Picture win this year, for it is Woody's finest accomplishment since Deconstructing Harry, and on a completely different level."

","I was so pleasantly surprised by this. I went with really low expectations, since I think Woody's recent (as in last 10 years) films have been horribly tired and half-hearted. Even the camera-work was beginning to look the same all the time,<br/><br/>This is a Wooody Allen film without the clichéd old Woody Allen-isms, and a real pleasure to watch. London seems to have invigorated him. And, the plot is actually interesting - his most interesting since Crimes and Misdemeanors, I think.<br/><br/>Emily Mortimer was particularly good as the wife. And, I loved the litte cameo by Spud from ""Trainspotting"""
"bonnieyouth","3","15","33","1 January 2006"," I think that Mr. Allen needs to get a new lease on life.
","Mr. Allen's theme is getting quite tiresome to me. He is so overtly cynical about the human condition (and its possibility for change) that I find him quite boring. Honestly, I can't figure out why people think this film is so good. The acting was fine and the cinematography was also good, but the movie was about people I just don't care about. It might do Mr. Allen a world of good to get out among real people and get to know them. While we all have our issues, I think that he might find a glimmer of hope among some of them. I would certainly introduce him to my friends and colleagues and maybe he might change his mind.<br/><br/>There was a time when he found some beauty within people. ""Broadway Danny Rose"" comes to mind. It's not that I don't find many of his past movies filled with brilliance, even ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"", which thematically is an exact duplicate of ""Match Point,"" but the unbelievable crush of cynicism is too much to bear."
"mcsawley","8","13","28","1 November 2005"," Misdeamanor, surely
","The casting is excellent both for the main actors and for the supporting role. Chris Wilton almost never smiles, thorn and dramatic figure. He discovers that he has a dark side of this personality which ruins the unbelievable luck that his other personality attracts. Nola Rice puts a brave face on the fact that she inspires only lust and not love, until she cannot take it any longer. This a film about discovering who you really are. As in Dostoievsky's story, and because he escapes justice from the humans, whatever he does, Wilton knows he never find any peace: this is the worst of the punishment because he understands he will be confronted with what he did every day of his life on earth, and beyond."

","On Thursday January 12th my mom brother and I decided to go to a Double header of movies first we went to see Rumor has it and then to the movie Match Point. After seeing the trailers and previews for Match Point I could have cared less whether or not I saw it because (A) It was rated R and rated R could mean horror and I don't handle horror very well and (B) because it thought it was going to be a stuck up, stuffy,arrogant tennis movie(eww) not my kind of movie. But i decided to see it anyway. I am so glad I did. Match point starts out as a tennis ball going back and forth over the net and the narrator saying something to the effect of how it is usually more import to be lucky then be good because you and have lots of talent but without lucky you will have a hard time going anywhere just then the ball hits the net and goes up in the air and the ball could got over the net for a point and win or it could fall and you lose the match there it is up to luck the ball fall to the other side of the net and luck went the shooters way. Now I wont spoil the movie because it would be a shame for you to know what happiness going into the movie but lets just say being lucky will come into play again in a BIG way later in the movie! One thing I loved about this movie is that it kept you guessing the whole way. Another thing i loved it the movies ""Unperiditcability"", and how you think luck went against Chris(the main character) but we find out that luck couldn't have been more on his side. It turns out the movie has really nothing to do with tennis with the exception of a few scenes where the characters are hitting the ball back and forth or and occasional reference to going to play a tennis after work or something but thats about it. There is a famous saying "" you can't judge a book by its cover"" now that is true about 30% of the time for me for example If i see a book's with a picture of an old man lying out for his teeth on the cover of a book and the title is the autobiography of Bill Clinton I GUARANTEE you i wont like it so there for i just judged a book by its cover and in this case i was right(the 70%).The title Match point is part if the 30% that i agree with the statement this title (Match Point) does this movie NO JUSTICE. When I Hear the title Match point and you look at the cover I would think this movie is about tennis and it really wasn't.This movie was a suspenseful, action packed, thriller and when i hear match point it implies none of those. So pay no attention to the title when considering going to see this movie.<br/><br/>After you see the movie Match Point you will have no choice but to agree with me when I saw that this movie was by far the best Woody Allen movie EVER!<br/><br/>Kelly (age:14)"

The dialogue is laughable from beginning to end - English people don't talk like this, in fact nobody talks like this. It was a badly scripted version of a soap opera. Woody has obviously not spent any time in England talking to real people - even the upper classes don't talk in the contrived, awkward way the characters do here. The ending, which I'm not going to give away, was enormously implausible.<br/><br/>An enormous disappointment, avoid at all costs."

","Had the plot not got livelier in the last half hour, I would have given this 1/10. Seriously, it is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It's boring, pretentious, stilted and insanely implausible, with wooden acting and the worst dialogue this side of George Lucas (who at least has the excuse of making fantasy movies). Less than two hours after I left the cinema, I'm still wondering how the man who made one of my top 25 films  Sweet and Lowdown, in 1999  could have been responsible for this drivel. Woody, you have lost it, mate, and you clearly have no ear for how the British speak. So many unintentionally funny lines! ""I grew up in Belgravia  maybe I could show you around London?""

","This movie is ridiculously uncomfortable to sit through. I checked my watch after only 45 minutes and seriously thought I had been there for two and a half hours. It is deceivingly disturbing and the kind of movie that makes you squirm constantly. I know some like feeling that kind of tension when they see new films, however I would rather jump off a bridge or watch 20 mary kate and ashley movies in a row than see this movie again. There is a weird scene in the end of the movie featuring an otherworldly Scarlett Johansen that just doesn't even make sense in the context. I felt like I was watching a cheesy lifetime or scifi movie at this point rather than an intellectual drama. Scarlett Johansen and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers had an attraction and chemistry that seemed to work but also made the viewer squeamish at their unnatural obsession. Woody Allen is indeed a freak."

Not a single redeeming feature save Matthew Goodes performance and Scarlett Johansson proving she can act.<br/><br/>Where to start. The acting was terrible. Shame on Brain Cox and Penelope Wliton for getting involved with this mess. Just what was going on at the casting office when they cast Jonathan Rhys Meyers, standing a skinny 5ft 8"" and playing a former international tennis star????? The tennis scenes were laughable, he was playing a tennis coach. Oh Woody, woody. Is he a sociopath a la The talented Mr Ripley, all the aspirational stuff is there, art, Dostoevsky, opera, grouse shoots....etc...but the character/actor is so annoyingly wooden and devoid of any emotion he is totally unbelievable. The cardboard clichés the other actors inhabit was shocking, as were the London locations, all those Minis!!!!,......Woody Allen made Richard Curtis look like Fellini. Everything so terribly contrived I'm getting angry just remembering.<br/><br/>Also, when a shotgun goes off in an enclosed space, it is VERY, VERY loud, not only that, it went off twice without anyone batting an eyelid, in the flats or in the street.<br/><br/>The diary plot twist was a joke. Could have worked but only worked against the film with the omissions from it.<br/><br/>The fact everyone kept bumping into each other or spotting each other was plain annoying.<br/><br/>The one saving grace was Scarlett Johansson, the only one acting in this debacle....that said, Matthew Goode came across well.<br/><br/>Also, why did everyone keep referring to the crime as a 'drugs robbery' not once but all the time. Who says that. All too, too convenient. Lightweight shot for hitting clay pigeons wouldn't necessarily kill either....how could he be sure. The guy he bumped into after the shooting, a red herring woody, the girl at Nola's work, surely she'd have been interviewed and told the police where she was dashing off to and who to see.<br/><br/>Also, from 10 ft and with a big throw, how come the ring hit the embankment.<br/><br/>The s*x scene with the tie, comical in the extreme, haven't laughed so much since Damage with Jeremy Irons.<br/><br/>As we left the cinema a group of people mockingly asked for their money back.....boy if only we could!"

","I sat in the theatre and watched this movie with people around me booing, except for the teenagers who giggled all the way through it. Personally, I could not find anything likable about these characters. Chris Wilton is shallow and stupid, and he marries into a family of even more shallow and stupid people. The dialog is all talky and on the nose, and there is too much dialog, all talking heads all the time. Nobody does anything except talk! There is no action, just talk, talk, talk. I could not find any sympathy for these characters. They evoked NO emotion in me, no empathy, nothing. I felt nothing. I felt no journey, no arc. They learned nothing, therefore, I learned nothing. Then, at the end, these random police officers come into the story, and the perspective changes abruptly to these two dumber police officers and how they deduce who killed Nola and the Landlady. Then these random ghosts of Nola and the Landlady show up-- come on? I never do understand why Chris comes to the decision he does to kill Nola. Why did he decide that? What made him decide that? What an awful thing for the director to do to me, to have the main character make a decision off camera without me to witness his thought process. I am so not buying anything in this movie. It never took me anywhere... And I desperately wanted to be taken on a journey with these people. The characters were so underdeveloped, they had no life to them. I just don't get why people liked this film. I really don't get it, unless we are all just shallow in this world today, and can identify with shallow characters on screen."

","A truly dreadful film. On one of the rare occasions when I have considered walking out of a film screening, a large portion of the audience sharing the unpleasant experience of watching Match Point did just that. At least half the audience left in disgust, and I wouldn't be surprised if they headed straight to the ticket counter for a refund.<br/><br/>Forced in places, rambling in others. Appalling dialogue that often appears ""ad lib""-ed (and not in a good way). Pointless scenes. Although Rhys-Myers and Johansson are good to look at, they both bumble through the film. Rhys-Myers in particular is frequently guilty of over-acting in that Shakespeare-esquire way, and Johansson jarrs unpleasantly in the English setting."

","There's nothing to spoil about this movie, but it does have its murders (the ring that forms the o in the title belongs to an elderly woman that the main character killed, ostensibly to cover up the murder of his girlfriend), and it has its closing line: the greatest boon is never to have been born. So if there was any chance that you might have liked this movie, too late, I've spoiled it for you.<br/><br/>The murders were there solely because a certain audience segment is believed to like to see people get murdered. The guy had plenty of opportunity to not get the girl pregnant. They were supposed to have some sort of spark that compelled him to keep screwing her, but his compulsion wasn't convincing, let alone compelling.<br/><br/>The movie had nothing to say, but didn't do a good job of being a just-for-fun movie. It's OK for a movie to have nothing to say, if it also has no pretensions. This movie thought it was deep, but the standard by which it judged its depth was that of a dull-normal thirteen-year-old.<br/><br/>The closest thing to a redeeming feature that it has is the implicitly self-referential nature of the summation: as far as this movie goes, the greatest boon would be to never have been made."

","This movie is absurd. The beginning of the movie is fine. The first red flag that signaled this movie would be terrible, was a few scene changes that were so drastic and obvious that you couldn't help but know exactly what would come next. Toward the middle-end, the movie takes a left turn and just becomes obscenely absurd. Some of the things that happen are unbelievably stupid and unreal. I would actually recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a potentially great movie that completely FLOPS and falls flat on its face. The actors were all good. The plot could have been much better with a few changes. All in all this movie was a big disappointment. It had great potential, and that's the most annoying part. I want my 2 hours back."

","Both direction and writing evoke very good performances from an excellent cast (remember Emily Mortimer acting in ""Young Adam"" and she was up to her skills this time too) but the one taking center stage is not Scarlett Johansson but Rhyss Meyers, who delivers. Plot's quite unusual for Woody Allen's fans but the movie has heart and soul. It's not one of Allen's best ones but the domestic melodrama, then turning into a psycho-thriller is watchable and has a pressing rhythm. Finally the ending twist will be appreciated even by Alfred Hitchcock's fans. All things considered not a genial work but certainly a charming story that is worth the ticket."

","Match Point is about as good as a Jilted Lover / Fatal Attraction style movie could ever hope to be. It took the genre, and achieved its goals with remarkable mastery. I WISH that Hollywood producers and directors would take a page from Woody's book.<br/><br/>Moral? There is no justice. There is chaos. Events occur, and we might be lucky enough to nudge them one way or another, but ultimately we are at the mercy of life in all its complexity. And in the end, you might just catch a break and everything will work out to your advantage. Or you might not catch that break. And everything that you did to prepare comes down to that moment - that chance - whether the ball bounces over the net or back.<br/><br/>Allen writes dialog like no other, and this movie displayed his talents eloquently. Mixed with his masterful direction, he controlled this story completely, trickling out the character and situation development so slowly, and with such care, as to leave you constantly hungry for the next moment. And by the way the movie crawls, but wonderfully. How can it be so suspenseful?"
"howard-rubinstein","10","6","11","8 January 2006"," Woody deserves more credit for this one
","Many reviewers of this film really miss the boat; some can't see Allen as anything but a comedic writer and others have questioned the central plot element in this particular film. Match Point does have a subtle comic undertone, which Allen uses to pass judgment on the peculiarities of upper-class British life (as viewed by an American), but its essence is (as in Crimes and Misdemeanours) on serious issues of morality (and sexual obsession). There's almost no one making commercial-run films that explore moral issues this well. I don't agree that C&M was better, just different -- and surely this subject is important enough to merit further consideration. I fully enjoyed this film but, more than that, I found interesting and provocative his contemplation of murdering someone because you can't be bothered to think of a better solution to maintain your comfortable existence. Surely he raises this question again now because it's remarkably analogous to the situation in Iraq. The little scene at the end, raising the issue of whether ""collateral damage"" of innocents is acceptable to ""achive a higher goal,"" is clearly there to raise this question. I think he parodies a certain British sense of entitlement because he's also very much considering the incredible inability of Americans to realize that their own position in the world is due to luck as much as hard work, and the decision to use war to maintain this position rested on as questionable a moral foundation as the one portrayed here."
"Rich B","8","6","11","4 January 2006"," Almost all great natural performances, wonderfully written and unnoticeably directed.
","I liked it from the opening moment, I really liked the titles before the movie, it was sort of a sign that this is different from the other movies you're watching, this harks back. The short introduction after this starts off the film nicely, and ties in much later on. It gives a little overview of what the film is about and how luck plays through our lives more than anything. Simply filmed and simply written, and yet it has a great impact both then, and retrospectively.<br/><br/>That was it, I started to like the movie already, and then Rhys-Meyers (Wilton) began talking and I felt my face screw up involuntarily. His acting voice was stilted and seemed very nervous, it just didn't sit right at all and gave quite an unnatural performance through the first half of the movie where emotions are checked and played low. It had more effect than just an annoyance though and for much of that first half I was continually pulled out of the movie because of the performance, yet there were performances that grabbed me by the throat and pulled me right in.<br/><br/>Johansson (Rice) doesn't start off that strong, she gives a plain but good performance, it's really in the latter half of the film that her character turns around and becomes impassioned, giving some depth to her performance. She is undoubtedly a great actress.<br/><br/>Mortimer, Goode, Cox and Wilton provide the entire Hewett family which Wilton slowly becomes a part of, and they all provide such real and utterly believable performances.<br/><br/>Something I noticed about the entire cast, apart from Rhys-Meyers, is their natural performance and well delivered lines. For these performances just seemed so realistic that you are drawn into them and into the heart of this family without any difficulty. It's even in subtle lines and gestures made throughout the movie as the family members and friends interact with each other, the dialogue is natural and flowing with characters often talking over each other as in real life. Throughout the movie there's perhaps only one line and one scene where the feeling was dropped for me, other than Rhys-Meyers first half performance of course.<br/><br/>Yet when the movie progresses and the mood changes, Rhys-Meyers starts to come to life and the stilted and awkward delivery fades in favour of a confused, bored and childish man. A man filled with more emotion and passion than previously seen, and it's here where we really begin to see the driving force of the movie and where I felt myself becoming more and more impatient and anxious as to how events would turn. In fact I wouldn't be stretching to say that I felt a growing dread, particularly when the family were together.<br/><br/>Wilton happens into the Hewett family and becomes a part of it, entering into a rich life in all aspects of the word. He is very privileged and becomes very accustomed to it. However something is either missing from his relationship with his wife, or he's merely wanting what he doesn't have, whichever is the real reason he becomes a passionate affair which spirals out of control.<br/><br/>It's during this affair where I felt the writing, direction and the performances pull together superbly and gave me these particular feelings. If I was to be in an affair I can imagine that it would be exactly like this (to a point in the story obviously) and you can imagine the conversations, phonecalls, confrontations, lies and hard choices being almost exactly as they are on screen. I totally believed in what I was watching at this point. When the family met together with Winton carrying on the deceit, often swapping the role of husband with lover and moving directly to a scene of a clandestine meeting, those feelings of impatience, anxiousness and dread built within me.<br/><br/>Somehow I engaged with his character, despite the earlier negative feelings to the performance, and felt as trapped and panicked as he did. Then when the family were together I realised I had fallen into the bond of the family, and with the fantastic performance of Mortimer as his wife, making me feel nervous and concerned about what would happen to them and how they could be hurt if the affair was made public.<br/><br/>There are some other very good smaller roles here from British actors that you wouldn't have expected either. Some of these were surprising to see, and all gave very good performances, albeit briefly.<br/><br/>The ending is very interesting, and takes a very strange turn. Luckily there's not much notice of this and gives you a nice surprise, at which point the movie does take a different turn. It's through this ending that the opening introduction returns bringing back the notion of luck and how it might, or might not, turn against you.<br/><br/>A couple of scenes here nudged my belief in the character of Wilton slightly through Rhys-Meyers performance and lines, however it wasn't enough to damage the end of the movie which is decidedly different and quite bold in it's final moments.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie, at key points, Allen utilises arias as score and also scene transitions, and in the second half these moments really come into their own when you do start to feel you are watching an operatic tragedy. It's here where I do feel that this style came through more as a storytelling device than a background score.<br/><br/>Overall I would recommend this movie, despite a feeling of the first half being too long and of the negative aspects Rhys-Meyers performance, it's an engrossing and interesting movie, one which does manage to engage and affect you right till the closing scene. Performances in the film are very strong, and had me dragged right into the movie into the minds of the characters, all except Rhys-Meyers who I found struggled with his performance."

"hill4420","1","8","16","18 May 2007"," Never another Woody Allen film.
","First off, I have never reviewed a movie for IMDb before. After watching Match Point I had to sign up, so I could warn others of what is coming I have never watched a Woody Allen film all the way through. After reading many positive reviews stating that this was not the typical Woody Allen film; I decided to give it a go. What a waste of 2 hours. I felt that the whole concept of this movie, though successfully tackled by Allen in the past (see Crimes and Misdemeanors), was totally contrived this time around. The character of Chris Wilton, played by a one-dimensional Jonathan Rhys Meyers, was executed so poorly that I found myself not caring what happens to him. Another poor character was Nola Rice (Scarlett Johansson). Our introduction to Nola involved ""Table"" tennis and sparking a cigarette. What a turn-off. How are we supposed to be interested in a character when she is so disgusting? While I have enjoyed Scarlett in other movies, especially The Prestige, I found myself wishing that Woody had selected another actress. As this role needed no talent, an actress lacking Scarlett's abilities would have possibly been a better choice. The only shining performance was from Emily Mortimer as Chris Wilton's wife Chloe.<br/><br/>Now moving on to the story; the plot crawled along for the first 90 minutes trying unsuccessfully to establish feelings for the main characters. I would have rather endured 90 minutes of a root canal instead of Woody Allen's attempt at drama. By the time the supposed plot twists come around I found me cheering that this travesty of drama was almost over. Even the twists are contrived. The ending left me wondering how anyone could be satisfied. How could Chris do what he did and Woody expect us, as ethical human beings, to feel empathy for him? How could we even think that he would be a decent father? I would like to see Woody be held accountable for the actions of his characters. I could go on with the disgust I feel but I think that would be giving Woody way too much credit. The only thing worse than hating a movie is ranting about it so much that generates publicity.<br/><br/>I am glad that I have never seen more Woody Allen films. I know that many people herald him for his great movies, but based on Match Point, I will never waste time on him again. With that I will close this review and strongly recommend that you watch Howard the Duck instead!"
"dfranzen70","1","8","16","18 January 2006"," Dreadful bore
","Match Point is Woody Allen's latest offering. The director of such gems as Manhattan, Annie Hall, Zelig, Bullets over Broadway, and Hannah and Her Sisters has been the king of the American art-house film for decades. Sometimes his movies are poignant, and sometimes they're slapstick hilarity. This offal, however, never even hints at Allen's writing or directing abilities; indeed, it may as well have been directed by John Badham for all of the flavor and panache it expresses.<br/><br/>Even though the movie's appeared on many must-see lists as people gear up for the Oscar nominations, Match Point is a travesty of a sham of a mockery of an entertaining film. It's a longwinded load of dung. Nearly every scene is deadeningly dull, and the few that aren't are instead serve as perfect clichés.<br/><br/>Jonathan Rhys-Meyers plays Chris, a tennis pro who falls for Chloe, the daughter of a rich British family (the movie's set in London), played by Emily Mortimer. Chris' best pal is Tom (Matthew Goode), Chloe's sister. Rounding out the main quartet is American actress Nola (Scarlett Johansson), who's engaged to Tom. Wouldn't you know it, seconds after meeting Nola - after already being partnered with Chloe - Chris falls for the flaxen-haired lass, who's strong-willed and outspoken where her British counterparts are a little more complacent.<br/><br/>Can Chris keep his lust a secret from Tom and Chloe? And what of the parents, the richer-than-rich Eleanor (Penelope Wilton) and Alec (Brian Cox)? They dote on Chris, showering him with money and gifts and a job. How could Chris give all of that up to be with Nola? Several things work against the movie aside from the faceless direction and writing. For one thing, Chris is utterly unappealing. A protagonist certainly does not need to be likable, but there must be something about him or her that makes the audience want to see what happens to him or her. The appalling acting by Rhys-Meyers doesn't help matters at all; he's lifeless, utterly devoid of emotion. He can't even seem to conjure enough strength to show a good facial expression. He's a blank, a cipher no one wants to learn more about. Allen didn't write the character well at all, to make matters worse. It's a little too easy to figure out Chris' intentions, but his motivations are sometimes a mystery. And for goodness' sake, someone give this boy a spine transplant! How can a lead character be so terminally wishy washy? Of the supporting cast, only Johansson and Cox emerge unscathed. Cox is a veteran actor and could probably have played this role in his sleep, and Johansson is a rising star, capable of fantastic range. She was given very little to work with (her character doesn't really possess any unique traits), and it showed.<br/><br/>The pacing is mind numbing. I cannot tell you how many times I checked my watch to see how much time remained in the movie. It's plodding and aimless, certain to bore even the most rabid Merchant-Ivory fan, even though those masters had nothing to do with this one. Instead, we're given the vagrant stepchild of a true master American filmmaker. Allen would have been much better off removing his name from the credits for the pseudonymous Alan Smithee. Another annoying debit: Despite the title, tennis takes place for maybe three scenes.<br/><br/>If you're not a fanatic of tedious, overwrought melodramas, please adjust this rating down at least half a star."
"joel40","2","8","16","6 January 2006"," Awful script, awful acting, awful film.
","This film is shockingly bad. I know nothing about Woody Allen's previous work but this production is so amateur it could have been written by a GCSE student.<br/><br/>The entire screenplay is so unoriginal and the dialogue so terribly scripted that, especially if you are English, you will find yourself cringing at regular intervals. A previous reviewer made a comparison with ""Closer""; I am not a great fan of that film but it undoubtedly had some dramatic and interesting scenes of well-performed dialogue. I do not recall one memorable moment of similar drama in Match Point at all.<br/><br/>That the script is dismal is still no excuse for the quite horrible acting performance of the lead, Rhys-Meyers. How he has received praise on this site I have no idea. His character is wholly unconvincing and he shows no hint of passion in his performance whatsoever. Compare him with Firth or MacFayden in the P&P films (a valid comparison since there are many storyline parallels, not to mention one famous scene which Allen has copied to poor effect) and you must surely wonder how he has become a star actor. (The answer of course sadly all to clear!) Johanssen is better and shows that she certainly has notable talent, while the supporting cast are generally very good. That said, I was left again unconvinced by Meyers' wife: watching the two of them on screen together was sometimes painful.<br/><br/>All these miseries were confounded by a sense of disbelief at Allen's portrayal of both London and the English upper class. London is shown, as another reviewer pointed out, from the tourist's point of view. Indeed, the scene where a local estate agent shows Meyers around a flat seems to be Allen's way of shouting: ""Look, I really DO know what London life is like, and here's a scene to prove it!"" In reality he is way off the mark.<br/><br/>The language he attributes to the young toffs is equally demonstrative of his ignorance. Take the scene where the characters are discussing their impending holiday to Greece: the uber-posh ultra-stuffy language is simply not what real people use these days (and yes, the ""upper"" class ARE real people). More worryingly, Allen has absolutely no idea that Greece, to Brits, is not an exotic location. You simply would never ever hear a Brit say the line ""Crete, it sounds so exotic"". It's a package holiday booze destination for god's sake! And as for the portrayal of British coppers, well it was plain laughable. I don't think James Nesbitt knew whether he was supposed to be acting in a spoof or a drama, so badly were his scenes written.<br/><br/>All in all I was astonished by how bad this film was - an awful script, awful lead acting and thoroughly ignorant direction. It is quite apt that the story centres on the idea that luck can pull you through, because if justice had its way, Meyers would certainly not be earning his millions and Allen would not be earning praise he undoubtedly does not deserve!"

Much more drama and thriller than comedy. I would consider it an evolution from Melinda & Melinda.<br/><br/>It's not an easy movie, it is not easy for me to say how much I liked it, not yet, that's good. I would like to see it again.

I kept waiting and waiting for the film to be over. I tried watching it once before and thought that, perhaps, I just wasn't in the mood. I even yelled at the TV, ""MOVE!"" It was SOOOOOOO SLOOOOWWWWW. I tried the 2nd time and suffered through it just waiting for SOMETHING to happen.<br/><br/>Possible spoiler (as if watching this rotten tripe wasn't spoil enough): All the wrong things happened. You know he's not going to go to a bridge and throw jewelry in the water in broad daylight. They could check phone records, and you certainly know that the detectives are going to ask the co-worker questions. She is most certainly going to tell them that Nola received a phone call right before she left work.<br/><br/>When Nola confronted his conscience she said something about holes in his plans. Maybe this was Woody Allen's way of saying that there were plenty of holes in his plot.<br/><br/>Wait! There was one good thing about the movie - the set for La Traviata. It was a delicious study in art deco.<br/><br/>Wish I could sue someone and get back my 2 hours of life that were wasted. It felt like two years!<br/><br/>Just proves to me over and over again that the ""critics"" are just glorified ""yes"" men. The ONLY reason that they found any credibility in this movie is because a NAME directed it. If Joe Blow had directed it, they would have shredded him."
"hall895","5","5","9","3 August 2006"," Unlikeable characters make this film hard to embrace
","Match Point has a pretty interesting story to tell. In fact after seeing the way it ultimately unfolds it would be fair to say the story is ingeniously crafted. All of the principal actors in the film do solid, if not spectacular, work. There's nothing here that you would call a bad performance. So we have a good story told in a very clever way. And we have solid acting all around. Good story, good acting...this film must be a winner right? Well, not so much. And why is that? It's simply because this may be collectively the most unlikeable cast of characters ever thrown up on the big screen. By the time the film plays out you will come to the sad realization that there is nobody here to root for, not a single character in this film worthy of your respect, much less your admiration. The characters range from selfish to arrogant to immoral to downright criminal. So for all the good things Match Point has going for it these characters are so unembraceable by the time the film is over you can't wait to be rid of the whole lot of them. And that is not a recipe for making a film which will be remembered fondly.<br/><br/>Now if you don't mind a film in which all the characters are covered in varied amounts of sleaze there is much to recommend this film. It is a really good, and ultimately very surprising, story. Jonathan Rhys Meyers plays the lead role of Chris, a former tennis pro who is now a tennis instructor. He gives a lesson to a wealthy young man, Tom, whose sister, Chloe, takes a liking to Chris and so the romantic entanglements begin. Seeing the potential financial benefits if nothing else Chris enters into a relationship with Chloe even though he, understandably since the character is played by Scarlett Johansson, finds himself much more attracted to struggling American actress Nola who happens to be Tom's fiancée. Oh what a tangled web we weave. The actors playing the Tom and Chloe parts, Matthew Goode and Emily Mortimer respectively, are fine but the real spark in this film comes whenever Meyers and Johansson are together. Johansson simply oozes sex appeal and it is a pleasure to watch her Nola work her charms on Chris. But as you might imagine given the tangled web of relationships here there are inevitably, shall we say, complications. And if you hadn't already been turned off by the rampaging selfishness and immorality of all of these characters the final act will simply make your jaw drop. These are very bad people, rotten to the core, and it is hard to find reason to sympathize with any of them. Given a choice you probably wouldn't want to spend five minutes with any of the characters in this film. In Match Point you are condemned to spend two hours with all of them. If you spent that much time around these characters in real life you'd probably feel as if you needed to take a shower afterwards to wipe away the stench."

","This review contains my own personal opinion, which differs for most others and is intended not to disuade viewers from watching and making up their own minds.<br/><br/>What can I say about this movie? Well lets start with ho hum.... I am amazed I didn't fall asleep. I watched this movie after reading some others comments as I have NEVER been a woody fan...At least I feel justified in my opinions now. Slow plodding plot, a lot of the actors did a fairly good job with what they had to work with but felt that this movie would have been better if it had been left on the shelf gathering dust. Given the choice of watching this or having every hair on your body plucked one by one...I guess the plucking would work out just a bit more painful and a bit less entertaining but not by much. I only rated it 3 out of 10 because I could not say that I enjoyed it but did watch it to the end after pausing it often and coming back to it.At least I had to see how it ended and no one was more happier to see the end than I was!! Watch it and make up your own mind, but it could cause drowsiness."
"gerrypig","2","5","9","17 June 2006"," Slow so slow and very, very boring!
","It seems like (reading the other reviews) if your name is Woody Allen you could get away with everything!<br/><br/>Quick summary: Nothing happens the first hour.. Just a bunch of people talking about nothing, watching opera and attending to galleries.. The movie starts to build up a little bit when this mistress gets pregnant and desperate to get Chris to leave his wife. The rest is just stupid!<br/><br/>I mean: The cop had the complete solution of the crime coming to him before he fell a sleep: EUREKA!! Clever cop! (Chris killing the old lady and the mistress). Sorry Mac.. Chris stole a wedding ring from the old lady and fails to throw it in the river so it falls back on the ground.. An drug addicts finds it, attends to a shoot out and gets killed in the same neighborhood the old lady got killed in. The smart cop gets confronted with this. Case closed. Chris is off the hook!! Likely? NO!! .. <br/><br/>If it was just that the plot sucked major I might not bother to write this review but there is more:<br/><br/>The most of the characters are just so incredible uninteresting! I must admit that Scharlett Johansson did a nice performance.. But the rest of them...OH GOD HOW BORING!<br/><br/>The only person I got some emotions towards was Chloe. I was thinking during the movie: Hey man why don't you kill your nagging wife instead!! Chris?? Chriiiis? Where are you ?? Chriiiiiiiiss?? Whats that in your pocket?? Pills? What kind of pills?? Chriiiiss?? Are you taking a dump?? Chriiis? I guess that might be some relevance to the morale of the movie (read metaphor :)). But I Don't Care! It sucks!! Specially the main character! He is so boring that you might want to take his tennis racket and smack him hard in his face! He uses 5 seconds to respond to the simplest questions and his answers isn't to bright either.. <br/><br/>There is probably hundreds of stupid metaphors in the flick, so you hopefully will give the film a thought after its finished. The metaphors gets pushed in your face like a baby being fed with a spoon!<br/><br/>If you like this movie you probably also would like to watch ""Gone with the wind "" three times in a row :)"
"greydemon","2","5","9","30 May 2006"," One of the worst films I have ever had to suffer
","I have just seen this film on a plane. I did not read the credits at the time and had no idea who wrote or directed it so as soon as I got home I looked it up here. I was amazed to find that it was a Woody Allen film.<br/><br/>Quite simply it was appallingly bad. The plot was Mills and Boon joke and totally predictable, the dialogue was stilted and unnatural. The acting was generally of a standard I would expect at the local amateur dramatic club. (Except James Nesbit who was as good as ever but only had a tiny part). I almost laughed out loud when one character called the Chris Wilton 'Irish' when the best the actor could manage was an upper class English twit accent.<br/><br/>A comment on the plot: How believable is it that a supposedly working class Irish tennis coach (with an unlikely love of Opera) with no qualifications, would be given a job in a large company 'In the City' and almost immediately be raised to a level where he has a chauffeur driven car at his beck and call, and a personal secretary. I know that he was the boyfriend of the boss's daughter but no boss got as rich as the one in this film by filling his company with his daughter's boyfriend who have no business experience.<br/><br/>Frankly I am amazed that this film ever managed to find funding, no doubt the Woody Allen name carried it through that process, it didn't however carry it much further."
"Galina_movie_fan","6","5","9","27 March 2006"," Recycling
","Match Point was one of very few movies from last year that I really wanted to see and could not wait for it to open. High praise from both the critics and the audience alike only contributed to my impatience. What did I get? Allen recycled one of his own earlier masterpieces, used only a drama part of it and created a good-looking movie with myriads of references to the works of literature and cinema that had told the same story much better than he did this time. What is fascinating, the earlier masterpiece that I've mentioned above is twenty minutes shorter than ""Match Point"" but it had said so much more with such power that Allen himself was not able to recreate. Jonathan Rhys Meyers is not Martin Landau and Scarlet Johansson is not Angelica Huston. It is nothing wrong to borrow from himself but nothing original or compelling came from ""Match Point"". I enjoyed his silly ""Scoop"" and his dramedic ""Melinda & Melinda"" much better than his almost universally proclaimed as masterpiece ""Match Point"". I said once and I am repeating that Allen makes good, very good and excellent films. Let's say that I prefer his combination of drama and comedy to pure drama. There have been many great dramas but ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" is beyond great, it is unique.<br/><br/>****A spoiler...sort of:****** <br/><br/>More than once I've seen the same scene in the movies lately - the main character reads a Dostoyevsky's novel in an opening scene - gives you a very good idea what to expect by the end."
"jackmronner","1","5","9","20 March 2006"," This film is drek!
","The only Woody Allen film I've ever even thought about walking out of. Gave it one hour, thought maybe there would be a redemptive great ending, but realized I didn't care! Unappealing characters in a dull, desultory pot-opera (combo of potboiler and soap opera)<br/><br/>Wasn't expecting comedy, but this is devoid of wit, style or any other of Allen's staple traits. Actively called friends to warn them not to even rent this piece of drek! Should add that opinion seems to split along the sexual fault-line, but not even the charms of Ms. Johanssen were proof against the dull, uninspired script, zipless dialogue and actively distasteful characters."
"t-flynn-1","1","5","9","28 February 2006"," Awful script and way too long
","I thought this film was really bad. I thought the dialogue was truly excruciating and the characters merely caricatures. The whole film was very poorly directed and edited. Cliché after cliché. It was a real stinker. Joanathan Reese Myers was really wooden and had a very strange accent for a supposed Itishman even though the actor really is Irish. The other actors did well considering how awful the dialogue was. The film seemed like it would never end. There was a slight twist at the end which is why I'm giving it 1 point instead of zero. It seemed to be yet another strangely warped American view of what upper class English people are really like."
"EUyeshima","8","5","9","30 January 2006"," Luck and Fate at an Unlikely Crossroads in an Elegant, Crafty Movie by Woody Allen
","While it's true that Woody Allen has had an erratic record as a filmmaker of late, there are definite pleasures to be had from his recent work such as 1999's ""Sweet and Lowdown"", 2000's ""Small Time Crooks"" and 2005's ""Melinda and Melinda"". However, what makes 2005's ""Match Point"" different from the usual Allen product is that it is an incessantly addictive film ripe with melodrama and suspense with little of Allen's angst-driven comedy. There are elements that will remind long-time Allen aficionados of 1989's ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" and 1993's ""Manhattan Murder Mystery"", but at the same time, the film seems also inspired by Anthony Minghella's 1999 adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"", George Stevens's 1951 ""A Place in the Sun"" based on Theodore Dreiser's ""An American Tragedy"", and Adrian Lyne's 1987 ""Fatal Attraction"".<br/><br/>Set in contemporary London, a first for Allen, the intricate plot focuses on a failed pro tennis player, Chris Wilton, who lands a rather cushy job as a coach at a fancy private club. Through sheer luck - a consistent theme throughout for Chris - he befriends wealthy Tom Hewett and by way of an evening in the family's opera box, begins dating his guileless sister Chloe. Insinuating himself into the family with ease, including securing a nice job at one of the companies owned by Tom and Chloe's father, Chris becomes obsessed with Nola Rice, Tom's seductive American fiancée, a failing actress of whom Tom and Chloe's mother vehemently disapproves. How they all intertwine is what makes up most of the action, and the story works like an ever-tightening noose around Chris's actions. Even though it plays out like a smart thriller, Allen brings a decidedly fatalistic tone that introduces greater issues of fate, retribution and justice. The themes don't weigh the film down unnecessarily, and in fact, the film's last half-hour brings all the higher-level issues together in a way that makes the conclusion resonate with unpredictable force.<br/><br/>As Chris, Jonathan Rhys-Meyers brings an effectively opaque manner to his character that makes him neither sympathetic nor villainous but rather leaves him precariously off-balance to the viewer. It's a smartly rendered performance that teeters toward the predictable only toward the very end. Although her first scene at the ping-pong table seems a bit excessive in introducing her character, Scarlett Johansson plays Nola with sensual fervor and palpable emotionalism, especially as her character spirals into darker psychological territory. Their scenes together are surprisingly carnal for an Allen film. Since they carry out the greater themes of moral vacuity, the remaining actors seem to be there simply to support the other end of the spectrum though not in predictable ways. For example, Emily Mortimer manages to play the unsuspecting Chloe not as a victim but as someone unwilling to confront her own unhappiness given her aggressive and rather selfish desire to become pregnant.<br/><br/>As embodied expertly by Brian Cox as the overly generous father, Penelope Wilton as the overbearing mother and Matthew Goode as carefree Tom, the rest of the Hewett family are equally clueless about what is going on around them. However, that's exactly Allen's point in his parable-like script as he makes shrewd observations about the power of luck and our profound inability to control our destinies in making one's way toward a desired life. In a manner that recalls Gordon Willis's work in Allen's ""Interiors"", Remi Adefarasin lends an immaculately cool sheen to the cinematography, and the upscale world among the London social elite is captured almost too adroitly with Jim Clay's manicured production design and Caroline Smith's tasteful set decorations. In place of his usual jazz-infused soundtrack, Allen uses old opera recordings of Caruso singing Bizet, Donizetti, Rossini and especially Verdi as a smartly evocative background. This is strong work from film auteur Allen well worth viewing."

Your local critics or the national critics like Ebert are really no different than you or me. The only difference is that they get to write about the movie and are forced to see hundreds of movies whether they want to or not.Therefore, it is our belief that if you get your monies worth for two hours of enjoyment that is good enough for us! We NEVER EVER listen or read the critics. We only care about our friends and those who we know like the same things as us. Well enough about that.<br/><br/>WOW! Scarlett Johannson spectacular and she is only 21! A great script not at all like Woody Allen's other movies. In fact you could not tell it was Woody if you didn't know it.

Scarlett is beautiful, curvy, sexy and innocent all in one package. She was very very good. The rest of the cast was really perfect, they all complemented each other so very well, I found that to be the one element that really gave this movie credibility. The casting was perfect. I would encourage you to go see this one in the theater."

","MATCH POINT takes Woody Allen in a new direction in his films and presents a London setting that is out of this world. Exterior locations add to the suspense which continues to build in the film, and the use of interiors with rich set decorations and the flat that overlooks the Thames really add to the luxe look of MATCH POINT.<br/><br/>A tremendous cast headed by the talented Jonathan Rhys Meyers, as Chris, and the beautiful Scarlett Johansson as Nola, drive MATCH POINT to its exciting conclusion. My only regret with the film is that I wish I could have liked the characters more, and had more empathy with their individual journeys. They came off as a bit too posh, spoiled and hedonistic in which Rhys Meyers character offers the final conclusion to this MATCH POINT. But in the end, it maybe MATCH...POINT...But is it really the GAME we came to expect? Perhaps the Golden Globes will lead us to that answer."

","Match Point is a truly awful film. The one word that I think sums it up is pretentious. Everything about it, from the horribly stuffy dialogue to the paper-thin plot and non-existent character development, exudes pretentiousness. The film attempts to present itself as a study of nihilism, but fails miserably. <br/><br/>The irony is that Woody Allen actually believes this hogwash is one of his best works. <br/><br/>I don't usually bother to review films that I hate, but when something this horrendous gets almost universally praised by so-called ""experts"" in the field, I feel the need to put the truth across. <br/><br/>I'm just glad I didn't pay to watch it.

"cdelacroix1","8","4","7","29 January 2006"," Wonderful Work, Mr. Allen!
","This is a marvelous tale, of fate and luck, of love and ambition. A tale very well told indeed.<br/><br/>Though set in London, the culture depicted seems to draw all its strength from Woody Allen's Manhattan. We have a rootless zeitgeist combined with a contrasting and singular rootedness in The City. That's the world of Woody Allen whether set on one side of the Atlantic or the other. This special world seems to be the one he was born to describe. The literary, articulate, smooth, urbane, well-to-do Manhattanite aristocracy of art and manners is a culture that, whether it actually exists or no, is a world that surely deserves its place in fiction. Some might find such a world viscerally unappealing. Yet the depiction of a world so cosmopolitan, urbane, smooth, well-to-do, and amoral (Dennis King's term in his review of Match Point; and he's right) is a pleasure to behold. <br/><br/>The first half of Match Point establishes this world, in a slow, desultory manner. After a first few minutes among this well-to-do slice of London's best and brightest, surely the natural reaction is that we've stumbled into a boring soap opera. <br/><br/>Suddenly, though, the pace, and my adrenalin, leap upward: for here is this banal Chris groping in a gun cabinet for a skeet shotgun ... and the thought suddenly dawns, ""My God he's going to kill her!"" Suddenly I feel myself plunged into an action thriller, the last thing I was expecting from this cool, quiet movie. Yet once in progress, all seemed so authentic, so natural. <br/><br/>For the rest of the picture, I was on the edge of my seat. And from audience reaction, I wasn't the only one. The pace picked up but remained curiously restrained  and suspense and story unfolded perfectly.<br/><br/>The acting and characterizations were wonderful. Jonathon Rhys Meyers as Chris brings this strangely disturbed and disturbing character to vivid life. Matthew Goode as the cool, witty Tom is excellent. Brian Cox surprised me in an appealing turn as Tom's father Alec. Penelope Wilton as Tom's mother Eleanor does fine work. Emily Mortimer as Chloe, Tom's sister and Chris's wife is very convincing indeed. But by far the best work is done by Scarlet Johansson as Nola. What a wonderful actress: here in a very different characterization from her excellent work in Ghost World, Lost in Translation, and Girl with a Pearl Earring. Johannson's Nola is sexy with a tough edge barely covering her underlying vulnerability. Nola is by turns a seductress, ""damaged goods"" with an identity subsumed within her sexuality and at the same time uncomfortably aware of how limited that identification is. <br/><br/>Nola's ability to convey simultaneous responsiveness to Chris' inappropriate advances, while mixing her response so variously, adds such depth to her character. So, when Chris first meets Nola, we see sparks with Nola assuming a clearly accustomed role of Dangerous Flirtatiousness. Then, in the bar after her failed audition, when Chris is pressing her again, she fails eye contact and both ignores and fails to ignore his verbal advances ... as if trying while inevitably knowing that she will fail, to resist. Then when she is fleeing in the rain and Chris catches up with her and she quickly succumbs to his advances, we see her in what we feel is also a very accustomed role: Hurt Vulnerability Succumbing to a (False) Male Rescuer's sexual advances. All of this is very convincing ... and tragic ... and perhaps establishes the only faint foreshadowing of the ultimate tragedy of her murder by Chris. <br/><br/>The interior dialog, expressed hallucinatorily, of Chris with the dead Nola and her dead neighbor, feels strange at first ... and then, again, strangely authentic. As if the things taking place inside of Chris had an objective reality that could not be suppressed by the random success of events in progress. Yet the prediction of Nola ... that he would fail ... proves wrong. By chance: again and again the beginning theme ... of Match Point ... that luck has such an important place in things ... was borne out again and again. Another set of dialogs ... that of the police ... comprised the first (I think?) away from Chris ... and added a polyvocal feature that was a real stunner ... yet works well for me. <br/><br/>There's a dialog between Chris and his old tennis buddy in which he's contemplating leaving Chloe for Nola. I couldn't help but think of a similar dialog: in The Family Man, when the Cage character is considering cheating on his wife. The reactions of Cage's friend, and Chris's friend, were enormously different. And seem to reflect a strong contrast between the self-absorbed values of urbane well-to-do class yuppies in London (or Manhattan) and the middle American family values of the Family Man. Interesting contrast.<br/><br/>In any event, the double-murder by Chris does not, on the surface, seem to disturb his world. Indeed, it protects it. Which is his intention. Whether by intent, or by sheer luck, or both, though, we find that Chris and Chloe are together, have a child and all seems to be proceeding swimmingly for the family by the end of the movie. What will happen next? Who knows? Chris may be able, as he said to Nola, to simply sweep all the guilt under the rug and go on. As in Hamlet, there is no reason that the central treachery should ever be discovered. Yet is this what we can expect from Chris? For he is still Chris. He is the man who did these terrible things; whose character flaws (if we can so style them) led him to the final ""fatal necessity"" of a double murder. If this is so, then one suspects that something like will happen again. This time, the luck of the tennis ball may go the other direction. Who can say?"
"cguldal","6","4","7","25 January 2006"," Disappointing...
","I am not a big fan of Woody Allen. I find him too self-indulgent and a bit hard to relate to in many of his movies. I like some of his work. I especially enjoy his dialogs. I have always thought that even if I do not like anything in a Woody Allen film, I will enjoy the dialog.<br/><br/>Well, not so in Match Point. I went not expecting much, because, again, I am not a big fan of his and I don't like ""love triangles"", which is what the movie seemed to be about from the previews. I don't know what happened to Woody's writing, but the script sucked! I cannot be more elegant than this, I'm afraid, because the dialog that I had so faithfully counted on was worse than most of the rubbish that comes out of Hollywood! It was almost shocking, except my low expectations prevented me from being entirely surprised. I think this attempt at good dialog could have succeeded if the main characters were acted well, but unfortunately, they weren't. It seemed like Johansson was stuck at her Lost in Translation role and Rhys-Meyers was transplanted into the film from Bend it Like Beckham! In the beginning a sexy sultry Nolah was welcome but later on the Nolah trapped in a desperate situation was flat. As much as I felt that Chris Wilton was being an opportunistic jerk, I found it impossible to sympathize with Nolah. Maybe I wasn't supposed to, but it seemed like Allen would really want us to, if only he could make us... I also did not like being hit over the head over and over with the Crime and Punishment parallel. I had thought Allen to be a director and writer capable of a more subtle and finer take on the underlying factors of motive and consequence.<br/><br/>Overall, the plot was decent. The supporting cast was good. But the main characters and Woody Allen really disappointing."

The writing is terrible, the acting is abysmal, and the story is full of holes. The love scenes are anything but compelling.

She agreed with me and we spent the next hour and a half giggling at the cliché-ridden script and embarrassingly bad acting. This film was so terrible, I seriously began to think it could only be intentional and that they were actually poking fun at this type of melodrama. I actually left the theatre completely freaked out by what I had seen. Woody Allen - a giant name in cinema - has produced a film packed with wooden, stereotypical characters and dialogue, a painfully bad depiction of English culture (especially his depiction of London) and a plot lifted from a third rate made-for-TV movie.<br/><br/>He should be ashamed of himself."
"jack_malvern","2","10","24","27 December 2005"," Not much point
","Woody Allen's luck-themed drama has drawn praise from the critics as the director's long-awaited ""return to form"". It could well be more accomplished than his recent output, but better does not mean good.<br/><br/>Match Point has quite an interesting premise: that luck, in the end, is more important than skill, faith or endeavour. But the film suffers from both a paucity of characterisation (especially around its charmless protagonist) and a slow-building plot.<br/><br/>Allen might have gotten away with one of these, but the double blow means that it is difficult to sustain interest in any of his somewhat bland characters (none of whom has anything interesting to say) during the unusually long 90-minute setup.<br/><br/>The majority of the plot is a simple love triangle. Jonathan Rhys Meyers is an inarticulate tennis coach who befriends his aristocratic client Tom (Matthew Goode), marries Tom's sister (Emily Mortimer) and has an affair with Tom's girlfriend (Scarlett Johansson). The fundamental problem is that although Rhys Meyers is quite handsome, he is so uncharismatic that there is no reason for the other characters, or indeed the audience, to be remotely interested in him.<br/><br/>The plot twists, when they do come, are interesting but hardly worth the wait. In the meantime we are left to ponder: a) Allen's decision to let his cast stumble over their lines; b) the touristy depiction of London in which Johansson's ""cheap"" flat is just around the corner from Bond Street; c) the oddity that is Johansson's mouth; and d) the desire to mutter ""What a tosser"" at Rhys Meyers's pathetic Sloaney aspirations.<br/><br/>You can't really blame the actors. Mortimer does very well in an unrewarding role and both Johansson and Goode are fine. Even Rhys Meyers has the excuse that Allen has written his protagonist as a villain from the start, never allowing him to build a connection with the audience even before he becomes deeply unsympathetic in the final act.<br/><br/>There are some good observations, but not nearly enough to rescue this drawn-out and occasionally stilted drama, which compares poorly with a feature-length episode of Inspector Morse."

","Interesting movie with quite an ending.<br/><br/>The story begins with Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) starting out a career as a tennis instructor after he had enough with the tennis professional circuit. He meets Tom Hewett (Matthew Goode) who is a member of the tennis club, and upon knowing Wilton's interest of opera invites him over to the family box at the opera house. There, Wilton gets introduced to the Hewett family and then later with Hewett's fiancée Nola Rice (Scarlett Johansson). Wilton gets very interested in Rice and then things get difficult...<br/><br/>A brilliant turn by Johansson, she really shone in her part. She was radiant in this movie. One would expect good things to come from her in the future. Not much could be said about Rhys-Meyers. He seemed rather wooden.<br/><br/>The supporting cast were rather brilliant. Emily Mortimer, Brian Cox and Penelope Wilton respectively as Tom Hewett's sister and the Hewett parents kept my interest in the story.<br/><br/>The pacing didn't really pick up until just after the middle part of the film but it's still a memorable movie.<br/><br/>My vote is 7 out of 10."
"cloud_nine","10","5","10","21 January 2006"," Held My Interest Throughout
","This is easily Woody Allen's best film in years.....in spite of (and maybe because of) being his least typically ""Woody Allen"" picture. Perhaps filming in London gave him a different perspective. It reminded me of ""Room at the Top"", several Hitchcock films and Allen's own ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"". So many movie plots today are formula. You know the entire story after seeing the preview. ""Match Point"" kept me guessing until the end. There are so many ways the story could have gone or could have ended. The characters are all believable and intelligent..some of them clueless but believable. Performances are excellent all around. I hope Woody is over his aversion to the Oscars. He may be receiving another one for this."
"ArmsAndMan","2","5","10","20 January 2006"," No Match for ""Crimes and Misdemeanors""
","Most of us don't grant Woody the gift of our attention and expect to be rewarded with facile nihilism. Nihilism has its place, but not in some comic book version of Sophocles.<br/><br/>This may be Woody's worst film since ""Interiors."" Woody seems to loath his own talent for Comedy, so he strains for significance by begging to sit at the adult table of Tragedy.<br/><br/>""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" succeeded far better with the same themes, in part because Woody still respected the expectations of his audience. ""Match Point"" is all about the so-called artist, not much about the rest of us. ""C&M"" explored moral ambiguity that engaged the viewer in a dialog. ""MP"" dashes any subtlety in favor of Moral Pronouncements. Worst of all, Woody lectures the audience like school children.<br/><br/>I suspect the reason Allen bangs the gong of nihilism so loudly is to distract us from the holes in his tidy plot. =SPOILER ALERT= Who can believe that Nola's diary did not mention her pregnancy? Wouldn't the police conduct a DNA test on the embryo? Case closed.<br/><br/>Five more minutes at the writer's desk: what if Nola had lied about being pregnant? Hmmm. Ah, but that kind of layered characterization and nuance of plot is not exercised by Woody Allen. He's content to borrow freely from ""A Place in the Sun"" and not strain too hard on his holiday in the UK."

","There have been few moments in my life where I've felt ripped off after seeing a movie, but this was one of them. I went into this flick hoping to see a good Woody Allen Movie, and all I got was an updated version of ""Crimes & Misdemeanors"" featuring steamy, forbidden sex between two beautiful people instead of two older people. Woody already did this before, and he's done it better.<br/><br/>Sure, the movie builds interesting characters in the beginning and sets them in an interesting place. But very early on the plot loses its way and descends into cliché. The characters show behavior that you can read about in the tabloids in line at the supermarket. Big deal. The whole theme of luck loses its punch due to some glaring, huge holes in the story that anyone with rudimentary common sense could figure out. There's just too much wrong with this film to forgive it on the basis of Woody's reputation.<br/><br/>The real tragedy of this film is that it had all the necessary components to say something worth saying rather than something already stated elsewhere. If it's supposed to be art, it's Xeroxed art. If it's supposed to simply tell a story, it's a story we've seen a million times."
"Casablanca3784","10","5","10","10 January 2006"," Absolutely BRILLIANT
","This film is so tremendous that anyone who dares sneak in a spoiler should be summarily shot! Woody Allen, despite his widely published indisgressions, is a genius to have written and directed this most potent story of how luck plays such an important part of our lives. I sat there mesmerized for the entire 124 minutes, intoxicated by the ingenious story that builds and builds and has the type of crescendo conclusion to knock one out of his seat. Indeed, I was seeing a Woody Hitchcock picture. Something touching on ""Dial M for Murder"" but BETTER. If I could rate this movie higher than 10, I'd go the limit. It contains every element of a super super flick. Great story, superb acting and an ending that, as I mentioned, will knock one out of his seat. ""Match Point"" is what GREAT movies are all about; it'll grip you from scene one and won't let go until the end when you will say to yourself what baseball broadcaster Jack Buck said when calling Kirk Gibson's miracle last of the 9th home run against Oakland in game one of the 1988 World Series. ""I don't believe what I just saw."""
"boblipton","7","5","10","1 January 2006"," Film Noir
","I'm always glad to see a new Woody Allen film and this is no exception. Here he returns to the dark, chaotic world he investigated in CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS -- his best straight drama, I believe -- and which he explored comically in BULLETS OVER Broadway -- his best comedy and you may disagree with both choices: a world without a god to impose a moral order which, tragically, destroys the men and women who inhabit it. A world of Film Noir that takes place across the river from London's Parliament where man's laws are made where he gives us a variation of AN American TRAGEDY. Yes, it can happen there.<br/><br/>There is a lot less Bergman influence in this movie. Instead the influences are visual touches: Hitchcock, Truffaut and others jostle each other in this script, the effective story of how a former tennis player cold-bloodedly marries into a wealthy English family -- ""They've got nothing but money"" he says trenchantly at one point -- and winds up murdering his pregnant mistress, the former fiancée of his brother-in-law. The script is brilliantly done and, even as he struggles to hide his crime, he wants himself caught. That desire to pay for his crime is the only thing that endears him to the audience, but it was enough to put the New York audience -- including me -- who sat through the showing on the first day of the new year in a similar mood. Would he be caught, which would give the universe some moral shape, or would he succeed in his quest for freedom and wealth? The script is topnotch, the cast performs admirably and the background of operatic music adds to the melodramatic tensions.<br/><br/>If the movie has any weakness, it is purely a comparative one: Woody Allen's New York films capture New York with subtlety. Wandering the streets of Manhattan, he can finds spots of beauty that would escape the casual eye: a scrap of paper blowing in the wind on 9th Street, the warehouse where the floats for the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade are stored, the cramped interior of a basement store in Chinatown. His views of London are more conventional in this movie: a river view of Parliament, the brick galleries of a London tennis club, the wood-and-leather library of a stately country home.<br/><br/>Perhaps, in time, Mr. Allen's perspective may bring us images of London that the natives have overlooked, but I doubt it. While this movie and his next, scheduled movie, also shot in London are worthwhile experiments, Woody Allen based in London is as unthinkable as Woody Allen in Hollywood. Come home, please, Woody. We need each other."
"wicked_stepmom","2","3","5","29 May 2011"," Not worth the time
","Flat, undeveloped characters, flat seriously underdeveloped story line. The story was so very easy to follow because there was NO complexity. Plot jumps months at a time, almost a year at a time, in more than one place, with no explanation. We went from ""I'm pregnant"" to bringing the baby home from the hospital in one scene. The main character is very unlike-able, perhaps he is supposed to be, if that was the case, there is at least one success in the movie. Mom is a sort of a bitch, the daughter that marries the main character, and the dad (Brian Cox's character) are the only like-able people in the movie, and they are naive. The plot was pretty simple, stupid guy wants wife and mistress and handles it all badly, the end."

The main character seemingly has no family and no friends even after years as a professional Tennis player. The person he confides in is an an old adversary from the tennis court. The story was painting by numbers- no surprises- everything that is going to happen is ""flagged-up"" so obviously that there are no shocks.

","I love Woody Allen films and whenever a new film by him comes out, I am rooting for him to produce something great again, so when I heard good things about this I was looking forward to it. I hated it. The plot is predicable noir, with some of Woody's clunkiest dialogue ever. The pressure, given the genre, is on the leads to smoke up the screen. The lovely Scarlett is quite well cast and suits her role physically, but there isn't much chemistry with Jonathen Rhys-Meyer. What can you say about this guy. Truly dreadful. His lines are poor in the main, but he makes them seem worse. The scenes with him and Scarlett should lift the film and give it a heartbeat, but they seem under-rehearsed and wooden. Its like watching a school play. He may have the looks, but next time Woody, cast an actor please. This guy just wrecked your film. Together with that, Woody Allen love him just doesn't have the feel for London that he has for New York. Johannsen's Fulham flat is a cheap dump? Come on! Anyone who live in London would be able to tell you that that place would cost a fortune and a student would NEVER be able to afford it! So the film is rendered out of touch and lacks all credibility. The tennis metaphor, to finish off, is rather flimsy and lacking any resonance, unlike a lot of Woody Allen's work. Altogether one for us fans to gloss over and forget."
"Killa42","3","3","5","29 April 2009"," 3 stars
","For me to like a movie I have to like the main character. I usually like Woody Allen movies also and was surprised at my disgust for this film. Here are 3 reasons: <br/><br/>1. The main character was a cheating, lying, manipulating, murdering sack of crap with no appealing characteristics.<br/><br/>2. The movie was misleading. Was it a romance? Was it a comedy? Was it a drama? It was none of the above... it wasn't even a mystery. It was simply about a cheating, lying, manipulating, murdering sack of crap with no appealing characteristics. <br/><br/>3. Skip this one if you haven't seen the movie: The cops didn't do their job. For those of you who saw this, ask yourself... why didn't the police ask the girls friend from work what Nola's plans were before she was killed? And who she was going to meet? Why have the scene with her co-worker unless that had a purpose? Why have the cop solve the crime in his dream and then not follow up? Why have the speech at the beginning of the movie about the ball going over the net, then showing the guy miss the metaphoric net near the end, only to get away with the crime anyways? Life may not be fair, and perhaps the reason Allen made this was to articulate just that. However, in real life this would not have happened. It is every cops job to not leave loose ends, and the poorly written cops in this could not seem to do just that. That is bad writing. <br/><br/>The only good thing about this movie was how great Scarlett Johansson looked. Before seeing this I didn't get why all my friends thought she was so hot and talented. She really shined."
"DaveDiggler","4","3","5","2 March 2009"," Forced Thriller That Doesn't Quite Work
","Woody Allen's ""Match Point"" is one of his most forced efforts to date. Allen tries to reinvent himself with a thriller that twists and turns for shock and awe. The biggest problem I had with with the film is the ridiculous turn it takes two-thirds of the way through. Allen tries to set the surprise up by making his main characters struggle over his involvement in a love-triangle seem so pressing on his conscience that he's forced to do the unthinkable. I didn't believe Chris Wilton's (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) change. Not for a second. It was baffling to witness. The entire time, as I'm watching his actions build up towards an inevitable climax, I'm thinking, ""Don't do it, Woody. Don't do it."" The twist just felt so forced that I laughed at the execution of the film, and, not to mention, the twist is foreseeable and not that shocking. You may shocked that Allen decided to make the turn down this road. Maybe Jonathan Rhys Meyers is just way over of his head. Maybe he's the demise of the film since the films turn rests solely on his shoulders to make the audience believe such a turn is believable.<br/><br/>I really never got into any part of this film. I wasn't engaged with these actors and their relationships at all. I didn't care about Chloe's (Emily Mortimer) obsession with getting pregnant, and actually found her terribly annoying and repulsive. Emily Mortimer is usually prime for a solid to great performance, but here she has a character that's just incredibly annoying that you find it odd how Chris can like her and how he wouldn't go after the more appealing Nola (Scarlett Johansson). Midway through the film, we kinda get bogged down in repeated scenes of Chris's inability to tell his wife that he's having an affair with another women, and we get the same argument between Chris and Nola multiple times. The film just comes to a stop. It might even lose some audiences and test their patience.<br/><br/>Matthew Goode is exceptional and stands out from the entire cast. He's really one of the few bright spots in the film. The relationship between Chris and Nola felt very fake and came off as very flat. I didn't really care about Chloe since she was written so poorly. I didn't find Chris's internal struggle interesting, engaging, or authentic. I found his actions to be forced in order to move the plot along, making the film a bit contrived and a little too neat. This isn't an effective romance or love-triangle, nor is it an effective thriller or character study. ""Match Point"" fails in the writing and the acting. This could have been good with a lead actor capable of handling such heavy material, but Jonathan Meyers is just unable to support such a dramatic turn. Very few actors can handle this kind of dramatic turn that borders unbelievability."
"Arthur_Desmond","2","3","5","20 July 2008"," So disappointing it made me angry
","This movie is nothing but a ""Crimes and misdemeanors"" rip-off, lacking both the (relative) novelty and the fortunate casting of its precedent. If the decades of experience packed by Allen have to amount to this heap of trash, I think we better think twice before we raise and keep filmmakers in some arbitrary Olympus of cinema history. Good wine, as a notorious film character put it, may indeed age into vinegar. And vice versa: for one thing, Adrian Lyne, Richard Gere and Diane Lane have been epitomes of mediocrity for most of their careers, and yet, in all its modesty, ""Unfaithful"" is a fine example of correct, unpretentious film-making. Compared to this, the downward spiral of someone like Allen should motivate a revisionist and probably destructive study of most of the film industry of the 60s and 70s -- a study devoid of any sentimentalism or partisan considerations. Audiences were impressionable back then: granted. But they shouldn't be now. Especially since the mere idea of replacing Martin Landau, Jerry Orbach, Anjelica Huston, Alan Alda or Claire Bloom with such shallow and hardly engaging brats is a stupidity all its own.<br/><br/>Several questions come to mind: <br/><br/>1. Can't anyone realize, once and for all, that Woody Allen's pen ran out of ink a long time ago? <br/><br/>2. Can't anyone realize, once and for all, that Scarlett Johansson is neither a good actress nor the closest thing to a natural candidate for a ""sex symbol""? <br/><br/>3. Can't anyone realize, once and for all, that Rhys-Meyers only stands as failure n. 23273 in the long list of failed attempts at occupying Stamp's or Caine's place? <br/><br/>4. Can't anyone realize, once and for all, that recycling past material ""per se"", with unreliable prime matter and haphazard attempts at renewal, is an empty ride and an exercise in futility?"

","Seriously Did Woody Allen write this as he was shooting it? This story is strung together so whimsically and motivated by dialogue so tough to swallow that even the actors seem at sea, painfully demonstrated by a chorus of flat-as-a-board performances namely the highly overrated ""Scleavage Johansson."" Who told Allen it was a great idea to make a 2-hour melodrama on the metaphor of luck between love and tennis, anyway? It would be more forgiving had he incorporated any of the usual witty and comedic banter, but sadly, this film takes itself far too seriously. To top it off, lead actor Jonathan Rhys Meyers, who courts 2 lady lovers in the film, comes across as flaming gay. Talk about unconvincing.

","First of all, let me say I like Woody Allen. Okay, he's very hit and miss, right across the scale. But when he gets it completely right (like ""Bullets Over Broadway"" or ""Mighty Aphrodite""): just, full marks.<br/><br/>If you're from midtown America and you're watching this, you just *might* be clueless enough to buy into the whole ""jolly hockey sticks, more tea vicar"" world that Woody Allen has written. But this is a film populated by utterly ridiculous stereotypes, swanning around in an idealized London Tourist Board picture postcard. Steve Martin's ""L.A. Story"" looks like a striking, visceral work of searing realism in comparison.<br/><br/>Myers is an unlikeable creep from the get go (there were odd moments I thought he was channelling Malcolm McDowell, but they never really surfaced), and the brother and sister duo are just so ""ma and pa are going to Henley"", I watched in disbelief. (Yes, such people exist. I know some of them. But for god's sake, Woody: try and populate the rest of your cast with a little diversity. This is a movie populated by the factory from ""The Stepford Wives"", with the computer chip switched to ""British English"". Where an actress doesn't go for an audition in some room in Soho...no, she goes (of course!) to the Royal Court Theatre. Were everyone shoots. And their father is on the board of some company. And...oh, for the love of mike. Just stop already.<br/><br/>Part of the problem is, Allen -- in Britain -- seems to have forgotten the working men's clubs and the REAL sense of Britain he experienced in his days there in standup. His existence now is defined by walking through a lobby where a man holds the door open: whether it's the Upper East Side, or London's Belgravia. When the characters in this go movie the cinema, they don't head to Leicester Square to see ""Bond"" or ""Night At The Museum"". Hell, no. They head off to the Curzon Mayfair to see ""The Motorcycle Diaries"".<br/><br/>British writer Richard Curtis might write fluffy disposable pastiches of quaint English-ism, but at least his entire cast isn't populated by vapid upper class twerps. Imagine the American version: all of Dan Ackroyd's irritating Club friends in ""Trading Places"", trying to make you genuinely care about a ""searing"" illicit romance.<br/><br/>Get a grip, Woody. You can't write British. Period. (That'd be ""full-stop"", by the way.)"

","Match Point is a decent movie. The story is similar to ""A place in the Sun."" Tennis player Chris (John Rhys Meyers) befriends rich boy Tom(Matthew Good) bringing him into a circle of the very wealthy. Chris is looking to move up in the world and begins a relationship with Toms plain Jane sister Chloe (Emily Mortimer). Trouble looms when Chris meets Nola (Scarlett Johannssen). Lets just say the plot thickens and complications arise from Chris's lust and stupidity.<br/><br/>This movie is at best average. I think Jonathan Rhys Meyers was a good actor to portray the social climbing Chris. He had that dopey eyed, boyish look. <br/><br/>Matthew Good as Tom as decent, though not a major role he played a British snob quite well and thankfully his appearance was kept to a minimum.<br/><br/>Emily Mortimer as Chloe is very much a sympathetic character and one is made to feel bad for her though I did not. <br/><br/>Scarlett as Nola. Perfect. A somewhat sleazy would be actress who has sexiness, but little else.<br/><br/>*****************SPOILERS***************************<br/><br/>I did not find much in Match Point or maybe I just did not like it too much that I found things ""wrong"" with it... <br/><br/>1. Chris, why is he such a sissy? He is not only stupid with his actions but even more amazing is no one around him suspects otherwise! Certainly his wife would be a little suspicious as well as the Tom character.<br/><br/>2. The Hewitts. They are very rich and reject Nola and seem to almost immediately welcome Chris, without any hesitation. Was it because he has that lovely English accent and Nola is...(gasp!)...American? Certainly they were very prejudice and would not have been so open to Chris as they are portrayed in the movie, after all the guy had no business experience yet is offered a high profile position in the family company, makes no sense.<br/><br/>3. Chloe. Is this woman blind? It is obvious Chris has such a strong interest in Nola. He looks at her in a way he never once looks at Chloe and always manages to conveniently be present where Nola is while Chloe is wondering ""Where is Chris?"". I do not think most wives would be that clueless especially when the other woman is right there all the time!<br/><br/>4. The rain hook up. This occurred at one of the family homes and certainly both Chris and Nola must have come back drenched. This would raise questions and yet no one again notices. Hmmm I guess it is just completely normal when two people in other relationships disappear at the same time, soak in the rain and no one wonders where they have been or what they have been doing. Maybe they are just talking about each others views on the AIDS epidemic in Africa. I find this particular first love encounter between the two, while somewhat ideal, not practical. Someone is bound to either notice or become suspicious.<br/><br/>5. Nola is the other woman, yet she expects Chris to eventually leave Chloe for her and accuses him of being a liar when he lies about his family vacation. DUH! The man is cheating on his wife with you! Does that not already make him a known liar? Nola, though is not far fetched as I have encountered many ""other women"" who like to believe their married lovers will leave their spouse for them and it becomes obvious that the relationship is pure sexual attraction. Nola becomes pregnant and expects Chris to do the right thing since he a man of such noble intentions! This complicates things causing Chris to take drastic measures.<br/><br/>I found the ending of this film to at least be satisfying which I will not give away. This is a movie that I enjoyed at the theaters, but not at home. It had a creepy feel as Opera music played during some of the most dramatic scenes. It is worth watching....but in my opinion only once."

I then wondered if Allan had run out of ideas and was just re-hashing his old films. Sure, it's set in a different place and has different characters, but really - if you've seen that movie, you've seen this one.<br/><br/>If you've never seen ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"", then this one is probably OK, more like 5 star than 3. Still, there is quite a lot of stilted dialog, and the sex scenes are awful. How do you ruin a sex scene with such good looking people? Well - it happened a lot in this movie.<br/><br/>I also found the directing quite poor. The framing and camera placement was fine, but the actors were better than they appeared in this movie. I've seen Scarlett Johansson in plenty of things, and she has always been better than we see her here.<br/><br/>Still, the overall story is interesting and you wonder what's going to happen.

Not one of the characters in Match Point could possibly be less interesting, appealing, or sympathetic. Woody Allen's growing, embarrassing obsession with Scarlett Johanssen notwithstanding, she's just an emergency backup Charlize Theron, 15 years younger, without Theron's experience and range as an actress and her mature sex appeal as a woman. Since Match Point also rehashes Woody's old pseudophilosophical ruminations of Crimes and Misdemeanors, I wish I could say watch Crimes and Misdemeanors instead, but I wouldn't wish that one on anybody either. No, you just can't beat Woody Allen's ""early, funny ones.""

No autopsy was conducted on Nola or the fetus? <br/><br/>2. They didn't even dust either of the flats for DNA residue or prints? <br/><br/>3. The ring wasn't the only thing missing from the old woman's flat, why just because you found a ring on a dead drug dealer would you automatically close a case and not try and use that lead to sniff out the rest of the missing items? <br/><br/>4. No eyewitness reports except for the neighbour who saw Nola minutes before her demise? That couldn't have happened here in NYC! At least 20 people would have seen something, including people who weren't even there!!!!! Besides, that street looked like it housed a lot of nosy type neighbours, how is it that nobody saw Chris (an out of place socialite looking man) enter or leave the building on the day of the murders, as well as the many times he came there to see Nola? <br/><br/>5. As curious and as nosy as Chris's wife was, she never once caught her husband going down to the cellar to steal or replace the shotgun?<br/><br/>6. The police didn't even bother to check phone records? <br/><br/>7. What about Nola's co-worker? Nobody even bothered to go interview her, and she obviously knew about the affair and pregnancy.<br/><br/>8. With a gun as loud as that, you just have to wonder how nobody heard it go off twice is such a stuffy looking neighbourhood and not to mention the building itself. + look how long Chris had to wait for Nola to come home!!!! <br/><br/>9. The neighbour knocks for so long on the old lady's door but never once thinks to call the cops to tell them that it's unusual for her not to answer her door? Somebody who barely leaves the house. And how that loser was upstairs the whole time the old lady was getting killed and did not hear anything is just totally and universally beyond me!!!! <br/><br/>10. Don't even get me started about the diary and its contents. <br/><br/>11. The crime was so sloppy, that even a high school Forensic-Files-Nancy-Drew-wannabe-team of students could have solved it, yet the entire police department for that city couldn't? <br/><br/>12. The maid must have seen something, yet she said nothing."

The differences?

","For those whom have not read the 5 book Ripley Series by American Writer Patrica Highsmith, this film may be mildly interesting, but for Highsmith Fans after the first twenty minutes of the picture it is painfully obvious, that both the characters and the plot is a thinly veiled, copy inspired by Highsmiths work. i do not need to list the plot entries which include almost every aspect of the film, or the character similarities down to the inclusion of some very familiar character names. As a fan of Highsmith, I could not find one original point from Allen in the entire movie. This greatly saddened me as I am usually a fan of Allen and cannot help but wonder Why Mr. Allen did not film the Second Book in the Ripley series, which is far more cohesive than this piece."
"BOUF","4","3","5","5 April 2006"," Cardboard characters in service of a not very credible plot, creaky doalogue, but Emily Mortimer's performance transcends the plodding script.
","Much of your enjoyment of Woody Allen's latest movie may hinge on whether you find Jonathan Rhys Meyers attractive and/or charismatic. I fail on both counts. It's a good looking, but pedestrian drama, in which JRM plays Chris, a gloomy, charmless parasite, who takes about 7 minutes of screen time to worm his way into a well-to-do British family. They all (mystifyingly) find him charming. He marries the daughter (the excellent Emily Mortimer), and lands an executive job in daddy's firm. Meanwhile, he's in lust with a sexy, wannabe actress (Scarlett Johansson) and is torn between her and his well-heeled home life. Many familiar sequences ensue, and most opportunities for suspense are either ignored or fluffed. Although there is some tension, and a few amusing moments, overall this is a plodding morality play, in which the cardboard characters are in the service of a not very credible plot. The actors do their best, but the story requires their characters to be so unaware of Chris's odious personality, and anti-social behavior, that it's almost comic. There's no chance anyone will misinterpret Woody's message, because everything is spelled out and underlined  especially the bald reminders of what a huge part luck plays in life. Get lucky, give this one a miss."
"Hellmao","4","3","5","21 February 2006"," Typing soap
","After having been announced as the best Woody Allen Film in many years (like every Woody Allen Film somehow is), Match Point pulled me over the line  and pushed me back. <br/><br/>The cast is credible and appropriate in their roles, but annoyingly stereotyped in their appearance and behaviour, with Scarlett Johanssons role as a slight exception. Also the world around Chris is stereotyped. The stock chart on his office desk is a gimmick and to show him pulling heavy business, he shakes hands with Japanese guys, saying ""Sayonara"". His heartless mother-in-law is THE heartless mother-in-law. To show how much Chris lost interest in his wife he doesn't answer to Chloe's remarks on earthquakes in China and the fact that a new planet has been discovered. In a restaurant, the former poor Irish guy is longing for roasted chicken, while the high society snobs prefer french cuisine and caviar, of course. Nobody ever works. This is daily soap style. <br/><br/>Allen uses these things to make us understand that the characters are all decadent and hollow, but that is very obvious already. The most disappointing thing, however, is the screenplay. This is the art that Allen used to push forward when he was writing short stories in the 70s, but in Match Point his type machine has lost all edges. I cannot remember a single sharp dialogue line. Because of his tendency towards stretching the plot (according to the IMDb, it is the longest movie he ever made), and the decision to mainly build the story on weak performing Jonathan Rhys Myers, the interest in any further human behaviour observation is lost half way. Chabrol or Malle describe these worlds much better. <br/><br/>Amazingly, many people love this movie, call it clever, intelligent, and recommend it for important awards. To me, that is truly astonishing. That's the good thing about movies. You can make up your own mind."
"huntley_haverstock","10","3","5","21 February 2006"," Woody Allen Must Never Die
","Having just returned from an afternoon screening of the latest Woody Allen film, all I can say is that I am in awe. In awe of a man, who after more than thirty years of film-making is still able to be so original, so poignant, so powerful, and so creative. Now into his seventies Woody has either written, directed or stared in (usually all three) a movie virtually ever year since 1969's 'Take The Money and Run' and with his latest 'Match Point' finally arriving in theaters he shows no signs of slowing down his prolific pace of unparalleled creativity as his latest project is undoubtedly his best in years.<br/><br/>The story revolves around an affluent British family and their particularly ambitious new son in-law. Chris (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) is a retired tennis pro who's recently taken a position as an instructor at one of London's most exclusive Country clubs. It is at this post that he meets and befriends Tom (Matthew Goode) a young executive in his father's highly successful London based business (the nature of which is never revealed). Tom introduces Chris to the high life, a world of garden parties and opera, a world Chris has dreamed of but has always been forced to view it from the outside like so many window displays that line Savell Row, Chris' new favorite shopping district. All seems to be running according to plan, Chris meets Tom's sister Chloe (Emily Mortimer) and the two hit it off, sparking a relationship that comes with a promising new career in the family business attached, when on a cloudy British afternoon Chris meets Nola (Scarlet Johansson) a struggling American actress from Boulder, Colorado who also happens to be Tom's fiancé. The two are instantly and irrevocably attracted to one another and begin to run into each other around London, each visit bringing an increased sexual tension until a countryside tryst confirms what both had suspected. Soon however, what they had falls apart as Nola doesn't wish to continue their deceitful liaisons. Eventually Tom and Nola end their engagement and Nola seems to disappear forcing Chris to settle into his perfect life, that is until a chance meeting at an art gallery drives the two to resume their ill-fated relationship, a relationship that will eventually prove deadly.<br/><br/>'Match Point' marks a return for Allen to the thematic ideas he's explored in previous outings such as 'Crimes and Misdemeanors' and 'Hannah and Her Sisters,' themes of lust, rejection, deceit and most of all luck. The theme of chance and opportunity is a common one throughout Woody's films but he had yet to attacked this topic with such fervor and brilliance. Let's not forget to mention suspense, Allen comes closer to Hitchcock than he or any other director of recent years has ever been able to, I guarantee you will spend the last twenty minutes of this film on no more that the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>Woody Allen is back in fine form, better than we've seen him a few years, there's no denying it, and I am personally begging you to do yourself a favor and join him at the theater; you won't be disappointed."
"blanche-2","10","3","5","19 February 2006"," A furtive tear
","As much as I have always appreciated Woody Allen comedies, I admit to liking more the dramas where he asks the tough questions. The brilliant ""Match Point,"" like ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" is one of those, and it's his best.<br/><br/>Loosely based on ""A Place in the Sun,"" Allen's tough question is, ""Would you rather be good or lucky?"" ""Is there such a thing as luck?"" Many believe that people ""make their own luck."" But Allen's premise is that, when it's all over, luck plays a huge part in all of our lives. He uses the analogy of a tennis ball - when you serve a ball and it lands on the net, it can topple over to the other side, and you win, or fall on the same side, and you lose.<br/><br/>What a perfect analogy to tell the story of Chris (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), a former professional tennis player. He becomes the tennis teacher at a British club and meets Tom Hewett, a young man from a filthy rich family. Chris is embraced by Hewett's family and begins dating Tom's sister Chloe. Then he sees Tom's fiancé, Nola, played by Scarlett Johannson, and becomes obsessed with her.<br/><br/>This is an amazing film - absolutely nothing happens for a while, and yet everything happens. The story is punctuated with old, scratchy Caruso records and operatic selections from ""Macbeth,"" ""Otello,"" and others. We watch the characters living their lives, including their work, romantic entanglements, and marital problems. We watch them evolve, grow happy or unhappy, contented or restless, all leading up to the point where something does happen. When it does, it's ferocious. The ending will knock your socks off. It goes nowhere you think it's going. The film manages to keep you constantly off-balance and misinterpreting what you think you're seeing.<br/><br/>The last time I saw Jonathan Rhys Meyers, he was giving a marvelous portrayal of Elvis Presley, despite the fact that his height and frame are somewhat slighter than the King's. A beautiful young man, he has an interior dialogue going throughout the film. We don't hear it; we see it on his face. Scarlet Johannson is gorgeous and sexy as Nola, a cool blond in the Lana Turner tradition who is the object of his desire. Of all the characters in the film, her character goes through the most change, and she's very effective.<br/><br/>There are no easy answers to the questions Allen asks in ""Crimes and Misdemeanors,"" ""Stardust Memories,"" ""Bullets over Broadway,"" and ""Match Point."" Allen leaves open what will happen emotionally as a result of the events of this film. But the verse of ""Una Furtiva Lagrima,"" (A secret tear) played several times during the film despite a bad skip in the recording means ""For just one moment the beating Of her hot pulse could be felt! With her sighing confounding Momentarily my sighs! Oh God, I shall expire; I can't ask for more."" Significantly, it is heard at the beginning of the film and at the end.<br/><br/>Just remember - the record skips."
"G_Mac85","3","3","5","10 February 2006"," Woody Allen has gone mad!!!!!
","I can't think too hard right now...I'm watching the San Antonio Spurs beat the New Jersey Nets...it's Friday...I finished classes earlier today...and I haven't moved in like 4 hours, so needless to say, I'm a tad groggy.<br/><br/>Thankful I am that Match Point, Woody Allen's only critically praised movie in my state of intellectual existence, is a pile of generic garbage glazed ever so lightly with enough cheap high-art ploys that certain individuals actually enjoyed it beyond it's dry dialogue and dreadful plot development. <br/><br/>I swear on my DVD copy of Manhattan that this movie's plot development is one of the most agonizing experiences in recent memory. Actually, it's laughable.<br/><br/>Like many others have expressed, I too have no strength to write a proper review of this movie. I just want to bring the rating down from an undeserving 8 out of 10!!!<br/><br/>Nothing that happens in this movie is believable, including the fact that critics say ""Woody is Back!"". This movie is a bad day. It's one of those ""days"" where unbelievable occurrences keep happening and happening, creating an excruciating pain deep in your stomach. <br/><br/>Don't believe anyone who praises this movie...they in love with it's sleek British sexiness. This movie has no heart, it's not funny, and it tells no truth about the human condition (despite an overt attempt by Woody Allen early on, at establishing Chris Wilton's (main character) philosophy about luck playing a largely significant role in the outcome of life......ooooohhhhhhhhh Match Point!) The aforementioned philosophy quickly dissipates and gives way to the obvious route of the plot: the incredibly trite tale of seductress lures impressionable (humble by social-status, but this isn't true at all) male. That is the interesting part. The last 30-45 minutes are horribly painful, as FAR TOOOOOOO MUCH TIME IS SPENT ON WHAT THE TWO MAIN CHARACTERS ARE GOING TO DO ABOUT THE AFFAIR. Let me give you an example of the final 30 to 45 minutes of Match Point:<br/><br/>Chris: I lust for you! Nola: You're married<br/><br/>Sex<br/><br/>Chris: I desire you! Nola: Me too!<br/><br/>Sex<br/><br/>Chris: I must have you! Nola: Where is this going! Chris: ............<br/><br/>Sex<br/><br/>Chris: I really must have you now! Nola: I need to know this is for sure! Chris: I'll tell her in a week<br/><br/>Sex<br/><br/>Chris: I'll tell her next week.<br/><br/>Sex<br/><br/>Chris: We're at the country house, I'll tell her when we get back.<br/><br/>Sex (a day later)<br/><br/>Nola: I WANT TO BE WITH YOU! WHY WON'T YOU TELL HER?!?!? Chris: I don't know, what do you want from me?!?! Nola: I'm pregnant.<br/><br/>Sex<br/><br/>Nola: What say you!!!! Chris: I'll leave my wife tomorrow.<br/><br/>Sex<br/><br/>So basically this keeps going on, while all the while Chris comes to the insane conclusion that he must take deadly actions....oooooohhh, I wonder what it could be. Maybe it's so tough to figure out since tales of affair never end up in anyone's eternal demise.<br/><br/>This movie is a joke of a story, and Woody Allen doesn't deserve the praise. He was once a freaking genius, but much like Mic Jagger, he has held on somehow, and let critics tolerate him long enough to eventually feel enough pity for him to utter the words of praise."
"liang-7","8","3","5","5 February 2006"," How we get away with murder
","I cannot accept the idea that Mr. Allen would be in any way interested in making a film about murder or even sex for that matter. I have always considered the man a pure intellectual at best as director and worst as actor when words keeps pouring out of his mouth whenever he is in a frame. In my humble opinion I am not mistaken since the sex scenes in Match Point does not involve nudity nor the murders bloodshed.<br/><br/>To me Match Point is a tragedy in the classic meaning of the word. When Chris has to account for his murders to his victims in the end, he quotes - and that cannot be an accident - one of the greatest Greek tragedy playwrights Sophocles. So the form is tragedy but the theme itself is a metaphor. What Chris truly killed is his youth aspirations which is to make a real contribution to the world. He killed his true passion impersonated by Nola, and he killed the fruit of his passion represented by his unborn child. Neither his athletic abilities, his interest for Dostojevski, Strindberg and opera, nor his MBA can save him. <br/><br/>The metaphor apply to most of us. Applied to Mr. Allen himself, the firm would be the film industry. The in laws would be the warm welcome of international acclaim for his work and fans who keep watching his movies. Nola would be his true passions which are all the scripts that are being rejected by producers over and over again and the unborn child are scripts that he doesn't even dare to write on paper. Condemned to be a society man he cannot both mechanically produce films that brings him fame and fortune and at the same time be consumed by ideas that leads to 'nowhere' so he sees only one solution to this dilemma which is eliminating the passionate path in his life.<br/><br/>When we get older and look back the way we once were, the dreams, ideas and loves we had, and when we at the same time look at the what remains of it then maybe we can congratulate ourselves that our apartment has a view over the river Thames, but then again we look at that child, which is the personification of our compromise to society and the life style we have chosen, then suddenly we might realize that we have indeed in a way killed those dreams, ideas and loves, and because we are just about the only ones who knows about it, we actually got away with it. And quite successfully jolly good fellow.<br/><br/>And tennis and luck? Well, I think Mr. Allen just used all those references to the game of tennis as a format for those who cannot see beyond that level. The movie Match Point has nothing to do with luck whatsoever. Luck in Match Point is just a pun, a cinematographic pun. And serving at match point Chris just end up where he started of: is the match worth winning or worse is the match worth playing?"
"Alieniloquium","9","3","5","28 January 2006"," ""Match Point"" is Hitchcock-cum-Dostoyevsky and fantastic new territory for Woody Allen.
","""Crime and Punishment"" is familiar stomping ground for Woody Allen, but every other element to ""Match Point"" is foreign. The setting, London, is literally foreign and the melodrama built into a domestic thriller is equally new for Allen. The subject matter of infidelity, highly reminiscent on ""Crimes and Misdemeanors,"" is typical Allen, however, and his new spin on it incredibly satisfying.<br/><br/>The film has been criticized for its setting and Allen's poor representation of Londoners. While the depiction of the locals and the locale is indeed clichéd, Allen has no interest in portraying realism in this film. Hitchcock is notorious for saying, ""Reality is something that none of us can stand, at any time,"" and Allen runs with this idea from Chris Wilton's (Jonathan Rhys Myers) ridiculous Lacoste and Ralph Lauren attire to his wife's (Emily Mortimer) painfully yuppie fanaticism with hideous art. There are no double-decker buses, but everyone rides in black cabs. The viewer should not despair at the dubious placement of the Houses of Parliament across from Wilton's flat; it is all part of Allen's way of playing with our expectations and sense of justice.<br/><br/>The entire Hewett family is just a piece of the scenery. They are as flat as can be (although they are entertaining to watch). They serve to make us identify with and like the enormously unlikable Chris Wilton. The only other developed character is Nola Rice (Scarlett Johansson), whom, significantly, we first see playing table tennis against former tennis pro Wilton. Her white dress hardly indicates innocence as it recalls Lana Turner's dress in ""The Postman Always Rings Twice."" She is the American blonde femme fatale, but clearly outclassed at the ping-pong table. What are we to expect? Allen is surprisingly deft with his command of a thriller. He avoids cheap ploys standard to infidelity flicks. The suspense does not come from Chloe's (Wilton's wife) growing suspicion. In fact, Allen's script hardly contains any suspicion on the part of the Hewetts. Standard to suspense movies is the waxing and waning of tension through situations where the lovers could get caught. For instance, when Chris and Nola kiss outside of the box at the opera, the viewer expects someone to come out or expects them to have to explain their absence in some way. Instead, the film cuts before any resolution is offered, leaving the tension high. Similarly, after Nola and Chris allow their passions to best them in rain on the countryside, the viewer wonders how they will explain their sopping and muddy clothes to the Hewetts. We can only assume that Hewetts are as fantastically naïve as the film skips any possible confrontation and cuts to another day and scene entirely. The viewer is allowed no reprieve from the tension as Chris continues to commit daring acts of stupidity and infidelity. Due to the lack of other developed characters, we must root for him and like him despite his slimy nature.<br/><br/>The only hope the viewer has for Chris is Allen's initial metaphor of luck. As adept at cheating as Chris may be, he admits that there are moments where luck could take him either way, to salvation or damnation. Playing over his sexual romps is incessant opera music, following his view of life as a great tragedy with no god, only pure chance. The opera music serves as another tool for making the entire story unreal enough into which we may immerse ourselves. In a film as godless and lacking in morals as ""Match Point,"" only the surreal would allow us to selfishly hope for Chris's well-being simply so that our nerves can take a break from his skulking.<br/><br/>It is unfortunate that to praise the best part of the film is to spoil the third act. To do the most justice (a significantly poor word to use for this film), one can only say that the ending is sadistically satisfying. To have an ending as deliciously godless, amoral, and simultaneously satisfying as the culmination of ""Match Point""can only be attributed to Woody Allen's skill at moving into new territory with one of best movies of the year."
"Iama5yrold","10","3","5","23 January 2006"," Would you rather be lucky or good?
","This movie took me by surprise. I'm a big Scarlett Johansson fan so I figured I'd see a nice little Woody Allen comedy drama with Scarlett being as sexy as one role could contain -- and I got that -- but there are so many more layers that continue to pile up as the movie goes on. Once the real action starts -- or perhaps I should say the real suspense -- it never lets up and it kept me quite literally on the edge of my seat.<br/><br/>On the other hand the movie is really quite funny. From the simple jokes -- like the confusion between ""Wok"" and ""Work"" which seems designed for English speaking audiences outside of Britain -- to the more intelligent jokes which can only be understood properly with an overarching view of the entire situation -- like the ""Powerful serve"" line, which is as funny as it is because of the complexity of which Chloe is totally unaware.<br/><br/>Just let yourself fall into the traps each character (particularly the four main characters) sets for themselves and your bound to get lost in the little world Allen has set up. Every shot is beautiful and a witty comment on its own so if you're open to it you will enjoy this movie as much as I do. I am waiting (quite impatiently) for someone I know to see this movie so I can discuss each scene for hours and hours -- the complexity in their faces alone! Oh my, go see this movie!"

I will never forget this.<br/><br/>Of course the movie is not perfect. Scarlett is probably not the most impressing cast for her role, because after her impressive opening scene, she acted a bit shallow and predictable.

","After the brief resurgence in Allen wit, style and innovation, this really feels like a giant leap backwards. After the stellar performances, nuances and power of Melinda and Melinda I was excited about Allen's first ever venture away from his beloved New York. With a painstakingly British line-up (including everyone from Brian Cox to James Nesbitt) and setting/ theme (class divide and tennis!), not to mention the sizzling Scarlett Johannson, Allen seemed to have a sure-fire Richard Curtis-bashing British hit on his handsbut oh dear. <br/><br/>I think Match Point will succeed in America with the ethereal ultra-London setting, concentrating on Union Jack Mini's and every prime location in the Rough Guide's centre-folds. I could never really understand who this film could be enjoyed by. I mean, we all get the clever operatic narrative and the Sliding Doors life-split decisive moments but there is so much wrong. The British will snicker at the outrageous stereotypes and the rest will find it hard to like any of the characters. Rhys Meyers is shallow and nasty, Johansson is sexy but weak and the whole Brian Cox family reeks of upper-class nonchalance. Not to mention the noticeable lack of Allen traits which we have all grown to love.<br/><br/>Hop back on a BA Flight Woody and get back to what you know best."
"GratefulJBG","5","7","17","5 January 2006"," What happened?
","One can usually say that even a mediocre Woody Allen film is better than most of the films released today. But this one was just match-pointless. It went nowhere. The entire movie up until the last 40 minutes were useless. The theme of luck (which is a great one) was underdeveloped, and there was no investment in this back story of the protagonist. We are just told he has come from a poor upbringing, and are expected to be invested in his nascent success and social climbing. His character was almost totally uninteresting. I'd rather have watched a movie about the Tom Hewett character. The introduction of the detective characters near the end of the film made it seem like another, more interesting movie had been going on, which we had been missing watching the main one. I liked this movie better when it was called Crimes and Misdemeanors. One saving grace is that Scarlett Johansson is hot. But why no gratuitous boob shots like those of Christina Ricci in Anything Else?"
"Harvb886","1","10","27","28 December 2005"," Allen's Disaster Movie
","The risks involved in writing films about a culture you do not live in or fully appreciate are all too evident in this movie. Allen clearly has no ear for English behaviour or speech rhythms, and his vision of middle class England is woefully off target. Worse, by giving his actors a dreary, predictable script he has made them all look third rate, which is unforgivable. The film lacks passion and structure and every painful step we have to take with this 'thriller' that neither thrills nor entertains is an insult to the British way of life and to our intelligence. For Golden Globes read The Emperor's New Clothes Awards, which should signal game, set and match for Allen's career, but will doubtless have an army of financiers clamouring along the baseline who are too in awe to realise that they are being hoodwinked by a man well past his prime. Neurosis, self-doubt and insecurity may be part of the tapestry of life in Manhatten, but they have no place among a society that plays to win with every swipe of the racket and accepts chance as a part of everyday life rather than a cheap manipulation in a film script."

","None of the characters are very inspiring. And even the main character is boring while he's being stupid. They are hopeless from go to woe. If you enjoy watching a bad paint job dry slowly, then you should enjoy this film. There is simply nothing terribly redeeming about the story or its characters. The film seems to have tricked a following into believing that it has something significant to say.<br/><br/>The film has no moral and no charm. It seems simply to be about a bunch of ""beautiful"", rich and aimless folks going about their selfish lives hopelessly. One thing I believe is somewhat expressed; is actor Jonathan Rhys Meyers portrayal of the character, Chris Wilton's internally soul destroying actions; I think he responded truthfully to the pain, we as an audience feel, watching this SLOW MOTION car accident of a movie.<br/><br/>The ""significance"" of the film and the hook for its title is that if a piece of incriminating evidence (tennis ball) bounces back (off the net losing you the point), it nevertheless may save you the match. This ""twist of fate"" is not profound, and does not warrant the sitting through of the preceeding two hours of tedious film making. Had I not been with friends, I assure you I would not have, I would have ejected myself from the cinema after the first twenty minutes.<br/><br/>The characters' selfish amoral lifestyles are losing them everything.

","Woody Allen, who has been struggling in his most recent films, is in top form here, aided by sterling performances from his leads as described in all the other reviews here. He manages to capture London and the upper crust perfectly for the bulk of his intended audience: Americans. <br/><br/>He loses two stars for two reasons: a sluggish 'first act,' which often drags and violates one of the principal dicta in film-making: move as far forward into the action as possible--any sensible audience will 'know' what brought us to where we are; the second reason is that (and Woody Allen must have known this) some of the film was apparently shot for television, with 'talking heads' that loom fifteen feet tall on the theatre screen and overwhelm the viewer. On the home screen, this would be in acceptable scale but on the big screen it's overpowering. <br/><br/>This would have been a perfect 10 had it been a 90-minute film. As it is, it's remarkably good and speaks excellently to Allen's sensitivity to British culture and behaviour, and his mastery over nuanced plot details. <br/><br/>Jonathan Rhys-Davies is magnetically watchable as he processes the realities around him, conveying emotion and meaning even when not saying anything (a good test for acting skill). It might have made him more credible as one who had come from a humble Irish background had he used the slightest hint of an Irish accent, but that's not a serious criticism except for the accent-aware (guilty as charged, m'lud)."

","Woody Allen went serious in 2005 with this incredibly serious and tense thriller set in England. That is not to say that Allen has abandoned the themes of his earlier work, about meaning and morality in this world of injustice and chaos. Of course the conclusion of this film is much more pessimistic than that of his others. This is not a whodunit or a crime doesn't pay moral message, this is filmmaking on a more powerful and intensely cynical level. It is a film about injustice and about the fact that crime can pay for people who betray moral values out of greed. Not that it supports this depravity, it states a cold truth, that there is no punishment for the wicked if they manage to fool the people around them. It may not be touchy-feely, but it certainly packs a cold, calculated, but incredibly sexy punch."

","A clandestine love affair sends one man's charmed life into a tailspin in this dark, disturbing drama written and directed by Woody Allen entitled Match Point.It stars Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Scarlett Johansson, Emily Mortimer, Matthew Goode, Brian Cox and Penelope Wilton.<br/><br/>Chris Wilton is an Irish tennis player with an impoverished background. Just accomplished enough to make his way onto the professional circuit, but not skilled enough to be a consistent winner, he now works as an instructor at a London tennis club. The wealthy Tom Hewett, who is as impressed by Chris's charm and good looks as he is by his game, takes a tennis lesson from the young man. Chris's intelligence and wit also make a strong impression on Tom's pretty sister, Chloe, who soon falls for him. It isn't long before Chris and Chloe are engaged to be married, a match that pleases both Tom and his father, Alec, a successful businessman who believes Chris has a bright future in his firm. However, Chris also feels an overwhelming attraction to Nola Rice, a sexy blonde from the United States who is dating Tom. Though Nola initially puts up some resistance, Chris gently nudges her in the direction of an affair. Passion soon ignites between the two, and they have a one-time sexual encounter, even as Chris and Chloe plan their wedding. Nola resists, however, when Chris makes additional attempts to wheedle her into bed. Nola drops out of Chris's life shortly before his wedding, but a chance meeting a few months later resurrects the relationship as Chris and Chloe try to start a family.<br/><br/>This lean, mean, surprisingly sultry thriller about fate, luck, greed and guilt is Woody Allen's best since Mighty Aphrodite.It has a winning combination of sex, mystery, brilliant writing and first-rate acting that all adds up to one of the most erotic and exhilarating movies Allen has done.It is one of his sharpest films in many years."

I say seems, because for most of the film we don't know what he's thinking. We see him with Chloe and with Nola, but we wonder what he feels as opposed to what he thinks each of them wants to hear.<br/><br/>Woody Allen is no stranger to navel-gazing characters trying to figure out what they really want, but Match Point is a departure for him: if there are other films by Allen that take dark turns into Hitchcockian deception and betrayal, I haven't seen them. It's well done--as clever as some of the rotund master's films--and executed with style.<br/><br/>Why you should see it: You like Hitchcock's films, but you've seen them all and Hitchcock died years ago, so you'll settle for Hitchcockian films.<br/><br/>Why you shouldn't see it: There's no nudity and no blood on camera.

","Great film, mostly free of many of the Woody tics that turn off the non-fans.

At the surface, there is a classic love triangle with the other woman, but the setup of the class dimension gives the film its bite. <br/><br/>Rhys Myers' character is the upwardly mobile Irish tennis pro finding his way into the jungle of the English upper class; the crux of the film is that his attempt to solve his romantic problems will end up being practically-motivated rather than achieved through finessing social relations, and we are left to the very end to find out whether or not this is his undoing.<br/><br/>Rhys Myers is OK, Johansson brings the screen presence but the reason to watch the film is for the relatively tight plotting (by Allen standards) along with WA's always-excellent eye for the underlying dynamics of sexual attraction and obsession.

"barryrd","8","2","3","17 January 2011"," Woody Allen's film noir
","It surprises me that this movie has not received more attention because it is a major departure for Woody Allen's career as a director and a very dark and brooding film that has more in common with Double Indemnity or The Postman Always Rings Twice. It is not a comedy but it does borrow on some of the themes in Allen's previous movies, particularly Crimes and Misdemeanors. It also deals with London's version of the artistic crowd he casually mocks in his New York movies of the 1980's. The climax is one that could have appeared in a film noir of the 1940's.<br/><br/>The dialogue is witty and the cast is excellent with Jonathan Rhys-Meyers and Scarlett Johanssen in the leading roles as two newcomers to London society whose paths converge, then change and finally come together again leading to a bizarre twist of fate at the end. Matthew Goode and Emily Mortimer as brother and sister are both excellent and round out the leading players. Brian Cox and Penelope Wilton are Mr and Mrs Hewett, the society couple who bring Rhys-Meyers into the family firm.<br/><br/>I found the lives of the family that Rhyss-Meyers married into somewhat shallow and this was no doubt Woody Allen's intent, reflecting his distaste for families with social status. Rhyss-Meyers finds it ""boring"" as he puts it, and seeks out an unconventional girl from Boulder, Colorado for some excitement and falls madly in love with her. He cannot bring himself to abandon the perks that come as a member of his new family and this leads to rather grim consequences with one person finding unusual good luck."
"secondtake","8","2","3","17 July 2009"," Flawlessly filmed, Intensely Subtle, a Tight, almost Ibsen-like Drama
","Match Point (2005)<br/><br/>Woody Allen's latest films, which I like a lot, are not overtly original. We are miles from Bananas, Stardust Memories, and Zelig. We are not even in the same room as other intimate dramas like Annie Hall or Hannah and Her Sisters. Match Point almost feels like a perfectly executed exercise in making an ordinary film, but making it so well we are spellbound and willing. There is a feeling as you watch that something more should happen, and maybe that's the genius of it, when something more does happen and it isn't so outrageous after all. Except in the usual sense--outrageous for Allen, and for a few other special filmmakers, used to mean charting new territory.<br/><br/>The movie is so finely balanced it's hard to find what to note in particular. But maybe, as a photographer, I'll start with the camera-work, not because it's stellar, but because it's invisible. And this invisibility is the film's trademark, some might say its only flaw. If you do watch the camera-work, though, you'll see no amazing light, no sweeping or swooping moving shots, no hand-held jitters, no black and white aura (all things Allen has used in the past). Instead, the visuals are in service to the story--superbly professional and subtle.<br/><br/>Everyone and every thing is out to support the story. Remember, Woody Allen is a writer, and maybe a writer above all. His fascination with an innocent person doing something wrong--from cheating on his woman to murder--appears more frequently in his films, and he makes it so terribly real, and subtle, and vivid, it becomes a real shock on the screen. And yet a shock with coat and tie, just theatrical and polite enough to avoid being literally shocked. Instead we experience a kind of theater-shock, the surprise and delight (and dismay) at seeing the character do something shocking, beyond the fourth wall.<br/><br/>This isn't meant to be double talk. I'm stressing how finely tuned the performances are woven together to enhance the basic events as a beautiful stage act. Yet it's on film, and filmed and directed with elegant subtlety. Three of Allen's most recent movies--Match Point, Vicki Christina Barcelona, and Cassandra's Dream--take a similar approach to life, crime, and infidelity, rooted in earlier films like his masterpiece Crimes and Misdemeanors (1989) and Manhattan Murder Mystery (1993). By itself, it's a body or work to distinguish any director. I know people who dismiss many of Allen's films basically because they aren't what they expected, his middle period serious films like Another Woman (1988), for example, but that's a shame. He's still at it, in a more conventional vein, for sure, but brilliantly, memorably."

"Ricky_Roma__","Null","2","3","27 June 2008"," London Woody (spoilers throughout)
","When it came out, Match Point was touted as a return to form for Woody Allen. It was meant to be one of his best films. Instead it's something of a disappointment, mostly because the two main stars perform so badly. Time after time amateurish acting spoils a possibly good scene. Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Scarlett Johansson are completely out of their depth.<br/><br/>The worst scenes occur towards the end when the fiendish Meyers concocts a plan to kill his lover. They spend ages talking and arguing, and over and over again Scarlett, who's pregnant, tries to get Myers to leave his wife. But all Scarlett does is walk around, drinking and popping pills as she shrilly berates her beau, and Myers just tugs his hair and shouts. It's like a school play  the quality of acting is that poor.<br/><br/>But you have to wonder what Meyers sees in the woman. Yes she's physically attractive, but her character is spoiled, selfish and whiny. Therefore I celebrated her murder at the hands of Meyers like he'd won Wimbledon. She really did deserve to be put out of her misery, screeching like a harridan at every moment and falling for Meyers' lies.<br/><br/>I was just annoyed that Meyers didn't kill his wife as well, as she was just as bad, if not worse, than Scarlett. Played by Emily Mortimer she's a silly little rich girl who gets besotted by the handsome ex-tennis pro and is then arranging his life for him within a few minutes. She introduces him to her rich father, gets him a good job and tells him she wants a child. Meyers' life is being taken away from him. It's no longer his own.<br/><br/>But although at first Mortimer seems nice, she turns out to be just as manipulative as Scarlett and Meyers. There's one scene where she's talking with her friends about the holiday they're all going on, and then she mentions that she once gave Meyers an ancient Greek fertility charm and put it under his pillow for two months but that she still isn't pregnant. It's a subtle humiliation, one with a smile. And earlier Mortimer makes fun of Meyers when he orders modestly at a restaurant and then jokingly refers to his poor upbringing. She's not meant to be making fun, but she is. And then even earlier she condescendingly says that her father is proud of the way he dragged himself up against the odds, meaning that they're indirectly calling him gutter-trash. Therefore you can't blame Meyers for seeking solace in someone else's arms.<br/><br/>But unfortunately Meyers' misery is everlasting. He kills Scarlett and gets away with the crime, but as if this emotional torment isn't enough, he finally has a child with his wife and there's talk of having another. He's buried himself even deeper in his own private hell. An escape is even less likely, tied as he is to the money and comfort of his torpid lifestyle.<br/><br/>And of course its ironic that this good luck of getting away with the crime means that Meyers has plunged himself even deeper into his misery. Consequently you know that the opening and ending adage that its better to be lucky than good is complete baloney. Being lucky has done nothing for this person. It's just made his existence even more painful and depressing.<br/><br/>With all these themes running through the film and with all this meat to chew on, you'd think the film would be a pleasurable experience. But like I mentioned at the beginning, the poor acting spoils things. Apart from Meyers and Johansson, who are consistently disappointing, there are also the two cops at the end. They never convince. Although some of the blame should also be apportioned to the writing. The dialogue between the detectives is consistently hokey and there's even a moment where one of them sits up in his bed and proclaims to himself that he knows who did it. The corniness of it is overwhelming. I can't believe anyone in real life does that.<br/><br/>Allen is much better at writing the idle banter of the rich. The characters here have nothing to contribute to the world. They're all selfish. They're all scum. And in a lot of scenes there's an upper class desperation that rings true. But because the acting from the two leads is so bad it's hard to get swept away by the film. I certainly don't need to like characters in order to enjoy a movie, but they need to be able to convince me that they exist in some alternate reality. Here, though, I was consistently pulled out of the film.<br/><br/>An example of this is during the murder sequence. Meyers is skulking away in a stairwell and he hears a couple approaching. Fearing exposure, he hides in a corner. But watch his face. He suddenly pulls an incredibly camp expression. In that moment he looks like Kenneth Williams.<br/><br/>And then you have the first encounter between Scarlett and Meyers. Scarlett's attempt at being sexy is to just pout and stare. There's little else going on behind the eyes. She fails to inhabit the skin of a character. Instead she just seems to be going through the motions.<br/><br/>But even though Allen is crippled by his actors, he still manages to make the film reasonably enjoyable. It's nowhere near his best but it's certainly not among his worst. And there's also the novelty value of Allen filming in London. He has a bit of a tourist's eye and the characters live lifestyles that often seem beyond them  even if you do have loads of money, how much would it cost to have an apartment overlooking Parliament?  but it's good to see Allen try and stretch himself. He doesn't quite succeed, but with Meyers and Johansson cast in the central roles, I guess luck wasn't quite with him."

He retires into a coaching job at a club and meets the wealthy Tom Hewitt. Through him he meets Tom's sister Chloe and also Tom's American fiancé Nola. The latter he finds sexual exciting and dangerous while the former he finds ""nice"" but available. With Eleanor by his side Tom finds opportunity and advantage entering his life and it is a matter of time before he marries her, while also starting an ill-judged affair with Nola.<br/><br/>It is fashionable to moan about Woody Allen's output over the last few years and this is perhaps understandable but for me Match Point is a commendable, if not perfect, film from him that doesn't sit with his usual genre. There is no laughs to be had here, no character for Allen or even a character like Allen but it is similar in regards its exploration of love, lust and money. The setting in the English upper classes makes for a cold setting that suits the relationships, which are as much about position and breeding as about genuine love. In this regard the film is engaging as we not only have a love triangle plot but we have questions of what we would do, the power of those at the top, the desire to stay on top and the practicality of relationships. It is longer than his normal work but Allen has no problem filling it with material that I was surprised to find him wholly responsible for writing.<br/><br/>It is not perfect of course and the very cold edge does mean that the fire of passion at the end might leave some viewers disbelieving. Likewise the speed with which it is all sown up might seem all a bit convenient to some, even if I felt it a fitter comment on the nature of power. The cast mostly work well with the material despite the fact that I personally don't care much for either of the leads. Meyers is suitably conflicted between lifestyle and love. I did feel his range was limited though and did think that someone better could easily have been cast. Likewise with Johansson, who is very playful and does pretty well with the later emotion but yet never made me shake the idea that she is here due to her fame not her talent. Mortimer is solid as is Goode, Cox and Wilton; although mentioning the last two leads me to mention that the film also contains minor turns from Kaye, Fortune, Salmon, Bremner and Nesbitt  none of whom are ""bad"" but their presence was a distraction that the film could have done without and I have no idea why so many famous faces were cast in minor roles; Allen might as well as set off bangers and fireworks at each showing if he wanted to distract the audience that much!<br/><br/>Anyway, despite this and the cold, slow pace, the film is engaging and interesting in its themes. In terms of story it doesn't totally work towards the end but up till then it is questioning and interesting. Not to everyone's taste and only a partial success but good to see Allen expanding himself and doing interesting work."

I found myself fast-forwarding frequently. The occasional comparisons to Hitchcock are far-fetched: one thing Hitch really knew how to do was pace a movie. Of course, some people may like the literary allusions, for example, the main character reads Dostoevsky and then commits a cold-calculated murder. The death of his girl-friend's neighbor is even more heinous than that of the pawn-broker in Crime and Punishment, whose lesson is apparently lost on our hero."
"stefanbe","9","2","3","2 December 2007"," A different type of Woody Allen film.
","For many years, Woody Allen shot his films in New York, showing neurotic characters discussing that they ""would never want to belong to any club that would have someone like me for a member"", quoting the old Groucho Marx quote. With Match Point, the clarinet-playing, Marx-quoting Allen moved to a totally different city: London, England. And thus, there is a change of pace from nervous, neurotic individuals to confident people looking to climb the social ladder. As typically happens when an American filmmaker puts his lens on Britain, audiences are treated to the upper-crust of English society and for Match Point, it works. Match Point also lacks the feel of a Woody Allen film, which makes it even more fascinating as he allows the actors to work on their terms, reading his written lines with enough of their own feel. And particularly what sets this film apart from previous Woody fare is the darkness of the production. While he has tackled dark films before with the Bergman-inspired Interiors and Crimes and Misdeamenors (which this film borrows heavily from), never has he attempted to make a psychological thriller. Match Point isn't like, say, The Silence of the Lambs, but it does have a suspenseful feel lurking around it.<br/><br/>Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) is a tennis instructor who wants to go higher up in society and he gets his chance when he is introduced to Tom Hewett (Matthew Goode), a member of an upper-crust family. Immediately, Chris starts to make his way, slowly becoming a member of the family by falling for Tom's sister, Chloe (Emily Mortimer) and attending the family's house in the country. In the meantime, he also meets Tom's girlfriend, a struggling actress from Colorado called Nola Rice (Scarlett Johansson). He becomes sexually attracted to Nola and the two of them have a short affair. Chris marries Chloe and Nola moves back to America, but as soon as she returns to England, the affair starts once again. Chris is soon forced to continually lie to keep his affair as secret as possible and not be thrown out of his new job and perks that the Hewetts have given him. Now, he decides to end the affair the only way he can think of: murder.<br/><br/>As mentioned before, Woody Allen's films portray their protagonists as neurotic beings, worried that they've done the wrong thing. With Match Point, there is a 180 degree turn with the character of Chris, a confidant who does not feel guilty in the least for cheating on his wife and once he murders, he does not sweat a brow even when being interrogated by the police. Throughout the film, he lies his way out of possible punishment, not because he is necessarily a good liar but because of pure luck. This is unlike the game of tennis, which requires both skill and luck. Chris may be skilled at tennis, but not murder, as he ""committed the murder, just begging to be caught."" In another twist on tennis, Chris 'serves' a piece of evidence, but it fails to land on the other side and into the river. Yet, by pure luck, somebody else finds it and is soon framed by somebody who never even met him.<br/><br/>Chris's sex life with Chloe wilts throughout the course of the film as he spends more and more time with Nola, who he has a bigger attraction for, yet doesn't divorce Chloe to his own greediness. He will lose the fancy car, driver and apartment if he does so and if lying is the only way to keep himself wealthy, so be it. This is all effectively portrayed in the performance by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, who embeds Chris with two sides. With the Hewetts, he is the good boy being as un-offensive as possible, so to be admitted into the family circle. With Nola, his darker side creeps out and he keeps going back for more. These differences are also played out very well with Emily Mortimer playing Chloe as innocent and apologetic and Scarlett Johansson injecting Nola with sexual tension and constantly over-bearing Chris. Chris believes his affair is something small, but Nola thinks differently. Johansson's scene where she catches Chris on a fib (the only person in the film to hundred percent do so) and pronounces him as a ""liar"" has been criticised by some circles. However, the scene and dialogue within do work because of the tiredness growing in the character.<br/><br/>Woody Allen's transition from New York to London worked perfectly as he made his best film in many years. Even those who complain that ""he doesn't make funny movies anymore"" will like Match Point. Those who don't like him at all will also be surprised as it feels more like a Jonathan Demme production rather than a film from the director of Annie Hall. A fascinating entry in his filmography, Match Point is certainly a film that while it would not have you on the edge of your seat, it will make you sit thoughtfully without complaining about bad service and small portions."
"galensaysyes","3","2","3","10 June 2007"," Bad girl in sooth
","This movie presents Scarlett Johanssen as a sultry femme fatale; and there's the rub. To me she looks like an open-mouthed Valley girl whom I'd expect to see working in the food court at the mall...except that those girls generally have more passion, and are more attractive. Judging by the reviews she gets, Johanssen sends a lot of middle-aged men into a tailspin, and I imagine that's how she wins a role like this--and indeed, tends to behave very much like a young actress working hard at doing so by wrapping a middle-aged producer around her nubile finger. But she is no vamp, and here, she's hardly an actress; her inexpressiveness of face, voice, and body makes a big hole at the center of a production that is half-baked at best: the characters and dialogue are in some early-draft stage, and the direction goes no farther in realizing them. And so were they in the only other late film of Woody Allen's that I've seen; he now seems to write and direct as Jack Nicholson now seems to act, content with work that is characteristic enough for the body of fans to recognize it as ""so Woody"" (""so Jack""), and to assume its merit as thereby proved. The only definite achievement of this film is to show Jonathan Rhys-Meyers in a persona other than that which he brought to his first movies--that of the Antichrist--in every case more or less inappropriately; so he may turn out to be good for something, after all."
"L. Lion","8","2","3","9 June 2007"," Allen's take on An American Tragedy - with his own twist
","Match Point is very similar in tone and story to Theodore Dreiser's great work An American Tragedy, although Allen has added a twist ending that hearkens back to Dostoevskii.<br/><br/>The plot is about a social-climbing tennis pro (Jonathan Rhys-Meyer as Chris) who charms his way into a rich British family, and the heart of their daughter, Chloe (Emily Mortimer). He is also friends with the scion of the family, Peter, whose fiancée is a beautiful young American woman, Nola (Scarlett Johansson). Chris is immediately enchanted by the bewitching Nola, especially in comparison to the rather plain Chloe that he has attached himself to, but both of them know that an indiscretion could spell disaster. Both of their futures appear hinged on remaining in the good graces of the Lord of the Manor and his children. Nola even spells it out for Chris - Chloe loves him, her father is also fond of him, his future is set if he doesn't ""blow it"". ""How do you suppose I would do that?"" Chris replies. ""Me"". She answers.<br/><br/>Without going into spoilers, the twists and turns of passion restrained by pragmatic, non-romantic concerns will lead Chris and Nola into territory where a difficult decision will need to be made.<br/><br/>For the most part, the performances are steady. Rhys-Meyer does his best work during the first half of the film, when his furtive nature and wariness at making a gaffe that could alienate this rich family create drama and intrigue. He always seems to have an agenda. This furtive nature is heightened by his reactions to Nola, reactions over which he has no control.<br/><br/>During the second half of the film, when he has to make more trenchant decisions, his work isn't as strong. For the most part his character is petulant and moody, and although this is called for by the script, it is hard to retain sympathy for the character. He was more interesting when he was climbing the social ladder than when he has already achieved a perch that he must protect from his own indiscretions.<br/><br/>Scarlett Johansson continues to impress as an actress. Her performance as Nola, a young actress aware of her effect on men but still unsure of herself, is beautifully portrayed. This is showcased in one powerful exchange where she and Rhys-Meyer have a drink after she has had a disastrous audition. Beginning distraught and cursing her life and choice of career, she morphs into a seductive temptress, sure of herself and well aware of her effect on Rhys-Meyer. ""Where was this confidence during your audition?"" he intelligently asks, all the while knowing and not knowing the answer. During the second half of the film, when Nola becomes more needy, she sets a clear choice for Rhys-Meyer - choose between his pocketbook, and his passion.<br/><br/>The film ends on a twist ending, which echoes some of the themes in Allen's earlier work, most notably Crimes and Misdemeanors. Allusions to Dostoevskii are made repeatedly. Although this film is not up with Allen's best work, it is a change - not set in Manhattan, and Allen appears nowhere in front of the camera. Well worth watching if you haven't seen it before."

"sonofnob","4","2","3","15 December 2006"," Well-acted crap
","Before this film, I hadn't seen many Woody Allen films but they seemed to mix a lot of cringe with humour and some nice observations about People, the general Human Condition, Life, and so on (and on). In Match Point, there is only cringe. No humour, no interesting insights. And most of the cringe is due to the bad script; it starts off with a bit of promise but quickly bogs down into a boring, contrived, predictable, and pretentious waste of a film. And unrealistic through and through: Woody Allen has some pretty weird notions about London and the British (i.e, he apparently has no clue). I really had to struggle to watch it to the end. It also got a lot worse towards the end, as if Woody Allen didn't know how to end it and out of desperation chose an idiotic ending. Or maybe it struck him that the big theme of the film, introduced heavy-handedly at the start of the film, hadn't yet stepped onto the stage, and so contrived an idiotic ending to let the theme get in on the act before curtain's close. And the big theme? That we are at the mercy of Chance (""That's like, deep, man!""). Besides forgetting the theme through most of the film, Woody Allen actually seems to promote the opposite view that Chance can be made redundant by hard work and good sense. At least, the moody main character has to make quite a mess before Chance properly makes her entry. So, Match Point neither entertains nor stimulates, and you can't chill out to it, since you are busy cringing. Having art galleries and operas in it does not make it Art. Nor do the obviously included details. The characters are 1.5-dimensional and pretty uninteresting, and evolve predictably throughout the film, so it is not a good character study. All in all pretty useless film. It could be that Woody Allen is making a public admittance of severe obsessions, through the acts of the main character, who knows. Who cares? <br/><br/>So what makes it worth the four stars I've given it? Well, the photography is pretty nice, and the most of the actors play pretty well, despite the lousy script and the laughable lines. I felt a bit sorry for them but they chose it themselves and get paid handsomely for it, I'm sure. And, of course, there's Scarlett Johansen. She plays very well (as usual) and is very sexy (as usual). But even here, Woody Allen fails miserably. She is in far too few scenes, and vanishes all-together in the last half hour. And, somehow, Woody Allen even manages to neutralize her sexiness at times by putting her into artificial and stilted settings. What a waste."

","If I didn't know this was directed by Woody Allen in advance i wouldn't have been able to tell from the movie. Although I'm not a WA aficionado, I do enjoy most of his films but this one, perhaps because it is not set in NY came across in a non-Woody way to me.<br/><br/>I thought the acting was very good on all parts. Scarlett Johannson especially stood out with her fine performance. She seems to be nailing the femme fatal role these days as she's getting all of those types of parts.<br/><br/>I don't like to give much away so I will just say that the plot moves along well, it is interesting & compelling. Some unexpected surprises.<br/><br/>If you want a good drama with dark overtones & fine acting then I highly recommend this movie. ***The cinematography is quite lovely in this film."

This is really a killer for a movie. I'm not coming to watch an actress, I am here to see a film. Same happened to me with Lost in Translation. (Please! Has anyone seen Hiroshima mon Amour??? but that's another rant...) It's not bad, I gave it a 5! But it's not brilliant...<br/><br/>Ms Johansson is certainly gorgeous and seems reasonably intelligent. But this is not a photo shoot... She just cannot take character."
"manuel-pestalozzi","4","2","3","9 October 2006"," Not a must-see, really. Ultimately disappointing
","Nobody could say that Woody Allen treads new ground here. So many similar movies come to mind, Renoir's la règle du jeu, Kubrick's Barry Lyndon, Gerd Oswald's version of Ira Levin's super-thriller A Kiss Before Dying, the rendition of several Patricia Highsmith novels, etc. etc.<br/><br/>So what new aspects does Woody Allen bring to a well known story? Very little, I am afraid. At best it is a well filmed update with famous 21st century locations in London (Swiss Re tower aka Gherkin"", Tate Modern, minimalistic glass house duplex apartment on the Thames) and an attempt to grapple with the actual state of rich First World societies in the era of Globalization.<br/><br/>The characters seem to be cardboard cutouts. Even a talented, experienced actor like Brian Cox moves around like a robot  the notable exceptions being the two persons who will get killed. Now I know that Mr Allen is a smart man and I can assume that the lack of personal traits in the characters is intentional. I can only guess that it should illustrate the actual state of human relations and the barbaric, little concealed greed of post modern capitalism. Unfortunately, the main characters are just not convincing. Take Brian Cox who plays the father-in-law of the rags to riches main character. Is that man, Alex Hewett, old wealth or nouveau riche with a thin varnish of fake cultivation? It is impossible for me to tell. Even this cultural disorientation"" might be intentional  and maybe REALLY smart  but considering that the story has a specific and in every sense exclusive setting one really expects a more firm footing or deeper roots for the Hewett family. Moreover, I could not convince myself that Alex Hewett loves his son-in-law. The young upstart does not seem to be very good company and his ingratiating attitude is rather obnoxious. And the rise from the minor tennis pro to a corporate big shot within a few weeks just did not help to make the story more believable to me.<br/><br/>After a very good and promising start the movie slows down considerably. Some scenes seem to be mere stuffing"" because the movie would have been too short otherwise. The tennis match-aspect is not pursued for very long and almost gets forgotten. The build up to the climax is painfully slow and eventless and requires the viewer's patience. A master of suspense Mr Allen is not. After the climax the ghosts of the dead come to haunt the hero, an occasion for a few good and wise lines  but which viewer is at that point attentive enough and willing to stomach a rather unexpected change of mode? <br/><br/>Somhow Match Point can not decide what it wants to be: Satire, drama, suspense-thriller or simply ethno-kitsch. To move the action to England might have been an unwise decision. When I think how brilliantly Allen tackled an interesting subject in Mighty Aphrodite, I wonder if the film would not have been better had it been shot in New York."

","OK, this was a disappointment. I expected totally nothing of this movie, then I saw it could be interesting for me when I saw Nola appear (You know, I am a man...). When the incredibly long paced story continued, and Chris kept promising Nola that he would tell his wife (wich lasted TOO long), I saw it could be interesting when he would leave her. <br/><br/>I began thinking of a plot where the family would do anything to ruin their lives and so on. And suddenly, he grabs a shotgun, and KILLS the only reason why I should watch more of this movie, since I was getting bored of the endless babbling about telling the wife. And come on! Killing the woman who is bearing your own child? Who would ever do that. <br/><br/>Then, the only reason to watch the movie more, was waiting for revenge on Chris. And I thought I got what I wanted when she came back to him after she died and promised revenge. ""Yes! The cop thinks he did it too!"" I thought after seeing him wake up. And 10 minutes later, the movie comes to an end, which is probably more unsatisfying thing I have ever seen.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, the acting is good, the plot is interesting, but the satisfaction factor of this movie is close to the absolute lowest temperature (which is-255 degrees Celcius, for the chemics)"
"JoeyBro","5","2","3","31 July 2006"," I would rather watch a bad Woody Allen movie than most box office hits.
","His films are usually remarkably well constructed, written, and directed, and I love how Allen as a director takes a back seat to his performers, letting them act them for the most part in the master shot, instead of interrupting the flow for the two shot, over the shoulder shots, and close-ups. Having said that, I'm very disappointed in ""Match Point,"" because I have seen this very same Woody Allen movie before, except it was set in New York and was called ""Crimes and Misdemeanors."" Intead of a tennis pro who marries into a privileged family, it involved an already privileged, well established ophthalmologist who was a pillar of his community. Both stories follow a very similar path and even end pretty much the same way. Come on, Woody, don't you think it's time to take a break from the yearly film to write something fresh instead of recycling nearly twenty year old scripts? This can't be about money, so I have to ask: exactly how insecure are you?"

","So many reviews praised this film on IMDb that I went right out and rented it. The expectation was for a solidly made Film Noir with a sensational ending that knocks the viewer out. Not so, McGee! <br/><br/>Granted that the acting, storyline, and the beautiful photography of London and the English countryside --- these things make an excellent first half; but just as a great appetizer can lead to disappointment when the main course is soggy, Woody sets us up and fails to deliver. I don't think it's a spoiler to say the movie self-distructs about halfway through, falling into foolish absurdity; a waste of the viewer's time. <br/><br/>Remembering that 2005 was the year which brought us Peter Jackson's pathetic mess of an alleged King Kong remake, as well as the worst body of pictures in 40 years, perhaps viewers seized on the few glimmers of excellence in the first hour. Sorry, but stacked up against the greats of the Film Noir genre, this film doesn't hold a candle."

I stuck with it and was appreciative of the writing and performances. As always, we need more Scarlett J.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, when the story took it's turn, I began to get less interested and more annoyed and impatient, as the actions taken by the main character were not based on any dialogue or rational thought. Things seem to happen because that's where the script decided to take the characters. It also plods on for too long once you realize what the main character is going to do. There are no real surprises here, except maybe in the exact method of the deed. The problem is that things just happen, without any feel for what the main character was REALLY going through, UNLIKE Martin Landau's character in Crimes and Misdemeanors.<br/><br/>My overall take on this movie is that it is Crimes and Misdemeanors Lite. It's Crimes and Misdemeanors without any introspection. While it may be Allen's best achievement since that amazing movie, it certainly is not a return to form."

Oy vey.<br/><br/>Woody keeps those themes going; love versus lust, aimlessness versus responsibility; empty souls versus warm hearts; crime versus punishment; purpose versus random acts; normality versus mayhem and what's the difference, bleakness and happiness. He was trying to emulate the Great Hitchcock and he did get some of it right.<br/><br/>These are excellent points in the film but somewhere he lost his way in the art of filmaking. I don't know, a removal from life's realities; too much time in a New York apartment building. The movie should have been 30 minutes shorter or maybe 45. It also had a connect the dots approach.<br/><br/>The actors superseded the material except for Scarlett Johanssen who of course is a lust to look at but the husky voice and constant cigarette smoking took away from the character.<br/><br/>Excellent work by everybody else and Woody must share in the credit for that aspect."

But not this one. Maybe it's the setting in London that's disturbing. Allen doesn't feel at home in this environment. Maybe all his movies should take place on Manhattan. The attraction between the two main characters doesn't come along as really convincing. The film is well done, and the script has some points, but when you think of what Allen is capable of I can't help to feel some disappointment. The main character I feel isn't convincing as former tennis pro, now reading Dostojevski and huge fan of opera. I don't really buy it. You might say he's trying to advance in the world by getting into that culture, but that's not really likely. Scarlett Johansson doesn't feel at home in her character either.

But the plot, with minor variations, is basically right out of that source, commingled with a bit of Dostoevsky's ""Crime and Punishment"" (telegraphed in the film by Chris's reading). Allen has often been heavily allusive in his scripts, to Ingmar Bergman and others, but I can't recall any other of his movies where virtually the entire plot seemed borrowed and from a fairly obvious source. P.S. Apologies to Roland Zwick. Upon perusing the comments more thoroughly I see that he had called this movie Woddy Allen's version of Dreiser's AN American TRAGEDY some time ago.

And however talented, and despite some great movies in his own social milieu, he perhaps inevitably has a tin ear for the appropriate language.<br/><br/>Listen to the lines Johannson says and they work because the cadences fit her voice and NY accent.

","There are both explicit and implicit references to 'Crime and Punishment', as well as the naturalistic Strindberg in this movie. It also packs the same moral as Allens own 'Crimes and Misdemeanours'. Allen seems to think that the story of how someone can get away with murder is an important one to tell. Why? Hitler and Stalin ""got away"" with the murder of millions and millions, its hardly news is it?<br/><br/>Essentially the movie paints the picture of a working class sociopath who climbs the social ladder in ways he sees fit, and who wont stop at murder to get what he wants. Allen makes no distinction between ""being guilty"" and ""getting caught"", there is little social commentary and not much in the way of serious reflections on class dynamics. So the film becomes a Nietzschean success story of nihilist overcoming of societies boundaries. Fourtunately the story is not that compelling or believable, though the films entertainment value is above average. The dialog is sometimes pretty corny, but it is well acted. <br/><br/>That Allen finds this theme important, this is his second film with an in parts identical theme, probably tells us more about his petite bourgeoisie world view and narcissistic tendencies, than anything else. No doubt Allen is both scared of and titillated by the thought of self-centered nihilistic action as a route to self-gratification."

Like the rest of his later films the characters are flat and unappealing. For the first half of the movie we seem to just drift through the life of Chris seeing random episodes at a very ambiguous pace. <br/><br/>I think Allen has always done this in his films, but in his great one's he has amazing character dynamic that makes them fun to watch. There was none of that here. And I also regret saying this, but, Scarlett Johansson cannot act. And I can't say much for Rhys-Meyers. I feel their awkward and off-key deliveries voided the movie of any graspable feelings. I could tell both were acting and so I couldn't figure out what kind of people the characters in the story actually were. <br/><br/>I must give Allen credit for this fact: He has no other film like this. He definitely has explored to territory here in terms of the way he tells a story. The film has a seriousness I have't seen since Interiors, but it still can't even be compared to that. Though I felt Bergman was strongly echoed in this movie.

The London locales are used well, but I can't say the same for the actors. Scarlett Johansson does a fair job at portraying her character with what Allen gives her, but the main actor, Jonathan Rhys- Meyers, can hardly go beyond a handsome-yet-scary face. He delivers his lines as if he's in a high-school play, with highly synthetic and stereotypical acting. The script could also be trimmed to have more meat; it feels very dry and theatrical. I have a feeling that much of my acting complaints are due to the script. On the bright side though, the cinematography was excellent, with effective camera angles and shot compositions. Overall though, it's interesting to see what Allen has been up to lately, considering how different this film feels when compared with his other, more notable, films."

Not even close to, say, Annie Hall, Sleeper, NY Stories, and Husbands and Wives, this was surprisingly intense suspenseful. For a few times I had to hit the pause button just to walk around and let my pulse calm down, I kid you not. Never have I been so unnerved by a film since perhaps Ringu. Woody should move into this territory more often. For those who are looking for Scarlett's talents other than the oft-repeated Black Widow, go to this one and watch her without the CGI. Her male counterpart, Jonathan Rhys Myers, holds his own, Emily Mortimer is a treat, and any movie with Brian Cox in it can't be that bad.<br/><br/>'You came here to look at me.'"

Though the plot borrows heavily from George Stevens' ""A Place In The Sun,"" the endings go in completely different directions. Allen sets the action against superb upper-class locations including the distinctive Gherkin building, adding to the film's visual appeal.

"oOoBarracuda","9","1","1","27 July 2017"," Match Point
","The idea that much of a person's life is determined simply by chance is an idea that one often wants to ignore. We plan too much, make too many decisions, and have too much control to consider the fact that to a large degree our fate is out of our hands. Woody Allen explores fate and chance in an incredible way in his 2005 film Match Point. Both written and directed by the auteur, Match Point represents a departure for Woody Allen as the first of his films to be shot in London, contain no Woody Allen character, and is the first thriller-type film for the constant genre hopper. There is no such thing as a typical Woody Allen film, I've gone to great lengths to dispel that notion and now seeing 40 of his films in a row, I will never be convinced that he is as one-dimensional as he is often accused. Match Point stars Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Scarlett Johansson as two individuals who are desperate to enter the fold of the wealthy, so desperate in fact that they are willing to abandon their identities in order to achieve financial riches. A piercing look at the philosophical issues connected to morality and a scathing assessment of class-consciousness, Woody Allen lands on the right side of the net with Match Point.<br/><br/>Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) is a fish out of water in his new position as a tennis instructor at an upscale London tennis club. Previously earning a living as a professional tennis player, Chris couldn't accustom to the constant traveling and wished to find a place to call home. Raised by a modest family in Ireland, Chris believes he sticks out like a sore thumb amongst the London elite. Desperate to fit in and leave his one-bedroom flat, Chris will do anything he needs to in order to come into more money. An opportunity arises when he begins providing lessons for wealthy club member Tom Hewett (Matthew Goode). Throughout the course of their lessons, Chris and Tom become friends and Chris meets Tom's sister Chloe (Emily Mortimer), who instantly finds herself attracted to Chris. Chloe has had an easy ride through life with more money than she's known where to spend and a father who will stop at nothing to make her happy, which essentially includes buying her a boyfriend. Chris is offered a job in one of Chloe's father's companies ensuring that his livelihood would be at stake if he were to ever leave Chloe. That knowledge doesn't stop Chris from becoming attracted to Tom's girlfriend Nola Rice (Scarlett Johansson) Nola is a struggling actress from America who is anxious to be brought into the fold of the aristocratic life. Nola, like many, doesn't want to struggle for money nor does she seem apt to put too much into her craft and would much rather marry into a good life. The passion Chris and Nola feel for each other is unable to be ignored and the two begin an affair, leaving Chris to decide if it is worth sacrificing the unfulfilled life that has been arranged for him to pursue the wild card that is Nola. <br/><br/>Toto, we""re not in New York anymore. Granted, this was not the first, nor would it be the last time Woody would shoot a film outside of New York but Woody Allen is synonymous in my mind with New York so it is always a shock for me to see a film of his in a different location. Match Point, like every Woody Allen film, has a brilliant opening monologue discussing the notion that most aspects of life are out of our control. The idea that we have no control over our lives brings about an interesting philosophical argument: If life is so meaningless we can't even control it, why not dismiss morality in order to give us the most pleasure. John Stuart Mill probably would have loved Match Point. There isn't a likable character that we ever see on screen, the audience is simply introduced to a host of people who exercise whatever means necessary to bring themselves the most pleasure. A brilliant bit of casting makes the audience wonder just what Chris is capable of from the first time we lay eyes on him. ""To never have been born may be the greatest boon of all"", this Sophocles quote makes an appearance again in a Woody Allen film but is better explored through the plot of Match Point. Since we're here, we may as well make the best of this existence and those in the film certainly draw no lines while chasing their particular blends of happiness. In addition to the philosophy commonly explored in Woody Allen's films, he also opens fire against the conflict in classes that still exists today. Nola desperately wants to be on the same playing field as her boyfriend Tom, but all doors seem to be closed to that possibility due to her being below his social standing, a fact that both are constantly reminded of by Tom's mother. Social standings are such that no matter how happy Tom is with Nola, she will never be welcome, ultimately causing their separation. Woody Allen makes a fantastic film questioning life's big issues all the while taking a scathing look at the societal constraints affecting everyone. Match Point is certainly not to be missed simply because it isn't a ""funny one""."

","The vague and vacuous title of my review very much resembles that of the film itself; Match Point. Within the context of this production, what exactly does it mean? So, yes, one of the leading characters was a former tennis pro but that seems about the only reference to the film name. Neither have I read any review or reference to the fact that this is all very bizarre. As for the movie itself, I have never been a fan of Woody Allen but the large part of this film is engrossing with greed, morals and attitude's of the monied classes very much to the fore.

In this Woody Allen film, Match Point (2006) takes you on one wild ride between doing the right thing versus what passion moves you towards. In this film Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) is a former tennis star that has high hope in making something of himself. The tennis circuit took him from his humble beginnings but his new job as a tennis instructor at a private club opens the door to opulence.

","It's hard to define the genre. Because it's not a rom-com, it's not a drama and it's not a thriller either. Until a certain point the film is mainly a drama about a man who marries and has an affair (it's a little more complicated than that though) with some comedic hints. But at one point (I'm not gonna give a way when it happens) it turns and becomes a comedy and it works. It works because the characters are extremely shallow and nearly cliché. This allows the comedy to work since you're not extremely into the characters but it also allows the drama to work because society kind of is as depicted in the film and because you're unable to see the thoughts of the characters and have to figure them out by yourself. The film is social satire through it's depiction of the characters and their decisions. But especially the ending is extremely biting.<br/><br/>The movie is easily thrilling enough, dramatic enough and witty and it even got some depth. The cinematography is really great and helps establish the mood of the film. All in all it's a great pleasure to watch and I can only recommend it."

Chris crawls into their lives and in no time at all Chloe is falling head over heels for him, even the father (Brian Cox) likes him and it'd seem that he is set for the rest of his life.

He seems a bit lazy and aimless at first, nothing out of ordinary, but as the movie progresses, he starts to change, to evolve, to fight for the way of living he has grown accustomed to. And it's an utterly fascinating process, the likes of which I have not seen before.<br/><br/>Because in all honesty, aside from the story, this film is nothing new. The characters are fairly normal, though they are played by capable actors and especially the differences between Chloe and Nola are brilliantly portrayed by Johansson and Mortimer. One a seductress, one a nice sweetheart. The filming is topnotch, though nothing extravagant, but it's the story and especially the third act that elevates this film above its peers. I was all set to hate this film by the end of the second act, but then it started. Can't spoil it for you, but remember to see this film through before you judge it.<br/><br/>To whom would I recommend this?

","Allen breaks a miserable dry spell with MATCH POINT. Since DECONSTRUCTING HARRY, of 1997, he very much earned the popular criticism of material regurgitation. He stepped outside of his comfort zone and outside of the United States, creating a crafty homage to Hitchcock.<br/><br/>First of all, it was nice to see Allen working in London. Among working directors, he is the most capable of capturing the truth in a town. It would eventually come to full fruition in the recent MIDNIGHT IN Paris, but his love for orgiastic civilization translates to film just as well in London as it does in Manhattan. <br/><br/>It was in stepping outside of his modus operandi that he pulls out of the rut, but so many of the trademarks are there. The usual preoccupation with fatalism and truth are pinned onto an amiable troupe of Upper Crust Brits. That is, except our protagonist. While Allen is not the only writer capable of successfully building a main character of such loathsome quality, he is the most fancy about it. Chris is played remarkably by Jonathan Rhys Meyers - a casting decision that quite possibly vaulted the picture from mediocrity to definition. His glib manipulation is, at first, difficult to understand. But by the end of MATCH POINT, we are the audience to his every thought. The deposition with the detectives is a fascinating example of filming the thoughts, not the words. We see into his self-loathing and it looks great.<br/><br/>So much cannot be said for Johansson, whose struggling actress character was probably looked at with some irony by Allen. She is the archetypal Allen Sexy Nymphette. In a performance that begins with such intrigue and fantasy, it rapidly devolves into a schizomaniacal tour of her body and methods of anger. I don't blame this on Allen. I've yet to be impressed by her, and I am beginning to think that Hollywood feels the same way.<br/><br/>Finally, it is worth noting how MATCH POINT is so much of a charming tip-of-the-hat in Hitchcock's direction. A witty use of Checkhov's Gun. A wedding ring MacGuffin. Allen succeeds admirably in imitating the shapes and structures of an inimitable force. MATCH POINT ends up being like a sissy backwards version of FRENZY with much more wit and character. Certainly not Allen's most monumental effort. And not one that demands much rewatching. But it broke perhaps the worst cycle of work by a respectable director. Too bad he didn't sustain the tradition of avoiding expectation.<br/><br/>74.2"

","The nature of luck is a very rewarding, and yet very deceptive concept. It can give one individual so much, or it can take more than what they bargained for. Director Woody Allen illustrates this vast un scientific concept with the example of Tennis as a good example. Through the well interpreted narration of the film's protagonist, Chris Wilton (Myers) we are given a more clear idea of how luck can work. In game of Tennis, the ball can go on either side of the fence, thus ending the game, and making a final result. The concept itself is more preferably displayed through the course of the film, and through the situations revolving around the characters themselves. The film begins with it's lead character Chris Wilton, a retired Tennis pro from Ireland has decided to take up a teaching position in a London Tennis Club, acquiring a very well priced apartment, as well a being given the chance to teach a very wealthy student Tom Hewitt (Goode). In time, Tom becomes closer friends with his new teacher, to inviting him to his families opera, out of their coincidental love for opera, thus furthering a good relation ship with Tom's parents. In Chris's favor, Tom's sister Chloe (Mortimer) takes a shine to Chris, opening numerous opportunities for him, a fancy executive positions at her dads companies, a relationship, and a much greater stand with her Parents, Alec and Eleanor in the act of holy matrimony. All the luck seems like it's been going in Chris's favor, only for him to rock the boat, by uncontrollably pursuing Tom's sexy fiancé, Nola Rice (Johansson), a girl who's lust for Chris as much as he does for her. In there sexually active love affair, their relationship faces it's ups and downs, as the matter of Whether Chris will leave his wife will ever happen, hence all his bull and stalling. Chris views his situation with much difficulty. One hand, a life with Chloe, he sees a frivolous life style beyond his own perceivable limitations, and on the other hand, a life with Nola means happiness, with the woman he truly loves, only to a future with who knows what kind of benefit. Christ luck becomes worse as Nola becomes pregnant, thus making his choice of action more clear. In the act of murder Chris, stains his soul further by not only ending Nola's life, but even shamelessly killing her neighbor, in the hopes of making his kills look untraceable. His luck seems bad at the call of the police for questioning, only to work in his favor, thus proving the concept of Luck to be neither pure nor tainted, but completely random. It even seemed like Chris's luck had turned for the worst, as the Detective was able to put together the puzzle that was Wilton's murders. Director Woody Allen has given viewers a very accurate depiction of how the very concept of luck can go in any situation, ignoring the moral traits most people would believe to go in effect. He just simply gave us a very basic situation, which then evolved into what turned out to be a tragic end for so many. All viewers would've enjoyed seeing Chris answer for his sins, thus suffering the most unfortunate luck possible for a man of his nature. However that is the way the world is. Things either can go good or bad for just about anybody, whether they are good or bad people, thus making none of them special in the nature of luck. I really enjoyed this film, and how its story focused on the very pathway it's protagonist was going. His life changing for the better from time to time, and thus getting worse for worse, and then getting better all together again. The very opera motivated themes represented the tragedy of the character, and the predicament of which his actions had led him to because despite proving to be cold hearted, Chris was still suffering inside, subjected forever to the torment of his sins. I would also like to say the Johansson's performance was unique, because although Nola may seem at first like a very insecure, and often struggling character, which is exactly the point of how Johansson portrayed her. She expressed both a strong emotion, as well displaying her desperate nature of her generally unconfident insecurity."
"Eternality","8","1","1","14 August 2010"," The old master still has some tricks up his sleeves.
","The first of his 'unofficial' London trilogy, Woody Allen's Match Point is later followed by Scoop (2006) and Cassandra's Dream (2007), both of which are unrelated to Match Point or to one another other than that they are set in Britain's capital. Critically-acclaimed and considered to be the director's best in a long while, Match Point does not feel like a traditional Allen picture (e.g. the use of British accents, and the lack of the director's 'voice'). Gone also are the witty, neurotic lines of humor and its tragicomic characters.<br/><br/>The 1970s and 1980s have seen the Oscar-winning writer-director make one excellent film after another. But a 1990s and early 2000s 'slump' sees him make only an occasional decent picture amid average ones. Match Point is the result of the American filmmaking legend looking into the mirror and realizing a change of formula is essential to keep up with the times. Allen reinvents himself in a surprisingly assured take on the low-key crime-thriller genre camouflaged by a dominant romantic drama that deals with marriage, extramarital affairs, love and lust.<br/><br/>The film consists of three principal characters: Chris, Chloe, and Nola. Chris, a hardworking but poor tennis instructor, marries Chloe and is set up for life because his father-in-law is wealthy and has given him a key corporate position in his company. However, Chris' true passion lies with Nola, his brother-in-law's sensuous and insecure fiancée who is struggling as an actress. As Chris gets deeper into his affair with Nola, the latter becomes unpredictable and overpowering, and later becomes a source of tension and frustration for Chris who turns increasingly paranoid to the thought of being exposed.<br/><br/>Match Point features sharp analytical writing which conveys very realistically the emotional and psychological states of mind of each major character, especially that of Chris and Nola. The most affecting display comes from Scarlett Johansson whose tortured performance as Nola earns her a Golden Globe nomination for Best Supporting Actress. At the beginning, Allen theorizes that when the tennis ball hits the top of the net, with a bit of luck it will drop on your opponent's side and you win. A similar scenario is further explored during the final quarter of the film where luck plays a huge role in determining the fates of people.<br/><br/>In an unexpected (and chilling) turn of events near the finale, Allen shows us his skill in misdirection. Up to that point, we are led to believe that we know how the film is going to end, but the old master still has some tricks up his sleeves. His near-brilliant sleigh of hand elevates Match Point to something more than just a decent drama. There are some situational flaws though, which on hindsight could have embarrassed Allen because if the viewer is discerning enough, he or she could see that there are loopholes in the execution of that misdirection sequence. Fortunately for Allen, the ball lands away from him.<br/><br/>SCORE: 8/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!"

Either way, it is pegged as Woody Allen's comeback, and I wholeheartedly agree. There are so many references to classic film and literature that it's hard not to think of this piece as satire. One of my favorite scenes is when the detective is lying in bed and suddenly solves the murder and sits straight up; this undoubtedly came straight from Crime and Punishment. We all know how Woody Allen loves his Russian lit. <br/><br/>Only Woody Allen can make a movie about killing your pregnant mistress funny. This is definitely one of my favorites, and I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in a dark, twisted good time. Scarlett Johanssen does a commendable job, Jonathan Rhys Meyers is brilliant, and Emily Mortimer is good as the naive wife. It's a movie where you want to pity all the characters, but at the same time, all of them deserve the events that occur. Meyers deserves to be in a passionless marriage; Johanssen deserves to be shanked; Mortimer deserves to be in the dark the entire time. It completely fits all of their characters. <br/><br/>See the original review here: http://themoviemistress.blogspot.com/2009/09/match- point.html"

However I find it hard to believe what happens in the last third of the film, the main character just didn't seem like the kind of person who would commit the ultimate crime .

"sc8031","8","1","1","10 August 2008"," Woody Allen presents... a whole new kind of depressing film-making!
","Woody Allen himself has said this is perhaps the best film he has ever made. And surely, this is one of Woody Allen's more notable films, a stand-out entry in his canon if only for the fact that it is so much darker than anything else he previously directed (save for possibly his best work, ""Crimes and Misdemeanors""). The serious material and location also break the typical Woody Allen rhythm of bittersweet comedic romance in New York City. Instead, this film takes place amongst the elite upper classes of London (which Woody unfortunately does not have the background to explore or present with a local's expertise) and investigates social climbing, nepotist opportunism and impractical lustful obsession.<br/><br/>The plot involves a mild-mannered amateur tennis pro named Chris (played by Jonathan Rhys Meyers, who looks like a splicing of Joaquin Phoenix and Ewan MacGregor) who works his way into the London upper classes by kindling a friendship with one of his male clients. The same client has a fiancée, Nola Rice (Scarlett Johannsen) with whom Chris develops an unhealthy obsession. Scarlett Johannsen seems to be Woody's current eye-candy muse, the clumsily acting starlet of his recent movies. This is the first Allen movie to feature Scarlett, and while she's much better cast here than in almost any other film she's been in, she is still a mediocre actress. <br/><br/>The performances and dialog are all above average (again, save for Scarlett and the fact that I don't know what passes for quality English dialog, hee hee!) and the cinematography is clean and pristine. So are most of the locations actually, often bright, clean and spacious -- in vivid contrast to the nature of the plot. In fact, some of the interior locations of this movie are reminiscent of the futuristic, super-silly sets of Allen's early ""Sleeper"". The difference is that the sets here are create an ominous atmosphere (almost like a Poe story, sans the macabre decadence). <br/><br/>As a film this holds together really well, but is incredibly depressing and somewhat self-important. There are some surprises and twists left open to interpretation, but the open-ended nature of some portions of it make it depressingly realistic. As a drama and suspense piece it is one of the best for it's professional inspiration, painless pacing (despite the slow plot development) and manages to be one of Woody's more notable films."

","This seems so dissimilar to every other Woody Allen film I've seen that I probably wouldn't have realised it was one if I hadn't known before the start.<br/><br/>This may be due to the London setting and the rather stiff upper middle class dialogue and the lack of a put upon loser acting in the Woody Allen mode. However, examine the themes and some of WA's obsessions are apparent. In particular, as I'm sure has been commented on before, I see a number of allusions to Dostoyevsky; the main character (hardly a hero) has something of Raskolnikov about him, happy to commit murder if it suits a 'higher' purpose. The murder itself echoes the elements of the murder in C & P. Even the cop (James Nesbitt) is a little like Porfiry in his attitude, although this cop seems a whole lot more incompetent than Porfiry! <br/><br/>It's not C & P however, and events turn it differently. It makes for an interesting film, even it does have a few flaws, as others have pointed out. Performances are good all round; I actually began to dislike the Scarlett Johannsson character which, given her pulchritudinous, is quite an achievement.<br/><br/>It's good to see WA still making thoughtful films..."

But by building this up on numerous unrealistic and irrational plots and turns of event does not help if not harms the credibility and decency of this movie. For such an ambitious and power hungry guy as Jonathan, many acts he did were totally out of the ordinary to completely destruct the credibility of the whole story. Why would he have sex with a lady possessed by his ""boss"" around his mansion? And this being done ""roughly"" on a rainy day in the field - how romantic! Why would he use a long gun owned by once again his ""boss"" to commit a recklessly dangerous murder? And he managed to be someone like an investment banker after years of playing pro tennis! Turns out the story discredits the theme the movie tries to bring out, which on itself is more credible before I watched the movie."

","In short, Whilst i'm generally not into movies like this, i did find it enjoyable. There was an element to the movie which attracted me into watching it right until the credits as I could feel the tension building in the situation Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) had found himself in. A sordid love triangle involving his wife, Chloe Hewett Wilton (Emily Mortimer) and a gorgeous Nola Rice (Scarlett Johansson).<br/><br/>The movie does plenty of character development and has and ending which will surprise most, but overall it's definitely worth checking out if you are having a night in.<br/><br/>Despite the slow-paced nature of the film I did find some just seemed to skip months or even a year into the future within the blink of the eye. Also, i think some scenes could have been done without and were probably there to cover any potential plot holes. But i'm just nit-picking."

","The Tourism Board of Greater London should have Woody Allen shoot a commercial for them, because London looks great in this movie, and is probably the most compelling character. I was expecting a lighthearted comedy, so was a little surprised to find myself watching a ""Talented Mr. Ripley"" style drama - the poor schemer desperately trying to fit into a world of old money. The writing and dialogue is very stilted, and the movie explores the same themes as ""Crimes and Misdemeanours"" in a much less satisfying fashion.<br/><br/>Skip this trifle and rent the aforementioned ""Crimes and Misdemeanours"", Allen's best film in my view."
"faraaj-1","8","1","1","23 August 2006"," Woody Allen does Dostoyevsky in London
","I've always admired Woody Allen. The sheer number of great films he's made - Hannah and her Sisters, Manhattan, Midsummer Nights Sex Comedy, Everything you Wanted to Know About Sex, Manhattan Murder Mystery etc. Although some of his newer films weren't totally up to speed, I wanted them to be successful (not in the financial sense, but critically).<br/><br/>Match Point is Allen's first film in years to be not only critically but also financially successful. He didn't act in it and its not even a comedy and no its not set in Manhattan. This is a thriller. The lead is an ambitious Irish tennis player who chose not to turn tennis pro and moved to London instead. He gets involved with the only daughter of an upper-upper class businessman (the excellent Brian Cox) who can give a son-in-law a great career. He also falls in love with the businessman's son's fiancée - a struggling American actress played by Scarlet Johannsen (oh she's hot!). I won't say more about the plot and no its nothing like Hannah and her Sisters. Instead, it is partially based on Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment.<br/><br/>I liked the London photography, the artwork and the Enrique Caruso opera piece which was used to great effect. The first scene with Jonathan Rhys-Myer and Scarlet is great. The verbal play reminded me of Bogart and Bacall. But none of their later scenes except the one in the café had that writing spark - less style and more realism which was a little jarring. I also felt Meyers was not a very good lead and acted poorly in several scenes. Emily Mortimer does a good job as Meyer's girlfriend.<br/><br/>I would recommend this as a good but not perfect film."
"ieatfemale","4","1","1","21 August 2006"," Not a waste, but a rubbish plot.
","I decided to watch it because Scarlett Johansson is in it, who, to me, doubtlessly is one of the most talented actresses of this decade. And the film started as always: a nice, warm romantic comedy, slightly drama, set in the gorgeous London. Tagging along with the story lines, Nola having a semi-true relationship with Tom, and Chris being with Chloe, I immediately realized I had landed the completely straight version of ""Imagine me and you"" which, according to most people, had a great story line and ended terrificly and romantic.<br/><br/>Straight up until the point when the affair between Nola and Chris started to progress and got much more intense. It almost seemed like Naomi Watts after waking up in ""Mulholland Dr."" Now, the plot change that I REALLY didn't get is when Chris got the gun out of his bag and shot the neighbor and Nola straight in the face.<br/><br/>My friends and I all came to the conclusion that Chris had fallen asleep in the country side after the bit when he had sex with Nola, and that it was all just a bad dream among his perfect rich life (that's right, COMPLETELY unpredictable and, to be honest, a little rubbish).<br/><br/>Getting all the way to the end, we all wondered what was going to happen: was it a dream? was it a joke? was it Mulholland Drive after all? I was quite a bit shocked when I saw the credits rolling up on the black screen without having even seen at least a trial or so. I'm almost sorry to say this, since Woody Allen usually is a genius, but this plot is THE WORST I've seen in my entire life. There's absolutely no sign of what it is: a comedy, a drama, a thriller. It all mixes up and ends without the viewer knowing anything about the future developments. I'm actually waiting for a sequel to come out to make up for the open ending and all the bad personality twists. The fact that Nola dies in the middle of the film, while she really is one of the bigger parts, as she's in an affair, being pregnant, being depressed, the viewer seeing all of this, is probably the thing that I keep tripping over when thinking about this.<br/><br/>Though this film wasn't a total waste to watch. The acting was superb. Scarlett was amazing, so were Jonathan and the rest of the cast. Strong signs of emotion, great looks. After an hour I just couldn't wait for Chris to break up with Chloe, who kept getting more and more annoying. Another thing that I really appreciated was the opera music playing a slightly unnoticeable but (if you paid attention to it) strong part in the film. I'm definitely going out to get the soundtrack if it's available. I also thought it was shot beautifully. The London estate was great, so was Nola's apartment and the big office building. The light and amazing just kept being lovely.<br/><br/>I think Allen could've done a much better job at keeping the script going in one direction instead of five."

","An ex tennis player turned pro marries into a wealthy British family but has his eyes on his brother-in-law's girlfriend. You know this is going to be good from the start, but some reviewers here are suggesting that this is a masterpiece and frankly its not. Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Scarlett Johannson are not convincing and some clever twists in the second half really save an otherwise slow film. The operatic themes throughout didn't work for me and were overdone. Perhaps the main problem lies in the fact that no one in the film is likable except for the father. Everyone else is so selfish and stupid. I could not muster up even a grain of sympathy for any of the characters and felt they deserved all they got. I actually hoped that they all might die in some terrible accident or similar tragedy in the end, but that never eventuated."
"bjrw","7","1","1","22 July 2006"," Why parts of movie are not believable........
","I thought this was a very good movie. It was entertaining, with good twists & turns .... and a good story about ""luck"" in life. I also enjoyed the performances of the actors. I especially loved that it was filmed in London & the English countryside .... my favorite places on earth!! Anyway, my biggest beef with the movie was that Nola was pregnant when she was killed. An autopsy would have immediately confirmed that. Which would have made Chris an even bigger suspect than he already was. The one detective was already on to him & the pregnancy would've strengthened his theory. Further, wouldn't Nola have recorded her pregnancy into her diary .... where she apparently wrote everything else??? Also, it would have been relatively easy for the detectives to learn if Chris had access to weapons. Once that was determined, the type of weapon used in the murder would've been traced directly to Chris.<br/><br/>So I find it doubtful that this type of murder could really have been that easy to walk away from.<br/><br/>Other than all that (!!) I did like the film - probably because the acting & the sets were a bit more realistic than most films I see today where directors treats their audience like imbeciles."
"bandw","7","1","1","11 July 2006"," A different side of Woody Allen
","Here Woody Allen has traded in his self-absorbed neurotics (of either the serious or comic variety) for the simply self-absorbed. Chris, a tennis pro who has just quit the circuit to become a pro at an upper-class London club, strikes up a friendship there with Tom, a club member. Chris has worked his way up and is not discomfited with the idea of entering Tom's world, and in short order he is faced with the dilemma of choosing between lust and greed. Lust for Tom's fiancée and greed to join the ranks of the rich - greed enough to enter into a marriage of convenience (at least for him) with Tom's sister. But of course he wants both and, as this movie (and the world) would have it, this is difficult to finesse.<br/><br/>Chris' emotional conflicts, and the repercussions of his decisions, are not what is really being addressed here. Allen calls it ""luck,"" but I think more accurately the topic is free-will versus determinism. Most people want to believe that, for the most part, where they wind up in life is due to the choices they have made rather than random chance. This movie argues otherwise, implying that major node points in our lives are often decided by nothing more significant than a coin flip. If you had been delayed by five seconds, you would not have had that car crash; if your boss had not eaten that double chili cheeseburger with extra fries and a side of jalapeños before the interview, you would have gotten the big promotion; if you had not met person X, you would have become rich; and so on. In a clever twist, a crucial random event in this movie that looks for all the world like it will spell Chris' demise actually saves him.<br/><br/>Some Woody Allen trademarks are still in evidence. The filming is meticulous and the actors attractive. The usual jazz score has been changed to opera (it's great to hear some of those old Caruso recordings), befitting the upscale clientèle. And there are some comments that are classic Allen, like a comment made by a woman in an art gallery about two friends, ""All their neuroses intertwine perfectly and it just works like a charm.""<br/><br/>Besides a couple of peripheral characters the people on display are not terribly likable, so it is hard to root for any of them. But perhaps it is one of the strengths of ""Match Point"" that it keeps your attention in spite of that.<br/><br/>As presented here it does not look like being in the British upper-classes would be much fun."

"The_Void","10","1","1","27 April 2006"," A change of environment proves lucky for Woody Allen
","Every film that Woody Allen releases is automatically a point of interest for me, especially when the film in question has won itself a lot of favourable reviews. Match Point sees Allen in new territory as his beloved New York has been swapped for London, England. Despite this relocation, however, Match Point is still very clearly a Woody Allen film. The film is mostly a romantic drama, but as the story moves forward; thriller elements start to creep through, and best of all we get a very potent streak of black humour to round things off. The plot typically features the central character in turmoil. We are introduced to former tennis star turned coach, Chris Wilton. He's looking for a meaning to his life and wants to do something different from tennis. After meeting a man named Tom, Chris finds himself the object of Tom's sister Chloe's affections. However, our tennis star has his eyes on Tom's finance; Nola. After having an affair with Nola, Chris finds himself at decision-making time. Because as we all know; you can't have two women for long.<br/><br/>The film starts off with a sequence in which the protagonist tells us about a tennis ball hitting the top of a net during a game. If it carries on going, your luck is in; but if it falls back, it isn't. Woody Allen keeps this luck theme going throughout the film, and the way that he harks back to the opening scene towards the end of the film is just great. Being from the UK myself, I was interested to see how Allen would handle the London setting. I've got to say, however, that I'm a bit upset about the fact that he has decided to set the film in the upper crust of society. It's not so difficult for me to relate to upper class New York because I'm not from America; but as far as I'm concerned, the environment seen in this film doesn't really exist...but at least the English characters have English accents. The acting is fine, with Jonathan Rhys Meyers doing well in the lead role and hitting all the right notes as his character changes his stripes later on. Scarlett Johansson is his opposite number and delivers an emotional portrayal as the put-upon mistress, while Emily Mortimer is suitably posh to round off the central threesome. I loved the way the tale climaxes and I'm glad that Allen didn't continue along the lines that many films of this nature are happy to stay between. Overall, I can't say that this is Allen's best effort; but it's a very good one, and the director has been showing good consistency over the last few years."
"Drtimk","8","1","1","7 April 2006"," Good film could have been great!
","Match Point is a wonderful story that is expertly filmed and told but is marred somewhat by some corny dialogue and a central passionate affair that fails to truly convince.<br/><br/>I am a huge fan of Scarlett Johansson ever since her wonderful understated performance in Lost in Translation.She gave similar very good performances in Love song for Bobby Long and In Good Company.However,this role called for a much larger emotional range(Obsession,lust,anger etc..) and I feel she comes up short. Similarly, Jonathan Rhys Meyers fails to convey the emotional nuances of his character.As such the fire of their affair is not convincing. Indeed, I had the feeling they didn't really get along.Adding to this were some awfully mundane interchanges(the table tennis scene made me cringe).<br/><br/>Overall though, this is a wonderful story and a masterful plot with great twists and turns.The support cast is excellent and the locations and photography are stunning.In the end however, I was left feeling that with a more inspired casting of the leads(say Naomi Watts and Jude Law)who could exhibit more emotional range, as well as some minor writing changes,could have turned a good film into a a great psychodrama/thriller of Double Indemnity proportions."
"ptkolar","Null","1","1","10 March 2006"," Wasn't crazy about this film
","I am a moderate fan of Woody Allen and was prepared to like this movie based on comments but actually didn't. Firstly, he repeats himself (Crimes and Misdemeanors). Secondly, both of these movies are really rehashes of one of the oldest plots (e.g. An American Tragedy), but C&M had great acting and very interesting side plots. Thirdly, I might have taken more to the movie if I wasn't aware that Woody Allen made it. As it was, his workmanship shows in the ""too perfect"" lining up of British accents for the various classes, mannerisms, etc.. (Actually Britain isn't that British any more). I am sorry but it just killed my suspension of disbelief. Finally, I wasn't impressed with character construction and story development. Chris's rapid advancement in the social and business world is too facile, Nola is definitely too slutty to make you believe somebody would get obsessive except for a quick roll in the hay once in a while, the father-in-law is too linearly fatherly and benevolent, etc.."
"TheNorthernMonkee","6","1","1","1 March 2006"," Missing New York
","SPOILERS Throughout his long and distinguished career, just how many films has Woody Allen set outside of his native New York? Not many spring to mind truthfully (older classics like ""Sleeper"" and ""Everything you wanted to know about Sex... but were afraid to ask"" for example), but with 2005's ""Match Point"" it might be that we are beginning to understand why. A firm believer in New York, most people would argue that he knows the place like the back of his hand. Relocating to London (for money?), Allen appears to be out of his depth. Creating an occasionally intense thriller, he gives us a perfect, tourist like view of London, distorted for the American audiences. With a cast of major British actors, he also manages to fill the two main roles with an excellent American and an awful Brit. Woody, for the sake of all the beautiful scripting that we know you can do, go home mate.<br/><br/>Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) is a former tennis pro, now working as a tennis instructor at a posh London club. Falling for the incredibly rich Chloe Hewett (Emily Mortimer) things are going great. That is until he encounters the beautiful and sultry American Nola Rice (Scarlett Johansson). Once Chris gets the image of Nola stuck in his head, it is stuck there.<br/><br/>It isn't difficult to see why Woody Allen considers Scarlett Johansson to be his new muse. Absolutely stunning throughout this film, she is the definite highlight. On top form with her performance, she gives us a strong and powerful character who we are never really sure what to think of.<br/><br/>In contrast to Johansson, Rhys Meyers is absolutely dreadful. An incredibly wooden actor, the guy is awful. Aside from the Queens English coming from an Irish character, he just never seems to click into place in the film, and for much of it, we really do develop a strong disliking for him. Whatever situation he finds himself in, there is no sympathy there. Now some might stipulate that this is Woody Allen's fault, and to a small degree this is true. Yes Woody wrote and directed the film, yes he wrote a script so painfully unBritish that you grate your teeth at times, but whatever Woody did, Meyers is the one who fails to give the character any sort of life, and who annoys throughout.<br/><br/>That point about Woody's script is worth going into further. Whilst a writer and director of great skill, let us not forget that his finest moments have come in scenes where he is in a New York café or where he is making some witty comment on a New York street. As Woody is from New York, he knows how they speak perfectly. Unfortunately with ""Match Point"", he manages to give us a script which is so hideously false that you wonder why more of his outstanding British cast (Brian Cox, Penelope Wilton, etc) didn't correct him more often. Woody writes New York perfectly, he writes British incredibly badly.<br/><br/>Woody Allen's last few films have been about ideas. Whilst ""Melinda & Melinda"" was an inconsistent film about comedy and tragedy, here we have another inconsistent film about luck. As Woody gets older, he seems to become increasingly more philosophical, and this is no bad thing. Unfortunately though, when he relocates from his native New York and begins casts awful British actors in the main roles, he wastes a perfectly good idea for a film. Woody, keep Scarlett, she's amazing, but please, for the sake of your fans, go back to America."

","You must read Crime and Punishment before you see this terrific movie. It will totally alter your experience, especially in the last third. To begin with, Chris is found reading the novel with the aid of a source book and critical summary-- one realizes he needs help with such complexity. From then on, for some reason, reviewers have not made the analogies, but here are some of them without giving away the plot: Note the similarities between the older neighbor and Lizaveta-- and the pawnbroker is turned into someone else who must be ""put away"". The casting off of the jewelry, the building up of suspense before the crime, the haunting dreams-- the discussion about the tragedy of life with the tragic operas playing in the background, and finally the ending which turns the novel completely on its head in the most cynical way possible."

","I've never been a fan of Woody Allen's narcissistic neurotic work but I gave Match Point a chance based on popular concensus that it was a 'turning point'.<br/><br/>I say, thank god for the female cast and the stunning London locations or it would sink without a trace. Rhys-Meyers has nowhere near the range required to carry an internalized, nuanced performance a film like this requires - I'm STRESSED- I'm RUNNING MY HANDS THROUGH MY HAIR- and Matthew Goode plays like a cheap, unlikebale Hugh Grant fopp. Do any of my fellow Britons know anyone who speaks like these characters (regradless of how posh?) ""Coal me on moi mooooboile when you get oarrrf"" (?!) It is so jarring to watch British actors play to the American audience, spouting clichés written by a New Yorker.<br/><br/>Emily Mortimer was outstanding - A realistic, sympathetic alternative to Johanssen's unhinged sex-pot. Johanssen is in a league of her own. She can't even be compared to the Dunsts, McAdams, Gellars et al. This is an acting sensation....<br/><br/>The other redeeming feature was the ring moment.

"gpappasmanips","9","1","1","30 January 2006"," a hymn to the superficiality of happiness
","Match Point portrays in a very beautiful manner that love and passion in life usually flourish against logic and out of proportion. This is what makes the hero of this movie a tragic person, someone who can get by in life using Socrate's saying ""the saddest thing in life is to be born"". Personally,what i really liked about this film was Allen's mastery of playing games with his audience's minds, compelling them to take compassion on a person that is about to give up any moral principle to preserve his superficial happiness. This is a high level of cinematography, very appealing to to those who get absorbed by a riveting plot. Also highly recommended to those who consider visual effects or stories without any grip on reality as definite no-nos."
"anhedonia","9","1","1","29 January 2006"," Absolutely engrossing - one of Allen's very best
","We hear Nola Rice before we see her in ""Match Point."" Scarlett Johansson poses an enticing query in a low, husky voice that promptly establishes Nora's persona. The scene that follows between Nola and Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) is just one of the many joys in Woody Allen's new film, his best in years and one of the finest in his remarkable oeuvre.<br/><br/>Critics have said that if you knew nothing about his film and walked in after the credits, you'd be hard-pressed to recognize it as a Woody Allen film. They're right.<br/><br/>Although there are some familiar touches that fans of Allen would recognize - how many filmmakers would have a character looking for his ""Strindberg book,"" after all? - this is quite possibly the most un-Allen like film he's made.<br/><br/>There's no schlemiel character or even an Allen surrogate here. No excessively neurotic people - although I'm a huge fan of his neuroses. Although Allen's stepping into English society for the first time, he doesn't seem out of place one bit. Though I doubt very much a London cop would say, ""Schmuck."" But such a trivial faux pas can easily be forgiven considering what a gem Allen's created.<br/><br/>Having seen all of Allen's films - most of them several times - I must admit I never would've pegged him to make a masterful thriller that raises important philosophical questions, places his characters in moral crises and creates tense moments and a delicious twist that would have made Hitchcock smile.<br/><br/>I know some have complained that Allen dealt with similar moral dilemmas in ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" (1989). True. But surely that doesn't mean he can't tackle those issues again. F.W. Murnau dealt with good vs. evil in 'Sunrise"" (1927), but that hasn't stopped countless filmmakers from delving into that topic ever since.<br/><br/>Allen assembled a superb cast. I've never been a fan of Rhys-Meyers because I've always viewed his performances as being somewhat affected. As tennis pro Chris, however, Rhys-Meyers is convincing as a man working himself up the social strata and enjoying the luxuries that come with it. The moral crisis he faces is dealt with honestly and it's to Rhys-Meyers' credit that I actually found myself rooting for him.<br/><br/>The story's great moral complexity is that you also find yourself desperately not wanting to see his wife, Chloe (Emily Mortimer), hurt, either. Mortimer's so absolutely lovable and charming that Allen toys with our emotions as we envision her world collapsing.<br/><br/>But the film's bright, shining light is the glorious Johansson.<br/><br/>""I'm not beautiful,"" Nola says at one point in the film. ""What I am is sexy."" Johansson has never been better in a film - the Best Supporting Actress Oscar should go to either her or Amy Adams for ""Junebug,"" unless Johansson snags a Best Actress nod - as she completely captivates us. It's a subtle performance that captures every nuance of Nola's complex and confused character.<br/><br/>Johansson also has never looked sexier on the screen. Cinematographer Remi Adefarasin's camera adores her, much like how Nestor Almendros' camera loved Meryl Streep.<br/><br/>Adultery and obsession are not novel ideas to cinema or Woody Allen. Yet, he's drawn utterly believable characters - albeit in the upper class - and his film succeeds on many levels.<br/><br/>After a few stumbles, Allen's found his touch, his fine touch, again. With ""Match Point,"" he proves why he's a cinematic genius, someone who can almost 40 years after directing his first film still surprise us and show us what a unique filmmaker and storyteller he is."

Chris is a tennis instructor at a posh tennis club in London. Rubbing elbows with London's elite on a daily basis leads Chris to a wealthy wife and a cushy job in the family business. His life would've been perfect if he hadn't pursued a dangerous affair with a gorgeous, but unstable, struggling American actress named Nola (as much as I dislike Scarlett Johansson, I have to admit that she fit the part perfectly). I've never been a Woody Allen fan, but ""Match Point"" smacks you in the face when you least expect it. In one second it goes from sexy drama to psychodrama, and there is never a dull moment.

","Unwillingly, I join the swelling ranks of disappointed Woody Allen fans. There are big problems with the screenplay (a kind of watered-down version of Crimes and Misdemeanours) and the burden imposed on a leading man who, charming and talented though he may be, simply isn't up to doing what is asked of him - i.e. imbuing a two-D character with flesh and blood. The leading lady, on the other hand, with a little more to chew on, is as impressive as ever, as are a gallery of excellent English character actors - as long as Penelope Wilton and Margaret Tyzack are on screen, the outlook can never be entirely bleak. I saw this the night before I saw Brokeback Mountain, which blew me away, and in retrospect has me thinking that maybe Woody Allen should retire before he embarrasses himself further."
"Tony43","Null","5","12","31 December 2005"," More of a double bagel
","Only tennis fans will get that line, but then this film uses tennis, both as a minor plot point, and as a metaphor for life's unique twists and turns. In fact, the whole premise of this film is that so much of what happens to us happens by complete chance that it is much better to be lucky than good, a phrase no small number of tennis players and commentators have used over the years.<br/><br/>""Match Point,"" Woody Allen's new film, has gotten hailed by some critics as a return to form and by others for breaking new ground, at least for Woody. Writing for once not about neurotic Manhattanites, Allen this time has moved his serious comedy of manners to England, where it belongs. The plot, in a nutshell is this, failed and somewhat lazy tennis pro Chris Wilton, through a number of strokes of luck, falls in with a very wealthy family that takes a shine to him. Before long, he's headed to the alter with the family's pretty, charming, but slightly patronizing daughter, and also on his way to a new career as a pampered corporate executive, although exactly what business he is in never seems to be spelled out.<br/><br/>That's pretty much the story for the first half of the movie, nothing but dumb luck taking the tennis pro, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, to the top, at least of the corporate rankings. Where things start to get sticky is when he falls for the girlfriend of the son of the family, an American actress named Nola. He even has a one afternoon stand with her, boffing her in a wheat field of all places in the middle of a heavy rain storm. But he goes ahead and marries the rich girl anyway, but then his brother-in-law dumps Nola and Chris finds himself obsessed with her. That leads to lies, deceptions and the finally, a major crime and then some.<br/><br/>First, lets deal with the acting. Rhys Meyers is fine as the ex-tennis pro, although not exactly dynamic. But then, his part doesn't call for it. Had he been depicted as the poor boy from Ireland who fought and maneuvered and clawed his way into the upper ranks of London society, it would have been a much more interesting film. Instead, he's depicted as a guy who was too lazy for the travel and hard work of the ATP tennis tour, so he becomes a teaching pro and the world just becomes his oyster. Again, that's the premise of the film and it might even be true in some rare cases, but it is not particularly exciting to watch on screen. It's also all been done better before, specifically in George Stevens version of ""An American Tragedy,"" which was released about 1950 as ""A Place in the Sun."" In ""Match Point,"" there is nobody to cheer for, because the central character is not only a less than admirable character, but he's also basically a reactive, rather than an active character. Luck may exist, but it isn't all that interesting to watch as it unfolds.<br/><br/>Supporting character Mathew Goode is good and Emily Mortimer in some ways delivers the best performance of the film as Chris' spoiled rotten, wife. Then comes the matter of the highly talented Scarlett Johansson as Nola, the American actress who for some unexplained reason, thinks London is the center of the film world. Even after being dumped by her boyfriend, she keeps coming back to England. Never mind New York, or, dare we say the word, Hollywood, she thinks all the acting jobs are in England.<br/><br/>Johansson delivers one of her weakest performances in this film, starting off fairly strong, but playing the same note throughout the film. And when you think about it, her cynicism never really rings true from the beginning. Why would a girl about to marry into such a wealthy family be so negative all the time. Couldn't an actress do a little more to win over the skeptical mother-in-law? <br/><br/>********************spoiler alert*****************<br/><br/>Then comes the big finish, in which Chris, who has had a torrid affair with Nola, finds out she is preggers and is about to blow his cover. So he shotguns both her and her neighbor to death and tries to make it look like a burglary gone bad. No, you didn't misread this. That's what happens. And as improbable as that is, the story gets worse. The subsequent police investigation of a particularly brutal double homicide quickly clears Chris. Even though there is enough evidence to make this a case right out of Detective 101, the cops just let him go. Apparently in London, no autopsies are performed on the bodies of murder victims, which of course would have shown that Nola was pregnant and of course, Chris was the main suspect. Secondly, even after he admits to the police he was having an affair with Nola, they never ask about his alibi for the time of the crime nor apparently make any effort to check it out.<br/><br/>I would guess the Bobbies never solved a murder case, which must come as something of a surprise to every English detective from Sherlock Holmes to Robbie Coltrane's character in ""Cracker."" <br/><br/>At any rate, I don't think Woody Allen is back and I don't think he made his case for everything being all about luck. I didn't feel lucky wasting my time in this film."

Scarlett Johansson can't act but shows us she sure can shout - in scene after scene after scene. Bless. I guess that must have been her doing ""angry"". Mortimer, Cox and Wilton are cardboard cut outs, so 2 dimensional are their characters. On the plus side, Rupert Penry-Jones and James Nesbitt both managed their cameos with style and credibility.

","If you like production of Woody Allen you will fall in love with ""Match Point""! I'm a big fan of Allen. His films contains so much ironic humor and great dialog that you cannot help but admire this 70-year-old funny little man.<br/><br/>I was surprised after seen ""Match Point"" because it represent a different kind of Allen. The irony was there but instead of raving comedy he gave us some completely different. ""Match Point"" is a story about love, passion and coincidence. Ex-tennis professional Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys-Myers) gets caught up with intriguing affair with his brothers bride Nola Rice (Scarlett Johansson). New heat is more interesting than his life with his wife Chloe (doll-faced Emily Mortimer. The passion becomes so powerful and overwhelming that it will have a huge impact on what will happen next.<br/><br/>The film is a different kind of Woody Allen because his known set Manhattan/New York has changed to rainy London. Allen expands his views, and the result is one working combination of new locations charm and variety. That fact made ""Match Point"" even more likable.<br/><br/>After 70's and 80's strut with great actors like Diane Keaton, Dianne Wiest and his ex-spouse Mia Farrow it is a blessing to see Allen directing rising young stars. We have seen Diane Keaton's face so many times in his older production that it is fantastic to see that he haven't lost his touch with younger stars either.<br/><br/>The end of the film was so striking that we laughed and could not believe the irony of being at right place at the right time.

Johansson is always so busy making her lips so sensual (thanks to the character of Chris for revealing that S. Johansson has ""sensual lips, I guess she got into the business thanks to her big lips...) that she forgets to play properly, oh God, all her mimics make me sick...Meyers is completely cold and expressionless, what an awful actor, everything sounds fake when he speaks, everything. The character of Chloe is way too gullible, that's almost irritating. And the plot is ridiculous. No, seriously, what is it with all these beautiful actresses who cannot play? S. Johansson, K. Knightley, they're big super popular superstars, but they are no actresses, they're just beautiful! Is it normal that every popular actress in America also always happens to be the icon for Chanel, or I don't know what? They just make the movie sell, but they are such lame actresses...

","Anyone who missed the opening credits may be forgiven for thinking they had wandered into the wrong auditorium by mistake given that they had paid for a Woody Allen movie on the strength of others they'd seen which, as is his wont, had been sprinkled with one-liners. Here we get a virtually straight story in which Woody seems to be hijacking Tom Ripley and/or other amoral Patricia Highsmith characters and amalgamating them into someone who, like Tom Ripley, ingratiates himself into a social class other than the one into which he was born and then does what he has to do in order to remain there and, as with Highsmith, gets away with it. This is not to detract from the entertainment on offer, the actors work well as an ensemble and Allen's writing and direction are up to his usual standard but one wonders if he is running out of ideas and whether this Ripleyesque character will emerge again ... and again."

After Nola and the lead have their moment of passion in the rain and lope back into the mansion after having both been gone for a good while, nobody puts two and two together? C'mon. I almost wore out my watch looking at it while waiting for this travesty to end.

","I think we can say Mr Allen has lost touch with the human race. This is certainly not a bad film...I was intrigued for a while until I realized I could care less for any of these shallow characters. Maybe that's Woody showing us the shallowness of class structure in such dark times, but who cares. If you want to see a good drama by Woody Allen, see his beautifully heart breaking, INTERIORS. So much of the film didn't ring true, though I must say this film is a cut above MELINDA & MELINDA..which was painful. I love earlier Woody, but unfortunately I think those days are long gone. At times it felt as if this film was some young director's debut, as if it were directed by someone with no real life experiences. This is mediocre stuff with an interesting dark twist. The one surprising thing about this film is that you don't really feel Mr. Allen's presence behind the camera, other than the sometimes stilted dialog and eccentric music choices. MATCH POINT is not a bad film but it's not a very good one either. See it at your own risk."

","As a long time Woody Allen fan, I was very disappointed by this film, and amazed by the (mostly) positive reaction it has received. The dialogue and the acting are run-of-the-mill for the most part, and the pace is generally slower than the material merits (face it, you just don't need much time to appreciate what Allen is presenting here). Most of the settings and the character interactions are both precious and banal, and if not for the unfortunately brief appearances of Eleanor Hewitt (Penelope Wilton), Mrs. Eastby (Margaret Tyzack) and Detective Banner (James Nesbitt), the film wouldn't have any spark at all. I saw this in New York and was astonished when people applauded at the end. Match Point, in more than two hours of screen time, does not present us with a single character or situation that is genuinely interesting and/or engaging. What's to like? We are being asked to forgive Woody Allen a great deal here. But I'm sorry -- I'm not up to it."

I don't know how the story turned out because after 30 minutes, I didn't care to sit through any more, because the plot setup is something you've seen many times before. Every scene went on twice as long as should have, and you can easily see where the scene is going to end up before it gets there. Allen's visual style has always been dependent on his cinematographers, so when he had Gordon Willis or Carlo DiPalma shooting his films, they were visually striking even if the films were not terribly interesting. Here, cinematographer Aderfasin brings no style to the proceedings, so you have a boring film that isn't even worth looking at. IMO, it's time for Mr. Allen to hang it up."

But the end -I mean how the lead character reacted- is so unrealistic that I kept wondering what was going on in Chris Wilton's mind. What triggered him to do what he did?

Violence against women again, yawn. Isn't David Mamet's constant input on this subject enough to put us all to sleep without any assistance from Woody Allen. When the main character began to plan to kill the love interest (the whole point of the movie) I simply turned it off. I didn't even bother to finish it. I want my dollar fifty back from the video store. What a huge disappointment. For some reason I thought this might be a good film, something like Merchant Ivory might make. For a great film with a very similar plot watch the old classic A Place In The Sun with Elizabeth Taylor.

"Flagrant-Baronessa","8","3","7","13 August 2006"," Exquisitely crafted drama-thriller by Woody
","A match point is, in tennis, the final point needed to win a game. Chris (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) points out to us early on that this point is more decided to random chance than anything else, as are most occurrences in the world - and that one little detail can determine your fate, if you're lucky or unlucky. Match Point (2005) is a film constructed almost solely on luck, exquisitely balancing on tiptoes throughout and sometimes being unbearably exciting because of it.<br/><br/>""I don't fool myself that I've gotten used to a certain kind of living."" <br/><br/><ul><li>So says Chris, who is living a comfortable life with his extraordinarily well-off wife, enjoying the luxury and stability that her family affords him. What takes him and shakes him off this balance--off his stable tiptoes--is the beautiful Nola Rice (Scarlett Johansson) and the two engage in a romantic affair that Chris struggles to hide from his wife.</li></ul><br/><br/>Jonathan Rhys-Meyers successfully captures the inner turmoil of his character and being in every scene of the film, we truly sympathise with him and I found myself totally engrossed in his struggle to juggle two women and all the problems that this brought with it. Scarlett Johansson is a mediocre actress here at best, delivering her dynamic Woody Allen-written lines with less conviction and less subtlety than the rest of the cast - but it is her gorgeous looks that propel the film because, in truth, this is all that is needed of her character as 'the other woman'.<br/><br/>Match Point spirals into a complex story by Woody Allen, but it is extremely well-crafted, paying great attention to little details and dialogue. It is seductive without playing too much on sex, as the trailer suggests. The long-drawn scenes were all compelling to watch and felt swift and poignant. I loved nearly everything about it, except for the tedious opera music that was playing in the background - it felt as though that device had already been used, and probably by Woody Allen himself.<br/><br/>8/10"
"ajsmacdonaLd","2","3","7","21 January 2006"," Really nothing notable here..
","To be honest, I found this movie irritating. It wasn't because the plot was Soooooo.....predictable or that the lighting was poor. It was the leading man J. Rhys Myers. He was simply flat. He was even too polished when the scene required that he only walk down the street. There's nothing natural about his acting. He's trying too hard, to the point of annoyance in some scenes, while in others, he barely seems awake. I think he brought the quality of what ""could have been"" an OK Woody Allen movie down. Mr Allen has never really impressed me too much. I know to be a producer/actor...etc..that one has to be eclectic and often times eccentric, but in Mr. Allen's case, he's just a sad demented post-middle aged man. He's not the least bit funny. I have to say that my money could have been better spent tipping a pizza boy and renting it at home, but I think 8 dollars Canadian would still a substantial waste. I try to keep my mind open and view movies done by producers/directors who I don't particularly care for. Sorry Woody-you still haven't done anything of quality to date."
"the_Poppuns","6","3","7","10 January 2006"," This is just like a Woody Allen movie
","Edit: Upon further review and after having rewatched A Place in the Sun. I do think this movie is too close for comfort. Having not realized that upon first seeing it I had written the review below. I'll leave it in case the movie still appeals to you, even if it's not very original. ******<br/><br/>Maybe all the people who keep saying that this is so different from everything else he's done haven't seen that much of what he's done. I think this is very much a Woody Allen film and a very good one at that. But a lot of the reviews I'm reading seem off to me. They call it a thriller. I wouldn't say that. They say it's got steamy sex scenes. Well, not really. I think they're selling this as something it's not.<br/><br/>What it is is a compelling story of a former tennis player Chris Wilton (played by Jonathan Rhys Meyers) who's life is at a crossroads. When we meet him he's looking for work as a tennis instructor. He gets the job and as luck would have it he befriends a student of his, Tom (Matthew Goode), who has a more satisfying lifestyle than his own. Very quickly Tom opens the door to this lifestyle for Chris. So what was he supposed to do, not walk through it? Anyway one thing leads to another and Chris finds himself snared in a trap of his own desires, that pull him in opposite directions.<br/><br/>From there on in I find this to be a character study. It's about what choices Chris makes and I find them all to be very difficult choices. And luck does play apart in what happens to him. But there is a view among people who've seen this movie that what should happen doesn't. Or that Karma's Army took a nap and someone gets away with something. But I think it's weird for people to have an assumption that this is how it works. Does every bad person you've ever met ""get theirs"" in the end? No. So, I think this movie is an honest look at what probably happens a lot and takes a sympathetic view of someone who most people would consider to be a social climber who takes it to the limit. I don't see it that way. But that's probably why I think this is such a good movie. To me, he had to choose between two lives neither of which should have been his. If he made a fatal mistake it was when he accepted Tom's offer to the opera. After that, the die was cast.<br/><br/>I've been a fan of Jonathan Rhys Meyers for a while and I think this is one of his best performances. I've loved Woody Allen for a long time and I think this is one of his better movies. If you liked 'Interiors', as I did, you should like this. I know a lot of people are comparing it to 'Crimes and Misdemeanors' but the tone is totally different to me and I very much prefer this movie. I didn't understand what all the hubbub was about concerning Scarlett Johansson in 'Lost in Translation' but I do like her here. She's got a Gloria Grahame (love her!) thing going on in this movie and I thought she did a great job. The character Emily Watson played, Chloe, annoyed me, so I don't know if I can judge her performance properly, but it was that kind of mousy sheepish person that really shouldn't breathe. But all around the performances were good.<br/><br/>Apart from being a movie buff, I'm a huge tennis fan as well, and I've drawn the net chord parallel to fate myself in the past. You see a guy playing his heart out who winds up losing a match because of a bad bounce or call. That's life isn't it? When you see that happen you feel bad for the loser but you can't blame the winner. They played the game and won. That's what this movie is about, a winner."
"burtbird","6","3","7","6 January 2006"," Very good... yet stale.
","Allen's latest offering resembles a celluloid operatic tragedy - the point of which is very poignant; luck is a major player in all things, and the good/bad people involved do not always get what they deserve. Unfortunately, despite a capable cast and director, the execution was somewhat sloppy. <br/><br/>The setup, although necessary, seemed overly long and stale; no doubt due to the flat, wooden dialogue that was spoken and made all the more unemotional by having our characters appear 'oh so very classically British' with their 'stiff upper lip' and what not, (although their class was pivotal to the plot). The way the dialogue was delivered, especially by 'Chris Wilton', was straight and obviously scripted - it was as if the characters were reading directly from a script.<br/><br/>Things do get better in the last half-hour or so; tempers fray, emotions build and climax, and the ending is very clever indeed. This film is definitely worth going to watch, it will stay with you long after you leave the cinema, yet it is slightly flawed."

"Geofbob","7","5","15","21 December 2005"," London no match for New York
","It's a little odd that for the time being at least Woody Allen has transferred his affection from New York to my home town, London. Following Match Point, he's well into his second London film (Scoop), and a third is said to be on the stocks. The point is, he may love London, but it's not clear that London or the UK generally loves him. Yes, they adore the classics, like Annie Hall and Manhatten; but they were never keen on his ""Bergman period"" efforts such as Interiors; and his latest offerings have generally been panned - I had to see and enjoy the bad taste of Hollywood Ending in Paris, as to date (late 2005) it's not been released in the UK.<br/><br/>All the signs are that Match Point will be well received when it opens here early in 2006; but personally I wasn't too sure. (Again, I saw it in the French capital, which gets many English-language films before London, and whose cinema scene makes ours look provincial.) It seemed to me that Allen may have been mildly infected by whatever bug caused Robert Altman to make Gosford Park. His film is so, so English, with almost all the characters talking in posh accents, and living posh life-styles (apart from the stereotypically, cardboard police detectives); and if there was even one of Allens trade-mark wisecracks, I missed it.<br/><br/>Sure, much of the milieu has to be high class, since a main theme of the film is how far a poorer (though not that poor) chap will go to climb the social ladder; but Allen might have shown a little of London's seamier and steamier side, to complement the series of shots of pristine tourist attractions such as the Tate Modern, South Bank arts complex, ""Gherkin"" office block, and Notting Hill. Overall, the film struck me as rather stilted and lifeless; and if it's Hitchcockian, it's the Hitch of Dial M for Murder.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, the film is deftly made and watchable, with more than a few surprises along the way, and all the principles filling their roles adequately, though I wasn't entirely convinced by Scarlett Johannson as femme fatale. Incidentally, one of the odder pieces of casting is the comedy actor and TV star, John Fortune, as the almost non-speaking chauffeur, though I note he is uncredited on IMDb.<br/><br/>Needless to say, since it is Woody Allen, it's a ""must see"" movie; but personally I hope for better from Scoop, and eventually would prefer to see him return to and do his work in the more familiar territory of Manhatten."

Now don't get me wrong Scarlett and those lips had me at go. But Ryhs Meyers, Goode (and Mortimer to the Nth Degree) just got boorish after a while. I even think her accent floated away during the second hour. Maybe it's the fact that Woody mostly makes movies for a special type of person, or maybe it's the fact that the British don't translate well into a Allen Movie. Either way the movie was a tragedy to watch I'm just sorry I blew 10 bucks on it, when that could have gone to a cute stripper somewhere far away from Match Point.

","Match Point has been publicised as Woody Allens return to cinematic form, this new film starring various British actors (Including Brian Cox) and Scarlett Johanssen. Sadly the film doesn't quite turn out to be all it should. While the beginning is OK and parts of the end of the film are good the middle section drags unbelievably at times, this is one of the few films where I've checked my watch and thought I'm bored. While I can see that Allen was really trying to get the audience into the life of the lead character (Played by Jonathan Rhys Meyers) all he did was bore us with repeat parts of the film and fluff. As another reviewer has mentioned this film suffers from Americans doing bad British cinema syndrome. The film comes across as being too British that it doesn't flow or feel natural, the dialogue is at times cheesy or painful. Particularly when Meyers and Johanssens characters meet, where did he get those lines from? Meyers in general was the biggest let down of the film he is not convincing in anyway, he's extremely wooden and doesn't really appear to change his mood/emotions at anytime. He really did not grab my attention and keep me interested, as a side note he also didn't suit to being paired with Johanssen there was no chemistry.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast are very good the family headed by Brian Cox fit well into the film and they are a pleasure to watch. Johanssen is also a pleasure to watch and not just because of her good looks. She fills the role very well, as a seductress and as her character evolves she keeps up and is believable. It's interesting to note that two of the 'Spooks' cast are in this.<br/><br/>Overall there are some good points it looks good and is well filmed. But it could have done with being trimmed down at least 20 minutes and a different lead actor would have raised the rating it deserves.<br/><br/>Don't spend £5+ to see it at the cinema."

Highly questionable casting. The most clunky script ever, twinned with an unbelievable plot involving characters with no depth whatsoever and all delivered with such heavy-handedness. The whole film felt like every scene had been done on the first take, no matter how bad.
Was it written as a play and then someone decided it would make more money as a movie? I can picture it being a mediocre stage play, but not a movie, please.

","This is one of the worst films that I have ever watched when I was in film class. You have a young man who is a tennis player and becomes entranced in a love affair with a rich and wealthy woman. Later in the film, he meets the woman's brother and his fiancee, who he starts to have an affection with. His infedelity and smug charm has made him one of the absolute worst characters that I have ever seen. This picture is pure filth and one of the worst from Woody Allen. It is unfunny, horrific, and one of the worst pieces of garbage that I have ever witnessed. I was reviled in letting the main hero/villain get away with murder by killing his fiancee who is pregnant with his child and by killing the witnesses in his clumsily stupid manner. Is it garbage? It is absolutely."

","I'm very fond of Woody Allen films. Even when he's sloppy, it's still a good film. But this one wasn't sloppy. It begins with the familiar plot- A man, whose destined to marry another woman, falls in love with his friend's fiancée. Only, the story goes deeper and deeper and creates a great suspense and interest. It isn't rare for an Allen's character to get involved in a mixed up situation. Only Allen can make a brilliant story out of it. I found the acting a little bit ""almost"", but the directing is, as usual, very good. In the end, I loved the turning of events and the well-written screenplay! Woody Allen does it again."

","I never know what I'll get with Woody Allen. Sometimes it will be something terrific like Midnight in Paris, Sweet and Lowdown, Sleeper, or The Purple Rose of Cairo, and sometimes it will be something painfully dull and pretentious like Alice, Hannah and Her Sisters or Match Point.<br/><br/>Match Point, like Hannah, is a movie about a bunch of people who all talk the same, have read the same authors, are familiar with the same music, and who are dull and lifeless and airless (except for Scarlett Johanson, who gets to play the role of the film's one non-boring person). I instantly disliked this movie, which seemed bland and unlikeable, but I struggled on through most of the first half hour in hopes that something would happen.<br/><br/>I hear something does happen eventually, but when I asked my girlfriend about it she said it was a terrible movie with a terrible ending, so I saw no reason to give it more of a chance."

","""The man who said I'd rather be lucky than good saw deeply into life.""<br/><br/>Those words, spoken in the opening narration, are the premise for Woody Allen's powerful thriller ""Match Point."" Everything that happens in the film is based on luck, whether good or bad, and how the characters respond to it.<br/><br/>Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) is a retired tennis pro who gets a job teaching tennis at a posh country club in London. There he meets rich kid Tom Hewett (Matthew Goode), and they become fast friends. Chris falls for Tom's sister, Chloe (Emily Mortimer), but then he meets Tom's fiancée, Nola Rice (Scarlett Johannson), and an affair begins.<br/><br/>To say more would be unfair, but let's leave it at saying that Allen knows what our expectations are, and plays them against us.<br/><br/>""Match Point"" demands patience, and for the first hour, is rather slow moving. However, this allows us to intimately know the characters. But more importantly, it allows Allen to pull us in without us really noticing. Allen sets the stage early, but he turns the wheels ever so slightly, so that by the time the film really gets going, we're completely hooked without realizing that Allen was drawing us into his web.<br/><br/>The acting is the most crucial part of the film. Woody Allen creates complete, three-dimensional characters on paper, but it's up to the actors to bring them to life. Fortunately, Allen has gathered a first-rate cast that is more than up to the task. Scarlett Johannson continues to impress as the seductive but unstable Nola. Nola could have been a one note plot contrivance, but with Johannson's performance (helped along by Allen's brilliant script), Nola is refreshingly real. Emily Mortimer is one of the most underrated actresses living today, but thankfully her performance in ""Match Point"" changed that. Chloe is an optimist who is completely in love with Chris, but she is completely oblivious to her husband's extracurricular activities. Matthew Goode shines as the immensely likable, but unintentionally snobbish Tom. It's no surprise that Chris would take a liking to him. Brian Cox and Penelope Wilton offer solid supporting turns as well, though their characters are strictly supplementary.<br/><br/>But this film belongs to Jonathan Rhys-Meyers. He got his break playing the soccer coach in the international hit ""Bend It Like Beckham,"" but here he is allowed to display his true range, and his performance is superb. He may not be present in every scene, but the whole film revolves around him and the decisions he makes; some of them are beyond his control, but others determine the course of events. This is a man who is held hostage by the decisions he makes, and desperately tries to find a way out from the unforeseen consequences. It is always a risky endeavor to have a single actor to carry the film, but Rhys-Meyers is more than up to the task. It is appalling that his work was unrecognized by any of the major awards.<br/><br/>This is the first Woody Allen film I've seen. Apparently, Allen is known for his comedies, but if anything, ""Match Point"" proves that when it comes to film-making, Allen has considerable versatility. His script is brilliant, and his direction is not far behind. He is a master of developing characters, but some of the scenes are cut a little too abruptly. However, these are small blemishes on an otherwise superb production.<br/><br/>""Match Point"" demands a lot from the viewer. But if you're willing to give it a chance, it will not disappoint."

","About 15 minutes in, my wife and I turned to each other and agreed that this was rubbish. In fact, if it hadn't been a Woody Allen film, we might've stopped watching. The acting is rotten, but given that the script is appallingly bad, they didn't stand a chance. (Brian Cox was good, and Johansson had her moments, but that's about it.) The lines are so cliché-laden, we thought that maybe it was all supposed to be a little tongue-in-cheek, but unfortunately it turns out it was all ""serious"".<br/><br/>I was mightily relieved when the film finally achieved some dramatic tension. The plot at this point wasn't original, but it was quite well done, and I almost decided that the film might be worth 5/10 after all. But the denouement is utterly ridiculous - Allen has resorted to remaking one of his own films! Sad. If this is the future level of Allen's film-making, I hope he retires."

","In more ways than one. But still you kinda root for that guy. It's not so much the love story that is the anchor of the movie, but the self destructive way of the main character, that does attract us to the film! <br/><br/>Some men might argue that the main attraction is Scarlett J. and I wouldn't want to disagree (optically speaking), but her character ... you have to be/feel sorry for her! Funnily enough the little detective story (thrill) at the end, does not distract from the main theme. Quite the contrary, the fact that our main character doesn't get punished for his sins (by the justice/police), but has to live with them for the rest of his life, is punishment enough!"

Boy can't broke up with woman, woman still wants a child, girl gets pregnant, boy loses his mind.<br/><br/>That's it! This is what the movie is all about. We all heard this story before BUT, not told by Woody Allen. The perfectionism here is all about the differences between both Americans and Europeans culture, something that Woody knows lot about. The English aristocracy is well reported and the north American rustic veins too, like ""ok, people, this is my first movie in Europe, so... something remains"", until the time Woody kills what has been reminiscent. That's my point of view.<br/><br/>BUT... the great part here is the insanity that gradually installs on each character's mind to a point that you know how it ends, but you don't know how it goes. You THINK you will know how the end will comes till you see that it's not the way you thought and again it's not the different way you're thinking again and this makes this romance thriller one of the best ones in years.<br/><br/>Woody's perfectionism is here, all the time, but it doesn't affect the final results like use to happen on his previous works, and that's a very good thing, making this movie something consistent, heavy and not something just meaning to be the mirror of his freakness."

","Going through the abundant and recently updated collection of my mother's DVDs, fighting to stave off boredom, passing the many titles I'd seen before and the ones I didn't want to see, I came across Match Point. I didn't know anything about it, but seeing that it had the endlessly sensual Scarlett I thought that even if the film itself was a loss I'd have something to watch. Oh, and the rundown on the back sounded interesting enough. I've only just discovered who the director is, and it's been quite some time since I've seen it. My painfully clear lack of attention to detail aside (and please don't take that as a reflection of my comments, it's there when it counts), I liked this film a lot. Well acted, well scripted, well shot and quite thought-provoking. The story is believable when it needs to be, the plot builds perfectly and the characters are real, well developed and likable. Rhys Meyers does brilliantly as a suitably self-confident prat (almost annoyingly so at times, which adds to his character's depth) and is great at conveying the fact that his character is cool and always in control, even when things start going to hell. If you didn't follow the actions and behaviour of his character from start to finish, you'd think he knows instinctively how to handle any situation and it's only through the ending that we're shown why, and what a great ending it is. Unexpected, definitely. Implausible, certainly, as some of the other comments have pointed out as a negative, but for me that just makes it better. Highly recommended."

","I watched Match Point on rental, I had always fancied seeing it but not enough to watch it in the cinema. All in all I thought the film was well below average, the principal reason is the dialogue which was terrible. I am English and live in London, I have rarely watched a film meant to be intelligent and thought provoking which used such predictable, clunking language. ""Let's go for a drink, I like it when you had had a drink because you were flirtatious"". It was as if Allen did not trust the viewer to discern the thoughts of any of the protagonists so instead made each character verbalise their every thought. The result was fake sounding dialogue and this rendered what might have been a good plot to almost an afterthought. Was this really the writer of Annie Hall? It was impossible to judge the performances of what might have been a fine cast with such a poor script. Spotting the cameos of several British actors and the languid sexuality of Scarlett Johansson were pretty much the only highlights. London was beautifully filmed at times, but why did Rhys Meyer's character have to have an office in the Gherkin? There are other buildings in London. And finally, the only thought that the film provoked was attractive vain men should not attempt to have their cake and eat it: hardly ground breaking. Poor."

Portraying English former tennis star Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) developing a relationship with American femme fatale Nola Rice (Scarlett Johansson), Allen really plays with the audience. You see, there's always the issue of chance out there. And boy does Allen know what to do with that! All in all, this is one of Allen's most interesting movies in years. He does much better when not focusing on neurotic rich New Yorkers (this one takes place in London). A real treat for everyone. Also starring Brian Cox and Penelope Wilton."

"adamwhite","4","2","4","20 April 2006"," More Woody Allen ""Classturbation""
","I find it sad that audiences and critics feel compelled to blow so much sunshine up Woody Allen's you-know-what just because he finally made another even watchable film. The utter mediocrity of his last dozen or so movies is no reason to trumpet the release of Match Point, a film that is at best bearable and probably most accurately described as, well... pointless.<br/><br/>Even a return to more fundamental narrative style doesn't prevent huge doses of classic Woody Allen ""classturbation,"" in which lavish settings and the details of an exorbitant lifestyle become characters as important as any of the ones embodied by the actors. Bryan Cox's character seems to be drowning in his own affluence in just about every scene; it is downright painful how many times he mutters the same line, ""You know you two will never have to worry about money"" to his daughter and son-in-law. Cox's performance seeks to reinforce Allen's cinematic credo, which his own personal roles usually spend countless scenes belaboring: no amount of personal or financial success can ease the basic human restlessness and discomfort within all of us.<br/><br/>Match Point, however, disembarks from the usual Allen blueprint of disjointed, exhaustively expositional dialog-driven scenes in favor of a more plot-driven narrative. But with such a simplistic plot, bereft of complexity and subtext, this isn't even necessarily a positive departure for the filmmaker. The slow buildup of tension within the second act is the closest this story gets to engaging its audience, before a twist at the second act climax that sends the tale spinning off beyond unbelievability into downright absurdity. Any value that Allen derives from his little third act twist-within-a-twist (involving use of a metaphorical ""net ball"" in tennis) is promptly squashed by more heavy-handed expositional dialog between his too-dim-to-believe police investigators. It is as if Allen himself grew too excited by his newly rediscovered skill with more conventional narrative, and lost sight of how subtlety fits into that equation.<br/><br/>If anything, the commercial and critical success of Match Point will hopefully encourage Woody Allen to pursue a disciplined approach to his storytelling in the future. But that is not a good enough reason to sing the praises of such a lackluster effort as this."
"kstephens","8","2","4","31 March 2006"," Woody Allen's Surefooted Noir
","Some delightful things are happening in Woody Allen's new movie and, even though there are points of similarity with previous films in the septuagenarian's filmography, this is a red-blooded, raw, and--yes--refreshing addition to his cannon.<br/><br/>It was always questionable whether Allen's blend of comedy and drama (even tragedy) was effective or legitimate in a filmic sense. He did great WOODY ALLEN movies, didn't he? And no one was particularly dazzled by the ambitious filmmaker's sleight of hand. His ""thesis"" was never accepted by the filmgoing public as completely valid...even early in his career, starting with the Bergman pastische, INTERIORS, in 1977; the desire of the director to wear masks and disguise his work or dress it up were always--at once--recognized as posing. Eventually, the hallmark dramedy of Allen's peculiar variety became all his own. This was best exemplified by 1989's CRIMES & MISDEMEANORS, where the balance was, in fact, perfect, and Allen's weighty moralizing was leavened with fey one-liners and sight gags.<br/><br/>Which brings us to MATCH POINT. This is Allen's most confident and controlled direction since (at least)1999's SWEET AND LOWDOWN and, like its closest cousin, CRIMES & MISDEMEANORS, MATCH POINT again asks whether morality and human desire are acquaintances....or complete strangers.<br/><br/>Allen's first grace note is placing the story in modern London, and cinephiles cannot help but remember that Hitchcock, in the twilight of his career, returned to London for the salacious murder-mystery of FRENZY. The analogy is apt since Allen firmly inhabits the other Master's realm of suspense, leaving the viewer to wonder if Allen's best amalgam of comedy and tragedy resides here... in a resurrected brand of film noir: both highly artificial and heightened in its store of cinematic effects. There are also echoes of Patricia Highsmith (Hitch's collaborator on STRANGERS ON A TRAIN), particularly in the chance meeting of two attractive young men, the motif of tennis (Hitchcock again), and in Chris Wilton's dark, rather Ripley-like anti-hero (Highsmith).<br/><br/>Allen's second success is in the writing and casting of Chris Wilton: a vain, selfish, greedy, and overly-ambitious young man (just as those great 1960's and '70's film anti-heroes used to be!) played with surly abandon by a post-Elvis Jonathan Rhys Meyers. His work is engaging and spirited, and there's an animal-like cunning there reminiscent of a young Malcolm McDowell. Because Allen makes Wilton our protagonist and point of identification, we have no choice but to root for one of the coldest users to come our way since Highsmith's Ripley. This is not pure noir since there is little redeeming in Chris, but the structure (no spoilers!) closely follows all the convolutions of a noir where our young, morally-compromised, ""hero"" gets himself into a mess, tries to extract himself, and gets in even deeper as a result. How Allen ends the film is one of the confident masterstrokes which makes MATCH POINT such an engaging entertainment. (I saw it in a crowded theater and the audible gasps of appreciation at its suspense were the highest compliment that can be paid a director.)<br/><br/>Along the way we have wonderful character performances by Emily Mortimer as the clueless fiancée, Brian Cox as the benevolent papa, and a pair of sterling comic performances by Ewen Bremner and James Nesbitt as the clever detectives. (Even Scarlett Johanssen provides the right notes in her portrayal of Nola.) It's all well-blended with the sort of location detail that enhanced many New York-based Allen movies, as well as a moody soundtrack soaring with the arias of Verdi. The dialogue, even spoken by British accents, doesn't entirely lose Allen's resonances, but this is a small complaint, and one of no great importance, in the tight unfolding of this suspenseful noir story.<br/><br/>This was the right movie for Allen to make at this point in his career. He comes to the material as both a film fan, and as a proved auteur, who can use reliable cinematic effects to create a true suspense highlight in a long and already-impressive filmography."
"valadas","6","2","4","23 March 2006"," Good movie weak story
","If you still remember Woody Allen's movies just forget it while watching this movie because it has nothing to do with his style or his favourite themata. We are thousands of miles away from a movie built along a series of witty, rich and vivid intellectual dialogues and monologues. We watch here only a serious psychological drama. It's doubtless a movie made with great mastery upon a weak and trite story. As a matter of fact we have already seen lots of movies and read lots of novels about the parvenu who climbs the social ladder by beginning to marry a tycoon's daughter and getting a good job in one of father-in-law's companies till his love affair with a woman out of his new acquired social ring comes to compromise everything, leading from a certain moment on to dangerous crossroads where dramatic choices must be quickly made. We remember for instance the excellent ""Room at the Top"" (1959) by Jack Clayton with Lawrence Harvey and Simone Signoret. In conclusion I think that although this is not a bad movie the story is too trivial for the genius of someone like Woody Allen to be wasted upon it."

It is one of the very best Allen has ever made, and that's saying a lot given the man's impressive record. It just kept me constantly on the edge of my seat, asking ""will he or won't he?"" at every turn, at every situation and every decision that the despicable character Chris Wilton had to face (and the terrible thing was that I'm pretty sure myself I would not be able to resist the temptation posed by Scarlett Johansson's ravishing beauty, so I couldn't help but empathize with his predicament a bit...). And the ending. Oh my God. What an ending. I didn't see that coming and it was fantastically clever. The film really drove the (very real) point home of how luck plays such a part in everybody's lives... <br/><br/>The only weak link in this masterpiece was Jonathan Rhys Meyers's performance; I found him flat and at times not quite believable in his delivery. My girlfriend suggested that this might be due to his efforts not to speak with his Irish accent, and it might be true, for he speaks with an English accent (which is weird, because his character is supposed to be Irish!). This minor glitch is what reduces my grade for the movie to a 9 instead of a perfect 10, but it is minor enough for me to still consider it a masterpiece and recommend it wholeheartedly to everyone."

","I'm amazed at how much hate this movie has inspired from people. If I had to guess, I'd say it's from either a. Too high of expectations or b. It's becoming hip to say that Woody Allen is over the hill. While Allen's films haven't been as strong the last few years, its ridiculous to think that he's lost it, and if you want proof check out Sweet and Lowdown or Melinda and Melinda. That said, to those still willing to give the Woodman the benefit of a doubt, Match Point is his absolute best in years, probably his overall strongest movie since that masterpiece Crimes and Misdemeanors (Or at least since Bullets Over Broadway). The plot concerns a young former tennis player who manages to slink his way into a very wealthy British family, getting himself a cushy job, a beautiful wife, and a lavish lifestyle to boot. Despite the fact that he's achieved so much, the young man gets bored quickly, and for more excitement he enters into an affair with his brother-in-law's former fiancé. Things quickly go wrong though, and soon the man's comfortable and secure lifestyle is thrown into jeopardy. In the hands of another director, this may have turned into another Fatal Attraction ripoff. Woody is too mature a filmmaker for that type of thing. Revisiting themes from Crimes and Misdemeanors, Woody again examines how one who has achieved an ideal lifestyle will react to the threat of losing it all, even resorting to murder. Allen also takes it one step further, by examining just how much luck determines our fate in life. Overall, a great film with wonderful performances all around. Just be careful not to come into it with the wrong attitude, or you may end up like some of the other posters on this site."

She falls deeply for him, and he kind of does for her until he meets Tom's fiancée, Nola (Scarlett Johansson), with whom he becomes obsessed. He eventually marries Chloe anyway, but goes on a reckless path that will take him down a more tragic hole than he ever imagined.<br/><br/>This London-set Woody Allen thriller --- woah, woah woah, wait a second. Woody Allen thriller?! A Woody Allen film set in London?! The world must be coming to an end.<br/><br/>Of course, I didn't laugh all that often during his films anyway, but I digress.<br/><br/>Actually, it's a cold, dark, realistic, slowly-paced (a little too slow) character drama that turns into a heck of a thriller in the last third. For the first part, Allen keeps the relationships utterly believable. Never once does the film get soap opera-ish, melodramatic, or less than three-dimensional. And because of the total realism and the passions the characters show, it's involving in spite of its cold harshness. Rhys-Meyers and Johannson are both superb, perfectly showing ever facet of their characters and completely disappearing into them. The supporting cast does the same.<br/><br/>And then, it twists into an absolutely riviting, heart-pounding thriller. Allen the writer gives Allen the director something to play with, and he does it brilliantly. The climactic scene is one of the most intense moments ever filmed in spite of how low-key it is. It's really stunning.<br/><br/>And both parts --- the drama and the thriller --- are a series of emotional punches to both the head and the heart. In short, in spite of the film's flaws (primarily it's slightly too-slow pace), it's a truly excellent film.<br/><br/>And, now that I've praised it like nothing else, I'm going to tell you that you probably don't want to watch it.<br/><br/>Why? Because it really is a slow, realistic, super-art house flick. If it isn't your kind of film, stay away. It's only kind of my sort of film, and I really liked it, but I'm more open to this kind of film than most people.<br/><br/>And, because it's one of those films where the point is that there is no point in life, it's completely unsatisfying unless you are totally cynical.<br/><br/>(Now, from Allen's worldview, that's a totally logical conclusion. I don't agree, but we the world very differently, and this shows that he's very observant about the way the world works.) And Woody Allen fans won't like it, at least not if they're expecting an Allen film. It's dead serious. There's practically no humor whatsoever (appropriately).<br/><br/>So, anyway, it's an excellent movie that, chances are, you do not want to see. But if you like deadly-serious films that take a lot of patience and effort to watch but reward that patience with powerful emotional responses and stomach-churning suspense, you should love it.<br/><br/>As for the other 99.9% of you out there, run, don't walk, in the opposite direction from the film. You will fall asleep, miss the good parts, and your snoring will create enemies out of everyone else in the theater.<br/><br/>Both of them."

And perhaps if I hadn't just recently seen an episode of ""Monk"" in which an almost identical plot is enacted (with slightly different results), I would have enjoyed it more. As it was, with Brian Cox and Scarlett Johannsen, two actors I enjoy immensely, and my favorite director, and tremendous reviews, I had very high hopes. They were dashed.<br/><br/>The movie starts well but all in all it is a rehash of Crimes with younger people, and very derivative of today's crop of mystery and forensic TV shows. In fact, having been primed by the likes of CSI to believe that police are godlike in their ability to detect things like the pregnancy of a cadaver, the ineptitude of the police in this movie is a little jarring.<br/><br/>All in all, not up to my expectations. I think The Talented Mr. Ripley is a far better movie about essentially the same thing. And Crimes and Misdemeanors is a more believable Woody Allen movie about essentially the same thing."

","Something of a turning point in the career of the director perhaps. After being ignored in his home country for many years, this new film by Woody Allen is already (on release in Britain) nominated at the Golden Globes for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay and Best Actress (Scarlett Johansson).<br/><br/>It's a big change for Allen. Gone is the familiar Manhattan skyline, Allan doesn't appear once, there are none of his stuttering lines, NY is exchanged for London's South Bank, and the even the comedy is very between the lines, with nods to Dostoevsky and La Traviata.<br/><br/>Jonathan Rhys-Meyers plays an ex tennis star now making a living as a coach at an exclusive club. There he becomes friends with wealthy socialite Tom and ends up marrying Tom's sister (played by the lovely Emily Mortimer). Except he has become smitten with Tom's fiancé, played by Scarlett Johansson, a failing American actress. Helped into the English upper classes, he is loathe to relinquish his lifestyle, even when he becomes bored with his wife. This is comedy in the Shakespearean sense, the whole story revolving around the importance of luck, yet it soon escalates into equally compelling tragedy.<br/><br/>There are few recognisable Woody Allen characteristics - possibly the author's detachment from his subject matter - and he makes the mistake of letting one of the characters call her father 'Papa' (which I doubt if anyone in the English upper classes does these days) - but it does not quite descend to the out-and-out thriller we might have anticipated from the trailer. It retains its aloofness to become a meditation on the importance luck plays in the lives of everyone and whether it is more important to be 'lucky' than 'good.' The sexual eroticism - between Jonathan Rhys-Meyers and Scarlett Johansson (who turns in yet another outstanding performance)- is unusual for Allen but, like the ensuing violence, is never allowed to detract from the cerebral content. It's a thought provoking study, but the question it poses is not exactly earth shattering."

Chris joins a London club as a tennis coach and soon makes friends with Tom Hewett (Matthew Goode), the son of a wealthy businessman Alec Hewett (Brian Cox) who he coaches. It takes him no time to enter the Hewett inner circle through the heart of Chloe (Emily Mortimer), Tom's sister, who falls for his charms easily.

Though Nola initially resists, she gives in to Chris when he promises to break away from Chloe. The problem with that is that Chris will have to sacrifice his life of plenty, comfort and success, a price that he isn't ready to pay yet. To compound the situation further, Nola announces that she is pregnant and becomes insistent about Chris getting out of his marriage.

The film walks a tightrope throughout, with a sword hanging over the veil of the many secrets that Chris harbours, taking Match Point to an almost nail biting finale, quite analogous to the excitement associated with the title in a tennis match. Jonathan Rhys Meyers is suave, smooth, composed and cool, and in contrast, Scarlett Johansson is raw and volatile. Emily Mortimer supports well.

","One reason for the fascination of Woody Allen's ""Match Point"" is that each and every character is rotten. This is a thriller not about good versus evil, but about various species of evil engaged in a struggle for survival of the fittest -- or, as the movie makes clear, the luckiest. ""I'd rather be lucky than good,"" Chris, the tennis pro from Ireland, tells us as the movie opens, and we see a tennis ball striking the net - it is pure luck which side it falls on. Chris' own good fortune depends on just such a lucky toss of a coin.<br/><br/>The movie, Allen's best since ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" (1989), involves a rich British family and two outsiders who hope to enter it by using their sex appeal. They are the two sexiest people in the movie -- their bad luck, since they are more attracted to each other than to their targets in the family. Still, as someone once said (Robert Heinlein if you must know), money is a powerful aphrodisiac. He added however, ""flowers work almost as well."" Not in this movie, they don't.<br/><br/>The movie stars Jonathan Rhys-Meyers as Chris, a poor boy from Ireland who was on the tennis tour and now works in London as a club pro. He meets rich young Tom (Matthew Goode), who takes a lesson, likes him, and invites him to attend the opera with his family. During the opera, Tom's sister Chloe (Emily Mortimer) looks at Chris once with interest and the second time with desire. Chris does not need to have anything explained to him.<br/><br/>Tom's own girlfriend is Nola (Scarlett Johansson), an American who hopes to become an actress or Tom's wife, not in that order. Tom and Chloe are the children of Alec and Eleanor Hewett (Brian Cox and Penelope Wilton), who have serious money, as symbolized by the country house where the crowd assembles for the weekend. It's big enough to welcome two Merchant-Ivory productions at the same time.<br/><br/>Chloe likes Chris. She wants Chris. Her parents want Chloe to have what she wants. Alec offers Chris a job in ""one of my companies"" -- always a nice touch, that. Tom likes Nola, but to what degree, and do his parents approve? All is decided in the fullness of time, and now I am going to become maddeningly vague in order not to spoil the movie's twists and turns, which are ingenious and difficult to anticipate.<br/><br/>Let us talk instead in terms of the underlying philosophical issues. To what degree are we prepared to set aside our moral qualms in order to indulge in greed and selfishness? I have just finished re-reading The Wings of the Dove, by Henry James, in which a young man struggles heroically with just such a question. He is in love with a young woman he cannot afford to marry, and a rich young heiress is under the impression he is in love with her. The heiress is dying. Everyone advises him he would do her a great favor by marrying her, and after her death, inheriting her wealth, he could afford to marry the woman he loves. But isn't this unethical? No one has such moral qualms in Allen's film, not even sweet Chloe, who essentially has her daddy buy Chris for her. The key question facing the major players is: Greed, or lust? How tiresome to have to choose.<br/><br/>Without saying why, let me say that fear also enters into the equation. In a moral universe, it would be joined by guilt, but not here. The fear is that in trying to satisfy both greed and lust, a character may have to lose both, which would be a great inconvenience. At one point this character sees a ghost, but this is not Hamlet's father, crying for revenge; this ghost drops by to discuss loopholes in a ""perfect crime.""<br/><br/>When ""Match Point"" premiered at Cannes last May, the critics agreed it was ""not a typical Woody Allen film."" This assumes there is such a thing. Allen has worked in a broad range of genres and has struck a lot of different notes, although often he uses a Woody Figure (preferably played by himself) as the hero. ""Match Point"" contains no one like Woody Allen; is his first film set in London; is constructed with a devious clockwork plot that would distinguish a film noir, and causes us to identify with some bad people. In an early scene, a character is reading Crime and Punishment, and during the movie, as during the novel, we are inside the character's thoughts.<br/><br/>The movie is more about plot and moral vacancy than about characters, and so Allen uses type-casting to quickly establish the characters and set them to their tasks of seduction, deception, lying and worse. Meyers has a face that can express crafty desire, which is not pure lust but more like lust transformed by quick strategic calculations. Matthew Goode, as his rich friend, is clueless almost as an occupation. Emily Mortimer plays a character incapable of questioning her own happiness, no matter how miserable it should make her. Scarlett Johansson's visiting American has been around the block a few times, but like all those poor American girls in Henry James, she is helpless when the Brits go to work on her. She has some good dialogue in the process.<br/><br/>""Men think I may be something special,"" she tells Chris.<br/><br/>""Are you?""<br/><br/>""No one's ever asked for their money back.""<br/><br/>""Match Point,"" which deserves to be ranked with Allen's ""Annie Hall,"" ""Hannah and Her Sisters,"" ""Manhattan,"" ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" and ""Everyone Says I Love You,"" has a terrible fascination that lasts all the way through. We can see a little way ahead, we can anticipate some of the mistakes and hazards, but the movie is too clever for us, too cynical. We expect the kinds of compromises and patented endings that most thrillers provide, and this one goes right to the wall. There are cops hanging around trying to figure out what, if anything, anyone in the movie might have been up to, but they're too smart and logical to figure this one out. Bad luck."
"maurice_yacowar","10","0","0","16 May 2020"," Crime and Punishment ironies played out in a wealthy British family
","There's an elegant irony at the heart of Match Point. As hero Chris Wilton early avers: ""The man who said 'I'd rather be lucky than good' saw deeply into life. People are afraid to face how great a part of life is dependent on luck. It's scary to think so much is out of one's control. There are moments in a match when the ball hits the top of the net, and for a split second, it can either go forward or fall back. With a little luck, it goes forward, and you win. Or maybe it doesn't, and you lose. ""
The opening focuses on the net at the center of a tennis game. We don't see the players, just the net and the traversing slo-mo ball. Illustrating the point, the ball hits the net, pops into the air and then falls - short. That player has lost - but the other one won. One player's bad luck is the other's good.
The net shot returns in the ping pong scene where Chris meets femme fatale Nola, the seductive fiancee of Chris's new best friend and future brother-in-law. Aggressive Chris plays weak but slams back her tentative serve. That prefigures the end of their relationship.
This Chris does not wilt. The irrational doomed Nola also has a telling name: It's 'alone' spelled backwards, as a tennis game volley invites.
The climactic irony has Wilton throwing into the Thames the jewelry he stole in the cover-up murder of Nola's neighbour. The last item, a ring, arcs toward the river but lands on the concrete wall. It hops into the air and then falls - short. When the police summon Wilton for an interview, alerted by her tell-all diary, we assume the ring will prove his undoing. Instead it saves him. The man who found it is caught committing a similar drug-theft so has Wilton's crimes hung on him too. The lucky find proves doom. The unlucky toss proves fortunate.
As a serious observer of life and art Woody Allen knows better than to believe and promulgate sentimental conventions. The overriding irrationality of life hardly guarantees justice (other than poetic) or satisfaction. So his characters can get away with murder, here as in Crimes and Misdemeanours if not in the more exuberantly generic Manhattan Murder Mystery.
Of course the title has a double point. It's not just about a tennis match but about the social order concentrated in the romantic match or marriage (one chooses). Chris and Nola meet in a supercharged erotic connection. But they are also players in that marriage game, ostensibly bound by its conventions.
Auteur Allen is not bound by genre conventions. His wealthy family is warm, cultured, generous. His tennis pro Wilton reads Dostoevsky (and a book about Dostoevsky) and is an opera enthusiast. Allen fills his tennis story with opera segments, dissolving the bounds of the genre.
But even in that welcoming world our central heroes - well or ill-matched - both are ambitious classless arriviste, the Irish tennis coach and the American actress. Both are bent upon marrying into their respective fortunes. Nola's engagement crumbles. But Chris's marriage thrives until their resurrected romance blossoms into the fatal pregnancy. Romantic matching is also a game, played by the rich and privileged, with the winner and the loser often distinguished only by the arc of accident."
"andrewbunney","10","0","0","13 May 2020"," Leads us up the garden path with twists and a cheeky resolution
","This is veteran auteur, Woody Allen's thirty-somethingth annual film. Famous for early comic masterpieces such as 'The Sleeper', 'Bananas', 'Annie Hall' and 'Manhattan', his career suffered a setback around the 1990s when he became tainted with allegations of sexual misconduct. This coincided with the release of several weaker films and his box-offices dropped through the floor. More recently though, films such as 'The Curse of the Jade Scorpion' have resurrected Allen's reputation and 'Match Point' builds on this.<br/><br/>Notably, 'Match Point' is not set in Allen's beloved New York City, and nor does the writer-director appear in this movie. The film takes place in present day London (England) and centres on a young professional tennis player, Chris (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), who retires from the circuit to broaden his life, initially seeking employment as an instructor at an exclusive tennis club.<br/><br/>He soon falls in with an upper class family who provide him with romance, fine food and access to the opera; 'wine, women and song'. He is then at the manor, practising his shootin' ahead of the grouse season and becomes a highly-paid and chauffeured executive in the family business. But their smitten daughter, Chloe (Emily Mortimer), is a little cloying for Chris who has eyes for the son's fiancée, Nola (Scarlett Johansson).<br/><br/>The premise is that some people have good luck, as when a tennis ball hits the top of the net and goes over, or doesn't. Just how lucky Chris can be is the story Allen spins, making the upper-class characters decent and his 'working-class hero' almost amoral.<br/><br/>Allen has the power to command the world's best actors and the women are perfectly cast to deliver the characters he needs for this perverse fable. Scarlett Johansson plays a struggling American actor and Penelope Wilton is brilliant as the family's matriarch. The blokes, Rhys Meyers, Matthew Goode and Brian Cox are fine, too. These are great actors, superbly directed.<br/><br/>Allen exploits our prejudices to lead us up the garden path with playful wit, although not outright comedy, and this film is most reminiscent of his superb 'Crimes and Misdemeanours'. The twists and cheeky resolution are novel enough to reassure us that Woody Allen at seventy years of age still has plenty to offer in the area of entertainment."

Criticized in some circles for its lack of ""English authenticity"" (the plot was originally intended to take place among the elite in the Hamptons), but this is a universal tale for most Western cultures, dovetailing its opening statement on the fickle impact of luck towards the end in a nicely surprising way. Makes good use of Meyers' typical detached blandness to expose moral degradation in the face of selfish compulsions, and even if the characters are sometimes shallowly observed, they find themselves at the service of the efficient machinery of a plot that resists idiosyncrasy.

","Within the vast film production of Woody Allen, the film ""Match Point"" is a benchmark for several reasons: It is the beginning of ""the Scarlett era"", who will star in a total of 3 films, ""Scoop"" and ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"". It is the 1st. movie shot entirely outside of New York and with British actors. It is also his first drama since 1988 ""Another Woman""
Very intelligent and well told story about opportunities, morality, desire and life decisions, 'constant' ""Allenians"" that summarize his key theme: Love and Death. The title of the film and the first shot warns us about the important 'variables' of life, on the one hand Match Point = Deciding Point and on the other hand, the ""luck"" which will define if the ball, when hitting the edge of the net, falls in your favor or against you.
Allen begins his romantic drama with a simple story of a casual encounter that will have to be complicated as the personalities and connections between their very well delineated characters develop, relationships that influence the decision and determine their choice of life. Through an elaborate script with great phrases, as well as citations and literary and operatic references, Allen strengthens his story and then we listen: Who is my next victim? Chloe asks playing ping pong. Strindberg and Dostoyefski refer to the ""morality"" of the events depicted in the film, ""A Furtive Tear"", the Italian Aria with which the film begins and closes, is a poor peasant singing to his beloved a wealthy landowner.
With a growing pace the plot has become increasingly distressing and more pressing, so there is no choice but to play the game and end the suspense, strategies are raised and the game progresses, finally Chris throws the incriminating ring and this one hits the edge of the fence of the River Thames, an image that refers us to the beginning of the film, a fact that will define the winner of the Match Point.
""I don't care if he's great. I just hope he is lucky"" Tom says at the end about his newborn nephew.

Beautiful cinematography-really stunning indoors and out, on top of which there's an engrossing plot that forgives some mediocre acting. These characters were fun to watch, especially slightly awkward Chloe and her slightly pompous brother who seemed natural in their upper crust roles. Mummy and father were also good. The tennis pro Chris and struggling actress from America Nola were my least favorite-not just the characters but the acting as well.

The main character Chris Wilton (played by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) is an ex-tennis pro wash-out turned tennis instructor. He is an American who is not from the same socioeconomic background of his clients, but blends in quite nicely with his sophistication and charm. Tom (played by Matthew Goode) is a wealthy student of Wilton who quickly becomes a friend sharing a common love: Opera. The relationship of the two men makes a brief head fake towards homo-sexuality before Tom's sister Chloe (played by Emily Mortimer) is introduced to Chris. She has her eyes set on him from the very start. Chloe invites Chris to the mansion for a gathering and the two take a swift liking towards each other.<br/><br/>While at the estate Chris stumbles upon Nola. Nola is played by Scarlett Johansson who does a stand-out performance. She is a sexy seductive American struggling actress who unexpectedly is the fiancé of Tom. Chris and Nola have immediate unspoken magnetic attraction towards each other portrayed nicely through their lustful eye contact. Later, a family feud sends angry Nora out on a walk alone which doesn't go unnoticed by Chris. He runs quickly after Nora, once he reaches her he makes the risky choice to kiss her which results in a steamy sex encounter in the pouring rain. Great scene, but could have been a little longer and more explicit given the excitement it creates.<br/><br/>Despite his attraction towards Nola, Chris continues his relationship with Chloe by default because Nola refuses to risk her engagement to Tom. This finally results in a marriage to Chloe based primarily on money and career advancement for Chris made possible through Chloe's family business connections. Chloe wants children with Chris right away and tries relentlessly to get pregnant. However, Chris wants no part of this with thoughts of Nora clouding his mind. When Chris surprisingly learns of the break up of Tom and Nola, he obsessively pursues Nora. Initially Nora is reluctant to oblige Chris's advances, but he breaks her protective wall and she neurotically falls in love with him. Chris eventually is confused about his feelings for Nola trying to define love or lust. While Chris continues the precarious lustful affair with Nola the impermissible happens: she gets pregnant. This is where the drama turns to thriller and gets the adrenaline pumping. How far will Chris go to protect his new found family, stability, money and power? Will he experience his own self proclaimed ""stroke of luck""?<br/><br/>This story line is easy to relate to on a personal level because of the choices we make in relationships/marriages, ultimately for the wrong reasons.... and how greener the grass always looks on the other side. I could identify with the emotions the characters went through when dealing with love, lust, and money. Which one should be the most important to us? Love is the easiest answer, but lust and money can lure the best of us down a regrettable path. We learn that having too much of one without the balance of the others can be devastating for our peace of mind and over all contentment.<br/><br/>The movie makes you crave a happy romantic ending but your instincts tell you otherwise.

Say again, it's a good movie, but I expected much more."

","Say what you want about Woody Allen, the guy makes some good films. He makes some bad films too. Heck, he's made a movie every year for the last four decades, there's bound to be one or two stinkers in there. But Match Point, for my money, is his best yet.<br/><br/>It's just so different. It is his most different work from anything else he has done and, unlike his other films, it is not immediately identifiable as A Woody Allen film, if not for his name in the credits. That's a good thing by the way. Different is good.<br/><br/>But moreover, it's different from anything I've ever seen before or since. Not so different that it feels TOO different. It's still very fun, unpredictable, and keeps you on the edge of your seat right up until the end, and then sends you home with a an ear-to-ear grin on your face. See it if you haven't yet. Tell your friends to see it. It's very good."

","Just finished watching this, and the plot gripped me all the way through from beginning to end. Sure there were things to dislike, the not-always accurate British accents, the at-times cheesy dialogue, with slightly too long stares into nothingness, but so much more to like! Matthew Goode and Emily Mortimer play very believable upper-class English characters, and the dialogue flows so naturally, you'd believe you were sitting right in the room with them and their family, listening to their conversations.<br/><br/>In my opinion Woody Allen does a great job in making use of the theme of luck, mixed in with some tennis, offering a surprising twist at the end that might have you reconsidering the effect of luck on your own life afterwards. Despite a few minor flaws, a very enjoyable watch!

","This movie has many brilliant moments and ideas. But I think the best part of the movie is the first hour and 15 minutes. The romance of the first 90 minutes paved the way for what would be a violent and thrilling second half. Woody Allen shines in romance and storytelling, but that's also why I didn't find the last 30-40 minutes to be that compelling. When I saw that this movie was considered a 'Crime-Drama-Thriller' movie I got excited. Those are my favorite movies. But in reality its much more a 'Romance-Drama' than anything else. There is barely any crime, and you don't see much of it on screen. I almost wish Allen stuck with his guts and brought the story a different way and kept it in his Romance wheelhouse. Nevertheless, as any other Allen movie, it has great characters. And characters that you don't particular care to root for. That's always been one thing Woody Allen does best. He makes movies with humanized characters and that are very relatable to modern day problems going on with relationships. 'Vicky Christina Barcelona' and 'Blue Jasmine' are perfect examples of that. With 'Match Point' you don't know who to root for. In fact, I particularly liked Emily Mortimer's character much more than Scarlett Johansson's. Even the title character is quite annoying at times. But overall the film as a whole is very good. It's a really solid drama that could have been brilliant as a whole if the last 40 minutes could have stayed within the mood of the first 90 minutes. Still a very enjoyable movie. 7.8/10"

","As a Londoner, I was very pleased to see what Woody Allen did with my city - he made it look as good as he has made New York look in numerous previous movies. Small corners of Holland Park which not many people know, as well as the fabulous new buildings in the City, all made it look like a good place to be. The film was unexpected and thoroughly absorbing, and when events took a dark turn, I was gripped. It was impossible to predict the outcome and the unexpectedness of it made this very different from a typical predictable drama about relationships. I was impressed by Woody Allen's ability to produce such a different type of film and although it wasn't what I expected, I enjoyed it. Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Scarlett Johansson were excellent - I believed that they were going through those emotions. The main thing that convinced me that this was a Woody Allen movie was the dialogue - his ability to make characters say things that real people might say, but also in a different way - more revealing than most scripts and clever with words. Definitely worth seeing."

","Match Point is set in London, England and is about a young man named Chris Wilton who is a tennis pro and now teaches others how to play tennis. Chris's friend Tom introduces him to his sister Chloe and they hit it off and are soon to be married. Chris also meets Tom's girlfriend named Nola who Chris instantly feels attracted to. Tom and Nola break up and Chris gets married to Chloe, but Chris starts to see more and more of Nola until they begin a rather serious affair. Soon, Nola wants Chris to live with her and dump Chloe, but Chris will not do it and Nola threatens to if Chris won't. This complicates matters leaving Chris having to decide between the two women and choose what to do. Winner of The David Award for Best European Film for writer/director Woody Allen at The David di Donatello Awards and The Goya Award for Best European Film at The Goya Awards. Match Point has good direction, a good script, good performances by the entire cast and good cinematography. Even though Match Point is written and directed by Woody Allen it is nothing at all like his other films. This is not a comedy and is instead more of a drama/thriller. Also instead of being filmed in New York like most of his movies are this one was filmed in England. This is one smart and crafty story of love and an affair that goes way out of control. I liked the film's dialog and the characters were all very well played by the actors who played them and I also thought that they were very well written. This is one film were there are many important characters and elements to the script and each are written in here for a purpose and the film plays out very well. I liked the thriller style of the movie that presented itself in a classy kind of way that old thrillers from the 30's or 40's would have and I thought the movie's pace was good and the more the film went on the more curious I became of what would happen next and I was thoroughly enjoying myself at this film and I was not disappointed by the time it was over. This is one classy and smart movie that really stands out for it's writing, direction and acting. I have always been a fan of Woody Allen and his films and I understand that some people just don't care for his usual comedies. This is unlike any Woody Allen movie he has done before and it really stands out from the others and as much as I like his comedies I think that he has done a great job at doing a thriller and you do not have to be a Woody Allen fan to enjoy this movie. One of the most intriguing, smart and classy films of 2005. I heavily recommend it."

","I went to the cineplex, bought a ticket for a movie and then realized that I was too early for its start. With about 30 minutes to kill, I went into see the start of ""Matchpoint"". I knew it was a Woody Allen movie and while I don't hate Woody Allen, I'm not a die-hard fan either. I prefer his early comedies, and I tend to rent his movies on DVD when nothing else seems good. So, by watching the start, I thought I'd get a sense of the movie to decide whether it would be a later rental. I looked at my watch as the 30 minute mark ticked by and decided to stay for the rest of ""Matchpoint"". The other movie will get the financial credit from my ticket purchase, but Woody Allen gets the artistic credit. ""Matchpoint"" is good, but disturbing. After watching it, and as I walked out of the cinema, I was almost angry with myself for having stayed. It's too disturbing.<br/><br/>The script was originally written for Long Island but then it got transferred to London. In my view, this makes for a better movie. The cold phlegmatism of class-obsessed England gives a critical twist to the story. True, this opens the movie to the expected quibbles about accents, origins, habits, expressions, country houses and so on. In a sense, the Brits who make such criticisms are just proving the truth of the film's context. The script has also been compared to ""Crimes and Misdemeanours"". In my opinion, the characters in ""Crimes and Misdemeanours"" openly reflected on their actions. In ""Matchpoint"", any reflection is much, much more subtle. This is Dostoievski territory.<br/><br/>Truth be told, Woody Allen on a bad day is better than most filmmakers on their best days. In ""Matchpoint"", you are in the hands of a master. Since ""Matchpoint"" puts an American character into a British setting, I suggest that you compare it with ""Notting Hill"" or ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" or even ""Wimbledon"". Woody Allen puts them all to shame, but in a very disturbing way."

","Can't understand why some critics don't think very much of Woody Allen's ""Melinda and Melinda"" (2004), which is a pretty decent piece of work compared with, say, his Narcissistic ""Hollywood ending"" (2002). It has been generally agreed though that ""Match point"", sans his characteristic witty comedy and nerdish characters, is Allen's best work in the last little while. And even after the ""surgery"", this is still very much Woody Allen as you'll feel at home with the familiar social stratum which is simply transported from New York to London.<br/><br/>The plot setup is actually quite simple, structured basically on two deprived people's interaction with a privileged London family, through the siblings Tom and Chloe. Struggling American actress-to-be Nola, from a deprived family with its fair share of alcohol and drug history, met Tom six month ago and the two lost no time in getting engaged. Competent tennis pro Chris from a poor Irish family, through coaching Tom, meets Chloe and they too have their love flame ignited, so to speak.<br/><br/>But here ends the symmetry. While Chris is embraced by the parents and groomed for the family business, Nola is frowned on (particularly by the mother) as she blows audition after audition. As the gripping plot develops, the focus zeroes in on a triangle involving Chloe, Chris and Nola. Through the lucid direction and absorbing script, the audience is taken on an engaging trip towards a dark destination. The ending is deviously clever, a wicked tease that twists and turns, wisely shunning poetic justice for a realistically cynical view that is consistent with the real, sardonic Woody Allen behind the persona of the comical nerd.<br/><br/>Jonathan Rhys Meyers plays beautifully Chris, a complex character that is never fully explained. That he reads Dostoevsky's ""Crime and punishment"" and loves the opera hints. That he openly acknowledges that he is not competitive but he wants to ""make a contribution"" hints. Most revealing, however, is the comparison of his first encounters with the two women, Chloe and Nola. That contrast is most revealing.<br/><br/>Scarlett Johansson playing femme fatale Nola will make you sit up and take note. None of the subtleties of her former roles such as in ""Girl with a pearl earring"" or ""Lost in translation"" here, but earthy and fiery, both.<br/><br/>With neither the innocence in ""Young Adam"" nor the maturity in ""Dear Frankie"", Emily Mortimer tackles yet a different role here, all-goodness and often simple Chloe, brought up in a fairyland and never exposed to the harsh reality of the ugliness of human nature.<br/><br/>These three key players give Allen the performances he deserves for the brilliant script and direction. A good supporting cast (particularly Brian Cox and Penelope Wilton, one of the ""Calendar girls"") completes the job of making this movie good to the last drop."
"ruisilva-1","9","0","0","27 April 2006"," Not your ""typical"" Woody Allen film!
","I just saw it last night, and boy (!) was I impressed. I'm a big fan of Woody's, but that in no part relates to my appreciation of this magnificent piece of film. The ""trademarks"" that make his films likable (or dislikable) are absent in this one: no jerky-poignant-mid-life-crisis-humour, even though it still (and always) relates to the conflicts of people, the struggle between doing ""the right thing"" and what we really want from life, the battle between love and lust. It could have been a cliché for all of this, but it's smart and refreshing instead. In fact, the only thing that gives it away early on (as a Woody Allen film) is probably the main title, as it is so ""woody-allenish""! It's a story that demands a certain commitment from the viewer. Anyway, you can't just drop into the story; you have to sit through it!<br/><br/>The story telling is terrific, and even though it seems slow at the beginning, it only seems that: the rhythm of the film is masterful, and there's always something going on, character and story wise. <br/><br/>The performances are delivered with accuracy. Especially the role of Rhys Meyers, who reminded me of Joaquin Phoenix in ""the Gladiator"": that same fiendish look in the eye, that cynical stance that gives him a predatory gait, as if he knew what was going to happen first hand. It's a guy whose ambition knows no bounds, yet has the brains to keep himself innocuous and small. The other anchor of the storyline is Scarlet, in her most daring role yet. She is the unwilling Femme Fatalle; she doesn't make things happen, but is instead a catalyst of the events that unfold (so ""anti-Catherine Tramell"").<br/><br/>One thing that I didn't find in character with Chris Wilton's (Meyers) attitude was that he always seemed (throughout the film) quite a cold, calculating guy, that would feel no more remorse for doing what he did that for ordering fried chicken at a vegetarian restaurant. At the end, the finale would have been perfect (IMO) if he had smiled. That simple gesture would show how he came to grips with his actions, as a character that never looks back. As it is, we feel like, somehow, he could be overcome with grief. But that's only speculation, of course.<br/><br/>The character point of view is so well defined, that you find yourself thinking like him, considering the ""necessary evil"". You can love him or hate him all you want, but it will never make you feel indifferent.<br/><br/>Even though there's a lot of morality involved, the script isn't cheap and cynical, and you get that at the very end. Woody might have gone for the moral approach, but he ditched it, and that's one of the many reasons why the film is plausible: sometimes the bad guys win and justice isn't always served! He's a truly Machiavellian character, struggling to remove every nuisance from his life on his path to glory. Fortitude is always at his side, from the little ironies to the people that stand around him. Reminds me of an illustration from the book in the ""the ninth gate"", in which there's a caption saying: ""virtue lies defeated"". It sure has in ""Match Point""; it's about doing the wrong thing to do the right thing.<br/><br/>9 out of 10!"

","I must agree with the smaller consensus in regards to some of the lavish praise that has been heaped onto this movie as being way overstated. My local paper's critic basically attributed this fact to it being Woody Allen's best in a little while, when his career has been in decline at least ten years. The fact that Allen had produced some kind of resonance within the film community at long last could have been the only reason audiences were on their feet at Cannes when it premiered, she went on to guess, and I must say I agree. Match Point is a very competent film, which does keep viewers pretty compelled throughout with it's involving story. For the first time though, I truly cannot see any trace of the writer/director in his script or direction. Obviously, Allen needed to do a little reinventing with his movies becoming more and more irrelevant in this modern age, but opting to basically sever his unique persona that has radiated everything I have seen by him was not the most assured decision of one of our most illustrious filmmakers. It will keep him in the limelight a little longer though."

","""Match Point"" moves fast. Everything happens so quickly that you miss it if you turn your head around. Even so, the movie's length is over two hours, and when you think an hour has gone by, only thirty minutes have passed. My grandmother said: ""They say it's not like Woody Allen's films but it has the eye of the genius"". She was right; Allen has created the most common plot line with the least common results.<br/><br/>Basing it slightly in something about a question of luck, the master places his game in Britain, particularly in London, precisely in the high class of the city. An Irish tennis instructor, former professional, called Chris Wilton (the growing talent Jonathan Rhys Meyers) requests to give classes in a tennis club. Soon he buys an apartment and meets Tom Hewett (a surprising Matthew Goode), and goes to an opera with his parents because they share the same passion.<br/><br/>This is when you wonder if Chris could have studied Tom and known what he liked, if he just sensed it or if he just had luck. Chris says at the beginning of the film: ""There's a time in a tennis match where the ball hits the top of the net and remains in mid air for a second. With a little luck, the ball goes over and you win; or it doesn't, and you loose"". That statement is presented later in the movie with many situations but specifically with one crucial moment.<br/><br/>Soon, again, Chris meets and starts dating Tom sister's Chloe (Emily Mortimer) and going to his parents' (flawless but limited Brian Cox and Penelope Wilton) country house, generating a good relationship with them. We get to know the main character (all of the characters) and we predict his ambitions and the place he wants to arrive. However, he is surrounded by people who play the game, know the rules and are aware of the consequences.<br/><br/>But there's always a weakness; in this case, it is Chris' very believable affection for Chloe. When Chloe's parents realize that they're both becoming close, they want to help him, even if he (very intelligently) didn't ask for it. Then Nola Rice, (each time better, Scarlett Johansson) Tom's fiancée appears, and meets while playing ping-pong when he tires to help her in a provocative way. ""Didn't they tell you that your game is aggressive?"", she asks him. ""Didn't they tell you that you have sexy lips?"", he responds.<br/><br/>Now Chris has done a lot to get where he is and knows that the only of screwing it up is by ""making a pass"" at her""; or so she tells him. The vocabulary and way of speaking used in every scene is admirable. In the line of what Patrick Marber did in ""Closer"" recently, but in a better way, Allen makes the character's seduction believable with his words. We believe it here, because we are allowed to be in their minds.<br/><br/>Then we sit and watch, patiently, and when we think we know the characters, actions take place and we can't believe what we were thinking. That's why Woody Allen's screenplay highlights more than his direction; that's why the screenplay is the high point: it astonishes. His direction, on the other hand shows the always great acting control and a camera that makes a long movement observing each scene it shoots.<br/><br/>The music is simply constituted by long or short or whole parts of famous Operas, which is as tragic as the tone of the story, editor Alisa Lepselter draws a lot of attention because of the rough cuts that definitely prove that Allen is not doing one of his last nice comedies. The central character does lots of things to cause an effect on people and to win them; but Chris Wilton is no Tom Ripley.<br/><br/>Ripley was a true genius, uninterested in what his decisions would cause to anyone; Wilton lies down with a manual about reading Dostoievski so he can impress an old man. Ripley didn't feel; Wilton is vulnerable, and doesn't own a mastermind: so he depends on luck. It could be enough, or not."
"marcin_kukuczka","8","0","0","23 April 2006"," Very well acted and directed drama that differs love from lust and conventions from honesty...
","What is the reason for complicating one's life if everything for happiness seems to be there? What is so hugely exciting in the lust that submitting to it may destroy friendship, love, stability, even the whole life? The answer seems to be the fact that emotions primarily win and reason usually seems to be doomed to lose. But is it so universal and fateful in all people's lives? <br/><br/>I started this review with such questions... Although they may seem sophisticated, they have their roots in the content of this movie, written and directed by Woody Allen. Throughout the film, such questions appeared unintentionally in my mind and now I am almost certain that the director wanted the viewers to leave the cinema with reflections. MATCH POINT is a powerful film that shows the sophisticated life of Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), a tennis player and an opera lover, who is not a simple man. From the very beginning, he wants to be noticed, wants to leave something special in the world. But is this ""special"" something proper or is it, in fact, a huge mistake? That is the matter of fate, like the tennis ball falling either on the left or on the right... From the moment Chris meets his friend Tom's (Matthew Goode) girlfriend, beautiful Nola Rice (Scarlett Johansson), he cannot forget her. Nevertheless, he gets married to rich Chloe Hewitt (Emily Mortimer) to whom he does not feel the equal passion like to Nola, but she is a woman who can ensure him a rich life. After the wedding, she desperately wants to have a baby, but she does it so automatically it all occurs so unnatural and sophisticated ...<br/><br/>The film touches the very core of human struggles between desires and reason, the very core of the ambiguity of human nature. Chris is not a bandit, but commits two murders. He is no debaucher but lust totally occupies his mind. Nola is not an ""easy-going girl"", but she continues living in a deeply unfair affair. Chloe is not a bad wife, but she cannot help her marriage problems. The characters are very complicated and there is definitely no simple answer that this one is good and that one is bad. They are all ambiguous, sophisticated. That is one thing that makes the film and interesting look at personalities. Another thing is the fact that Woody Allen shows the decadence of widespread morality that has no roots in the hearts of people but ONLY in the old social conventions. ""You may kiss the bride"" for the first time while she is in the 6th month of pregnancy (Tom's wife), ""You should make up your mind whether be in this difficult job especially for women (an actress) or not,"" says Tom's mother to Nola. ""It (sexual act) leads us nowhere"" or ""Not now, I am tired!"" as refusal of a wife's offer of making love. The rotten decadence of shallow but comfortable morality that the society is used to is highly questioned in the movie. The viewer gets an impression that in such a world, there is no place for true love and frankness. Partly true, isn't it? But whose guilt is this? Besides, the film deeply stresses the existence of conscience. I loved the symbolic scene when Chris sees his two victims (as if ghosts). ""You will pay for that"" ... not by prison but by constant mind suffering. The final shot proves that...<br/><br/>The performances are very fine. Jonathan Rhys Meyers gives a very good performance as Chris. He wonderfully expresses a character of a liar, a passionate, lustful but at the same time a crazy man. Scarlett Johansson fits very well to her role as Nola Rice. She portrays a woman who does not want to live in lie and wants to give birth to a child that will be ""born out of true love"" (but rather lust)... Some people said that this role will be crucial in Scarlett's career and I would agree with this viewpoint. She is great! I also liked the performance of Emily Mortimer as Chris' wife, Chloe. She is worth consideration and although her role is quite difficult, she manages to express different feelings in an outstanding manner. There is also such a famous star in the cast as Brian Cox who plays Alec, the father of Chloe. He is perfect as an old rich gentleman who loves his son-in-law not knowing what harm he does to other people.<br/><br/>MATCH POINT is a good film, interesting to watch. It throughout catches the attention of the viewer because of its action combined with psychological aspects of human minds. No character is shallow in interpretation, each of them leads a viewer to reflections. The end is also great... Chris is not punished for his deed so noticeably. No one finds him guilty, but his conscience knows what happened. That is how it usually is in life. Can he be happy? The closeup onto his face tells everything...<br/><br/>One of the few films that I discussed with my friends long after we left the cinema! 8/10!"
"MOscarbradley","9","0","0","22 April 2006"," The long promised return to form
","Now affectionately known as his 'London picture', presumably to distinguish it from all those other 'Noo Yawk' pictures, ""Match Point"" is unmistakably Allen. He has said that originally he wrote it for a New York setting and that the changes for London were purely cosmetic, and in doing so he has alienated a large number of British critics who feel that Allen's high-brow, intellectual, art-orientated dialogue doesn't ring true in a British setting. Rubbish! This smart, intelligent film is worth a hundred Richard Curtis rom-coms and it's Allen's understanding of what humanizes his characters that makes it so.<br/><br/>Jonathan Rhys Meyers is the tennis coach who through good looks, better manners and an excess of guile, not to mention extraordinary luck, worms his way into the affections of a reliably realistic upper-class British family and in particular into the bed of the sweetly vacant daughter. From here on his trajectory can only be upwards until he falls in love the son's American fiancée, (a fabulously willful Scarlett Johansson). Then the waters muddy.<br/><br/>This is Allen in a serious mode. There are no deliberate laughs, though the irony of the later scenes isn't entirely lost. Nor are the allusions to Dostoyevsky whom we see the hero reading at the beginning. The material isn't particularly new either, (he covers similar ground in ""Crimes and Misdemeanours""), but the movie is so intelligent and accurate that it represents something of that return to the form we have been waiting for, (as did last year's ""Melinda and Melinda"" and this is a step-up from that).<br/><br/>As ever Allen confirms his position as one of the greatest of all directors of actors. Here he has a superb ensemble. Rhys Meyers has his best part so far and makes the most of it and Johansson turns what could have been a shrew into a multi-faceted, vulnerable young woman. The family Rhys Meyers wheedles his way into, eventually through marriage, is superbly represented by Brian Cox and Penelope Wilton, (parents), and Matthew Goode and Emily Mortimer (siblings). Again in the hands of a lesser writer, (Richard Curtis, perhaps?), these people could so easily have been the most basic of caricatures but Allen bestows on them a kind of gentle affection; they are nice people for all their wealth, looks and sense of class. The mother's rejection of Scarlett Johansson as a potential daughter-in-law is only in part based on her feelings that she is 'beneath' them, (so, too, is Meyers, but he has potential). Rather, perhaps, she sees in her that fundamental lack of stability she later comes to display. And there are pleasing cameos, too, from the likes of Margaret Tyzack and James Nesbitt.<br/><br/>Allen, himself, feels ""Match Point"" may be his best picture. For those of us who still feel ""Interiors"", ""Manhatten"" and ""The Purple Rose of Cairo"" are masterpieces that may seem something of a blinkered boast.

","In interviews and documentaries, Woody Allen has always claimed to believe in the accidental, and thus morally neutral universe. In Matchpoint he gives us a picture of what life would be like in a world ""where everything is permitted"".<br/><br/>He begins with a reference to Dostoevski who proposed that even if God didn't exist, we would have to invent Him because humanity and civilization are dependent on the belief that the universe is ultimately a just place. Allen has his latter day Raskolnikov make the pronouncement that ""faith is the easy way out"".<br/><br/>He then provides us a picture of a world where life is inherently devoid of meaning and where the summum bonum is to make lots of money, live well, and to have children, so they can do the same. It is a vacuous life that is hollow at the core and which hardly seems to be worth living.<br/><br/>If one takes his protagonist as a role model, it seems that Mr. Allen believes that the only truly self-actualized person is the psycho-path. Conscience is merely a hindrance that interferes with one's personal development.<br/><br/>Ultimately, Mr. Allen gives us a horrific view of life as he sees it, and inadvertently makes Dostoevski's case for him in a rather brilliant fashion. Postscript. Judging from Cloe's demeanor when she realizes he is having an affair, it is clear to me that he does not have to kill her, If he had simply told her part of the truth, she would have called daddy, who would have called a friend in the home office, and Nola would have been deported and the problem solved."

","i've just finished watching the film. this is the first time i saw Woody Allen's film, although i know he is one of the best American directors. the reason for this is that i mainly care about the British films and the films concerned with the British people. it is the story and location of this film that make me buy a DVD of it and watch it very attentively. while watching it, i felt that the main theme of the film is almost the same with ""damage"" i've seen before, which has Juliette Binoche as its leading actress. both of these two seem to share the same theme that one should pay for his wrongdoings out of love affair, at least in the most part of ""match point"". but the ending of these two differentiate from each other greatly. ""damage"" ends with Chris's lucky avoidance from the legitimate punishment, while in ""damage"" the MP answered for all he has done. lucky or not, both of them give a vivid performance of those who are exhausted mentally by the affair, which is always the bewilderment of those who are struggling between love and lust. a good film worthy of recommendation!"
"wasimmon","5","0","0","5 April 2006"," Allen's Return to Relevance?
","This film begins in refreshing subtlety, but the violence at the end seems a real miscue. It really prevents Woody Allen's return to relevance and becomes instead an awkward stab at semi-grace. Tennis, that subtle sport, is the back drop here. The opening sequence with a tennis ball jutting into the air above a net signals a film about manners, both good and bad, on both sides of the court. Actually, the characters are mostly well-to-do Irish and British people. The lone American is so crudely foreign that she becomes the object of desire for more than one seeker. But, the sensuality never seems forced or overdone, perhaps because of the youthful preponderance. Another viewer drew a comparison to Allen's earlier film about the elimination of an affair Crimes and Misdemeanors. Yet those characters were older and drenched in off-putting angst, whereas these characters are so young, athletic, and noncommittal. In Crimes and Misdemeanors, you walk away believing that Martin Landaeu not only killed someone he loved but also tried to hire a hit-man in the process. However, you leave the theater here saying that pretty boy Meyers did what with his father-in-law's shotgun? Minus the shotgun and the double homicide, of course, this film could have really stood as a humble film standing in the face of contemporary violence, a kind of angel for character-driven pieces. So, the murder is truly a mistake because the film doesn't set us up for it. The tension builds and builds and then breaks apart, never to be seen again. Allen ends with Meyers gazing away from his circle of loved ones as the opera swoons his internal despair. The viewer doesn't empathize with Meyers because we feel the same way. What just happened here?"

","A tennis coach turned businessman (Jonathan Rhys Myers) begins an affair with his brother in law's former fiancée (Scarlett Johansson) but can't decide whether to leave his wife (Emily Mortimer), whose family has provided him with upper-class comforts, or to break it off with the mistress.<br/><br/>Impressive film written and directed by Woody Allen, this is very much a change of pace for the veteran filmmaker. The film is very well written as Allen ensures his script touches on themes of fate and luck, which ultimately have an enormous bearing on the climax, and class struggle and the desire to enter 'higher society'. The acting is excellent as Myers' character is both shifty and almost likable. Allen draws considerable suspense throughout the film as we (the audience) ultimately follow Myers and, in the tradition of the best of Hitchcock, want him to succeed even when his intentions take a turn for the worse. Perhaps a tad slow in parts and hence slightly overlong, but overall a very impressive film. This was likely influenced by A Place in the Sun (1951), which is also recommended. Also with Brian Cox."

","Hi there, i wanted to add a couple of comments about the end of the movie. I liked Allen's point of view about luck in life a lot, but it seems difficult for me to believe that the police would archive the case even without looking for the gun (2 murders, 2 different guns ?) and even knowing that Chris had access to his father in law's fire guns... I also guess that Nola's autopsy would definitely throw new light into the case and also her friend at the shopping centre who was, for sure, aware of the whole story!! Too many hints left behind! I considered an additional ending, any comments are more than welcome: Chris goes to the police where he knows about Nola's diary and his affair is revealed. The policeman asks him if he was aware of Nola's pregnancy and Chris, confused, replies that he did not know anything of it. Then the police tells him that in the diary is written that she invented her pregnancy to push him to leave his wife (this would be really lucky,would not it?) so no possible way to formally accuse him."

It puts London in the viewfinder as it really looks on the few sunny days. Class is no longer an issue, ability and luck is. This is really a film about luck, those who have it and those who don't. It is a clever film. It is an unexpected film from the master of neurotics in New York. The actors are superb.

In the way he through away any character who resemble him. Through away the jokes(which were becoming tiresome and repetitive) and give us a film which interesting and say something about the society we live in.<br/><br/>It should be said that Allen has already made a film with a similar story-line(see Crimes and Misdemeanors) but where the former take the subject from a Jewish point of view(as a result of Allen presence in the film,). This film here take is from a less religious point of view. Allen says that nothing is important in life except if you have luck. The film is a simply a way to put his point forward and to convince us. From a moral point of view I would be satisfied if Chris Wilton(a very good Jonathan Rhys Meyers) would have been punished for his deeds, but as a movie who has a point to say I can live with the way Allen solve the whole things. The fact is that Chris leave with the burden of his deeds and no matter how he try to justified them, he still has this burden on his shoulders.<br/><br/>The bottom line is that this is a very good film. Highly recommended thanks to a tight script, very good acting(more or less from everyone involved) and a directing which serve the script well."

","I was soooo glad this flick finally showed up in my city. When it came out around Christmas, I knew like all Woody Allen movies, it would be in and out of the theaters quickly. However, it never showed up, even by the start of Febuary. It went to Toronto and other cities, but not here in Winnipeg.<br/><br/>Well, this week it showed up. Thank you theater people. Thank You Woody. This was a very good, well written movie. <br/><br/>I am not going to give away any plot points. Instead I'll comment on a criticism of the local newspaper critic who gave this film a near perfect score, but refused to give it a perfect score due to...the dream sequence. <br/><br/>I have mixed feeling over the dream. On one hand, it throws the viewer off for a moment thinking the movie will be going one way, that perhaps retribution will be at hand. On the other side, the actor (tell me he doesn't remind you of Joaquin Phoenix?) Jonathan Rhys Meyers did a hell of a job conveying regret and fear at the end. We know he was worried he'd be caught. He knows how close he came from being investigated. So you decide. Is the movie better without it?<br/><br/>Anyone who has a problem with 'Woody Allen' should have no problem with this film. Yes, it does remind the viewer of 'Crimes and Misdemeaners', but there is virtually no comedy this time around. Like Ned Flanders said, and I paraphrase, 'I enjoy those Woody Allen movies, with the exception of that nervous fellow that is always in them.' That character is nowhere to be found in Matchpoint. <br/><br/>Highly recommended."

So, of course, I had great expectations on this one. I was disappointed. I thought that to a certain extent and until the killing scene the film was OK, but not superb. But I wasn't at all convinced of the Rhys-Myers character and I just didn't think he would have the guts to kill the Johansson character. He just seemed too nice and certainly not diabolical enough to commit such an atrocious act. As to the whole investigation by the clumsy police cops (Sick boy from Trainspotting): Was Allen trying to be funny? If so, he didn't succeed. To me, the whole investigation was like a useless appendix to a film that should have ended a lot earlier. And when the Rhys-Myers character meets his two murder victims in the kitchen at night and defines the old lady as collateral damage I was completely put off by the way how Allen concocted a lot of his earlier film elements.

However, it's not exactly the same as space shuttles docked on meteors planting nukes. ""Match Point"" makes it case about life and luck from the word GO and successfully nails it in with a wedding ring saving families, careers and feigned innocence.<br/><br/>Jonathan Rhys Meyers, playing Chris Wilton, does an incredible job playing a small time tennis instructor who gets involved with a wealthy conglomerate's daughter and soon bowls her over. Her parents decide to groom the young man ordering roasted chicken instead of soaked caviar towards becoming their son-in-law. Understandably, Chris is doing a great job running his father-in-law's business while scaling the corporate ladder. The movie does not explain however, if Chris got his MBA from Harvard or Kelloggs !! Soon he falls prey to Nola's(played by Scarlett) drop dead gorgeousness who incidentally happens to have been engaged to his wife's brother but only to break up soon. Chris nurses his affair while his wife nurses her obsession to get pregnant repeatedly albeit a slow starter. What follows is a bunch of credible and not so credible romanticizing. Chris soon gets torn apart with his affair and his career centric marriage and decides to do something radical and drastic. Chris' actions however, although seemingly adroit wouldn't really fit into a professional's handbook. Well, ""Fortune does Favour Brave Chris"" in the end. I really got Lost in Translation with Scarlett and have been watching out for her ever since and she definitely doesn't disappoint with this one either. Soundtrack predominantly has an operatic allure and it somehow seems to fit.<br/><br/>All in all, ""Match Point"" is definitely worth all the ""dead presidents"" and if you already believe in luck get ready for some reinforcements.<br/><br/>9 on 10"

","The film starts out with a former tennis star Chris(Jonathan Rhys-Meyers)being interviewed for job as a tennis instructor for a prestige country club in London, England. Trying to get away from the glamor and drama of the tennis industry that he once committed too, he begins giving lessons to Tom(Matthew Goode) whom the two then become good friends. Tom introduces his sister Chloe(Emily Mortimer) to Chris and he then sees his chance to find a women that is will to settle down to work for a living and start a new family, in addition to the wealthy family that Chloe lives in as of now. Chris then meets Tom's fiancé Nola(Scarlett Johansson) and a immediate physical attraction is developed between the two. Chris then proceeds to marry Chloe and also begins a physical relationship with Nola, after she had been dumped by Tom.<br/><br/>Allen's film revolves around the concept of luck and guilt, showing the effect of the two of the main character. It's hard to relate to the social aristocratic environment that Allen portrays, but the point is made clear. In order to get what you want, you need to sacrifice certain priorities. The main character, as I perceived, is being very self-fish and sleazy at times and unwilling to work for this balance of work and pleasure. The scene that stuck out for me was when Chris and Nola are having a drink in a local pub, discussing their relationship status. Before Chris and Nola begin their relationship and while Nola is still engaged to Tom, Nola states that Chris is going to ruin the Hewett family by making a pass at her. Having some beef with the Hewett family that disapproves of her, nothing more pleasurable to Nola than to seek out revenge towards the family that she loathes. This begins a motive for Chris as he promises that he can balance out both his family and his affair, but also shows what Nola's character wants and how she's going to get it. Chris begins to fall for Nola, but knows if he stays involve with her he'll have to sacrifice his well paid career given by the Chloe's father and his steady and safe relationship with Chloe. He then becomes involved with lie after lie, trying to separate work and play. One thing leads to another and the guilt makes things complicated.<br/><br/>The acting is very well done in this film and it's everything that I would expect out of a good Woody Allen film, neglecting the comical side that he is known for. The film made me analyze what the difference is between luck and fate and how they are two similar yet different occurrences. I was uncomfortable with the film's direction changing pretty abruptly by showing the cause and solution of one's inner guilt and how it can drive someone to the extreme, but I did understand the reasoning behind it. I enjoyed the film based on the drama, suspense and yes, even the romance in the film found a spot in my heart. Allen has definitely redeemed himself with this fresh approach, but not to worry, it still has that same Woody Allen flavor to it."

The film tells the story of Chris Harris (the always stunning Jonathan Rhys-Myers) an Irish pro-tennis instructor who meets the wealthy Tom Hewett. Chris and Tom become friends and then Chris is introduced to Tom's lovely sister, Chloe (a wonderful performance by Emily Mortimer). Chloe falls in love with Chris and he is content with her, but not in love with her. Chris is later introduced to Tom's fiancée, Nola (the equally striking and alluring Scarlett Johanson). Chris and Nola are immediately attracted to one another and from there the film goes down the road of obsession, passion, violence, and guilt. Chris and Nola are two souls who meet in the modern upper class world: they are sexy, smart, and ambitious, but unfortunately these are two souls that are so much alike that the result of their chemistry is one that ends in tragedy. One of the year's best films at least in my list."

There's a lot of ground to cover, and just when you think it's going to end or that you've figured out how it will end, you get thrown for a loop. Scarlett Johansson is so gorgeous, you can't take your eyes off of her. But she seems out of place being an American in a English movie. I almost feel like Woody Allen (the writer/director) wanted to cast Scarlet but wasn't sure if she could pull off a successful English accent, because of her deep American voice. So he made up this ridiculous sub-plot of her finding her acting roots in London. Regardless she's absolutely great and so is the cast. I particularly I think that Matthew Goode and Emily Mortimer did a great job. Mortimer's perky oh-so-sweet way was a little off putting but she played it very convincingly. Goode seemed to understand his character the best, (even better then the lead played by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) when he spoke I truly felt he knew what he was saying. Appose to some who made it very evident that they were reading a script. Overall Match Point is worth your time (maybe on DVD) and not with-out it's flaws (acting, length, and cheese)"

","MATCH POINT - written & directed by Woody Allen<br/><br/>This movie is set in London, and has the style of a foreign film. While I understood beforehand that this was a romantic drama, those expecting some of trademark Allen's humor throughout this movie will be disappointed. There is none. What does this movie offer? There is Scarlett Johansson's voluptuous presence, playing an aspiring actress from Boulder, Colorado. And for those with enough patience, there is some romantic intrigue to resolve.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, for most of the American public, without a generous curiosity for upper class British style, these character's dialogue is very cold, dry, and emotionless. Even Johansson's character seems to be a bit overdone in this regard until deep into the film, and to criticize Allen, some of the early romantic repartee seems forced and flounders a bit.<br/><br/>Which makes one wonder what Allen's motivation for making this film was. Most Americans have no access to or knowledge of upper crust British society - could Allen could be condemning their detached and aloof style with this film? These British characters are generally sedated throughout and seems entirely oblivious to current events.<br/><br/>The focus of the drama, an Irish, former tennis pro named Chris, seems a bit too wrapped up in his chauvinist understanding of philosophy and literature to see the situation he is wrapped up in straight. Women too have the ability to have absorbed the wisdom of philosophy by this, the 21st century, and have a good amount of common sense in general, and Chris unfortunately tries to make all the decisions in this own head without relying on anyone else. The passion implied by his humble past sets up the drama for the film.<br/><br/>(Note: one must be alert to notice the scene early in the film when it is mentioned the one and only time that tennis was a way of escape for him from poverty, especially as his manner and speech are on par with any of the upper class company he keeps.)<br/><br/>Ultimately I doubt most of the American public would be able to stand how robotic the speech of these Brits is, and so unless you are a fan of foreign films in general, vis a vis a person with two hours of patience to blow for the small reward of a reasonably interesting comment on youth and foolish passion, I suggest you stay away. An interesting but not entirely entertaining film that I suspect to be aimed mostly at the British public and the coolness of their quasi-democratic society.<br/><br/>If you are going to see Scarlett Johansson, you will have to wait for her to find another vehicle to titillate your senses; Allen is all for his message and the sex scenes are gone before they begin to smolder at all. The way she looks now they might have memorable. ----- 6/10"

His style was distinct though. And much of his work became tiresome. That is why Match Point is so great. It does not play at all like a Woody Allen film. It is not a comfortable film by any means. I felt like I was constantly squirming through every scene. I'll admit there was a part of me that was happy to get out of the theater. I think about the intended audience for say ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"". And I would describe match Point as Texas Chainsaw Massacre for people with an intellect. That is an odd description, I know. My point is that they both have the same effect on ones bottom action in their seat. They admittedly go at it in very different ways though. I love the payoff at the end. I enjoy the commentaries about the effects of luck and faith on the paths of our lives. The actors were all superb. I hope this signals in a new era for Mr. Allen.

"vincenthetreed","8","0","0","3 February 2006"," Complex thriller plot beautifully realised
","A lot of critics call this ""noir"", and it's certainly morally murky, but ""noir"", of course, isn't French and this film is. It's a homage to Chabrol, cynical, playful and assured. Unlike the Hollywood ""noir"", of Fritz Lang and others in the 40s and 50s, it is shot in lovely edible colour, (which makes London look gorgeous), and the dialogue (perfect 'British' English by Allen himself, except for one ""gotten"") and acting are naturalistic rather than stylised. The other comparison that comes to mind, apart from Allen's own - ""Crimes and Misdemeanours"", is Hitchcock, and look how the French new wave directors admired and emulated him. If you expect an Allen comedy, this is far from typical. There are few verbal gags, but there is humour in the plotting, what you might call 'life-jokes', enhanced by the lightning narrative of the first section of the film, which sets up the moral problem at its centre: a problem for the central character, Chris. He has to choose between social and economic security on the one hand and lust and commitment to his pregnant mistress on the other. He is venal, weak, a chameleon trading on charm and looks to make his way. His wife is a little foolish and desperate to get pregnant, but his privileged lifestyle, job and social acceptance are tied to her. His mistress is a hot cookie, but now that she is pregnant, and seems to expect him to dump wife, success and all, she has become a millstone. Scarlett Johannson never looks like a millstone, she looks terrific and her performance stands out because she is playing the alien in this very British social setting, but Jonathan Rhys Meyers (Chris) and all the supporting cast are equally good. How Chris will solve his problem is the puzzle for us. For me, the only fault this film has is that the tension of this puzzle is stretched too long, particularly considering the speed of the earlier part. The rushing stream seems to have run into a pond, but it does find its way out again, and it's a cracking climax, full of twists and false trails, with a conclusion that ties everything into an agonising knot."

","Woody Allen is treading down a familiar path. Lower class boy meets rich girl, and uses her to get ahead, but is sidetracked along the way by his libido. The question is can Allen do the subject as well, or better than it's forebears. Two movies come to mind: ""A place in the Sun,"" and ""Room at the top."" Both are classics, the first an American version of Dreiser's: ""An American tragedy,"" starring Montgomery Clift. The second a gritty British version starring Laurence Harvey as the unforgettable Joe Lampton. The answer is: no, not by a long shot!<br/><br/>A tennis pro (Myers), at a posh British Country club, gets invited by one of his clients to the Opera with his rich family. Our hero meets the client's sister, and she takes a romantic interest in him. Our hero sees his opportunity and let's it take him where it can do him the most good, which is out of Tennis and into the boardroom.<br/><br/>Allen chooses to go softly and slowly into this story, and it takes awhile for the story to get under one's skin. That moment is the arrival of Scarlett Johansen, his girlfriend's, brother's, fiancée; and our hero's immediate beeline towards her. Now we know that he isn't simply trying to get ahead, he is trying to have it all, and in so doing the only question left unanswered is how self destructive are his demons? Allen wrote the screenplay as well as directed, often a difficult combination to pull off. But then, that is his métier! The problem I had with the script is that too often we can see the actor's struggling to make the words come out naturally. Johansen struggles the most, perhaps because she is not a great actress, or perhaps because Allen gives her lines that are more in place on stage.<br/><br/>Meyers struggles as well, in part because he is surrounded by more accomplished British professionals, and in part because he is not really up for the kind of nuanced performance required of him. But ultimately the main fault is Allen's, because he wants to give us a movie about the pit falls of ambition, and all we get is a rather mediocre morality play. In the end Meyer's character is not nearly as dangerous as Joe Lampton, nor as tragic as Clift's. So what he leaves us with is a nice little twist at the end, that somehow manages to come off too easily and too patly."

","I loved this film, but as an opera director, I had one big beef, which I'm sure was a money saver - the performances at Covent Garden were accompanied by piano on practically non- existent sets - very disappointing! Otherwise, an excellent film. This is the most satisfying Woody Allen film in recent memory, and the plot twists toward the end, and the recurring symbolism was great. I found Jonathan Rhys-Myers performance very rich, and all of the other performers were strong. A pity that the excellent Brian Cox's part was not fleshed out more - I am always intrigued by his performances. The operatic selections were well thought out, and in some cases (ie the Otello excerpt) creepily appropriate. I was glad to see a setting outside of New York City, and as always, Allen catches ""atmosphere"" as well as anyone. Wonderful film overall!"

","I was very impressed with ""Match Point."" The screenplay actually bears resemblance to a tennis game, and I mean the kind that McEnroe and Borg played back in the '70s! I had listened to a portion of the new operatic version of ""An American Tragedy,"" which was the basis for the Elizabeth Taylor-Montgomery Clift film ""A Place in the Sun."" I did not realize that it was Woody Allen's main source of inspiration for this film until after the fact! This film marks a radical departure from recent film, such as ""Anything Else"" (which I liked, but few seemed to), and bears very little resemblance to the Allen we have grown to love over the years. The film more closely resembles ""Interiors"" and ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" more so than ""Annie Hall"" or ""The Mighty Aphrodite."" There are great performances as well. Brian Cox is really good as a tyrannical father figure. Emily Mortimer is also outstanding as the clueless Chloe. The film also hints at a Hitchcockian influence. You don't have to be a Woody Allen fan to like this one."

","Although a mild thriller with beautiful people and sets, and even a philosophy of luck with which I totally agree, in order to make his point, plot and film work, Woody sloppily leaves out a routine forensic activity, which is distracting at best and at worst, spoils an otherwise well-crafted film. My daughter laughed when I told her that I must write to Woody and call him on this blatant gap. Still, the film had both erotic and tense moments enough to hold most moviegoers and a pace to satisfy even restless husbands who demand action. The London setting was a refreshing change from New York and Woody does his usual good thing of taking us into really interesting and beautiful homes to live out his film."

","Woody Allen has been making movies for just over forty years so it seems reasonable to wonder just how much of a departure MATCH POINT really could be from a director who's neurotic mistrust of love and life looms over most of his offerings. Even as he gets on in years and no longer takes on the lead acting responsibilities, cutting down to merely writing and directing one film a year on average, the ghost of the Woody Allen caricature finds it's way into the picture (see Jason Biggs in ANYTHING ELSE or Will Ferrell in MELINDA AND MELINDA.) The lead here, tennis pro turned instructor, Chris Wilton is played by Jonathan Rhys Meyers. We meet him after Woody's classic plain white text on black background opening credits, interviewing for a job and looking for a London flat. The young lad worked his way out of a poor Irish background into the pro-tennis circuit before retiring for a more stable life where he could appreciate the finer things life had to offer, like opera and art. In opposition to past leads, he is well put together, focused. He has his eye on the ball, if you will. This is not to say he has everything figured out or is without fear. He knows he wants to do something of value with his life, isn't clear on what exactly that is but also does not let hesitation paralyze him. Upon meeting Chloe Hewett (the glowing Emily Mortimer), Chris' biggest similarity to the Woody Allen archetype becomes apparent. Despite all his efforts and subsequent accomplishments, he is a pessimist. He may appreciate the finer things but his belief is the finest things are those capable of capturing and communicating everything that is tragic about life. Can a pessimist truly know love? Woody seems to think yes, at least at first. Chloe is an eternal optimist who has never known anything tragic about life and despite their differences they fall in love while walking around London, which Allen frames like postcards in much the same way he has framed Manhattan for years.<br/><br/>Woody has a strong handle on the visual direction, allowing characters to walk in and out of the frame when we would expect them to. There are no surprises, just a natural direction, suggesting that Woody knows exactly what we will want to see as we watch from behind bushes or fences. More importantly, he has an even stronger control on this, his finest screenplay since 1992's HUSBANDS AND WIVES. MATCHPOINT is ultimately about luck, how little importance we place on luck despite the significant role it plays in our lives and how far we're willing to push our own luck. Chris, a devout believer in the influence luck has on his life, decides to close his eyes and hope for the best when he embarks on an affair with Nola Rice (Scarlet Johansson), his soon-to-be brother-in-law's fiancé. The two gravitate towards each other, pulled by an uncontrollable sexual desire. Separately, they each represent opposite ends of the luck spectrum. Chris is still riding his lucky streak, scoring his tennis instructor job, meeting Chloe, getting a job at one of her father's business firms. Whereas Nola is still trying to escape hers, running away from her dead-end Colorado home, struggling to make it as an actress and eventually losing her fiancé, Tom (Matthew Goode). The question then is how much better is Chris' luck when all the successes he stumbles upon are not what he wants but what he believes he should want?<br/><br/>Further strengthening Woody's script, is the issue of class woven in and out of the entire film. Both Chris and Nola come from modest backgrounds at best and are dating members of London's higher society. Tom and Chloe are happy, High-spirited people with all the time in the world to pursue their interests  opera, tennis, opening an art gallery. Chris and Nola have been working their whole lives to get where they are with Nola finding she still has a great deal of work ahead of her while she's not certain she has it in her to get there. For Tom and Chloe, there is no flipside to the coin and new opportunities arise all the time. They've always been lucky and what makes them descent is at least they can each acknowledge their fortunate existence. Nola has yet to truly know luck and lack of enthusiasm in her speech shows how little faith she has in potentially finding it. But it is the taste of a fortunate man's life that is new to Chris Wilton. He has a driver now and his new flat no longer has a fold out sofa bed but it does have one of the most spectacular views of London available. So when his affair with Nola begins to threaten his newfound cushion of a life, he is forced to make a decision for the first time instead of leaving everything to chance. This decision brings about a tension and discomfort that is so rarely achieved in film-making today. Woody manages to blindside his audience without using it as a gimmick or relying on twists to give the film its ultimate meaning.<br/><br/>Be it lucky in life or unlucky in love, Woody serves up a film about the game itself. We may all think that we have control, that we hold the power over our lives or that we are making the decisions that will move us forward. What Woody wants to remind us is that, like a game, we don't get to make any of these decisions until it's our turn to serve and we certainly don't know what our opponents will do next despite how well we think we know their game."

And, of course, the background - this time, London, is displayed with the same kind of love Woody brought to previous works set in New York.<br/><br/>Kudos to Woody Allen for this very capable departure from comedy.

She is an actress with so much depths already, at her young age, that you are astonished.

","I don't remember Crimes and Misdemeanors, although I'm sure I have seen it, so can't make any comparisons. And I did like ""Melinda, Melinda"" very much. This movie, like so many of Woody Allen's was great because of the musical accompaniments and in particular the use of opera, which sets the theme ultimately for the story. (I'm glad to read that it was the ""Pearl Fishers"" to begin with as I thought, although that was not listed first in credits.) Also a thematic indication was Chris' reading of Dostowevski. Interestingly we do not know the title of the book. Unlike some reviewers I got the impression that Chris Wilton was quite famous, indeed as a tennis player but I agree that in his initial meeting with Tom there was an undercurrent of sexual ambiguity that of course was resolved in the meeting of Chloe and then Nola. The charms of Scarlett Johanason really elude me (but I am an old dame), her walk is most ungraceful (she stalks) and her lips look pumped full of collagen, plus I don't think much of her acting ability. In fact in the early part of the movie to me the acting seemed very stilted and conversations almost like just going through the motions, not really engaged. Aside from Scarlett, none of the actors were known to me. They did do a good job, really. As always I loved the sets. There is that very neat twist at the end but it also was allowed to have the impact it did because some very basic police procedures were completely ignored or by-passed. Also a little difficult to believe was the continuing affair when Nola was at first really rather indifferent bordering on repelled by Chris. Guess it could be explained by loneliness, abandonment and whatever financial assistance he could have given her (this is not at all explored). Overall it was a pleasure to see an adult movie with a plot, beautiful photography and settings, beautiful music and (to me) an introduction to some new, interesting and very attractive actors. Oh and an observation sort of outside the main review. . . when I saw the art in Chloe's gallery, I almost burst out laughing. Was that Woody's attempt at ridiculing the current art world?"

","When it seems as if Woody Allen is ready to break free of whatever creative rut his critics assume he is in, the Woodster still manages to regurgitate himself. This movie was better, much better when he did it fifteen years ago and called it Crimes and Misdemeanors.<br/><br/>Not to say that Match Point isn't without merit, but its subject matter is not only familiar territory for Allen, but at two hours maybe a bit too long to prove to Allen that he can do an old Hollywood pot-boiler outside of his beloved NYC....which I think was the point of this whole exercise.<br/><br/>What saves this from being negligible is the same thing that saves most of Woody's movies from falling into ""Woody's World"" and that's his uncanny ability to get a great performance out of his lead/supporting actresses.<br/><br/>Scarlett Johannson is great in this. Though her introduction scene is poorly staged and written (a ping-pong game?) in an obvious manner to make her seem like a tough, sexy American/Hollywood vixen, Scarlet turns an oversexed caricatured bitch into a sympathetic victim. Unfortunately not enough time is devoted to her character, which would have made for a far more interesting movie."

","If you look at the graph of voting on this movie, the greatest number of voters give ""Match Point"" at 10, which seems to me ridiculous.

You don't leave the movie thinking about your OWN life (ugh!), but rather reconsidering and debating the options, motives, and mistakes of the characters. Which is to say, it is a fairly believable, adult film.<br/><br/>Maybe in this day and age, that is enough to make a movie seem like an all-time masterpiece, so let me say, compared to any number of films which came out in the past four years, this certainly is a ""10,"" and in that case I'm not sure of the criteria on which one rates these things."

","Matchpoint, the new Woody Allen film, deals with a group of Londoners who are, for the most part, well-to-do. We meet one on the tennis court as he takes a lesson from a former professional player. The teacher will become the protagonist of the story as he finds himself more and more immersed in his student's life and family. <br/><br/>From the outer edges of the story, we watch the tennis ball being struck back and forth--not expertly, but not amateurishly either. At one point the ball hits the top of the net, bounces straight up, and we hear the narrator say as the ball descends towards the net in slow motion, that if the ball comes back on our side, we lose and if it falls over the net we win. <br/><br/>Integral to the movie is opera. Not only is the soundtrack all opera, but both the student and the teacher discover that each loves opera and an extra ticket to that night's performance in the family box is made available to the teacher. He accepts--not with alacrity, as if he were seeking to intrude himself into the student's life--, but reluctantly as would we all after being asked to a box at the opera from someone of new acquaintance.<br/><br/>It is the love these characters have for each other--or the lust in some cases--that makes the movie interesting. It is the machinations that each of them uses to bring someone closer or drive someone away that grips you in the entanglements. It is the extremity of feeling, the complexity of motivation, the conflict of goals that makes you relate to the people, sympathize with them and want them to solve their problems well because, after all, they are you. <br/><br/>The story of the tennis teacher and the student unfolds in many layers. The student's sister falls in love with the pro. You meet the doting parents who want only the best for their children. You can't help liking the whole family as it lovingly tries to make life easier for everyone in its circle. Complications arise and therein is the crux of the story. <br/><br/>You never really get to know any of the characters very well. You know what's driving them each at any given moment and what they think they want to happen, but all is on the surface. Surface volatility abounds. Dialogue between lovers is almost banal in tone. Anger is expressed at the most elemental level. The characters don't seem to have any experience to draw upon--real or derived. What is happening to them is as if it's happening for the first time. Solutions that seem extreme to you or me seem the only possible way to go for them.<br/><br/>The tennis ball bounces into the air straight up from hitting the net. It comes down and someone wins and someone loses."

","Match Point (2005), written and directed by Woody Allen, is a movie during which I wanted to shout, ""Don't do it"" to the protagonist.<br/><br/>Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) was a modestly skilled professional tennis player who now has everything: an intelligent, beautiful, loving wife (the exquisite Emily Mortimer), a great job (his boss is his father-in-law), good looks, charm, and what appears to be the best apartment in London.<br/><br/>What Chris doesn't have--but decides he wants--is Nola Rice (played by Scarlett Johansson). Nola--a no-talent aspiring actress from the U.S.--describes herself as sexy, but not beautiful. Well, actually, she's both, but that's about the end of her list of positive attributes.<br/><br/>Chris risks everything to begin an affair with Nola, with predictable results, up to a point. About 90 minutes into this two-hour film, Allen switches course, and the last quarter of the film doesn't really fit the first three quarters. I found this annoying, although I can't deny that the action leading to the film's conclusion is riveting.<br/><br/>The actors are excellent, with the exception of Johansson, who to my mind plays the part with no particular insight or subtlety.<br/><br/>London looks wonderful--clean and brilliant. (Allen's London bears the same resemblance to the real London as Allen's New York does to the real New York.) The soundtrack--mostly classic operatic performances--is wonderful.<br/><br/>This is a film worth seeing, but I suggest you see it at home. That way, when Chris approaches Nola, you can shout, ""Don't do it"" without disturbing the other people in the theater."

It was too long by about 30% and would be much more suitable as a TV movie. Even the people in it are much more often seen in British TV, except Ms Johansen.<br/><br/>All that said maybe he made it to show he could, not just because he can make any movie, but to show he can make movies like anyone else.

","Match Point isn't a bad movie, but after watching it I didn't feel satisfied. Most of the cast provides solid acting except for Jonathan Rhys-Meyers which is rather problematic as he plays the lead role. The dialogs are good with some quite cynical humor, Allen has done a good job of adapting his writing style to the British setting of his story.<br/><br/>What really lets Match Point down is its structure. After thinking about the movie for quite a while it seems to me that it's built around the reference to Fyodor Dostoevsky's novel ""Crime and Punishment"" (I.E. the murder scene). However, it's not really an adaptation as the scene doesn't serve the same purpose in the film and in the novel.<br/><br/>The first three quarters of the film, the romantic intrigue, go by very naturally. Chris' decision to murder Nola is very awkward and I can't help thinking that Allen wanted to make a direct reference to Dostoevsky and just couldn't figure out a way of including it in his film. Maybe an extra half hour in the middle could have helped?"

"daviddesancho","6","6","22","14 November 2005"," Another disappointing work by a formerly great author
","I have found 'Match Point' as disappointing as other promising Woody Allen releases in the last years. The critics in Spain spoke about a comeback to the times of 'Crimes and misdemeanors', one of his best movies, because of the darkness in the argument, or the link to the Russian classic 'Crime and punishment'. In fact, the argument of the film has some things in common with that of the late eighties movie: a guy that appears to be happily married, keeps an affair with another woman that demands of him more than he is willing to give. In this case, the guy, Chris Wilton, is not a renowned dentist but a low-class Irish tennis teacher that arrives in London, starts giving classes and relates to a wealthy family via one of his pupils, Tom Hewett, and most importantly, with his sister Chloe. Chris and Chloe get married but by the time the wedding occurs he is already involved in a passionate relation with Tom's seductive girlfriend, Nola. At the beginning of the movie, it is interesting to see how Wilton gets gradually engaged to the Hewetts. You never know how sincere his intentions are, a little bit like in Pasolini's 'Theorem' (besides, Jonathan Rhys-Meyers is such an inexpressive actor that it is difficult to catch a sight of what lies beneath his character). Soon, a sexual relationship more explicit than in other Allen's movies begins, and despite the arguable charms of Rhys-Meyers and Johansson ---they look more like models than actors---, the film turns boring and plain. None of the passion that the characters should feel reaches the audience. At the end of the movie, Wilton gets gradually in despair because of his infidelity ---in fact, Nola gets pregnant--- and decides to end with the problem in the Raskolnikov-style. Then comes the scene of the crime, and for the first time in near two hours we feel some tension. It is a matter of opinion if the merits are of Woody or another guy called Fjodor. The citing game is excellent: the shotgun under the coat, the knock on the door, the robbery, the killing... A comforting prove of the sleepy talent of Woody Allen. I won't say more about the ending. Just a few thoughts about the film. Why do Allen's main characters lack any interest nowadays? Probably because the bourgeoisie that he has always portrayed in his films is much less interesting now than some fifteen years ago. Why did he choose so inexpressive actors? Maybe because they are perfect to look like people from covers of magazines, instead of complex individuals. Why didn't he decide to film 'Crime and punishment'? Maybe next year."

We both commented on how we'd been waiting for the story line to begin and only gave up hope when the credits went up on the screen. This film is one of the worst I have ever viewed, not only did have very little structure, but it was completely unpredictable and the actions of certain characters were completely unforeseen. I was hoping for some morals or principles to come into practise at some stage during the film, but it continued to be frustratingly flawed. I went to the cinema to enjoy myself but was actually quite disturbed by it.<br/><br/>(Look away if you actually want to view this film, because I'm about to ruin the plot.) I was going for romantic comedy type, instead the main character has an affair all through his marriage, gets his mistress pregnant, doesn't tell his wife when the opportunity arises, but instead ruthlessly murders his mistress and an old lady in cold blood. He then isn't even convicted, only cries a little and that's it. In the meanwhile his innocent (admittedly slightly sycophantic) wife and her family are celebrating the birth of his son. The film ends. What was Woody Allen thinking? There is no comeuppance for the murderer, the film doesn't even end with a proper conclusion. This film rates as very poor, in my opinion, because it has no plot and consists of very little 'good film material'. At no stage in this film did I smile, laugh or feel any happiness within.

There is one clever plot twist, one excellent confrontational dialog scene. The rest is treading water, much of it with head barely above water. If you know Allen's films, and especially Crimes and Misdemeanors, this film will disappoint and depress you as a cynical commercial shadow of that great film. If you are new to Woody Allen the film may entertain in a superficial PBS kind of way. But don't be fooled by the hype. This is not the return of the great Woody Allen of years past.

Some Allen's movies hit the perfect chord and are so impressively flawless that they always make you feel like you've seen nothing of Allen yet.<br/><br/>Out of the forty-something movies he made, I have certainly watched three dozens and well, I wasn't prepared by how good ""Match Point"" would be. Even halfway through the film, I didn't know where it was going, but near the third act, I knew I was watching a Woody Allen film with capital A. The ending made me realize it was more serious than that, it was probably one of his best. I had to watch it a second time then a third time, and I maintain that it's one of his best, and for two reasons.<br/><br/>On a technical level (to get through it), this is a film that is flawlessly acted and scenes flow with such fluidity that when you see it again, you can see that there's no detail that doesn't play a pivotal role, yet without its inclusion feeling contrived or artificial. The second aspect is the way the ending makes the beginning's point, the film has a message to tell from the story and it's not until the last five minutes that we realize how brilliantly Allen toyed with our expectations, making the point we expected him to make but not as we thought.<br/><br/>I will get back to the story because being too talkative about the ending might spoil the surprise. The film is about an Irish tennis teacher Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), a young man with dashing good looks who gets a job in an English country club. He meets Tom Hewett (Matthew Goode), they exchange a few words about music, earning him an immediate invitation to an Opera concert. Tom comes from a rich family (the father, played by Brian Cox ""own"" companies) and they seem to like Chris, and the daughter, Chloe (Emily Mortimer) instantly falls in love with him. He gets Chloe and a job in Daddy's company as collateral gift. This is like Cinderella story in speed motion.<br/><br/>And there's no catch actually, this is no Faustian pact of anything of that sort, Chris has basically everything a sensitive man would look for, especially one of his background, a steady job, a loving and pretty wife and money, so Chris is the one who looks for trouble. He meets Nora, Tom's fiancée, a sexy aspiring actress, and it's not love but lust-at-first-sight, Chris is invaded by an immediate and intense desire to possess her. And since their luscious interactions behind the ping pong table, we know it's a matter of time before they succumb to the call of lust, catalyzed by anger, booze and rain.<br/><br/>But this sexual intercourse has only intensified his appetite. The situation gets tricky when he realizes he can't renounce his lifestyle either. This is not the Cornelian conflict between duty and passion, but between greed and sex, the two drivers of society. In a way, Chris is the pure embodiment of modernity in its most pervert form, like when he marries Chloe and gets Nora pregnant. I already had feelings of déjà vu but the pregnancy subplot immediately reminded me of a classic of American Cinema ""A Place in the Sun"". Yet the film was nominated for Best Original Screenplay, maybe it's a way to acknowledge that the ""American Tragedy"" classic is a universal story with infinite variations.<br/><br/>Allen also seems to have borrowed elements from his critically acclaimed ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"", which featured a similar situation but was more about religion, moral and the dilemma between reason and conscience. In ""Match Point"", Woody chooses a different angle, a sort of existential tennis match between work and luck. The film opens with the sight of a tennis ball swinging back and forth like so many up and downs that life has to provide and then the ball hits the net and bounce, it's all about the side of the court it will fall in: one means victory, another means defeat.<br/><br/>Life is as simple as that and I'm in total agreement because I used to believe in chronically bad luck, on being screwed, but I realized life was made through a few hit-or-miss moments and all the hard work of the world can see its effect canceled if you make the wrong move at the wrong time, sometimes you're lucky, sometimes not but never underestimate the potentiality of luck within the bad luck. Woody Allen who loved to play or portray unlucky schmucks caught in the midst of modernity, focuses here in the case of a particularly lucky character and we wait for the moment it changes. Maybe this is why it doesn't feel like an Allen film, but I'm not even sure there's such a thing as a typical Allen film.<br/><br/>I had just seen a masterpiece about 'bad luck' called ""A Serious Man"" and now I have its polar opposite with ""Match Point"". The two movies have interesting things to say about the way we control our own fates, whether under the direction of God or hazard, which also echoes the religious undertones of ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"", but someone said ""Hazard is the anonymous way to call God"", sometimes, it might be the anonymous way to call the devil as well, and I will say no more."

","There are a few candidates for the nadir of Woody Allen's film career. This one takes the biscuit, scoffs it, then hoovers up all the Jaffa Cakes to boot.<br/><br/>This from The Guardian's ""sport on TV"" columnist, Martin Kelner: ""This may be not just Woody Allen's worst film but the worst film ever made... as though the great Woody had seen a bunch of Hugh Grant-Working Title movies and decided he liked them, but without all the gritty realism."" He is not wrong.<br/><br/>Cringe through the opening hour, as the love quadrangle (mixed doubles) develops, as phoned in by the tea boy at the Ministry Of The Bleedin' Obvious. If you get through that without turning off or leaving, you will be treated to some left turns which beggar belief, plus the aforementioned (and infuriating) inaccuracies about the, ah, ""London Police"".<br/><br/>Poor performances by all the leads - especially the self-regarding Ms Johansson.

","The first time I watched Match Point I found Jonathan Rhys-Meyers too cool, too unemotional, but the second and third times I watched the film the grand subtleties of his performance became more evident. He does appear aloof, too smooth, always spot on with the correct response...but the cracks in his polish show through more and more until the climax of the film where he reveals his inner life before smoothing it over again. He shows great promise for the future as a top actor. He is, of course, stunningly attractive, is everyone else in the film. The visual control and setting are masterful and surprisingly different from Allen's previous work. He displays an astounding degree of departure from his familiar style in a highly successful way. There were traces of comedy throughout but they were displayed through the characters' English humor rather than by situation or dialog. The story line if fantastic as well - the script is as polished as a diamond bracelet. Quite the powerhouse."

","There is such a brilliant hook in Woody Allen's *Match Point* that to say anything about it would ruin its impact.<br/><br/>So I'm going to anyway. It's the woman in me.<br/><br/>Writer-director Allen leans so heavily on the tennis idiom (from opening the film with a tennis analogy dependent on luck  a ball nicking the top edge of the net - to the lead character being an ex-tennis pro, to the title of the film itself) that he hooks us wholeheartedly into the idea that any ball that nicks the net needs to go *over* the net to win.<br/><br/>Then the movie does exactly the opposite. To say any more would be far too feminine <br/><br/>Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) is that ex-tennis pro turned instructor at an exclusive London club, where  as luck would have it  he befriends a painfully upper-class British tennis student, Tom Hewett (Matthew Goode), who invites him to an opera, and whose sister Chloe (Emily Mortimer) then falls for Chris and whose fiancé, Nola (Scarlett Johansson), Chris falls for.<br/><br/>In a situation which might have easily degenerated into a tiresome love-quadrangle farce, *Match Point* instead adopts a stance contrary to that of any given formulaic ""American"" Love Story. In other words, it is not a complete waste of time, brain cells, funding, resources and talent.<br/><br/>How Woody Allen, a steadfast New Yorker, managed to capture the upper-class British idiom so concisely is a wonder. Sure, employing British actors helps, but the writing seems inherently British from the outset. For example, when Nola comments on her fiancé being handsome and asks whether Chris also finds him handsome, without any hesitation, embarrassment, or sophomoric gay innuendo, Chris replies, ""Very."" Decidedly NOT an American response.<br/><br/>Further, in crafting the film on location in London, the censorious MPAA (Motion Picture Association of America) seem to exert less of a stranglehold on ""injurious"" themes, especially their insulting edict, ""no crime shall go unpunished."" When unpunished crime, abortion or infidelity arise in *Match Point*, there is no moralism attached, no proselytizing or justification. Whereas wide-release American movies have reached a point where they must explain or justify every action for their dim-witted, lazy demographic (thereby becoming a collective insult to their own audiences by their very pandering existence), this movie floats free of those strictures, and is crisper, more mature and infinitely more powerful for it.<br/><br/>Realizing that operatic themes were nothing more than the pulp fiction of their day, Allen slyly uses the melodrama of opera as a backdrop, enabling him to push the pulp envelope. When Chris Wilton is forced into deciding which woman he wants to retain in his life, the faux-operatic extremities he takes are congruent with the opera soundtrack enhancing the surrealism. Like Mozart's *Don Giovanni*, Chris remains unrepentant; like Verdi's *La Traviata*, his lover is a whore, and like Eastwood's *High Plains Drifter* he's going to resolve the problem in very stylish pants.<br/><br/>In true European idiom, Chris thankfully does not assess which woman he ""loves"" more; he assesses his future - and acts accordingly. At last: Truth in a movie! Though the American Teen Power Phrase ""Do you love her?"" was brought into play for the Great Unwashed to sink their blunted teeth into, it is never dwelt upon, this story intelligently illustrating how codifying or measuring ""love"" does not resolve harsh realities. Unlike the formulaic drivel that informs ninety-percent of character motivation in films, Chris' final, fateful decision is not made because he feared losing love, but because he feared losing his enablement.<br/><br/>Like a more intense Ewan McGregor, Rhys Meyers' aloof intensity and reptilian charm defines the term ""smooth criminal."" We discover how smooth in the film's final frames.<br/><br/>The UK cast  down to the smallest bit parts  are flawless, including Brian Cox and Penelope Wilton as Chris' in-laws, and Ewen Bremner and James Nesbitt as flustered detectives.<br/><br/>Scarlett Johansson is almost not ready to be placed amongst this cast, as her jarring American acting training clashes irreconcilably with the fluid ease of the UK ensemble. Satirizing Shatner has become passé, for what comedian Kevin Pollak termed his ""pause acting,"" yet Shatner merely accentuated a certain American Method. In American movies it goes unnoticed. Held against the naturalistic European Method, it is virtually unwatchable, Johansson's most irritating Shatner occurring during the scene where she opens up to Rhys Meyers after a failed audition, Rhys Meyers' potent uninflected replies colliding with her heavily inflected ""acting"" responses. Though she shines with a flirtatious, needy light in this scene, all that keeps springing to mind is, ""Khaaaaan!"" <br/><br/>Allen's subtexts in this movie are hilarious for their blackness: As soon as Chris' wife makes ""getting pregnant"" her *raison d'etre* and as soon as his lover actually *gets* pregnant, they both become insufferable. On one side, mechanical, passionless sex, on the other, maddening whining and threats, to the point where no amount of bra-less t-shirt-wearing will save her. It is unlikely that women will ever glean the subtext: that it is not sex, marriage or infidelity that drives a man to madness  it is anything to do with pregnancy. Then there is the deeper irony which Woman will refuse to see as long as the species must procreate: that the very thing which she believes seals her future with her mate  pregnancy - in actuality rends his psyche from hers irreconcilably.<br/><br/>Via Woody Allen's magnificent art, that's coming straight from the Man in all of us..."
"thedwang","5","2","5","5 July 2006"," Unfathomable
","This movie had potential but it seems Woody Allen wrote himself into a corner and needed a way out. I put myself into the shoes of the main character and could never see myself acting as he did. The outcome was convenient but not believable. I am a Woody Allen fan but was not a fan of this movie. The musical score and British undertones were more worthy than the lifeless plot. It's a good thing that Scarlett Johansson was cast, otherwise there would of been no reason to watch. This might be Woody Allen's way to say that the English are cavalier and/or dumb. I doubt it, but after seeing the outcome of the movie I cannot help but think anything else."

","If you don't know by now, ""Match Point"" is such a ripoff of ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" that Woody oughta be censured for plaigiarising his own work. If this man, admittedly a cinematic genius, can't come up with something more original, then he needs to follow Paris Hilton into the pop music genre. How hard could it be to digress, if even so slightly, into a different story arc than the well-beaten trail he's already traveled? I've always waited impatiently for the Woodman's next entry in the cinema pantheon, but if this is the best he can do, maybe he should just pack it in.<br/><br/>Woody, it's time to stop borrowing from yourself. If Paul Simon can do it, so can you. Come up with something truly original, and your fans will follow. If not - I can't even imagine an ""if not."" Please...PLEASE put your thinking cap on.

"ttoshko","4","2","5","22 June 2006"," Bad plagiarism. Bad story composition.
","This film is a bad copy of a Dostoyevski's book (Crime and Punishment, in particular). It is written and directed in a way to suggest deeper meaning, but it has not anything deep within it.<br/><br/>While we expected something to be justified or explained along the story evolved, there is no such counterpart in the presented work. It is plain simple pure Hollywood story without essence.<br/><br/>This film is not evenly distributed - or the end comes too soon. If Woody Allen thought of something else for an end, and it could not be fitted in the expected length of a classical film (we saw that the film was 2:04h which is quite long) that could explain, in a way, the stupid end. Every other explanation is unacceptable.<br/><br/>My personal opinion is that the machinery behind the Woody Allen is big and fully commercial, but he is dead and gone altogether. The machinery waits for anything he wants and realizes it, relying just on he's name to sell it big. It is a classical story, seen too many times. For him, the best would be either to go into religious waters in order to calm himself, or just to peacefully accept the fact that he is old and gone.<br/><br/>Tehnically he could do some other projects, but since the life energy and creativity have evidently left him, he should not pursue the film business anymore.<br/><br/>Film does not deserve the hype about it. Apart from Scarlett Johansson's beauty, there is really not much to be seen in it.<br/><br/>This and such films are lowering the quality of certain film category. Which category is that? It is not strictly commercial, but it is heavily involved on making money. It is not the art category, but it relies on major population which prefers art films. So, inside this category, one would expect more intriguing, deeper, more markant story.<br/><br/>I really thought that the film would make some point to me.<br/><br/>And it did. The point made was this: ""Stick to the books if you want to find deeper grounds"". As simple as that."
"earthward","8","2","5","23 May 2006"," surprisingly good
","Given the sexy, suspense thriller image that marketers have created for this movie I went into it expecting something formulaic, high on action and sex and low on character development. I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was a thought-provoking story driven by subtle characterizations and allusions to Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment. The interactions of the characters are intriguing to watch and grounded in realism and the acting is mostly strong throughout. <br/><br/>A voice-over at the beginning suggests that luck may be more of a determining factor in life than is often thought and the events which follow support this central idea. At the same time the film explores the familiar themes of obsession and love vs. ambition. Whether the movie intends to be taken seriously with respect to any of these themes is hard to tell. Unfortunately any serious artistic aims are undermined towards the end, where real-life credibility takes a back-seat the clever machinations of the plot. <br/><br/>Though artistically less sound, this movie is nevertheless a worthwhile ride as it manages to be both very entertaining and thought-provoking at the same time."

","The theme of although skill is involved, but luck does have something to do with it was apparent in almost every aspect for Chris. He starts out in the movie as a tennis instructor, and eventually gets a job at a business firm from one of his clients/girlfriends father. You think life couldn't get better for this guy until he gets a mistress, in which no one suspects him with. The movie flawlessly binds his day to day life as a loving husband and business man while he also is shown as a desperate fool at the end of his rope looking for a way out. Scarlett Johanson's performance was flawless as Nola who was also Chris' mistress and once business partners fiancé. This is a great movie about desperation and lust. It should be viewed by all and is in my opinion Woody Allen's best directorial job I've seen."

"noralee","5","2","5","13 January 2006"," A Beautiful Looking Pastiche of Many Films and Literary Works
","""Match Point"" is such a pastiche of many films and literary works, some self-referentially preened, that I occupied myself identifying them throughout the movie. <br/><br/>Starting with a repeating visual motif of tennis balls across the net recalling a classic image from ""Blow Up,"" scenes at a Wimbledon-like club near the opening seem straight out of Evelyn Waugh, such as in ""Bright Young Things."" Two guys exchange a freighted conversation about loving opera I thought for sure was a coded gaydar filter so we'd be seeing them either on the down low or bi, especially as Matthew Goode is channeling a young Rupert Everett. <br/><br/>But, no, Jonathan Rhys-Meyers is more conventionally manipulative as we see him reading ""Crime and Punishment,"" and the Penguin equivalent of Cliff Notes of Dostoevsky for analysis (and poshing up his native accent even as Goode keeps teasingly calling him ""Irish""). <br/><br/>Courting is done, as in many references to Woody Allen's own ""Crimes and Misdemeanors,"" by seeing old black and white movies during the day (portentously ""Rififi (Du rififi chez les hommes)"") or foreign ones (ironically class-conscious ""The Motorcycle Diaries (Diarios de motocicleta)"" with a rich girlfriend of an ambitious guy who makes quite different decisions) though this film actually focuses very little on Dreiser's class differentials of the similar ""American Tragedy"").<br/><br/>The setting is supposed to be contemporary, but other than some frank discussion of birth control and fertility treatments, these folks love opera and collect classic cars. Not an iPod in sight and computers are something mysteriously used at vague jobs. It would make sense if Penelope Wilton's tippling matriarch was the source of inherited wealth and Brian Cox's patriarch a wealthy business tycoon, recalling Edith Wharton, let alone F. Scott Fitzgerald, but that would make too much sense, as we're supposed to assume this is an old, inbred family. This seems to be parallel to Allen's oeuvre as ""Age of Innocence"" is to Scorcese and ""Gosford Park"" is to Altman's, but their period specificity added the weight of historical social changes to come that this film is lacking.<br/><br/>Instead, what we get is basically another take on the character of ""The Talented Mr. Ripley,"" and Rhys-Meyers is much better than Matt Damon, as sexy as Alain Delon was in the ""Purple Noon (Plein soleil)"" interpretation and far more emotional than both, in his lust and in his chutzpah. He dynamically carries the last part of the movie by creating the kind of villain where the whole audience first starts rumbling about him to each other and then yelling to him on the screen. His Bergman-like confrontation with ghosts, while visual, is far less effective than the moral and religious discussions in ""Crimes and Misdemeanors.""<br/><br/>Up until her last few Shelley Winters-in-""A Place in the Sun""-channeling hysteria scenes, Scarlett Johansson has some of the smartest and sexiest seduction dialog in any of Allen's films. But her character stops making a lot of sense.<br/><br/>Emily Mortimer pretty much plays the same love-lorn victim she did in ""Young Adam"" and doesn't get to expand into the further tender vulnerability she projected in ""Lovely and Amazing.""<br/><br/>With the film co-produced by BBC, it's nice to see wonderful actors from TV series such as ""Spooks (MI-5),"" ""Murphy's Law"" and ""Prime Suspect,"" who add authenticity heft in small roles. <br/><br/>The production design and music are way over the top. The continuous opera excerpts, sounding like they are playing from old '78's, are a change from Allen's usual jazz, but seem a forced exaggerated theatricality (even as Rhys-Meyers amusingly uses the decidedly more middle-brow mystery ""The Woman in White"" as an alibi). With one of the characters interested in contemporary art, he is constantly surrounded by paintings that comment on his actions, such as a large red rooster emphasizing his cuckoldry and another with the word ""ache"" writ large across it, etc.<br/><br/>The best elements of the film are ironically visualizing the elements of luck and chance, as applied to tennis, fertility and life.<br/><br/>This film looks beautiful and has nothing new to show or say."
"ucarr68","4","5","20","25 December 2005"," Does ""Match Point"" Express Atheism?
","I'm a Woody Allen fan who experienced ""Match Point"" as an interesting and watchable failure. Critics and the general public have been raving about the movie, saying Allen's work is back in top form. Since I've experienced Allen's greatness in such films as ""Sleeper,"" ""Annie Hall,"" ""Manhattan"" and ""Hanna and her Sisters,"" I feel funny being out of sync with the consensus on this one, so I'm posting my reaction in hopes of learning something about the gap; perhaps my understanding will change and the gap will close.<br/><br/>It seems to me that the story has three acts, with the first act being unusually long, and the last two acts being unusually short. In the first act, which details Irish outsider Chris Wilton's rise to wealth via the British upper crust Hewett family, the narrative style is a familiar Allen staple: the character-driven, relationship drama. During this stretch, the movie has a straightforward predictability which, I realized with chagrin, plods along. All of this was enjoyable, but I had to admit to myself that everything was superficial; only the surfaces of the characters were being presented. Here's the reason: in the face of a tissue of Wilton lies covering his ambition, usury and adultery, the Hewett family remains cheerfully clueless; he's a clever cad who thinks fast on his feet, and, for the sake of drama, one or more of the Hewetts need to be his match; mother Hewett's dislike of potential daughter-in-law Nola Rice, the American actress fiancé of son Tom is misplaced; were she skeptical about Wilton instead, and closing in on his deception fast, the first act would have the rising tension and suspense it sorely lacks.<br/><br/>Act two makes a sharp turn away from the relationship drama, alternatively plunging headlong into Hitchcock territory. The scenes in the latter part of act one, which have Nola Rice, mistress to the married Wilton, confronting the inner man, crackle with tension and dramatic interest because she's a match for this wicked careerist. Sadly, these scenes are few and far between. Even worse, they occasion the desperate turn to violence by Wilton. When he picks up one of the Hewett shotguns, Nola falls prey to the buckshot, and thus the active drama, the present excitement of the movie dies. Again, the action is straightforward and predictable. In act two, without a proper emotional foundation having been laid, we're suddenly immersed in a police procedural that asks such questions as: Will he do it? How will he do it? Will he get away with it? All of this plot-driven, physical action has a jarring, awkward relationship to the character-driven, psychological action of the first act.<br/><br/>Act three, which makes a sharp turn away from the previous two acts, belly flops into the realm of Bergman metaphysics, where it flails about blindly. The murderous Wilton has pangs of conscience, so the ghosts of his victims confront him with silly, superfluous verbal recaps of the action seen just prior. There is a brilliantly structured payoff to the movie's grand theme: we're immersed within a cosmic randomness that alternates between lucky and unlucky. Because Wilton gets the lucky bounce of life, he escapes human justice. His reward? A life term in hell.<br/><br/>With the exception of the scenes involving Nola Rice, the uncouth, western American, Allen has created, by design, an emotionally flat narrative in which a clever, lucky man buries himself alive beneath the contours of a dignified, public image. In my opinion, this hardly makes the case for a capricious universe. I'm inclined to think Allen, by stepping in and blocking human justice, condemns his protagonist to a far bleaker fate. So there's a backfire because the moral universe of this story, rather than dissolving, deepens.<br/><br/>Allen's randomness-as-luck tells me that he wants to show our universe as a godless place where outrageous turns of fortune have no systematic causes, where no understandings, rational or otherwise, explain the details that fill our lives. Throughout the narrative of this movie, he's at great pains to insulate his protagonist from the customary, expected consequences of his actions. In so doing, Allen is intent upon decimating all rationalistic, moral viewpoints. For me, this film, along the narrow track of moral anarchy, displays an impressive, brute force of intellect. He has thought his way into a clever, structurally elegant deconstruction of moral order. He has also cast off the gossamer magic of his great films.<br/><br/>I dare speculate that Allen is a deeply angry man. His anger, I think, is directed towards a God he hates enough to deny. The God-hate, I suspect, has fueled the magic of the great Allen films. In those films, Allen balances along a tightrope of God belief/unbelief, sending up an ether of smoke from the white-hotness of his rage. As long as God is in the picture, however faintly and begrudgingly, the picture has magic. Within the presence of the magic, the rage alchemizes into world-class humor. As a member of a persecuted group, Allen stares down the face of hell, in the process transforming himself into a funny man delightful to be with. But now, without God, what remains is plodding mechanism. So the real price of the greatness is not endurance of the rage, but endurance of the unexplainable otherness called God. The demanding presence of God fatigues the artist, and the art dies. In the great films, Allen's anger is divine, but now, in this new film, it's merely human."

And as for the Woody Allen, well, he did this material in a much stronger, more persuasive fashion with Crimes & Misdemeanors. As a friend of mine said, it's ""real estate porn"" and not much else.

","Allen's little atheistic one-liners and musings were always a nice change from the religious baloney we get in other movies. MP's basic point isn't a theme as trite as fidelity (as some people here seem to think) but the factor of luck that dominates everyone's life from the word go. Meyers got away with murder merely because the ring didn't fall into the Thames river. Sure, it's a bit fortune-cookie-ish, the ""grand"" way in which this startling new philosophical revelation was presented, i.e. it can't be anything new to anyone above the age of 12 (excepting morons), but it gave Allen an opportunity to make a dull drama once again (after ""Interiors""). As we know, all comedians are miserable bastards who strive to be taken seriously, which they all seem to think can only be achieved through the channeling of their energy into drama. How stupid. Or perhaps writing a drama is much easier than coming up with something funny. Well, no ""perhaps"" about it.<br/><br/>A romantic drama, no less, for at least 90 minutes of this over-long 2-hour movie. What was he thinking? MP has the plot of a typical movie-of-the-week man-cheats-wife-and-it-all-ends-in-murder TV drama, only with marginally better acting and dialogue. Meyers is a poor boy who's made his way through tennis, he gets into a very rich family, he gets fatally attracted to his future brother-in-law's fiancée, things start getting complicated etc... Most of the movie is Meyers lying to his wife or having sex with Johansson, all of this interspersed with surprisingly stilted dialogue which reveals Allen's inability to write for straight characters. And let's not forget all the coincidences...<br/><br/>The theme of luck serves as a very convenient excuse for all the cheap plot-devices that had characters bumping into one another in the streets of London, which isn't exactly a small Welsh mining town. Clever, Woody, clever. Nevertheless, whether you have an excuse for it or not, it's always lazy and unoriginal writing to employ such clichés/tricks.<br/><br/>But forget luck. Now we come to the REAL purpose behind this movie: let's face it, MP was written and made as a simple excuse for Woody to film his latest female obsession - Scarlett Johansson - having sex scenes. (""Artistic muse"", my a**...) Many directors have tried this sort of thing, and some even got lucky by hooking up with the star bimbo. Of course, Woody is far too old and funny-looking (trying to be diplomatic here) for Scarlett to help turn his burning-desire/fantasy into reality. They'll never become a couple, but God knows WA will be trying for years to come... (""Scarlett, honey, I have a new movie for you. Will you please play a starving, nymphomaniac hooker?"" ""Of course, I will, Woody. You know that it's, like, always a huge honour to work with an artist like you, and stuff!"") Draw your own conclusions as to what Woody was doing in his trailer on the days when the sex scenes with Scarlett were being shot (no pun intended)... (Damn, Hollywood is full of dysfunctional morons...)<br/><br/>Intentional or not, MP reveals the full extent of WA's decadence and lack of morality. The theme of casually cheating on your partner with your best friend's wife/husband is nothing new to Woody. (""Husbands & Wives"", as just one example.) He always presents it as something that isn't so bad. In fact, he even makes the cheaters likable. No wonder. After all, this is the man who MARRIED HIS DAUGHTER, lest we forget. Woody Allen the private person has absolutely no scruples whatsoever, hence his relatively sympathetic portrayal of two selfish adulterers, Johansson and Meyers, is not a surprise.<br/><br/>The casting is problematic too. Meyers, who appears in just about every scene, simply isn't capable of carrying a 2-hour movie. He has the charisma of a fish. Besides, we never quite understand what exactly attracts the ""wild"" Scarlett to him; he is like a lifeless android, always dull and polite. It was also predictable that the ghosts of Meyers' victims would appear at some point. Allen's fanatical devotion to the Swedish charlatan, critics' darling, and gloom-and-doom suicidario, Ingmar Bergman, is on record... Check out the poster for MP: there's a hint of Bergmanesqueness there. So blatant, so shameless.<br/><br/>Thank God the tennis scenes were sparse. If I had been forced to watch the very unathletic Meyers hit those lousy ground strokes another minute more, I'd have freaked out. Isn't there a single male actor out there who can play just one shot properly? Pathetic. You can't show an average player hit his mediocre shots, and then expect to have us believe that he almost became a pro..."

He has a comfortable life with his soon to be wife but is only interested in his friend's fiancé and that's what leads to his downfall. I have not been a huge fan of Woody Allen, but after watching Match Point, I think that I might pay a little more attention to his films. This is a very interesting film with great acting from the whole cast especially Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Scarlett Johansson, and Emily Mortimer. The screenplay written by Allen was pretty original actually and most of the dialogue was neatly written out. The direction also was good and I like some of the camera shots that Allen pulled out. I like how the film was pretty sappy in the beginning and as things start to turn out bad halfway through, it got darker and built up a lot of suspense. Usually Woody Allen makes comedies and happy ending romances but this is a totally different outlook on his films. Overall, this is a great film that put Woody Allen out of his slump and showed us his best side. I highly recommend it.<br/><br/>Hedeen's Outlook: 8.5/10 ***+ B+"

","What if Roskolnikov was blessed with a little luck? Woody Allen's brilliant rendition of Fyodor Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment, Match Point (2005), comes close to answering that question. The film is a quiet abandon of Allen's classic style of quirky and paranoiac storytelling. The staple concrete Manhattan backdrop, that we have come to expect from a Woody Allen flick, has been replaced by the damp grey-white overcast of the London sky. Even the cartoonish banter between the classic Woody Allen characters has taken a side-seat to highly textured dialogue between multidimensional characters. All in all, if it weren't for the ten-second flash of his name in the opening credits, I would have never guessed that Woody Allen wrote and directed this film.<br/><br/>We first meet the protagonist Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), a modern-day Roskolnikov, and would-be tennis pro turn tennis instructor, as he enters the filthy-rich world of British aristocracy. We see Chris as a self-made Irishman, who rises from the poorness of his background learning to play the rich man's game  tennis. He soon befriends Tom Hewitt (Matthew Goode) and is introduced into the life of upper-class decadence, during which he meets, and becomes romantically involved with, Tom's sister Chloe (Emily Mortimer). Chris's will is slowly bent, as he is coerced into the Hewitt family business. During this time, he chances upon the breathtaking Nola Rice (Scarlett Johansson), the fiancée of Tom Hewitt. Soon begins a carefully constructed love-triangle, which through a very Hitchcock-like style of suspense, is cast into motion, one step ahead of the viewer. The anxiety once donned by the classic Woody Allan character, is now offered to the audience to wear, and just like a tennis ball in a rally, the spectator is made to watch the tension bounce back and forth from one character to another.<br/><br/>I'm normally not a big fan of Woody Allan movies, however Match Point definitely surpassed all my expectations. Many critics have viewed this work as proof of the fading director's resurrection. I view it as a piece of solid storytelling from a one of the greatest directors of our time in the winter of his career. Match Point is one of the best films to come out of 2005. Obviously, the movie is not for the average moviegoer, but if you are a fan of fine film-making, definitely check it out.<br/><br/>Similar movies: Closer (2004), Rope (1948), Last Tango in Paris (1972), Sabrina (1954), In Good Company (2004), The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999)"

","Woody Allen moved to Europe from Manhattan and he did not miss. Here, in Europe, he did a great job. Allen came back to those kinds of movies, that differs from his others (I mean his look-alike sexual comedies). He took at least two masterpieces (Dostoevsky's ""Crime and Punishment"" and Dryzer's ""American Tragedy"") and mixed them to a brand-new cocktail, that turned out to be an explosive kind of thing. Allen red Dostoevsky's novel visa-versa - from its ending to its beginning, from character's torches of what he has done to the moment when he had actually done it. And it turned out that the story perfectly fits to Dryzer's Tragedy. Well, who else - except a New York intellectual - could possibly do that? Allen creates his own story of what those two great masters has wrote. He shows nowadays reality in his movie and modern character. But the most incredible fact is that Allen does not punish his hero as well as he does not find him guilty. Allen declaims - this what we have - this kind of people, in this kind of world!"

I hadn't seen a Woody Allen film in a long time but was encouraged by the good buzz Match Point received. But I'm done with Woody Allen. Match Point killed whatever was left of my fondness for his work.<br/><br/>The story, hinging as it does on a wealthy Brit hiring a tennis pro as a high level manager in his operation, is not remotely credible. Every scene screams self-consciously, ""this is a scene from a movie."" Woody's writing and direction render the characters lifeless and I couldn't see any effort by any of the actors to individuate their character or in anyway make them other than ""disapproving mother"" ""rich drinker"" or ""nervous actress."" I've never seen Jonathan Rhys Meyers act before but I won't be rushing out to view his work anytime soon. I saw no inner life in his character at all.<br/><br/>When was the last time Woody Allen wrote a believable line of dialog? All of his characters speak in the same cadence, with the same vocabulary. Not a syllable that comes out of their mouths is anything but a ""Woody Allen line."" Worse, he has every actor in this movie deliver his or her line in the same smug, oddly flat, tone.<br/><br/>The only reason I gave this movie a 3 is because it is real estate porn.

I originally wanted to see this in theaters because the trailer looked awesome, however I never did, so I was really happy to see this masterpiece when it came to DVD, and it's full of incredible plot twists as well, plus I absolutely loved the dialog!. This should be on the top 250, and while it may seem draggy at 1st, if you stick with it you will be rewarded, plus like the tennis ball does your luck can go over the net, or not. It was completely unpredictable for me throughout, and it was fun to see Scarlett Johansson's character develop throughout, plus while I was hoping Jonathan Rhys Meyers would get caught because he was such an unbelievable prick(in my opinion), the ending still worked pretty well, even it didn't give me what I wanted. I will definitely be checking out more of Woody Allern's work after loving this film,and Emily Mortimer did fantastic in her role, plus I loved the old fashioned music it had in it as well.<br/><br/>It's extremely well made and written, and there are many shocking and suspenseful moments as well, plus it will leave you thinking long after you are finished watching it. Penelope Wilton was incredibly annoying as Chloe's(Mortimer) mother, but played her role extremely well,and I really loved the setting as well, plus Woody really has an incredible mind, as he is just so imaginative and creative. It also has an important message about adultery,and while I really couldn't feel any sympathy for the characters, they were still very likable(except for Meyers), plus I couldn't believe what Meyers character did, and that he would resort to that, as it just shocked me. This deserves all the praise it gets, and yes while it is talky, it was always interesting, plus the most important scene in the movie for me may be when Meyers tries to throw the watch into the river, but it hits the railing instead. This was my 1st Woody Allen experience and I must say it was an incredible one, and if you Haven't seen it, please do so immediately you shouldn't regret it!. <br/><br/>The Direction is outstanding!. Woody Allen does an outstanding! job here with wonderful camera work,excellent angles, using an awesome setting, and just keeping the film at an extremely engrossing pace, and doing everything else just perfect. <br/><br/>The Acting is top notch!. Jonathan Rhys Meyers is incredible here, he played an unbelievably selfish prick, that I despised,a gold digger in my opinion, but he was just so incredible at it, and as I said the things that he resorted too, just shocked me, he was one of the main reasons the movie was as good as it was, I just wished he didn't get away with it. Scarlett Johansson is also incredible here, she is incredibly gorgeous, and while she didn't have as much screen time as I would have liked she was incredible when on, I know some people thought her performance was very wooden, but I must say I disagree completely she was intense when needed to be, and played her role extremely well! (Scarlett Rules!!!!!!!). Emily Mortimer is fantastic in her role, her role wasn't anything special, but she did it with charm and likability, she also was very sweet, I really liked her, as she had fine chemistry with Meyers. Brian Cox is good as the father. Penelope Wilton is incredibly annoying but very effective, as the Mother. Matthew Goode is good as the best friend.

"Cineanalyst","6","1","2","26 September 2019"," Crime and No Punishment: Allen on Dostoevsky, Part II
","Generally considered one of Woody Allen's more atypical films, which being made outside of New York (in this case, London) makes that consideration true, I suppose, ""Match Point"" is in other ways similar to his ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" (1989) and later ""Irrational Man"" (2015), all of which contest the underlying philosophy of Fyodor Dostoevsky's novel ""Crime and Punishment."" The 1989 film only alluded to this with its play on the book's title, but ""Match Point"" more noticeably acknowledges Dostoevsky's influence by including a scene where the film's protagonist, Chris, is reading the novel, as well as ""The Cambridge Companion to Dostoevsky."" The patriarch of the Hewett family later remarks that Chris made insightful comments regarding the Russian author. Indeed, Chris goes on to test Raskolnikov's, the book's protagonist, theory regarding getting away with murder. The motive for the crime, however, is more akin to that of ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" rather than that of Raskolnikov, and ""Match Point"" also seems indebted to the oeuvre of Alfred Hitchcock, especially ""Strangers on a Train"" (1951) and ""Vertigo"" (1958).<br/><br/>As with one of the leads in Hitchcock's former film, Chris is a tennis player who plans to marry up, and both get involved in a murder plot. There's also the attention to symbolic objects: the lighter in ""Strangers on a Train,"" for instance, and the tennis ball and ring in ""Match Point."" There's no homosexual coding along the lines of Hitchcock's picture in Allen's, however, regardless of two men enjoying the opera and sleeping with the same woman. Meanwhile, the picture's movie romance and art gallery sequence shadow ""Vertigo."" As for ""Crimes and Misdemeanors,"" ""Match Point"" lifts the dilemma of a mistress who threatens to expose their affair to the wife. Both also exploit their crime as an atheistic antithesis to Dostoevsky's Orthodox conservatism. None of the comedy and cinematic reflexivity of the prior film is carried over, though. There is the spectatorship of opera, the musical ""The Woman in White,"" and an American actress, Scarlett Johansson, plays an American actress, but not much is done with any of that. Much more is made of social class here, however, which is more in line with Dostoevsky's prose and the movie's British setting. The Irish tennis-pro-turned-businessman and the struggling American actress are both the active and suspect characters in the drawing-room play of a life of leisure preoccupying the English and wealthy Hewett family.<br/><br/>Shared among Allen, Dostoevsky and Hitchcock are their inclusions of doubles motifs. In ""Match Point,"" there's the two players in tennis, the two lower-class foreigners, the two upper-class siblings and their two parents, the two men, as in ""Crimes and Misdemeanors,"" who both have affairs and marriages, each in this case causing two pregnancies, Chris's, like Raskolinikov's, and as planned in ""Strangers on a Train,"" two murders (well, three counting the pregnancy), and even two detectives. One man breaks off his engagement after impregnating his mistress, while the other decides to preserve his union by murdering his expecting lover, which recalls the duality of Allen and Martin Landau's characters in ""Crimes and Misdemeanors,"" the two protagonists in ""Strangers on a Train,"" Kim Novak's doppelgängers in ""Vertigo,"" and Raskolnikov and Svidrigaïlov in ""Crime and Punishment.""<br/><br/>Although this is all interesting material, ""Match Point"" is rather meandering, despite some critics' claim of it being a ""taut thriller."" Without the Dostoevsky foreshadowing, the crime would've seemed entirely out of place. The classism doesn't add anything, and the luck business seems overly simplistic compared to Allen's prior philosophizing. The dreary picture reflects its subject matter. And some of the borrowings here seem trite; there's even a make-out session in the rain, which I know it rains a lot in England, but had Allen just seen ""The Notebook"" (2004) or something? Nevertheless, after seeking a bunch of film adaptations after reading ""Crime and Punishment,"" I continue to be impressed that Allen more intelligently engages with the text, as well as other films, than do other filmmakers, whether of straightforward adaptations or inspired reworkings such as ""Match Point."""

He's stiff, wooden and uninvolving.<br/><br/>Maybe also, the style of the piece is not suited to Woody Allen's skills. The lies and deception give rise to tensions that are too predictable and not well portrayed. And the wheeling and dealing in the City contrasted with the calm of the country are not really at all like New York, where most of Allen's best movies are set. <br/><br/>It's been suggested that the closer you are to living in west London and the home counties, where most of the action is set, the less you tend to like the film. Well I live quite close and I certainly don't like it. <br/><br/>Scarlett Johansson I have not yet mentioned.

","Top tennis players are not generally notable culture-vultures- Jim Courier was allegedly much teased by his fellow-professionals for his habit of reading literary fiction such as Armistead Maupin's ""Tales of the City"" in the locker room- so heaven knows what the men's tour would have made of Chris Wilton, the central figure of this film, with his love of Dostoyevsky, Modernist art and Grand Opera.<br/><br/>As the film opens, Chris, who hates the stress of touring and realises he will never be a Grand Slam champion, has retired from professional tennis and is working as a coach at an exclusive London tennis club. Drawn together by their shared love of opera, he befriends a young man named Tom Hewett, one of his pupils at the club. Tom introduces Chris to his wealthy family, and before long everything seems to be going his way. Chris ends up married to Tom's sister Chloe and is given a job as an executive in the family firm.<br/><br/>""Match Point"" was written and directed by Woody Allen, but during the first half it bears little resemblance to what we have come to think of as a ""Woody Allen film"". It is set in London rather than New York, none of the characters are Jewish- Woody himself does not appear- and it contains little or no humour. For much of its length it resembles nothing so much as a melodramatic soap opera set among the moneyed classes, ""Westenders"" rather than ""Eastenders"". Despite his marriage, Chris cannot resist having an affair with Tom's ex-girlfriend Nola, a beautiful but struggling American actress. Nola, however, is not content with a mere affair. She wants Chris to divorce Chloe and marry her. He does not want to do any such thing but manages to string Nola along by making promises he has no intention of keeping. Matters come to a head when Nola reveals that she is pregnant and threatens to inform Chloe about the affair.<br/><br/>It is at this point that ""Match Point"" starts to resemble a Woody film, one Woody film in particular- ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" from 1989, which also dealt with a successful professional man threatened by an inconvenient mistress. In this case Chris, who knows that a divorce would jeopardise his job and his social position, reaches the same conclusion as did Judah in the earlier film- his mistress must die. He comes up with an elaborate scheme to kill Nola and make it look as though she was killed by a burglar.<br/><br/>Like ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" , ""Match Point"" can be seen as Woody's debate with the spirit of Dostoyevsky over the themes of his ""Crime and Punishment"", the novel which Chris is seen reading. Like Dostoyevsky's anti-hero Raskolnikov, both Chris and Judah are atheists and, whereas many people without religious beliefs nevertheless have strong moral principles, they take the view that ""Si Dieu n'existe pas, tout est permis"". They believe that, if necessity so dictates, any crime, up to and including murder, can be justified.<br/><br/>Self-plagiarism is not always a good idea unless one can equal (or, better still, improve upon) one's previous effort, and I am afraid that here Woody falls a long way short of equalling the success he had with ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" (in my view one of his greatest films), still less of improving on it. This is only partly because Jonathan Rhys Meyers as Chris is not nearly as good as Martin Landau, who played Judah. ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" is a much more complex film in which the bleakness of the ""Judah"" plot is counterbalanced by a more positive viewpoint put forward by Sam Waterston's rabbi and by a lighter tragi-comic subplot involving Woody himself as one of his trademark neurotic worriers and which contains a good deal of humour. As he demonstrated in ""September"" (in my view one of his worst films), Woody does not always handle high seriousness unrelieved by humour very well.<br/><br/>""Match Point"" is at least better than ""September"", for two reasons. The first is that some of the acting is good, especially from Scarlett Johansson as Nola, a tragic figure who genuinely loves Chris and cannot quite accept that he is only using her for sex. (She prefers to believe that he is emotionally torn between her and Chloe, but the truth is that Chris does not love either woman and is only using Chloe for her family's money). Johannsson was a late replacement for Kate Winslet who was originally cast in the role but dropped out.<br/><br/>The second reason is the film's ending. Chris has always believed in the importance of luck, comparing life to a tennis match in which a player can either win or lose a point depending on which side of the net the ball falls. The question of whether Chris will be found guilty of Nola's murder or escape scot-free depends upon a similar matter of chance- and there is a brilliant twist at the end, worthy of a great writer like O. Henry or Roald Dahl. The difference is that the twists produced by Henry and Dahl came as the climax to intriguing, economically-written short stories. Woody's twist comes as the climax to a meandering and at times rather dull long story. 6/10"

","ALLEN ENTERS NEW TERRITORY WITH ""MATCH POINT""<br/><br/>Viewed at 2005 San Sebastian Film Festival featuring centenary homage to Alfred Hitchcock. Though there were no films by Hitchcock on view, several films are in a way a homage to the master. ""Match Point"", the latest from Woody Allen is a vast departure from his usual form and is, in effect, a Hitchcockian suspense thriller filmed in London no less, with an entirely English cast except for a smashingly sexy Scarlett Johansson in a most uncharacteristic vamp role, as the sole American presence – (and what a presence she is!). <br/><br/>At a turning point in his life, an unscrupulous social climbing former tennis pro falls for a scrumptuous femme-fatal type (Scarlett Jo) who happens to be dating his new best friend and soon-to-be brother-in-law. Her blatant irresistibility forces him to tread a skittery fine line between acceptance or expulsion from the high society he has edged his way into -- like a tennis ball teetering on top of the net at a decisive win-or-lose ""match point"". Also the metaphor for which way the evidence will fall when he is a suspect in Scarlett's shocking but necessary murder. Young Scarlett really sets the celluloid aflame in this stylish shot out of Mr. Konigsberg's Twilight Zone, with sensitive support from Jonathan Rhys Meyers as the freaked-out lover-killer who in the end will go unpunished. <br/><br/>Woody has strayed from comedy before with mixed results but this no-nonsense edge of the seat entry into typical Hitchcockian territory demonstrates his versatility as nothing before. The tennis background is perfectly employed to a breath-taking conclusion where a tennis ball teeters momentarily on the top of the net and can fall either way. Johansson, moreover, pulls out all the stops and shows she can act as well as just look gorgeous — and sexier than ever as a scheming heartless femme fatale. Hats off to both Woody and Scarlett for a perfectly realized neo Film Noir. Alfred would have loved it!<br/><br/>An extra dessert for Opera fans; Since both leading men are opera lovers the musical score is made up entirely of opera excerpts with remastered Caruso recordings and oodles of Verdi arias commenting subtly on the proceedings of this amoral operatic film noir masterpiece."
"tomsview","9","1","2","17 June 2014"," Matchless
","There has been a lot written and said about this movie, and I can understand why; I think it is one of the most intriguing movies I've seen.<br/><br/>With a measured pace and style, ""Match Point"" tells the story of Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) who marries for money and position while lusting after another woman with whom he has an affair. But when she becomes too demanding, he solves his problem in a totally unexpected way.<br/><br/>The plot is built around the theme of luck. Meyer's character sets up the premise in his opening narration, ""The man who said I would rather be lucky than good, saw deeply into life. People are afraid to face how great a part of life is dependent on luck. It's scary to think so much is out of one's control"".<br/><br/>Luck also played a part in the making of ""Match Point"". In an interview Woody Allen told how he was lucky with just about every aspect of the movie. Lucky with the script, lucky that the location changed from The Hamptons in NY to London, lucky with the cast, and lucky when Kate Winslet dropped out and Scarlett Johansson was available.<br/><br/>Would this movie have had the same frisson with Kate Winslet playing Nola Rice? It's subjective of course, but Scarlett just has that powerful, glamorous look and calm sensuality that could cause males of any age to stumble over their words. <br/><br/>The cast praised her acting, although it's the scenes where her relationship with Chris Wilton starts to unravel, replete with yelling and screaming, where she seems a little stretched. As she herself says, ""I'm a pretty relaxed person and I don't consider myself a screamer so when you're elevated to that, it brings up all this crazy energy that you didn't realize you were bottling up."" <br/><br/>I was actually surprised to find that about half the reviewers on IMDb hated ""Match Point"", especially UK reviewers. One of the main complaints was that Allen didn't really capture a feeling for modern London life - they felt it was all a bit Oscar Wilde. <br/><br/>However, in all the interviews I've seen or read with the mainly British cast, Emily Mortimer, Brian Cox, Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Matthew Goode, none of them had anything but praise for the script, and all seemed to enjoy working with Allen. Most of the crew were also British, so up-to-date advice and local knowledge was always close at hand.<br/><br/>Anyway, it's the terrific cast, and the story with its reverse homage to Dostoevsky that drives the movie. Those who hated it overlooked some of Allen's most insightful writing - look at the way Matthew Goode as Tom Hewitt gets over Nola, he and his family move on from her. Then, even Chris Wilton gets over her - passions cool, relationships change, love can turn to hate, or worse, indifference. Allen weaves it all into his story where the security and power of wealth are the strongest driving forces of all.<br/><br/>All I would say is that it's a film that deserves re-evaluation. I've seen it a number of times, and each time I discover some new aspect to enjoy."

"punishmentpark","3","1","2","25 July 2013"," Is it luck?
","The second time I saw this film and again it's disappointing.<br/><br/>It begins with the casting of Rhys Meyers: he's never been my favorite actor (though I've not seen much with him in it), but how is anyone supposed to feel sympathetic towards this sourpuss, who, on top of that, just lies and cheats his way through life? It diminishes the whole given of a heartfelt romance under bad circumstances with Johansson's character, who in turn has her flaws as well. And to be honest, I wasn't as crazy about her performance as I always am about her looks.<br/><br/>So the film goes on being a dry tale of human entanglements that leads slowly (very slowly, which is also a minus) to a dark and depraved place, with sort of a detective story twist at the end. And even that twist wasn't very well thought out; when that ring is found on that killer, it is strange his whereabouts at the time of the previous (double) murder aren't investigated and it's even more strange (lucky, Woody Allen would probably call it) if that man can not be cleared in any way. Another thing which is demonstrated here is plain class justice where as these rich folks are not to be disturbed in their day to day about the possible access to firearms. Such a thing can not be called luck.<br/><br/>Also, a lot of other scenes illustrate nicely why I hardly care what happens to any of these people; they are vain, self-obsessed and interested only in good food, opera, films and better careers. I exaggerate - to make a point. Maybe it has to do with Woody Allen writing about what he knows, and such is his right, but it's not for me - though I see plenty of characters in other films which I may not directly relate to, but still they (or the story or something else) succeed in winning me over...<br/><br/>Anyway, Woody shot some wonderful pictures of London and the British countryside, the sex scene in a summer's rain ís quite nice and a lot of (opera) music is simply beautiful, so I didn't feel gypped (again) completely.<br/><br/>3 out of 10."

","I've never really been a Woody Allen fan: this film changed everything, it is he's turning point, the passage to a new (that's for sure) and better (in my opinion) Woddy Allen. The story is quite simple: a poor guy who managed to overcome poverty has the chance of a lifetime and he catches it, without thinking twice about it, and, as the circumstances evolve, he's ready to do anything, absolutely anything, to protect what luck has so kindly poured over him. What's truly amazing about this film is the way the simple story is presented and developed: the first part of the story occupies 3/4 of the film, where almost nothing happens, while everything is resolved and revealed in the last quarter. Also, everything else is perfect: the acting, the dialogs, the music (some of the most beautiful opera arias), the different themes touched (infidelity, the importance of luck in once's life, crime and punishment). A real pleasure for the eyes, the ears, the mind. A masterpiece."
"billha47","6","1","2","17 August 2012"," Looking For Family
","Like one reviewer, I too thought the ensemble acting of the British cast--the family especially--was the strong foundation, particularly when the plot became predictably noir. Chris, in a sense, is in love with the family, and not just for the wealth. Although we know nothing substantial about his past, he seems starved for relationships that are durable. <br/><br/>The pairing of Chris and Nola as characters on the make is well conceived. Both apparently have talent that has never been fully realized--or just enough talent to frustrate their hopes of shaping a career with that talent. I thought Scarlett's portrayal of the would-be actress was more convincing, since one could readily see why she wouldn't succeed. The character of Chris, however, seemed more a patchwork, with personal tags (Dostoyevsky, opera) that theme well with the plot. Utterly unbelievable was his supposed prowess as a tennis player; his strokes are little better than the all-arm loopy swings of those he is teaching. It helped that those scenes were out of the way early. Once he in the affair, his conflicted impulses make him more interesting and more believable. I appreciate the fact that he's not entirely a Ripley, Patricia Highsmith's amoral climber. <br/><br/>...which reminds me that Hitchcock used tennis to better effect in another Highsmith film, Strangers on a Train."

","This movie had a nice rhythm to it and the score is both fantastic and apt. I did have a few concerns though: 1. JRM is supposed to be a poor Irish boy yet doesn't have the hint of an Irish accent (at least to my ear) 2. JRMs acting is pretty wooden. 3. JRM lands some swanky job in the gherkin yet in one of the scenes it appears he is day trading in Forex. Not sure why he needs a secretary for this or that his excuse to have to head in to town to sign papers is believable within this context . Furthermore, for someone with zero biz experience its hard to believe that he is suddenly in the position he finds himself AND gets plaudits for doing a good job. 4. The coppers were nothing more than comic relief and JRMs acting when he is called in following the murders is pretty weak. 5. Except for one scene it was fairly bright and sunny. This is London people! Who are you kidding? 6. In an early scene, Mathewe Goode and JRM are discussing whether Tim Henman or Agassi was better...Really??<br/><br/>Aside from that I enjoyed the movie. Not to mention watching Scarlett..what can one really say about that!<br/><br/>I'd give it a 6.8 but since IMDb doesn't allow decimals I'll have to go with 7."
"ghamlin24","10","1","2","3 May 2012"," Genius Interpretation of Love and Life
","Allen uses a plethora of in depth character development and heavy plot development to create his intriguing story. The majority of the first half of the movie is dedicated to a full understanding of the true nature of Allen's characters. This is essential to the heavy weighted plot development and leads to a undoubtedly shocking climax. Within that one can feel a true emotional connection to the characters and the choices that they make. <br/><br/>As an avid action movie fanatic I was quite surprised with the continued interest I held throughout this movie. The interconnections of characters and the environment they live in serve as powerful allusions to the discrepancy between wealth and happiness. One of the most powerful lines of the movies arrives when Chris Wilton played by Jonathan Rhys Meyers exclaims ""I would be lying if I were to say that I have not grown accustom to the life I live."" This is in reference to the wealth, safety, and comfort that Meyers has grown accustom while being a part of a wealthy and prominent English family.<br/><br/>This is truly significant and genius because it illuminates a much larger discrepancy between societal values. The difference between the human desire for happiness and the human desires for importance and wealth are prevalent in modern society. Match Point illustrates this difference with beautiful character development and connection. The viewer is built up throughout the movie growing fond of Scarlett Johansson's character Nola Rice and feeling the love between Nola and Chris. <br/><br/>However the climax treads an entirely different direction when Chris decides to murder Nola in cold blood and continue his life of wealth and prominence lending to the allusion of social values. Chris Wilton decisions to disregard his feeling of love demonstrate the insurmountable draw to affluence over his notion of inner happiness."

","There was a time when Woody Allen could get away with anything he did, no matter how failed it was. Audiences as well as critics adored him and his cinema, for undeniable masterpieces as ""Manhattan"", ""Annie Hall"", and ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"", and favorites as ""Sleeper"", ""Broadway Danny Rose"","" Radio Days"", ""Hannah and Her Sisters"" or ""The Purple Rose of Cairo"". But things have changed, and even if repeating himself is a sign of authorship, it seems he has few new things to say. This is a reflection on luck, but the complications of the plot are resolved with resources from ""Crimes..."" that worked very well in 1989, but this time they seem preposterous, while the Bergmanesque ghosts are an easy way out to the complications he concocted. As Scorsese, he is a good director, and both craft fine products. But quite often today they seem pointless."

The plot is immensely unbelievable, none of the characters are likable, and the dialogue is a desperate attempt to portray high class society in England, but is as boring and uninteresting as a stereotype of the same thing. In fact I might also note that this movie is also poorly acted, John Rhys Meyers is a drone to watch with whatever he does, but surprisingly Scarlett Johansson is dreadful. The film does nothing but constantly plays on clichés but neither entertainingly or ironically. Don't watch this movie, its boring and excruciatingly unlikeable. Trash..."

Whether it falls forward or backward can make all the difference in the world.<br/><br/>I can't believe that tennis players say the same thing that poker players say: ""I'd rather be lucky than good."" Poker players say that because there is a significant element of chance involved in any given hand; and besides they already think they're good. It is the other guy who is lucky.<br/><br/>Jonathan Rhys-Meyers stars as Chris Wilton, a poor Irish boy on the make. He is handsome, charming, smart, and a very good tennis player who is candid about not quite being good enough against the very best. He gets a job teaching tennis at an exclusive English club and quickly meets and charms a very rich student (Matthew Goode as Tom Hewitt) who has a sister (Chole, played by Emily Mortimer) who finds him irresistible.<br/><br/>Well, how lucky can you get? Complication: Scarlett (the sexiest woman on earth, at one time, anyway, according to some magazine) Johansson playing Nola Rice, who is seriously dating the very eligible Tom Hewitt.

She is sitting pretty however because if she marries Tom she will be set for life.<br/><br/>I could go on, but the plot is so delicious that I don't want to spoil it for you. It's a variation on the venerable theme of rake's progress, employing in an interesting way the old adage, ""The man who marries for money earns it."" I have only one criticism of this especially well directed effort from the redoubtable Mr. Allen: you could have done without that cheesy ghost or hallucination scene near the end, involving sweet lips Scarlett and her neighbor.<br/><br/>See this for Woody Allen, who is just as smooth with this upscale noir/Hitchcockian thriller as he is with his renowned comedic and satirical efforts.

"brandon_lee420","9","1","2","24 April 2010"," Romance and Suspense combined awesomely!
","Woody Allen never came across to me as a great director, mainly since all of his films are boring and romantic ""masterpieces"" that lets you look at the cheating lives of old people, and I have tried watching one of his films but could never find myself interested. I tried watching Annie Hall, never came around to watching it, because it looked so lame and old-fashioned for me but one of the other reasons was that I wasn't too keen on watching a grandma and a grandpa having sex. When Match Point came out (get it) along with it's favorable reviews and a hot young cast, that included Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Scarlett Johansson, I decided to finally watch his latest film.The films is, from my point of view, about the two LL's: Love and Luck. It uses tennis as an example of luck and throughout the movie, at the beginning, the middle, and at the end, it references luck as a tennis ball that has tipped the net in the middle and which side will it land in: your opponents or back into your own. It uses love like any other Woody Allen movie.... Apart from the two LL's, Woody Allen is also pursuing Adultery and murder. And if mix that with the two LL's the result can be pretty entertaining and mesmerizing. The film also proved that Woody Allen is not as boring as I say he is and that consensus will live with me until he makes another Annie Hall. The performances by Johansson and Meyers are terrific and they are probably the best actors of the new generation. Jonathan Rhys Meyers plays an intriguing ex-tennis payer who falls for a friends sister and then he meets another girl who he thinks is his true love. Scarlett Johansson plays a hot Blondie who smokes often and is a sex symbol in Chris Wilton's life (Meyers). The performances from both of them is something to remember because they plays their role convincingly well. Brian Cox is also a respected actor in this film and even though his role isn't as important as Johasson's or Meyers, he is still good to see. The story is slow at the beginning but then eventually, when it starts reaching its climax, things heat up and the twist at the end of the film was a bit of a surprise but all that tension and suspense led up to nothing. It would have been better if the ending was different than the one used in the theatrical version. The character development was just perfect because during the movie you become attached to the characters so much that you want a happy ending to take place. But Match Point, to everyone who sees it, purposely did what it did at the end to make your blood boil. The film should be recommended to anyone who hates the genre romance/suspense but wants to start getting into because Match Point is one of the rare films that define both of the genres. The film isn't Oscar worthy but.....(sigh)...the performances are so good.<br/><br/>Chris, a recently retired tennis player, requests work like instructor in a London select club, there he knows and friendship begins with Tom Hewett who is member of an English wealthy family, Chris is a youth with luck, Chloe sister of Tom falls in love with Chris who takes advantage of this. On the other hand, Nola, an American sensual actress of little mount, girlfriend of Tom, knows Chris in a family party and the Irishman immediately is attracted by the beauty of the actress. Different to Nola's fate, Chris is well accepted in the Hewett's family and has the fortune of sympathizing with Mr. Alec Hewett who uses their influence to place young Chris in an executive position. Chris marries this way Chloe, Tom breaks up suddenly with Nola and he marries a youth of his class. Then Chris looks for Nola laboriously, and he revives the passion that feels for the American, this way Chris is amid an enormous pressure, coming from the work, of his relationship with Nola and of his wife's necessity of having a son. Finally, Nola leaves pregnant and she begins to press Chris so that he abandons Chloe, the retired tennis player has to make a difficult decision that will take him to extreme situations and a fatal destination for the young actress. Again the random, the good luck, allows Chris to stay free of this difficult situation, again the ball hits in the net and it falls in the rival's land.<br/><br/>The music going along with this movie is what you would expect and that is slow, enjoyable, and thrillingly clever. The film is flawless apart from the ending and I hope everyone thinks the way I do. Now, I'll be heading off to my local video store.....here I come Match Point...<br/><br/>""Over and Out."" 24 April 2010."
"Red_Identity","Null","1","2","30 January 2010"," The work of a genius!
","Woody Allen is a true genius for creating a film this brave. It is a revelation, a film that becomes more unpredictable than you bare to think as it goes along. I certainly did not know how it would end, and I certainly did not think it's genre would change like it did. Never have I seen a film that does that. Woody Allen's screenplay was rich and filled with great dialogue and fascinating characters. Jonathan Rhys Meyers really great, and I do not want to say anything more than I have to, but his character really is something unique. Scarlett Johansson gives her best performance, and she proves she is the best actress out there under 30. I am waiting for her to finally get an Oscar nomination (she deserved one for this). Matthew Goode is becoming an actor I notice more and more. In Watchmen he was great, and in this he plays a completely different characters, he is very smooth and subtle. On a side note, Brian Cox seems to be the actor that is the most low-key, appearing in many films I have seen (but he is always playing a very small role). The film never has a very serious tone, and even when it's subject matter turns dark it stays with the same sort of subtle and light tone, which makes it even more intriguing. The only other film I have seem from Woody Allen was Vicky Cristina Barcelona, so it's second half surprised me. The themes Allen present are insightful, and he has created a true work of genius, which deserved the Oscar for Original Screenplay over Crash."

","A talented young Irish tennis professional moves to London and obtains a position at an exclusive tennis club, makes friends with a wealthy member, becomes romantically involved with the member's sister, and then becomes sexually involved with the member's fiancé. The story in nothing new, but it is written and produced with great panache by Woody Allen.<br/><br/>Roger Ebert in his review says, ""often he uses a Woody Figure (preferably played by himself) as the hero. Match Point contains no one like Woody Allen "" I find that statement ironic for, as I watched the film, I was thinking that the main character - skillfully played by Jonathan Rhys Meyers - is a Woody Allen hero. The only difference is that, in most of Allen's films, the lead character is a somewhat neurotic Jewish man lost in a world of Gentiles whereas in Match Point, the lead character is a somewhat neurotic poor Irishman lost in a world of Englishmen. None-the-less, Jonathan Rhys Meyers is perfect for the part of Chris Wilton in the film because he has the ability to appear in many different guises from an innocent boy-like man to the incarnation of pure evil, and the complex character of Wilton offers that full range to the actor. Meyers' acting and Allen's writing and direction keeps you wandering as to the fate of this character all the way to the end of the film.<br/><br/>Scarlett Johansson plays Nola Rice, the object of Chris Wilton's adulterous desire, and she is beautiful in both physical appearance and acting skill in the part. Again, we are shown a person whose diverse emotions make her seem a different person at various times in the film.<br/><br/>Most of us wear our masks and adjust our behaviors according to our needs and the situation, but the characters in Match Point - particularly the two major characters - have honed that skill to absolute perfection. As Mr. Ebert also states, ""each and every character is rotten"" I didn't find them all totally rotten - some are just a little on the gamey side. Without likable or admirable characters, the captivation and brilliance of the film is that Woody Allen has given us these people, shown us what they do, and then lets us see the realistic - not moralistic - results."
"Cosmoeticadotcom","8","1","2","14 September 2008"," Comeback
","The critical buzz about Woody Allen's latest film, Match Point, is that it's his best since (fill in the blank), and, to a degree, that's true. The last of his films to attain even a limited greatness was 1999's Sweet And Lowdown, with the magnificent performances of Sean Penn and Samantha Morton, and the last flat out great Allen film was 1992's Husbands And Wives. But a case can be made that this film is his best since 1989's Crimes And Misdemeanors, the film which is its most obvious philosophic and narrative ancestor. That said, in a sense, this film is also sort of a 'Best Of' Woody Allen film, which reuses many of the best scenes and motifs of his best work.<br/><br/>There is the obvious nod to Crimes And Misdemeanors, in that this film follows a murderer who gets away with his crime of killing his mistress when she gets too clingy and demanding. But, there are nods to Interiors, with the end shot of the film, as the protagonist gazes out a window into a vacant sky, Annie Hall with the scenes of tennis, and several others. Also, as always, there is Allen's 'grand idea' that propels the film; in this case another one he has used before, that of luck being the single greatest determinant in someone's success or failure writ small or large, not ethics. Whether or not this terrific film signals a quality fluke, for Allen's stealing shamelessly from earlier great outings may belie a creative bankruptcy (although one could argue the reassemblage or collage is creative in its own right), or a renascent final Silver Age to bookend his Golden Age (1977's Annie Hall through 1992's Husbands And Wives), only the next few films will herald, but I'd love to see Allen stay away from New York for the next four or five films, and really push himself hard narratively, in a final creative burst. The editing of the film is very crisp, and at only about two hours, the film feels far longer and richer, in the best sense. The English countryside is also beautifully filmed by Allen newcomer Remi Adefarasin.<br/><br/>As said, without Crimes And Misdemeanors' comedy, this film does not approach the universality of experience that film does (recall the philosopher in that film's documentary within a film, and his narration over the final wedding scenes), but it is still leagues above the usual crap Hollywood puts forth."

","Having read many comments and agreeing in principle with most, this movie really is a thoughtful and fairly intriguing film about a poor boy from Ireland faced with an age-old problem, the stable, attractive woman, or the more combustible, but gorgeous.....(oh who am I kidding? I wish my choices were that good) woman. <br/><br/>For me, I had a bit of a problem with the premise on which one of the relationships is premised. Without giving too much away, it seems that one affair seems to have begun rather reluctantly, indeed, it seemed to me inexplicably given the initial resistance. That said, if you can get past that seeming unlikelihood, Allen has hit on a very nice film. In addressing the role that luck plays in life and the pressures on a poor boy to make good, Allen has tapped into a rich vein of material addressing class, gender roles, and sexual politics. The acting is quite good although the setting, a rather tony British social circle seems quite exclusive. That said, Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, Emily Mortimer as a naive but sweet lady, and Scarlett Johannsen who seems effortlessly to inhabit her somewhat troubled, provocative character. She is very talented-do not underestimate her abilities on account of her good looks. (That admonition may be directed at me as much as anyone :) ) Seriously though, Johanssen is a very very very talented actress. She creates and seems to meld with the characters she plays effortlessly. <br/><br/>I found the soundtrack (early Italian opera originally recorded on 78s (not sure if that's how they're transferred into the movie)) excellent and it foreshadowed throughout the film. I thought his selection of this extremely visceral, emotional music was quite fitting for story arc. Really, Allen is an excellent director and I would imagine he thought he needed to take a break from New York. Really though, this is a very good film and it will be interesting to see what he does next."

","Caught this about 20 minutes in while channel surfing. I saw Johannson and figured it's worth a look. Almost immediately I noticed the incredibly poorly written dialog. I was a bit shocked Scarlett would agree, or her people would agree and recommend, to do a film that was so clearly written by a guy/gal still in drama class, possibly at his or her high school. This is something anyone who's reading this could probably have written. The plot was interesting enough and the flow of the events was in line but the words themselves were so inadequately written, you sort of expected it to be a joke at times.<br/><br/>Well, imagine my shock when I came here to what I thought would be a complete pan of the film and the first thing I see is it's a freaking Woody Allen film. Now I am no Allen fanatic but the guy did write Annie Hall. He can write dialog. But based on this picture I am not completely sure there wasn't a ghostwriter for his 70's, early 80's career.<br/><br/>The movie, is not without some merit. It's the script and it's juvenile delivery of the lines that make it suspect as a general movie, and as an Allen film, a jolt to the system. It's pitiful.<br/><br/>I am glad to see there were at least some reviewers who were sober enough to review the movie with some credibility. If you think this was a masterpiece you must think Caddyshack 2 was a pretty good flick."

","Scarlett Johansson has never been this good. While a supremely sympathetic presence, this actress usually displays a narrow set of skills at let's-pretend. In her defense, she usually is not asked to do more than look pretty and not stutter. But she certainly works best in modern idiom, and she has been practicing for this one. Here, as in ""Lost in Translation"", she plays a woman more sensual than enlightened, isolated in a foreign city, confusing sex with communion and reeling on the verge of a nervous breakdown. Her performance this time is daring and revelatory. So is the work of Woody Allen, at least to many who view ""Match Point"" as a violent departure from his usual style. But this is not primarily a sex thriller; this is a story about fate vs intention, a theme shared by all of Allen's good movies, and he too has been working on this one for a long time. <br/><br/>He has made thrilling entertainments before: ""Bullets Over Broadway"", ""Manhattan Murder Mystery"", ""Sweet and Lowdown"", ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"", all have some sense of danger. And his movies have always contained a lot of sex. Just picking from the last twenty or so, ""Hannah and Her Sisters"", ""Husbands and Wives"", ""Deconstructing Harry"" and ""Anything Else"" each contain some hot stuff, and not always to comic effect. True, ""Match Point"" is surprisingly fluent in the language of the crime story, from desperate lovers to novice criminals to clever detectives. But while expertly executed, these are devices used as decoration rather than framework. And though he doesn't tell us any jokes this time, so many of the dependable Allen elements are in place: the ubiquitous music, now opera instead of the usual jazz; the ensemble of literate intellectuals, mildly camouflaged as Londoners instead of Manhattanites; the infelicitous indiscretion, once again within an intimate circle of friends; the strained marriage, shot through with infidelity and unrequited passion. Allen has given himself comfortable ground on which to hunt his favorite game: a man who can't be happy with success, whose joust with fate leads him (nearly or completely) to destroy all he has. It is the old story of hubris, and there are even Greek references lest we miss the classical implications of the theme.<br/><br/>While one of our most accomplished writers and directors, even Allen has stretches of bad luck. Over the course of forty years' work, there have been sometimes two or three movies in a row that aren't worth watching. Dionysius doesn't always smile. But many things happen in ""Match Point"" that speak of all Thespian gods' favorable intentions. The cast was perfectly timed, plucking Jonathan Rhys-Myers, Ms Johansson, and Emily Mortimer at the height of ripeness; the supporting cast is one of the great recent collections of British acting power, a coup in which Ewan Bremner, Matthew Goode, Penelope Wilton and James Nesbitt are merely standouts. So too are the other departments in eerily excellent form - the writing is subtle, careful, and mostly absent of Allen's tendency toward protagonistic self-exploration; the sets, costumes and props speak volumes about theme, action and character; English weather even seems to have cooperated to make this piece of theater possible, with ample sunshine at the country locations. And that's no small piece of fortune.<br/><br/>Allen does something else here that's worth noting. As this isn't just a crime melodrama, so it is not a simple morality play. The good guy, who turns into a bad guy, succeeds at being bad. He wins. There is not much to suggest that Mr Rhys-Myers' character is very damaged by tweaking fate's beard. Indeed there is some evidence that he grows and completes his hero's journey as a result of his petulance. Now that's either the sophomoric conclusion of an unsophisticated auteur, or the considered revelation of a veteran artist."

","MAJOR SPOILER<br/><br/>First off, if I hadn't known in advance that this was a Woody Allen film, I would never have guessed: only once, in passing, is there any mention of neuroses. I'm not a great fan of Allen's, his brand of quirky comedy for the intelligentsia leaves me cold, but I decided to give this one a chance as it's not a comedy and the man himself doesn't appear.<br/><br/>Overall, I'm glad I took the chance. In terms of story, Match Point is nothing new, influenced heavily as it is by Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment, but it tells its story in an unhurried manner that is quite refreshing in an age when any scene lasting longer than five seconds seems to be considered a bad thing. The story unfolds quite believably, and the theme of the influence luck/chance/things beyond our control has on our lives is clear throughout without being overstated. It's not about moments of luck, it's about lucky people - and people don't come any luckier than the man who is cleared of the crime he committed by a piece of incriminating evidence he failed to dispose of properly. I liked the resonance of that moment when the old woman's wedding ring bounces on the metal railing, falling backwards (unluckily, we are led to believe), taking us back to the net at the start of the film. British, you see - we love irony for some reason.<br/><br/>The performances are largely good. although Rhys Meyer's performance grated a little. He seems to get better as the film progresses, and I can't quite make up my mind whether his monotone delivery early on is due to poor acting or is meant to convey the attempts of an Irish boy to pull off a posh English accent. Brian Cox is a great actor, but has little to do here as the protagonist's father-in-law. Scarlett Johansson looks gorgeous and gives a good account of herself."
"bryanmolinelli","7","1","2","16 May 2007"," Mediocre Acting Makes a Good Movie
","Match Point is typical Woody Allen method neatly fitted into an atypical Woody Allen film. Instead of New York, we're in London. Instead of humor, we're in a series of serious situations, with tensions building from the outset, when Chris Wilton dates Chloe Hewitt but desires his friend's fiancée, Nola Rice. I was taken back to ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" while watching this film, and if you're familiar with Allen's dramas you'll recognize in Match Point a very common thread: the protagonist is indeed a Hellenic muse and gets away with a heinous crime, though not without tragic psychological consequences. In this case, long story short, Wilton is caught between the woman he's married (Chloe) and the one he's impregnated (Nola) and has to choose a life with one of them. He devises a rather hackneyed plan to murder Nola and successfully follows through with it, although his actions are visibly stilted by the emotional strain such action wreaks on his character. He fumbles with the murder weapon. He isn't prepared to full unscheduled quotas of collateral damage. And he disposes of the evidence carelessly. Wilton executes a crime that he certainly should be caught for. But Allen carefully threads this needle by making Wilton guilty before he murders Nola, and then cool and crafty after the fact. The script is also careful to express that Wilton's main motivation is fear - fear of losing the comfortable, upper-crust lifestyle he's ensconced in with Chloe and her family, and fear of being publicly dishonored through evidence of infidelity.<br/><br/>As with most Allen films, Match Point has unscripted, ad-lib moments, and here is where the acting rolls consistently downhill and into puddles. Take, for instance, the initial meeting of Chris Wilton and Nola Rice. He's wandering about the Hewitt's mansion when he happens upon Rice playing - and winning - table tennis. What ensues is five minutes of awkward improvisation, and with other actors it would sink. With Scarlett Johansson and Jonathan Rhys Meyers it swims, mainly because Johansson is sexy (okay, maybe not classically beautiful) and Meyers is the picture of icy, predatory lust. It's easy to forgive the ridiculously dated mobster-flick marbles that roll out of their mouths because they pretend to be tough, sensual entities with utter confidence, and this confidence (barely) saves the scene. Eventually this kind of pretending fades back to acting, but it goes in and out - in another scene with the same characters, Nola has bombed an audition, and drunkenly asserts that men desire her because they want to see what it would be like to have her. Johansson overplays this moment, Meyers looks like he's talking to himself, and the whole Allen method begins to scrape against the walls. But a minute later we're out of the smoky, uncomfortable bar scene and back out on the open English countryside, and the editing here lets us breath again.<br/><br/>What is most refreshing is this change of scenery. London suits the script and the story. It could work in New York, but with London the emphasis on class and its trappings has a greater resonance. The murder motive is terrifically believable. There aren't any jokes. And there is no happy ending. But when the end credits roll, they're chasing a film that struggled a bit to convey its message, and succeeded all the same."

","Chris is an ex-professional tennis player who starts training a rich British guy. As her sister fells in love to Chris, his style of life rises up. However, Chris is in love to his sister-in-law, Nola, so they start a hot romance. As she wants to make everybody to know it, Chris decides to take drastic measures to avoid it. In this film, Allen thinks about luck and its influence in life by telling us a history of a greed man that rises, as he has luck. There we can see his goals and his fears (surprisingly good acting of Rhys Meyers) and his relationships with all the family. It is also compulsory to remark the good paper of Scarlet Johansson (Nola) as a femme-fatal, in which she shows how good actress she is. The history is curious and the directing is good: all scenes are important, any empty one, well build characters (Woody Allen is a great director, he know to make things well). On the other hand, I've missed Allen's sense of humour, most of the movie, though interesting, is quite boring, as we watch all the serious moments in Chris' life, the main problem is that the main character is not very charismatic and some moments, though needed, are quite moment. Probably the most realistic Allen's film in a long time."

","Woody Allen has a gift. He is able to make the most mundane of movies interesting by simply adding in an extra layer for viewers to ponder. No matter how lengthy certain scenes, even if the first hour is bereft of any major revelations, Allen has a knack of implanting an engaging idea in the first few minutes of film, and keeping the viewer glued to the screen, waiting for the root idea to germinate into an awe-inspiring finale. While critics have blasted the director for regurgitating the same ideas over the years, Match Point proves that an old idea can be injected with new life, brought back from the dead to create a new and exciting experience. Ditching the usual New York locale, Woody Allen takes on London in what is definitely one of his greatest works.<br/><br/>Jonathan Rhys Meyers (Bend It Like Beckham) plays Chris Wilton, a man of Irish descent come to London to work as a tennis trainer for company bigwigs. Of modest wealth, Chris quickly makes it big as he starts to date a rich executive's daughter and is soon asked to work in the company. His new family treats him very well, and has seemed to settle into a luxurious and safe life. This sense of balance is disrupted upon the arrival of American Nola Rice (Scarlett Johansson), a sultry wannabe-actress dating a member of the family. What follows is a classic Woody Allen affair scenario, filled with close calls and sexy encounters, soul-searching and the rest. It is in this first portion of the film where viewers familiar with Allen's work are likely to roll their eyes in knowing boredom. Thankfully, the first few minutes of film introduce a wild card: in the game of tennis, when the ball hits the net, there is a moment of time in which the ball could fall either backwards or forwards; luck decides what course the ball will take. It is this simple idea that makes the first hour more endurable, that creates a need to know where the equation gets plugged in.<br/><br/>Woody Allen makes an excellent move after the lengthy setup sequences. While the affair scenario sparks a quiet interest in the viewer who is constantly waiting for the punchline, Allen makes a twist that changes the entire feel and emotion of the film. The twist is poignant; I found myself glued to my seat in utter confusion, aghast at the turn of events, until the very end of the film where it twists once again to create one of the most satisfying conclusions of any recent movie. The one-two punch breaks the fabric of the typical Allen affair film, and with the usual Shakespearean & Dostoevskian overtones, Match Point ends up being one of the most overlooked films of 2005 and signals another classic for Woody Allen's extensive portfolio. We should count ourselves lucky that there are direct-to-screen filmmakers of his quality still in circulation. (9/10 Excellent)"

","It's not just that Woody isn't in it. There is no humor in ""Match Point"" and -- although I've not seen everything Woody has ever done -- nothing that connects it to the rest of his ouvre. This is a conventional adultery-leading-to-murder film, not the worst of its type but far from the best. If you like Scarlett Johansson (and I do), here's an opportunity to see a good deal of her body, and you also get to see another aspect of her acting talent (in an essentially undemanding role). Johansson may be Woody's latest muse but, if so, he did not succeed in creating a story worthy of her talents or, for that matter, an especially interesting character for her to play. When the great critic in the sky writes down a final verdict on Woody Allen's career, ""Match Point"" will be down near the bottom of the list of his achievements."

","I really enjoyed this film but the first time I watched it I found myself turning it off in the middle (an almost unheard of act) and completing my evening re watching 'The Duel' (the first tale in the Hornblower miniseries). The following day I reflected on my actions and with much introspection came to the conclusion that the reason I had turned it off at the point I realized the inevitability of the murder was because I was inwardly revolted by what was about to happen. <br/><br/>I watched the film through to it's end at 4 AM the next morning and thoroughly enjoyed it. I was not upset that Chris Wilton had gotten away with a double murder. I was not upset that the totally innocent neighbor was killed as 'collateral damage'. I wasn't even upset over the concept of a man using murder to solve a domestic problem (I can think of a number of people whose spouses should be held justified and therefore blameless for their murders).<br/><br/>What I discovered was that I had so objectified either Scarlett Johansson or Nola Rice (I'm not sure which) that my mind had rebelled at what it saw as an act of ultimate evil; the wasting of an absolute babe. The act had apparently so horrified me that I ran to one of my icons of purity and goodness; the character of the 17-year-old midshipman Horatio Hornblower.<br/><br/>Go figure!"

","MP is a riff on A PLACE IN THE SUN. I saw SCOOP and NOTES ON A SCANDAL in October 2006 before I saw MATCH POINT tonight Dec 26 2006. ... Each have something in common with the other. As MATCH POINT was produced first and SCOOP secondly I find that SCOOP is a disgrace, out takes from MATCH POINT like some home movie fun project Allen decided to make for himself whilst still in London with a crew and Scarlett Johanssen. SCOOP now seems more reprehensible than when I first saw it 2 months ago . I also now can see how NOTES ON A SCANDAL came about given the acclaim and perfected London based thriller deception both MATCH and NOTES share. Generally one can see a theme in productions that feed from another's success; remember all the supernatural films that followed THE SIXTH SENSE.... even a copycat one with Cate Blanchett (some forgettable thing called THE GIFT set in a swamp in Louisiana and with Giovanni Ribisi).... now she has one like MATCH POINT called NOTES ON A SCANDAL. Friends told me for 12 months to see MATCH POINT and now seeing it as described above makes for reflection of production that I find rather predictable, a line of films I would otherwise not have linked. Lots of other comments here will explain the story and their own take but all I want to acclaim is three things: it is an excellent thriller with a moral and ethical dilemma that allows fate to take the lead... and I like that very much. also: thank God someone has finally given Jonathan Rhys-Meyers a truly decent great role; he deserves it and I have been interested in his career since VELVET GOLDMINE waiting for someone of note to actually showcase his considerable talents. MI3 and the interest of Tom Cruise does not count. .....and finally: the superbly written character of Chloe, the wife to Chris... what a great role and what a superb clean kind humane female part. I really cared for her character. MATCH POINT is a great film; well written, perfectly cast, supremely suspenseful .... terrifying actually....and not tidy...... reflecting life properly. But when and if you bother seeing the stupid tedious boring self indulgent thin SCOOP it will erase again whatever goodwill MATCH POINT allowed you to have for Allen at this late stage."
"rbruhn","Null","1","2","17 October 2006"," Details, details
","Granted, the movie isn't trying to be CSI, but the London cops were slipshod to the point of stupidity in their ""investigation"" of the murders. First of all, the fact that the women were killed with a shotgun should have raised eyebrows right off the bat. What criminal goes around carrying a weapon so difficult to conceal as a shotgun? The cops rationalize this by saying that it was a sawed-off shotgun. But any seasoned forensics person should have recognized immediately that the pattern of the shotgun pellets on the bodies was not that of a sawed-off gun, because a sawed-off shotgun sprays shot out in a widely dispersed pattern, not the tight pattern that the choked shotgun that he took from his father-in-law would make. In other words, the wounds that would be inflicted by these two different types of barrels (sawed-off and choked) would be quite different and quite apparent to any good forensics lab. <br/><br/>Secondly, if a criminal were to choose a shotgun as his concealed carry weapon he surely would not have used the type of shot that Chris would have found in his father-in-law's ammo pouch, which would have been a light load of small pellets suitable for shooting clay pigeons or small game birds. If you want to kill someone with a shotgun, you'd use a heavy load and something like BB shot. Again, this would have been a no-brainer for the forensics lab, and should have cast strong suspicion on Chris, who, as a rich upper-class Englishman would have had access to just this sort of gun and ammunition.<br/><br/>It is also remarkable that the cops didn't question the fact that there was no sign of forced entry into the old lady's apartment. When Chris came to her door she said that she never let in anyone she didn't know. So how would some lowlife druggie get into her apartment? And, for that matter, how did the cops know that drugs had been stolen? Unless the victim is alive to tell you what was stolen, how do you know what used to be there that is no longer there because it was stolen? Same with her jewelry. If you don't know what jewelry she had, how do you know any was stolen? <br/><br/>Then there is the crucial coincidence of the old lady's letting Chris wander into the TV room alone, where he then, of course, has time to assemble the shotgun. He had to have time to put the gun together. How did he expect to accomplish that? He couldn't possibly have known that the old lady would leave him alone for a few minutes and he couldn't very well take out the gun and assemble it while she was standing there watching him. So that scene was really a stretch, rather obviously unrealistic.<br/><br/>Finally, there is the quite reasonable question of how someone could fire two shotgun blasts in an apartment building -- one in the open hallway -- and not have anyone hear it. And then, on top of that, Chris apparently (although we don't see this) has time to disassemble the gun and put it back in his bag. Not bloody likely; but this, too, is glossed over, and the cops seem never to have investigated any of this.<br/><br/>But, guess what... I still liked the film enormously. I loved the tennis metaphor and that beautifully pregnant scene where the ring hits the railing and falls back on the sidewalk and you suddenly realize what all that talk about luck was all about in the beginning."

This contains major spoilers that might ruin the movie for you if you don't already know what happens at the end of it!<br/><br/>*CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS*<br/><br/>I thought the movie set up an excellent point to ponder about; Chris explains at the end that maybe he did want to get caught, because it would show him for the first time in his life, that there just MAY be justice out there, that there just MAY be a higher meaning to life, and that it wasn't all just random luck!<br/><br/>When we see the ring falling down on the ground instead of going into the river, we look back upon that shot of the tennisball bouncing off the net! In that shot, we were meant to think that if it falls short of the other side, it would be a losing shot (which it would, most certainly)! Therefore, when we see the ring fall short of the other side of the fence, we take it in as bad luck on Chris' behalf! That something bad is gonna' come out of that little piece of bad luck!<br/><br/>A few scenes later, there it is: The detective working the case has found out that Chris killed Nola!<br/><br/>The detective explains in detail what really happened in the case of Nolas murder, and we think back to that little piece of bad luck again: The ring! It could most definitely provide the missing piece to this puzzle that the detective is slowly putting together! All because the ring fell short of the other side of the fence, all because of that little piece of bad luck, Chris is gonna' get caught!<br/><br/>Then, we're thrown a curveball, and learn that the ring was picked up by a violent drugaddict with a previous record, who later on was killed, and the police found the ring in his pocket! We wonder for a short while if it really IS the end of the case the detective was putting together against Chris, but the detective finally walks away, saying ""I give up!""<br/><br/>Chris wins! All because of that little piece of bad luck which really turned out to be good luck! So, sometimes when it seems you're out of luck, that can really be a lucky occurrence in itself! Or so we think! Because what if that bad luck turned to good luck wasn't really good luck at all? Like he said himself, a small part of Chris WANTED to be caught! He WANTED to feel a sense of justice! He NEEDED to feel a sense of purpose in life! The ring fell short of the other side of the fence, the river, the vast deepness where it would never have been found! We're meant to take it as bad luck turned to good luck, since he didn't get caught! But what if... He NEEDED to get caught?!<br/><br/>If he had gotten caught, he would FINALLY have felt a real sense of justice in his life, a sense of a higher purpose for his existence, the fact that he can't get away with what he did! All throughout the movie, he's tragically depressed! Even during his finest hours, his happiest moments, there's a sense of sadness behind his eyes, like a feeling that there needs to be more in this life for him! It's addressed several times, during his first long talk with Chloe, during his moments of doubt about taking a desk-job, during the double-date restaurant scene and his talk with Nola and the others, hell, even in the opening lines! He needs to know if there's a purpose with life! Getting caught would've told him! Since he didn't get caught, however, now he may never find out! So, that little ring bouncing back off the fence, which we took as bad luck turned good, may really have been bad luck when you think about it!<br/><br/>That is what defines the quality of this movie! That tiny little thing, which is so perfectly well addressed! Great movie, in my opinion!<br/><br/>9/10 (excellent)"

Some of his movies are disappointing, but most of them have delighted me, even the more serious ones, like Interiors and C&M. This one is a real departure of sorts, not necessarily in the subject matter but rather in the execution. Gone are the nauseating jumpy camera moves from Husbands & Wives (which I liked nonetheless, what can I tell ya), gone are the snappy one-liners, gone is the jazzy soundtrack, gone is his beloved New York City. Instead, we get slow, subtle panning shots, arch dialogue with hardly any obvious humor to them, an opera soundtrack, and London, of all places. It works, though, this noir-ish concoction; it lures you in, sweeps you along and then it turns the screws in a most surprising way, leaving the viewer - this viewer, anyway - entirely jaw-dropped.<br/><br/>This is a thought-provoking work that no doubt has precipitated many philosophical discussions, and for that alone it's a winner. Not quite perfect, however - some of the dialog feels a little phony, the opera gets a little bit much in places, and some of the plot points are a tad heavy-handed. I forgive Woody for this.

Yet, the feeling one gets when progressing from this slowly evolving tale of romance into one about double homicide is only emptiness. Nevermind that greed and cold-blooded murder are all aspects quite contrary to the developed character who commits the crime, who, up to this stark and desperate turning point halfway into the movie, would have found it seemingly impossible to defy the one thing he felt sure of and passionate about in himself in order to save that which he, we are led to believe, cared so little about: a comfortable, stable position in life. What should we have gleaned from this, then, that men will throw away their most precious desires (namely love) for money and a small emolument of normalcy? But we already see that everyday.<br/><br/>It is too difficult to accept the premise of this murder based on desperation, or that the character could devolve so quickly into lies and callousness, and it seems that too easily real meaning here is traded, in turn, for yet another ""shocking"" turn of plot, all of which is wrapped up in the end with a few fine tethers which is, unfortunately, not enough to hold this nest of loose feathers together."

As their love grows Chris runs into problems with Tom's fiancé Nola Rice (Scarlett Johansson) because no matter how rich Chloe may be he still wants to get into Nola's pants. And honestly can you blame him? If you have ever seen Scarlett Johansson you know what I am talking about. This girl is so hot she could make a burlap bag look good. Chris spends the majority of the beginning of the movie hitting on Nola without her fiancé finding out all the time climbing the corporate latter under Chloe's daddy's help. Eventually because of liquor and a PO'd mother-in-law Nola is driven into Chris' waiting arms in an open field in the back of Chole's and Tom's parent estate.<br/><br/>Chris and Nola pursue their relationship further after a messy break up with Tom and the fact that Chole keeps hounding Chris to knock her up. Because Chris is protected at work by the fact that he is the son in law to the man in charge this give Chris ample time to leave work whenever he wants to go and bang Nola. Chris ends up knocking up Nola which causes a series of events that could potentially ruin his relationship with his sugar mama Chole. Nola unwilling to the abort the mission Chris comes up with a plan to ""take care"" of the situation. What that plan is I will not say and how it ends up you will have to go and find out for yourself.<br/><br/>One thing that really bothered me about this movie was the fact that Chris continually takes calls from Nola in front of his wife on his cell phone. It is like Woody Allen has never heard of call ID or voicemail. Not once in the entire movie does Chris check his phone to see who was calling and if it was a good decision to answer the phone. If you are honestly screwing around on your wife I think you might do a better job of screening your calls.<br/><br/>The moral of this movie is that if you are going to have an affair with a hot Hollywood actress you'd better bring a condom because you never know when one of your little guys is going to get past the goalie and potentially ruin your life.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this movie and I would recommend it to anyone. The movie moves kind of slow at times but the ending makes up for it. But then again, what do I know?"
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","7","1","2","5 June 2006"," Merely a more modern version of Allen's typical dark and passion-filled drama
","Woody Allen's comedic films and darker films are both very distinct, but very similar within each genre, and while the film begins as something much different in the drama realm, it turns out to be Allen relying on his strengths, simply from a more modern point of view.<br/><br/>In ""Match Point,"" Jonathan Rhys-Meyers plays Allen's troubled protagonist Chris, a former tennis pro, torn between his love for his wife Chloe (Emily Mortimer) and all the support her family provides him through his new job, and his undying passion for Nola (Scarlett Johansson), the former fiancée of his brother-in-law (Matthew Goode). Much of the film focuses on Rhys-Meyers figuring out what it is matters most and the drama this causes both his relationships, but then a long ways in turns very dark, Woody Allen dark, much like 1989's ""Crimes and Misdemeanors.""<br/><br/>The films strengths are in the dramatic relationships and events that have a more modern realism to them to keep Allen's style fresh and effective. Thematically, like past Allen films, the movie thrives on the impending choice and consequences Rhys-Meyers will make and deal with as a result. (Ironically he reads ""Crime and Punishment"" along with a reader's guide early in the film.) <br/><br/>On the weak side, there is also the theme of luck constantly being pounded in, or as Chris the tennis pro puts it, ""sometimes the ball falls on your side of the court and sometimes it bounces over,"" although tennis, despite the title, hardly plays any role in the film outside of metaphor and symbolism. While luck can be pulled off as a theme, it appears more like a cop out for Allen than an important lesson, as anything can happen if you're lucky enough. Allen does, however, use it effectively through small directorial choices that keep the viewer constantly predicting the consequences of Rhys-Meyers' actions before they occur, and then looking incredibly clever when he throws in luck as a curve ball, but for the most part it seems unrealistic and somewhat bothersome.<br/><br/>Aside from the need to be thematically explicit, the film succeeds as a more modern telling of one of Allen's old stories, which in some ways helps the film and hurts the film. The characters are incredibly strong and the passion and tension in the film is very effective, but as a whole the story is rather thematically questionable in terms of whether Allen's sometimes clearly stated ideas are truly as he says they are."
"ElMarxistaFiel","7","1","2","4 June 2006"," Clever, Modern interpretation of Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment.
","Easily one of the best films Woody Allen has created in quite a long time. He's finally decided to take the scene somewhere else, besides the streets of New York City. He adds a new flair and taste to this film by placing it in London. You'd almost not know it was a Woody Allen film. I don't know if this is him being somewhat experimental or if it's just his way of trying to make an excellent interpretation without destroying it by injecting to much ""Woody"". Whatever it is, it works, and this was quite a good film.<br/><br/>The first 75% percent of the movie is dedicated to learning who the characters are and is a little boring, until you start getting closer and closer to the characters. Jonathan Rhys Meyers is Raskolnikov in this movie, and I wasn't too stunned with his acting. I found him quite dull, not very emotional. His acting stumbled in certain important scenes and he was very blunt at times when he needed to be more refined. He is a young actor however and wasn't that horrible enough to ruin the entire movie. Scarlett Johansson, meanwhile plays the beautiful and promiscuous Nola Rice. In Crime and Punishment Nola's character would probably relate the most to Alyona Ivanovna. She was very sexy, but other then that there was no sparkle in her acting either.<br/><br/>The last 20-30 minutes of the movie is where things really start to heat up and where the parallels between ""Match Point"" and ""Crime and Punishment"" become more obvious. Just like the book we get into a deep examination of morality, and if crime is ever a solution to any problems you may face. Woody Allen pays homage to the genius, Fyodor Dostoevsky, in one brief scene where we see Jonathan Rhys Meyers reading Crime and Punishment. Beyoned the scope of Crime and Punishment however, this movie also examines fidelity, and monogamy.<br/><br/>It's not an exact 100% copy of the events that occur in Crime and Punishment but the parallels are easily seen if you have read the book. It's a clever modern interpretation, and it works. Even though the acting is a little weak, the story is clever, and the philosophical questions asked are interesting. Good movie."
"jeremy-liebster","7","1","2","31 May 2006"," Started slowly but by the end I was riveted
","After half an hour of this film I felt as if I was watching one of those awful one off Sunday evening dramas which seem to have been made only with the middle class housewife in mind. There were cut glass English accents, shots of tennis and the opera, meaningful looks across dinner tables and a rather obvious love triangle involving Scarlet Johannsen. But I have to admit that the longer this film progressed the more intriguing it became until by the end I was quite unashamedly shouting advice at the screen. Match Point was refreshingly unpredictable and also rather refreshingly had no particularly likable characters thereby avoiding moral judgements. As others have said this is far from your typical Woody Allen film - and I am normally a big fan. A slight disappointment for me in Match Point was that you can normally rely on Allen to produce scintillating dialogue yet the conversations appeared stilted and slightly humourless. I also felt that some of the details - such as Chris being a supposedly working class boy from Ireland yet with a posh English accent and a penchant for Dostoevsky were a little far-fetched. Overall though Match Point is definitely worth a look."
"Voitcus","5","1","2","30 May 2006"," A little too long
","The movie at its beginning goes very fast. There is a man who meets two women. One of them becomes his wife, the other -- his lover. Then the movie slows down, in my opinion, too much. The problem is typical: how to hide man's affair without letting his wife know too much. The action again goes faster, when he gets to know that the lover is pregnant. It is now very interesting, how he will manage the situation. The surprising ending is however worth waiting, but I would say, the time could be shorter.<br/><br/>The motto of the movie, which is said at the very beginning, is that everybody needs luck in his/her life. OK, we remember the sentence, and start watching. Then, there is nothing about it. I forgot the motto. Then you can remember it again, but only having watched everything."

","I watched this film and I liked it a lot! The film first started off very slow, as there are many characters to introduce. They also had to put in that tennis scene to pave the way for later developments. After we got to know all the characters, their love relationships get rather muddled up. Jonathan Rhys Meyers & Scarlett Johansson were very good in their roles, it was so convincing that they really loved each other. The locations were very well chosen.<br/><br/>As the story unfolds, it became very gripping and kept me in suspense. Who would have thought the lovely Jonathan Rhys Meyers would have done such a thing? The ending was a bit unexpected, but I loved it.<br/><br/>After the disastrous Melinda And Melinda, Woody Allen made a wonderful film to redeem himself. Though I still miss his witty comedies such as Hollywood Ending or Small Time Crooks."
"forkerouac","6","1","2","17 May 2006"," Couldn't Turn Away
","This is neither a recommendation nor a warning. It takes a lot of internal debate before you can decide whether you liked the film or not. The film goes like this: Nothing much happens, nothing much happens, nothing much happens, nothing much happens, something quickly happens, and then it is over. Yet during the nothing much happens period, you cannot look away. The film holds you. Don't know why. If there is any building sense of dread that something bad is going to happen, the characters don't show it. They are one steady bunch. You just assume something is going to happen because a) this is a movie; and b) the constant references to opera and constant use of opera music make you think there is going to be some sort of Greek tragedy event. So you wait and wait and wait.<br/><br/>When the event does finally happen, it too is a headscratcher, i.e., you ask yourself if that character would really do that. And then you have to grapple with what happens to that character in the aftermath. It offends moral sense--but do you still like the movie? Don't know. Good luck working on that.<br/><br/>For persons knowledgeable about opera, there may be more layers of this film to enjoy. Don't know. For lovers of Woody Allen films, you may wonder if you rented the right movie. Nothing typically Woody Allen here."
"meeza","9","1","2","31 March 2006"," A win for this Match!
","Woody Allen has been serving our comedic cravings for many decades. Love him or hate him, the ""Woodsman"" has verifiably proved that he is a comedic cinematic genius and a master of storytelling within themes of neurosis, self-exploration, adultery, egoism, and obsession. His latest effort ""Match Point"" serves up those themes with cinematic poetic justice. Jonathan Rhys Meyers stars as tennis pro Chris Wilton, an opportunistic handsome Scottish lad who befriends a British yuppie named Tom Hewett played by Matthew Goode and eventually marries his sister played by Emily Mortimer. Let's just say that Chris wants to live a joyous ""Chrismas"" lifestyle every day of the year by marrying into a wealthy family. The luscious Scarlett Johansson co-stars as Nola Rice, Tom's fiancée and Chris' American object of desire. I will not spoil a good cinematic match for you, but I will say that Chris' obsession for Nola does have enough probable cause for him to double fault and jeopardize his enriching plan. Johansson looks ravishing in the narrative. No doubt that ""Scarlett Fever"" is hot! Murder does come into play in ""Match Point"" during the latter part of the narrative. Rhys Meyers and Johansson were a superb acting duo with their ace performances. However, the main ""advantage"" of ""Match Point"" was the cleverness of Writer-Director Woody Allen. His triumphant return to cinematic excellence was done by the way of game, set, and ""Match Point"". ***** Excellent"
"ipilowsk","5","1","2","20 March 2006"," The work of a master craftsman.
","I am a fan of Woody Allen as a hardworking creative artist. This movie reminded one of 'Crimes and misdemeanors': has the same nightmarish quality. Juxtaposes humdrum upper middle-class life with the world where murder is used to resolve problems (war?).Current geopolitical preoccupations are dealt with summarily in the final ten minutes eg the issue of 'collateral damage for the purpose of a greater good'. The police were played by excellent actors in an effective low-key style. The movie is well paced and has a character-driven inevitability about it which gripped me.I needed a feel-good movie that day but this movie's virtuosity satisfied me."
"distemper","6","1","2","13 March 2006"," disappointing
","A very slow paced story- the pace does allow detail, and thus perhaps better than average USA film, but here it is a little shallow, and a little laboured.<br/><br/>The production is a bit careless. e.g. a lingering shot of a multi million dollar view from the happy couples apartment - shows a barge on the Thames that is stationary, (highly unlikely in real life).<br/><br/>The story is a dark one, introspective, and perhaps a little pretentious. Woody gives us a clue when the main character reads Dostoevsky.<br/><br/>Maybe a project to keep Woody occupied for a few months, but not a masterpiece."
"Atavisten","8","1","2","5 March 2006"," People say Woody Allen is back
","But truth is he never went anywhere. Here he goes to London and makes almost a film noir with British actors. The first third establish Jonathan Rhys Meyers character as the poor, but lucky Irish who has gotten into the higher circles of society. Not unlike one Barry Lyndon he does so with a minimum of constraint and effort, growing only desire for the sultry American Scarlett Johanson on the way, that sadly for him is dating his wife's brother. Here the tone is full of rewritten clichés from the classic movies, all tongue in cheek and humorous. Like many other of Woody Allens movies the references are clever and aplenty, repeated viewings may be needed to enjoy all of them.<br/><br/>Apart from a slow moving middle part this is an excellent movie, it really picks up the pace so by the end you're left quite satisfied.

"mike-925","6","1","2","27 February 2006"," Woody's Trying to Change His Career
","The best thing Woody Allen has done here is remove himself from the movie. It dawns that Allen has been boring us for years with plots featuring himself in the lead role, a move that eventually made all his films appear very much alike. <br/><br/>The plot of Match Point is similar to Dreiser's American Tragedy which was made by George Stevens in 1949 as A Place in the Sun with Monty Clift and Liz Taylor. In this one tennis pro and former tennis tourney participant Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) meets a tennis student who is the son of a rich family from the financial community in London. Meyers marries their daughter Chloe (Emily Mortimer) but before this is smitten by the blond American actress Nola Rice (Scarlett Johannson) who is engaged to be married to his student. Chris begins quietly hitting on her. Later, the Missus of the family manages to torpedo the engagement. Chris steps up his seduction of Nola. Later, Chloe is having trouble getting pregnant. <br/><br/>At some point Nola gets pregnant and, believing Chris will leave his wife for her, refuses to have an abortion, sending Wilton into paroxysms of fear that he will be found out and lose Chloe and his lucrative position in the family. <br/><br/>Chris decides to murder Nola with one of the family's shooting party shotguns at her apartment. To mask the motive, he kills the nice old lady next door and steals her jewels, then kills Nola Rice as she steps from the elevator. He returns the shotgun to its berth at the Mansion, and throws all the booty from the 'robbery' in the Thames. Except that one gold ring doesn't quite get over the railing, and lands instead in front of the railing overlooking the river. <br/><br/>Scotland Yard questions Chris and discovers his romance by reading Nola's diary. Chris urges them not to ruin his marriage by telling his wife and her family. They agree not to. <br/><br/>But the lead detective wakes in the night to a eureka moment. He deduces the woman next door was killed by Chris to camouflage the murder of Nola. Discussing the case the next day at work with a colleague, he learns that another burglary in the neighborhood overnight has resulted in the capture of the real murderer, who had the effrontery to be carrying the golden ring stolen in the original Burglary-murders. Yes, its the ring that didn't quite clear the railing. Chris Wilton, in other words, has gotten away with murder, just as Allen did in Crimes and Misdemeanors in 1989.<br/><br/>The movie isn't great, but its better than the normal Woody film. I detected some choppiness in Johannsen's performance. When first meeting Chris she is terribly seductive and her acting superb. But later, as she falls in love, her portrayal of Nola becomes routine and banal. This doesn't quite make sense and undermines a romance that should have been taken down by the declining credibility of her lover. Instead, she becomes ordinary for no discernible reason except that Allan can't emphasize the romance and Chris's declining credibility as a committed lover at the same time. He has to furiously shovel plot at the audience instead.<br/><br/>The movie isn't quite good. I sense it is an attempt by Allan to both resurrect the career that was nearly ruined by his marrying his own step daughter, and to move beyond his comic films to something that is not in his hero Ingmar Bergman's league, but may reach the level of Alfred Hitchcock, whose films are imitated somewhat here. I think the film borrows an unexplored part of the Farley Granger character in Stranger on a Train. I will bet we see more attempts at Hitchcock from Allen, who probably got the idea from David Lynch's paean to Hitch, Mullholland Drive."
"stewball99","4","1","2","15 February 2006"," Situation (un)comedy
","It is a great example of how a movie can have all the parts (except story) well done, and still be a looser in my never to be humble opinion.<br/><br/>It has five good minutes concerning the sub-theme of the movie (better to be lucky than good) stretched out at the beginning and the (genuinely Hitchcockian) end, which were indeed good, but the rest was like a 2 hour situation comedy without the comedy--either type of which are forever on my s#*tlist. ""Let's watch the stupid people do stupid things so that we won't feel so stupid ourselves."" It's right up there with slapstick; it was painful to watch at times.<br/><br/>How this ever got to be considered among the year's best is beyond me, and if it hadn't had Woody Allen's name on it, it wouldn't have been."

It was really setting up what was going to happen later.<br/><br/>I am really glad that Woody Allen did a film noir. He did a great job. I love old Woody Allen movies, but he hasn't done anything spectacular in about twenty years. This movie was a breath of fresh air.<br/><br/>Jonathan Rhys Meyers was decent...not great, but he did pull it off. Scarlett Johanssen is one of the most over-hyped actresses of the day. She didn't bring much to this role and her acting was so poor that I found it infuriating. She'll probably continue to get roles due to the fact that she's pretty, but she was definitely the weak point in the movie. Emily Mortimer was great in her role as Chloe. Completely underrated. The other supporting actors blew the two leads out of the water.<br/><br/>I recommend the movie, but for the engaging storyline. If you want to see amazing theatrical performances you might not be very impressed."
"tehspap","7","1","2","6 February 2006"," Surprisingly Good
","To put it simply, Match Point really surprised me. I normally am not a fan of Woody Allen's writing style (besides when he shines on dialouge, something hard not to love). I went into the theater expecting a film so annoyingly bad that I could joke about it later with friends. (I came to this conclusion after reading some summaries, tag-lines, and quotes.) Instead, I had the pleasure of seeing a movie with an array of relatable characters and situations along with a great ending.<br/><br/>The overall story of the film makes it a definite must-see. What really turned me on to the story was the ending. Even if the rest of the story was bad, the ending would have made up for it. Even though the acting, dialouge, and shooting style were all boring and sub-par, I still consider this a great movie because of the ending.<br/><br/>I admit that the acting and dialouge are bad. Jonathan Rhys-Meyers always seemed like he was about to cry regardless of the emotion of the scene. I have a bias against Scarlett Johansson (mostly because of the Island) that made it hard for her to be convincing to me. Both characters were rendered even worse by the bad dialouge which was either over-full of British colloquialisms or just hurriedly written.<br/><br/>The cinematography was bland. It was very static in more ways than one. It was static as in still, without many notable moving shots. In addition, it was static as in unchanging, unreflective of the feeling a shot or scene was meant to convey. One part of the cinematography that I did like was that many of the close-ups were very sharply focused which helped to keep the attention on the words (the very poorly written words) of the characters. These didn't make up for the otherwise boring shooting style.<br/><br/>Despite the technical and personnel flaws (I really enjoy phrasing it in this way), Match Point is still very much worth seeing because of the relatability of the story. The themes present are so universal that they overshadow the bad dialouge and acting. The movie also ends in an amazing way that has to be seen to be fully understood.<br/><br/>If you don't get a chance to see this in the theater, you need to rent it and watch it with some friends with good senses of humor."
"triple8","9","1","2","5 February 2006"," Mesmerizing, very very disturbing and without a doubt one of the best of the year.
","SPOILERS THROUGHOUT: <br/><br/>Match Point is so well made and so mesmerizing that it's actually disappointing when the film ends. It is an excellent, extremely impressive drama and it's true that this is definitely not a typical Woody Allen film.<br/><br/>I'm actually not a major Allen fan. One of the reasons I was looking forward to seeing this was because I had heard how different it was from the usual Allen film, darker and much more Noirish then what you'd expect from Allen. It sounded like something I'd like and I did. This is definitely academy award worthy and it's also really really disturbing.<br/><br/>The theme of the film, as anyone who has seen it knows, is the importance of luck in determining -well-pretty much everything in one's life. It really makes one think in the way many films don't. This film inspired an all night discussion between myself and several of my friends and it's not any film that could do that.<br/><br/>The fact that this could be true-that it all comes down to luck-is actually a very disturbing thing and as far as the way Match Point's story unravels, it is topnotch. The performances were wonderful and the audience is kept on the edge of their seat from the beginning. Match Point manages to avoid a lot of negatives other films don't. (It's not overly long, not boring, the dialog is sharp, the characters are fascinating and the story compelling.) It goes way beyond being a very good film and goes into being an excellent one.<br/><br/>The atmosphere itself is perfect. The musical score is almost hypnotic and the opera music that comes and goes throughout increases the compelling aspect of the picture. The imagery of the scene when Johanson runs into the lush fields in the rain must be mentioned as well. The whole movie is curiously subdued but had an energy about it where you know the film is gathering momentum, that is palpable. The ending is chilling and as mesmerizing as the rest of the film. This really is a must see.<br/><br/>As for negatives there are a few. First was the ghost sequence. Not that I did not think that fit-I did. But I am still confused as to whether that was through Chris's eyes, or was the dream of the police officer. I am still completely unsure of that.<br/><br/>There were also some plot holes in the last act that I'd have liked to have been explained. For example, if the police had Nola's diary then they must have known she had given Chris an ultimatum and was threatening to tell his wife. They had to have known from the diary, the frequency of which Nola and Chris were together, that she was pregnant and that he was having difficulty telling his wife. And yet, from the beginning, way before the old lady's ring is found, with the exception of the one officer, nobody seems to think Chris would do it. That's not just luck, that's something beyond, almost unbelievable. Because in reality, he'd probably be the prime suspect.<br/><br/>Adding to that, is the fact that there is a witness. The ""friend"" Nola confides in. When Chris calls Nola, the friend asks Nola if that's ""him"". The implication at least, is that Nola has told her friend all about Chris and their story. If the friend knew that Nola was leaving to meet Chris, wouldn't that put him under suspicion right away? These maybe minor points, but they are the reason I'd give this a 9 over a 10, even though I enjoyed this more then almost any film I've seen this year. This movie is very well made and it will get under your skin and really disturb in a way most films do not. Brokeback Mountain still deserves the Oscar, in my opinion, but Match Point, being this well made, really deserved a nomination as did some of the performers.<br/><br/>One other thing that was a little hard for me to buy was how much everyone loved Chris from the beginning. And that is because, to me, Chris lacked any charm whatsoever. There was no charisma there, he was almost robotic and so it was difficult for me to believe absolutely everyone would want to be around this guy. (It didn't surprise me so much with the women in his life because almost everyone in the world, at one point or other falls for someone that others may not like.) But SO MANY people loved this guy from the women, to his buddies and his wife's family, coworkers etc. Chris, to me, seemed cold, stilted and not really present in an emotional sense, from the beginning so I couldn't understand why everyone wanted to be near this guy. But then again....maybe he's just lucky.<br/><br/>In closing, Woody Allen fan or not...if you want a film that will inspire discussion you've found your dream here. 9 of 10 and a must see."

","Was I the only person who was disappointed in this film? The movie is such an obvious attempt to recapture the narrative and sexual tension of ""A Place in the Sun"" that I am surprised Woody Allen got away with it. The scene around the ping-pong table in the beginning (by the way, how many British aristo families play ping-pong?)is a weak imitation of Montgomery Clift and Liz Taylor around the billiards table.<br/><br/>Woody Allen is free to cannibalize his own ""Crimes and Misdemeanors,"" but George Stevens (director of ""Place"") and Theodore Dreiser (author of ""An American Tragedy"" -- the book on which ""Place"" was based)are probably spinning.<br/><br/>Also, the film is about 30 minutes too long. If Meyer's cell phone went off one more time, or if Johannson screamed ""But you said you were going to tell her!"" once more, I was gonna scream."

The dialogue bored me. Without action, one has to rely on other aspects like dialogue, story, beauty, historical accuracy, fantasy, sex, tension, comedy, music, etc. <br/><br/>It seemed Woody made the movie after a really frustrating day. I never got a single chuckle from it. The only funny thing was that Jonathan Rhys-Meyers seemed to be a clone of Woody's. There were a couple of times I could have sworn I saw images of Woody standing in Jonathan Rhys-Meyers' place. Maybe he has been delving into trick photography - you know, like subliminal messages.<br/><br/>Well, Scarlett Johansson helped but Woody came up short - never got it straight. I gave it a 4 for each sex scene Scarlett was in, plus just the fact she was in it.<br/><br/>No matter, there was not enough to keep me interested or appreciative."

","Filmed on location in England and featuring just one joke about neuroses, ""Match Point"" is perhaps not instantly recognizable as a Woody Allen film. But its intelligent script and skillful direction mark it as the work of a talented filmmaker, and one who is still willing to try new techniques.<br/><br/>Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers), who teaches tennis at a posh club, becomes friends with the wealthy Tom Hewett (Matthew Goode) and starts dating Tom's sister Chloe (Emily Mortimer). But he finds himself extremely attracted to Tom's fiancée, an aspiring actress named Nola Rice (Scarlett Johansson). Increasingly, Chris must choose between two very different women and two very different lifestyles--optimistic, naive, moneyed Chloe, or worldly, seductive, struggling Nola? Using this rather simple story, ""Match Point"" goes on to explore questions of luck, fate, ambition, and morality.<br/><br/>Allen takes his time with the early part of the movie, which is perhaps a few scenes too long. Eventually, though, it subtly shifts from being a realistic drama to something much darker and more involving. The last 40 or so minutes are absolutely gripping, full of classically suspenseful moments and a very clever resolution.<br/><br/>Some reviews have called Nola a ""femme fatale"" type, and her memorable first appearance certainly gives off that impression: her husky voice purrs ""So, who's my next victim?"" as she pouts by the ping-pong table. But one of the nice things about ""Match Point"" is that it subverts these expectations. Nola's character gains depth until she seems like a rather ordinary young woman who got herself into a difficult situation and is trying her best to get out of it. She's far from a perfect human being, but far from the evil ""femme fatale"" mode too. (Besides, no one in this film is perfect.) Scarlett Johansson gives a vivid performance of this complex character.<br/><br/>In the early scenes of ""Match Point,"" Chris's personality is a little unclear, both in the way Allen wrote the role and the way Rhys-Meyers performs it. However, by the end, both writer and actor have fully committed to making Chris a ""Talented Mr. Ripley"" type. Mortimer and Goode excellently capture the Hewett siblings' characters--good-natured, accustomed to a life of ease, unaware of how lucky they are.<br/><br/>""Match Point""'s slow start keeps it from perfection (there is also one small misstep toward the end, where Allen violates the rules of the world he has created). Still, in an era when many movies begin well and then fall apart by the end, I'll take ""Match Point""'s solid-but- unremarkable beginning and brilliant ending any day."

","Match Point is not only a great film, not only a great Woody Allen film, but it's enjoyable on many different levels. What Allen does is to create a whole world in which his characters live and develop. They are very nice characters to look at, listen to, and sympathize with.<br/><br/>On a visual level, this is a lush, gorgeous film. Both the main characters are seductive, and dress that way. The locations are just as pretty whether they be downtown London, a tennis club or an estate.<br/><br/>The main characters are human with faults, desires, and unreasonable expectations, like us all. It's easy to sympathize with both of the main characters even though they are despicable in so many ways. That is why I think it's a great movie.

","Another reviewer here seem relieved that gone from this film was the NYC Jewish dialog, but was that not the only endearing thing about Woody Allen films? Infidelity has long been a favorite topic of Woody Allen, who in truth has made a genre out of infidelity. The only new twist is the WASP never even dates a NY Jew, but instead chooses a sexy blonde white trash girl from Colorado (equipt with beauty pageant sister and all).<br/><br/>The only aspect of human existence Woody can comment on seems to be infidelity. After a few decades, this has become tragic and dull. Aside from the foreign setting and lack of a Jewish element, there is NOTHING new to this story. We've seen Woody do it a dozen times, and others have been telling this tale for centuries. Nothing triumphant in this return for Mr Allen. Yawn"
"David_Frames","6","3","12","15 January 2006"," ""You cannot be serious""
","Woody Allen relocates to London but based on this evidence, he wrote the screenplay on the plane. Had he waited until landing and spent a little time in good 'ol Londoninium, he might had the chance to listen to how we speak over here. As it is you've got a movie with some of the most stilted, turgidly written and, curiously for Allen, witless dialogue you'll ever hear and absolute murder on the ears for real Londoners. Allen (Daddy to his wife) has always rolled naked in language like a sunbathing hippo in mud but the wordy script, stuffed into the misshapen mouths of 'the English upper class' is awkwardly spewed out over two hours, more you suspect out of reverence to the director who no-one wanted to offend with a factual denunciation of its sheer wooden quality, so the cast look stagestruck - a group of people lifelessly reciting their lines like schoolchildren forced to read Shakespeare out loud in class. You've never heard anyone speak the way these people do - okay this is what used to be known as the Ruling class and they're an odd bunch as we know but do they really talk like the King addressing the nation on BBC radio circa 1935? The casting of Myers is also unusual. We're asked to believe that this cut-glass Englishman is in fact a poor Irishman who's pulled himself up through his Tennis skills. Woody Allen himself sounds more Irish than Reece-Myers. Occasionally Match Point engages. As the affair between Myers and Johansson deepens so does the material but as it all pans out the twists in the story become signposted far in advance and it progressively becomes less plausible until finally, with Johansson murdered and Myers looking as though he'll get away with it, Allen strays into an middling episode of Columbo but without the great man himself to pick apart the killer's poorly conceived plot. Its also in the denouement that Allen's misogyny rears its ugly, lecherous head. Johanson, like all women in these situations, pays for her intense sexuality that turned the poor mans head and potentially wrecked his marriage, with her life. Never mind that unlike say Glen Close in Fatal Attraction, she was groomed by the man in question and harassed until she gave in and who cares if Myers has lied to all parties throughout and acted with ruthless self-interest - he's a man and more importantly the Allen surrogate so its inconceivable that he'll be hauled into a police van by the hapless Rozzers and given a life sentence at Parkhurst. That audiences tend to sympathise with the men in these situations, some women mystifyingly included, is one of the great psychological conundrums of the cinematic experience. As I left the cinema in fact I heard two teenage girls ruminating on the fact that the genetically gifted Myers had got away it and saying that they were 'glad, weren't you?' Well no I wasn't - having sat through two hours of conversations with the new English who use phrases like ""schmuk"" and ""I figured"", I had hoped for at least the sight of Myers being lead to the gallows. So Match Point is a movie that oscillates between poorly performed melodrama and jaw-on-the-floor implausibility. The one moment that really is an ace is the scene in which Myers throws an incriminating ring into the Thames only for it to hit the rail and bounce back onto the pavement. The same action with the ball in Tennis would have Myers lose the point but ironically here it has the opposite effect as it's discovered by a drug addict who is later fingered for the Tennis Pro's spate of murders. The message is clear - sometimes what's generally accepted as wrong can, with a bit of luck, work to your advantage. One thinks of Woody and his young bride and shudders. Lucky for Mia Farrow the director doesn't own a rifle."

","***SPOILER ALERT*** Theodore Dreiser's estate, as well as the screenwriters of A Place in the Sun, should be clamoring for credit and dough. Radio Days was a love letter to Amarcord but it didn't rip it off point for point, beat for beat. I sat there in the theater saying: in the next scene the Shelley Winters character will tell the Montgomery Clift character that she is pregnant... in the next scene the father in law will offer the Montgomery Clift character a spectacular business opportunity... in the next scene, while happily at home with the Elizabeth Taylor character, the Montgomery Clift character will (gasp!) get a call from the police. And having read most if not all of Patricia Highsmith's books, I also knew pretty well how it was going to end. When in an early scene the main character was reading Crime and Punishment I even knew that somehow, one way or another, he was going to kill an old lady in her apartment. And yet... and yet... why five stars? Because over this overcooked oft-eaten meal Woody Allen lays one dazzlingly rich precise detail of life and character after another. One brilliant example--the wealthy parents of a newborn are never ever seen with their baby, because unseen nannies are always caring for it. And in the final scene, when a new baby comes home, the parents don't go anywhere near touching it--the nanny carries it and they coo at it from a distance. Brilliant. Woody, you are a greater director than George Stevens! You don't have to eat his leftovers!"

","Whoever said ""write what you know"" first must have been a very successful writer themselves and also ignored by Woody Allen. 'Matchpoint' is a film that writhes and struggles in the quagmire of ""American Cinema doing Britain"" and as a British movie goer I found myself writhing and struggling in my chair to watch this film .<br/><br/>It is Jonathan Rhys Meyers that ruins this film for me , yes he's good looking and fills out a pair of briefs like a Clavin Klein underwear model but perhaps that is a vocation he should consider as opposed to acting . Myers leaves me unconvinced throughout, unconvinced that he wants Nola Rice (Scarlett Johansson) unconvinced he is a man on the edge, unconvinced he is a deceptive liar , unconvinced he is scared of being caught. The scene when Myers visits the police station is where you really see how poor his performance is , one is never sure if he is crying, if he is feeling guilty, if he is being arrogant or if he is afraid .<br/><br/>Myers ruined this film for me , he was the proverbial turd in the punch bowl, he is a sad reminder to many hopeful actors that looks are more important than performance."

","The worst performance in this movie obviously belongs to Scarlett Johanson. The plot is ridiculously unbelievable; there is no way that Chris would be attracted to Nola over Chloe, Nola is a derelict dolt while Chloe is a cultured personality.. The only reason that Crhis would be attracted to Nola is because of her huge breasts and this is obviously the only thing that draws superficial, simpleton Chris to her. Chloe has much more to offer personally and intellectually and has a much prettier face, the only thing she does not have is a huge rack. ""Men think I would be something special"", quotes Nola. This is the funniest line by far in the movie, for Nola is obviously nothing special except to men with an IQ around 100 and a fetish for monstrous breasts.

","It doesn't surprise me that Woody Allen was no where to be seen in this film. I'd hide behind a camera too, if I was a shriveled up, old misogynist of a filmmaker. The men I went with to see Match Point were not quite as disenchanted with the film as I was. I was definitely not satisfied when I left the theater. Allen may have shown us an honest portrayal of the male psyche, but I think he presented us with a genuine psychopath, instead. Chris is completely devoid of morality, incapable of taking responsibility for himself and his actions, and operating from a totally self-centered, id-like perspective. There was nothing at all likable about Jonathan Rhys Meyer's character. It saddens me, but unfortunately it does not surprise me that this movie is getting such good reviews. All you losers who like watching women being used, abused, and killed, need to get some medical attention. This film makes me want to write the female version for Mr. Allen, but I realize I need to be better than that. I don't need to spread that kind of hatred. I will give Allen credit for: 1)Beautiful Gallery Shots, 2)Presenting us with a MALE GOLDIGGER, and 3)A Wonderful Performance from Scarlett Johansson.

"hardrockstar27","10","2","8","21 June 2006"," Allen's Best Since Crimes and Misdemeanors
","Woody Allen's Match Point is an extremely entertaining, well-made thriller about lust, greed and ambition and the tragic consequences of these aspects, but in the process we identify with Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys Myers), a poor boy from Ireland who had a brief career in tennis, but at one point in the movie he says: ""I was never going to be an Andre Agassi, so I decided to give it up."" Then later on in the movie we find out more about why he gave tennis up and the reason is the theme Allen uses throughout the film.<br/><br/>Instead, he is a tennis instructor at a London tennis club and one day, by chance, he meets Tom Hewitt (Matthew Goode) who's family is very rich and part of high society London. He invites Chris to the opera, and there he meets Tom's sister Chloe (Emily Mortimer) she is immediately attracted to Chris. This becomes the turning point in his life for the good, or so he thinks. Chris likes Chloe, but he's not in love with her. She loves him, her father Alec (Brian Cox) likes him and wants to get him started in one of his companies and her mother Eleanor (Penelope Wilton) is also fond of him and she wants to see her daughter have what she wants. Chris sees Chloe's attraction to him as an opportunity to climb up the social latter. The problem with Chris's plan is that his relationship with Chloe is mechanical because he is only with her to enter the royal family.<br/><br/>But when he does meet a woman he is very attracted to, she turns out to be Tom's fiancé. He meets her at the house, when he finds her playing ping ping. In their first flirtatious encounter, after the woman beats someone else at ping ping, she says: ""next victim."" Chris comes over and is already filled with lust. Then, the woman says to him ""how about playing for $1000 a game""? Chris agrees and after one quick serve, she says to him, ""anybody ever tell you play a very aggressive game."" Chris replies: ""Did anybody ever tell you that you have very sensual lips."" The woman is Nola (Scarlett Johansson), a struggling American actress who Chris begins an affair with and then can't seem to shake her.<br/><br/>The strength of the movie is Allen's deceptive plot. It has many cunning, ingenious twists that are not anticipated. I will be diligent for the rest of this review so I won't reveal any of the surprises that makes this movie one of the best of the year and Allen's best in years. This movie resembles Crimes and Misdemeanors, where the main character finds himself in a situation that would jeopardize his comfortable life of wealth and privilege. It conveys how far he is willing to go for his own greed. The movie is more about plot than characters, and the way the drama of the plot unfolds is the joy of watching the film. The plot is clockwork. The movie is rich in irony, like many of Allen's films and here it's like he's trying to convince you he's still one of the smartest writers in the business.<br/><br/>There are three very good performances in the movie. Jonathan Rhys Myers carries his main character very well. He expresses his anguish at the events that unfold in a very effective way. He is especially good in the scenes with Scarlett Johansson. He conveys the lust he feels for her through his face and eyes that makes it all the more convincing. He also evokes empathy for his tragic flaw of ambition that leads him to lie, cheat, deceive and then even worse. He doesn't deserve forgiveness, but pity. Johansson is very sexy and juicy in her role. Allen gives her the sexy flirtatious dialogue she needs to thoroughly convince us that she loves to edge men on, especially Chris for that matter. Emily Mortimer is also very effective as Chloe as she strives to bring Chris closer to her because for some reason she can't put her finger on, he often seems distant.<br/><br/>There is a crucial scene near the middle of the movie when Chris meets an old friend on the street. He turns out to be a tennis player he once knew on the tour. At one point in their conversation he says to Chris: ""If a couple bounces would have went your way, you could have been a champion."" That two minute scene is one of the dark undercurrents lurking beneath the surface. The theme of luck is set up so clearly that it sets up for the single best shot of the film. The shot is only about five seconds long, and it comes towards the end of the film when something is thrown and doesn't clear a railing that leads into the Thames River. The shot is so perfect, it'll make you gasp.<br/><br/>When it comes down to Chris Wilton's Match Point, does he get lucky and the ball clears the net and he wins or does he get a dose of bad luck when the ball falls backward and he loses? That's for you to see. All I will say is that the police are involved and are trying to get to the bottom of what happened in the events that unfolded, but they run into a little bad luck and as for Chris, he runs into some good luck, but still doesn't know whether he's won or lost the point. A masterful film noir from Woody Allen. Extremely cleverly written and directed. Highly Recommended. 4 stars out of four."
"markwalton-1","6","2","8","6 January 2006"," Bum note
","This film is very funny, but most of the humour derives from Allen's ignorance of British culture and mores and was presumably unintended by him. You wonder why his British actors didn't intervene to save the script from some of its worst howlers. Nobody ever refers to the Royal Opera House Covent Garden as 'The Royal,' and the operas that are performed there are not accompanied by a piano - presumably the budget for the film did not extend to an orchestra? It's also very unlikely that the patrons of the opera house would be seen dead at an Andrew Lloyd-Webber musical, as his productions are considered the height of naffness amongst most London classical music lovers, especially ones who read Dostoyevsky. Either Lloyd-Webbers's company has coughed up the money for a product placement or he has been given this free publicity because Allen thinks American audiences will know who he is. As for the holes in the plot...others have already done justice to them."

","Definitely a good movie, well written, good dialogue, intelligent..., but I agree with another comment that noticed how similar this story is to ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" a much better movie in my opinion.<br/><br/>A friend of mine recently told me of a date he had and pointed out that she's a ""woman you ----"", not marry. I think that was the theme of this story. Chris (rhys myers) found the perfect woman, tons of money, fabulously wealthy life, all the comfort a man could ever ask for and best of all; he didn't really have to work for it, just marry it. Then there's Nola, (Johhanson) who is a sexy struggling actress, not making it. She has no money, comes from a crappy home life and basically has nothing to offer this guy except her body. When she wants more he has no intention of giving up this great life he's acquired, even though he's in a loveless marriage. He has an internal crisis. What to do? Be with the sexy siren, or stay in the comfortable married life with kids, money, and perhaps boredom. Which is better? He has to decide. Clearly Nola is not a woman he'd ever consider marrying so in order to avoid risking losing his new life he has to get rid of her. Good story, but as I said ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" did it better."

","Normally, I don't appreciate commenting on other users' comments (it has the smack of arrogance), but in this case I frankly must say that if you consider this one of Woody Allen's masterpieces then you haven't seen many of his movies so far. <br/><br/>I agree that ""Match Point"" is better than ""Melinda and Melinda"" (though that wouldn't be much of a compliment on its own), and I wouldn't even complain too much about the all too obvious flaws: its clumsy dialogue and threadbare characters, the horrible (yes: horrible!) use of soundtrack music (scratchy opera tunes which reveal absolutely no connection with the on-screen action whatsoever, nor do they comment on it in an especially subtle manner - you get the impression that Mr. Allen just wanted to show us what an exquisite connoisseur he thinks he is), the cliché settings or the length of the movie (at least 30 minutes too long). <br/><br/>What I really DO complain about is that Woody Allen has made far, far superior films in the past dealing with related topics.

Here we get the minis on every street (heavy product placement).

"erniemunger","7","2","9","29 December 2005"," Lucky Draw
","How do you make a dense feature-length movie from a plot that holds in two lines? This rhetoric question is masterfully resolved in this Hitchcock-inspired thriller by a mature and quietly reflected director. Unsuccessful former tennis pro (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) weds into British upper class (Emily Mortimer et al.) by chance, has an affair with his brother-in-law's (Matthew Goode) raunchy mistress (Scarlett Johansson), has her pregnant by accident, then saves his marriage by killing her and, for sheer luck, gets away with it. End of story. Roll the credits. In Match Point, this skeleton of a story is actually just the pretext to a moody excursion into the nature of fate, as you will have easily guessed from the chance appendices in all actions described. Bar the psychological foray, this low-key and solemn account is highly untypical of Allen, who for once refrains from screw-balling and delivers instead a psycho classic in the vein of the unsurpassed Chabrol. Accordingly, Allen takes the freedom to develop his characters at length and let the narrative evolve in a natural, almost organic way, something unthinkable in modern-day screen drama, where black and white is the dominant code of portrayal. Admittedly, Match Point has numerous flaws, the most obvious being the outrageous clichés of London and all things British, but then again, whoever claims that Allen's Manhattan is the result of a naturalist depiction must be either a self-indulgent New Yorker or a downright fool (things identical, I guess). And yes, the film could have easily been shortened by some ten to fifteen minutes, the middle part  devoted to the emotional set-up for the crime  being a tad bit redundant. On the other hand, the recurring motif of Verdi's La Traviata, with its corollary: art  here, literally used as a reverse blueprint  beautifully carries the subplot, with a ""diverted"" pariah who, in the end, remains an outsider in a shallow society, itself a self-deluded meritocracy, where only an ephemeral stroke of luck could have brought him in  and will keep him there for good or for bad. Very solid cinema, to say the least, and a late blossom in Allen's career who, like others before him (but to name John Ford), shows there is no age for reinventing yourself."

","Had it not been a ""Woody Allen film"" I probably would have given up on this movie after the first five minutes. I was alerted to the dodgy status of the dialogue by Alexander Armstrong's unsteady delivery as he interviews J R M . The words were English, they were right, but not necessarily in the right order or in the right place. This curious dialect continued. It was as if Woody Allen had imagined what Londoners might say if they were rich enough to have a chauffeur, live in a studio flat with more than 2 rooms and have a box at the opera. Or maybe he wrote what such people might say if they lived in New York, and then ran it through Google Translate for British English. And another thing: why have a scratchy soundtrack filled with operatic arias? They weren't matched to the mood of the film. The plot is preposterous, amoral and cliched. But if you like that sort of thing, then you will persist with the film until it reaches its climax and the one true scene of filmic worth occurs. But even then the conclusion derived from that moment - the closing of the arc set up by the opening credits - is nonsensical.

","Woody Allen's ""Match Point"" at 53rd San Sebastian in 2005<br/><br/>2EE648C9-20F9-4C8F-8452-7DC284AC5808<br/><br/>The dominant theme at the festival this year was Hitchcock with Hitchcock imagery everywhere celebrating the hundredth anniversary of the birth of Master of Suspense. Though there actually are no films by Hitchcock on view, several films are in a way a homage to the master. ""Match Point"", the latest from Woody Allen is a vast departure from his usual form and is, in effect, a Hitchcockian suspense thriller filmed in London no less, with an entirely English cast except for a smashingly sexy Scarlett Johansson in a most uncharacteristic vamp role, as the sole American presence – (and what a presence she is!). Young Scarlett really sets the celluloid aflame in this stylish shot out of Mr. Konigsberg's Twilight Zone, with savvy support from Jonathan Rhys Meyers as the freaked-out lover-killer who in the end will go unpunished.... No sidewalks of New York, no neurotic Jews, no sly jokes and one liners, just a straightforward English psychodrama made with such aplomb you would never guess it was a Woody Allen film if you missed the opening credits. In a way it does hark back to Woody's Crimes and Misdemeanors, but only because of the theme of getting away with murder. Rhys is a professional but impoverished tennis instructor and bald faced social climber with clients in high society. His character marries into a wealthy family, but his social position is threatened by a steamy extra-marital affair with his new brother-in-law's girlfriend, played by Johansson. When Johansson claims to be pregnant and insists that he leave his wife for her -- which would bring down the whole world he has strived so hard to attain - she signs her death warrant. Rhys goes to her apartment, shoots her to death (in a shocking sequence) and makes it look like a robbery to obtain drugs. The rest is a cat and mouse interrogation by a Scotland yard detective with echoes of Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment. His skin is saved by a twist of fate similar to a tennis ball suspended momentarily on the net which could fall either way. This is, of course, the Match Point of the title. Instead of a tennis ball we have an incriminating ring from the scene of the crime which accidentally gets dumped onto the ground after teetering on a rail by the river where Rhys is disposing of other evidence from the scene of the crime. We find out that the ring was picked up by a junkie who got killed but now appears to be the indisputable culprit who killed Johansson. Case closed. Our anti-hero gets away with murder. Everything handled just right by Allen to produce a tight thriller with the kinds of twists and turns that mirror Hitchcock to a tee. Not only is this a. ""return to form"" for Woody, but a venture into fresh new territory -- straight drama with not a single laugh --and done like an expert born to the cloth. Most enjoyable film with an entirely new Scarlett Jo! as an astonishingly sexy femme fatale."

For some reason it struck a chord, whether it was the circumstances i was in or the situation it depicted.<br/><br/>At the time i was interested in business in a broad academic sense of the word. An the fact that a business degree might merely be a ticket to ride the train of the big bucks has been underlined by the movie. The main protagonist enters that world due the fact that someone with a position liked him, not because he has any knowledge about anything relevant.<br/><br/>The impending global financial crisis that ensued a couple of years after this movie was one of those moments where viewers might even claim how Woody Allen predicted it all.<br/><br/>On a more basic level, the sexual tension between Scarlett Johansson and Jonathan Rhys Meyers and his ambivalence towards Emily Mortimer were depicted amazingly. Otherwise some thoughts on crime and punishment are showcased, a somewhat omnipresent motif in Woody Allen's work.<br/><br/>To sum it all up, if you like the movies by the same author, you'd like this one.

"moonspinner55","6","1","3","5 July 2014"," Getting what you want...but at the expense of true fulfillment
","Writer-director Woody Allen, so proficient in comedy, has also been comfortably at home in straight dramas, and ""Match Point"" is probably his meanest dramatic movie to date--and arguably his most polished. A young, well-heeled British executive, married but carrying on an affair with an American girl, finds himself in an unwinnable situation when his girlfriend tells him she's pregnant; she wants to have the baby, naturally, and stubbornly expects him to leave his wife (and, consequently, his cushy position in life). Allen doesn't view the participants in this deadly game as immoral; just the opposite, in fact. He sees the frailty of the human heart--and in the tug-of-war between love and lust--and uses this to paint a deliciously involving portrait of 'ordinary' lives turned inside-out by lies and deception caused by romantic indiscretion. The film gets you in the gut, although the concluding events, engineered to make Allen's point about getting one's way at the expense of others, are not especially convincing. The performers are nicely-attuned to the material and the narrative defies going over-the-top, which is remarkable considering where Allen takes the characters. **1/2 from ****"

","The story of the film starts in a normal fashion and doesn't interest much to a general audience but the way it takes turns after the second half and the engaging part in the end is going to be in my memory forever. After watching the film, the question related to scripts again resurfaced in my mind. Isn't the story the most important part of a film? Well I just think of the fugitive, the story being pretty much normal but I bet there will be very few who didn't like it. No doubt, a film has to have all the departments very powerful in order to be successful. In the fugitive we have an extraordinary execution of a normal story and in Match Point we have an extraordinary execution of an extraordinary story. But why can't I distinguish between the two films properly. I want to incline more towards the Match Point but after finishing both of them I had almost the same feeling. But in the end I believe it is the story which should be paid more emphasis.<br/><br/>The film' story here digs deeper into LUCK. How luck can change the life. The story does true justice to the idea. We have a Retired Tennis player inducted into a family and start to have a relationship with the daughter of the family. Sideways, he grows his feelings for another girl involved in the same family. The story takes many turns all the time. The combination of the mood at times along with the opera music was an exhilarating experience. The way the film ends, the acting by the cast, the change in behavior or the characterization everything about the film is so perfect. The ending clearly suggests that this is how life is sometimes and we don't know it. Woody Allen is a master storyteller. With 23 nominations of original screenplays, the guy is a gem in our world. I seriously doubt that anyone would dislike the film. There are instances where the story tends to proceed in a clichéd manner but wait till you reach to the end.<br/><br/>MESSAGE: ""LUCK MATTERS.""<br/><br/>VERDICT: ""A must watch."""
"StevePulaski","8","1","3","6 December 2012"," Allen doesn't stop at simplicity
","Woody Allen's Match Point opens by telling us exactly where it derives its title from. It compares life to that moment in a game of tennis, when a ball is swung and hits the top of the net and for a split second has the option of falling back on your side of the court, penalizing you or, with a little luck, falling on your opponent's side, penalizing them. In a sense, this is a film that questions the mysteries that inhabit life, actually offering up some very interesting existential questions about life and its numerous quirks.<br/><br/>I guess it's too considered a ""match point"" when you've caught yourself in the middle of a love triangle and are unsure of whether to stay with the one you're officially with or take a risk and form a full, open relationship with the one you've kept ""waiting"" on the side. The character stuck in this depressing position is Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), a retired professional tennis player attempting to climb the social ladder in London, as he trains Tom Hewett (Matthew Goode). The two share their love for opera, and along the way, Chris meets Chloe (Emily Mortimer), Tom's sister, and quickly jumps into a relationship with her. That is, until he meets Tom's confident, incredibly sensuous fiancée named Nola Rice (Scarlet Johansson). The woman is bold, beautiful, and gorgeous and knows of this, and becomes smitten with the idea of becoming involved in an affair with Chris, while Chloe is left in the dark. There are a number of twists and unforeseen directions in the film, so spoiling them would be an act of sin.<br/><br/>Allen completely disregards everything he's led us to believe he has been about since his career beginnings in the 1960's. His male archetype is not a neurotic, inept, quirky writer, but a fully brazen and somewhat arrogant womanizer played expertly by Meyers, who embodies this role with true power and intensity. The characters around him that could've been gravely underwritten (for example, Mortimer's Chloe) are developed through monologues in luxurious restaurants, sipping the fanciest wine, talking openly amongst friends and acquaintances. It's scenes like this that Allen nails with a complete and total brash sense of direction and confidence. He portrays these luxurious get-togethers as comfortable, inviting experiences that places the viewer at their table or like a voyeur at a nearby table, listening in on a conversation you're afraid for just because you don't want it to go the way you believe it will.<br/><br/>Aside from Meyers, the wealth of supporting talent that surrounds him is commendable and fascinating. He is greatly assisted by Johansson's deeply passionate, sensuous Nola, and we can see him being persuaded by her just by her simple gaze and her incredible attractive lips.<br/><br/>Match Point could've evolved into a simple love triangle involving a prestigious tennis player desperately struggling to maintain two different girls while he resides in London's upper-class. But two tactics that Allen inserts here comfortably are exploring how someone can climb the social ladder of London, and, inviting in the idea of how luck plays a role in all our lives. He illustrates how sometimes the most despicable, unruly humans get the undeserved good luck, while the good people of the world get shafted with the bad luck.<br/><br/>In multiple ways, this reminded me of Spike Lee's sincere and delightfully efficient directorial debut She's Gotta Have It, which also centered around a love triangle, but instead of exploring the idea of how luck plays into ones life, it examined each character and how they reacted to being part of this triangle. Lee channeled Allen in some respects, with the black and white atmosphere and the dramatic tonality of the screenplay, and both in return made a sufficient picture.<br/><br/>Some consider Allen to come gift wrapped in his own pretentiousness and accuse him for making ""odd"" pictures that few can connect with. I consider him valuable and a necessity to film; we need people like Allen to show a barrage of different people, with extremely different personalities, that somehow come all together and connect with their traits to make the complex, admirably complete figure that is Woody Allen.<br/><br/>Starring: Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Scarlett Johansson, Emily Mortimer, Matthew Goode, Brian Cox, and Penelope Wilton. Directed by: Woody Allen."

I disliked the cast, not one single performer to cheer me; and then there were those loads of Verdi, Gomes, Donizetti, Bizet, Rossini, Webber—all of Woody Allen's vileness released upon the audience. MATCH POINT might perhaps be of some interest to illiterate adolescents, the 12—15 yrs. segment—and to illiterates generally. Otherwise, it's simply some regular Woody Allen rubbish. Perhaps with a better cast and a better script and a better score and better sets it might of been less trashy.

This movie has been described as ""Hitchcockian"" and the final act is indeed suspenseful, but Hitch would not have nearly put me to sleep for the first hour.Overall I would recommend this movie, but it is in no way a masterpiece and I would warn the viewer to resist giving up on it since the ending redeems the film.

Match Point has an unlikely and rather banal story line, interpreted by unsympathetic characters, with gratuitous sex scenes, and although the acting was above par, the opera bits in the background were totally incongruous and the whole thing left me with a profound sense of disappointment because I had been looking forward to something more edifying from a genius like this writer/director. There is no point in Match Point but I will give it 3 points for its production values and its authentic capture of the London scene.

","No, this is not your typical Woody Allen movie. First, it isn't a comedy. Second, unless you were well versed in Woody Allen movies, you'd never think that ""Match Point"" was a Woody Allen movie. Third, the plot takes place beyond Woody's usual haunts. Basically, a tennis instructor Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys Meyers of ""Mission Impossible III"") falls into the good life when one of his tennis students, Tom Hewitt (Matthew Goode of "" befriends him. He thinks that everything in life is the result of luck. The protagonist--because he certainly shouldn't be considered heroic--quits teaching tennis. He marries his good friend's sister Chloe Hewitt (sweet Emily Mortimer of ""Pink Panther""), but he falls recklessly in love with his friend's girlfriend, Nola Rice (sultry Scarlett Johansson of ""The Island""), a struggling actress looking for roles in England, and they have a torrid affair that he must conceal from Chloe. Meanwhile, poor Chloe complains that she cannot have a baby and Chris and she visit many fertility experts and struggle to have a child. At the same time, the other woman, Nola, gets pregnant. Initially, the husband (Rhys Meyers) was infatuated with Nola, but his star rises because his father-in-law, Alec Hewitt (Brian Cox of ""The Glimmer Man"")hires him to work in his huge company. Things are exploding for the protagonist at this time. He is assured of wealth and happiness and the very thing he sought outside of his marriage becomes an anathema to him. This synopsis takes ""Match Point"" up to about the first hour and a half of its two hour plus running time. Woody Allen paces this melodrama superbly and he captures the English way of life and language. I cannot reveal what happens in the last 36 minutes. Indeed, I was on my feet, walking around as I watched those last 36 minutes. The suspense--based on the outcome of this feature--was simply unbearable. The suspense doesn't end until the last three minutes of the film and Allen has you on the edge of your seat throughout those final 36 minutes. Women probably won't like this Woody Allen movie for its incredible, unpredictable ending. I still cannot believe how surprised that I was when the movie finally did end. The performances are flawless; nobody delivers a bad performance. The two detectives at the end of the movie were fantastic! One of them is the fantasdtic Ewen Bremner of ""Alien Vs. Predator"").

","Luck. That is what Chris Wilton describes at the opening scene of MATCH POINT... Please take note that the thoughts explored in that opening are exactly what is explored in the closing scene. The film is a matter-of-factly depiction of the troubles one has to face during extra-marital affairs, or forbidden relationships for that matter. Jonathan Rhys Meyers plays the character with the much needed intensity and bustling pressure that occupy Chris Wilton. Johansson is able to stand out as the strong-willed Nola Rice, aggressive and anxious to put things to a resolve suspense builds as she always desires to make things her way if Chris's actions aren't enough for her... Bryan Cox is excellent as Alec, the father-in-law of Chris, this is the first time I have seen Cox with an English accent... same with all other players, they shine in this Woody Allen piece. Woody Allen handles his work with the D.P. and camera operators very well, some interesting shots, long takes e.g. the scene where Chris bumps into Nola in the sidewalk and walks her into her audition and many more.<br/><br/>The suspense in this tragic drama builds to an almost unbearable level when Rhys-Meyer's character decides to do the deed that will be the turning point towards the climax of the movie. The intensity of his portrayal of what Chris is going through in those scenes is perfect and only appropriate. As with most of the movie, that turning point of a scene is accentuated with some opera music as well, and more spine-chilling in it's melody at that during the sequence.<br/><br/>Well, the movie does not end as ... Nola Rice (Scarlett Johansson) would have had it, but it does not end on an ""up"" note either. And it does not end the way you think it would, if you can tell my train of thought (no, not a happy ending) but not that either. Instead it closes with a little discrepancy, in fact a little twist that happens against Chris Wilton's act in the end of the film... and as mentioned in the opening scene, it closes with a little bit of luck. Just watch what I mean. The ""lucky"" element is a visual parallel of the first thing you see when the film opens. Excellent filming of the ""objects"" involved in what I am referring to.<br/><br/>Allen has done a terrific job in weaving a tale of passion, obsession and the release of self-control and decisiveness and the consequences of it in this life.

For your convenience I'll divide the two hour film in four quarters of 30 minutes length each: First and second quarters keep your attention up pretty good.

","The plot of this movie was uncannily similar to that of the 1925 novel, ""An American Tragedy"" by Theodore Dreiser. Allen just changed the setting from central NY state and the Adirondacks to London, changed the main characters M.O. (staged fake robbery instead of staged ""accidental"" drowning), and gave it a different ending (in the book the main character gets caught and is sentenced to the death penalty). The book was based on an actual murder in 1906 in which a man, Chester Gillette, killed his ex-girlfriend and tried to make it look like an accident. Gillette got the death penalty much like, Clyde Griffiths did in the book.<br/><br/>But coming from a morally bankrupt pedophile like Woody Allen, I'm not surprised that he would stoop to such blatant plagiarism.

"jay4stein79-1","9","1","3","8 May 2006"," Do you feel guilty?
","Woody Allen is at the top of a short list for the title of greatest American director of the past 35 years. The man has produced quality films since the hilarity of Bananas in 1971, seemingly with ease. He's given us some duds (see 1980-1984 and 2000-2004), but his credentials are impeccable: Sleeper, Annie Hall, Manhattan, Interiors, Purple Rose of Cairo, Everyone Says I Love You, Sweet and Lowdown, Hannah and Her Sisters, Deconstructing Harry, Husbands and Wives, etc. And, when his films fall flat, they're nevertheless interesting. Like Robert Altman, he just seems to love making movies, regardless of their critical reception. <br/><br/>As I said, Woody had hit the doldrums of late, producing intermittently funny films like Hollywood Ending and Small Time Crooks. To pompously quote Jeff Daniels in the Squid and the Whale, these are lesser Allen. Match Point is his best film since a string of brilliant gems during the mid- to late 1990s. It's terse, tragic, and darkly humorous; it's also a delicious slice of noir. Allen has made a movie like this (Crimes and Misdemeanors) but this slick little movie feels more lurid and more juicy. <br/><br/>It's a potboiler that moves inexorably toward its conclusion like the finest fatalistic literature. Echoes of Dostoyevski and Strindberg are heard clearly throughout, but there are undercurrents here as well of Dreiser. To those who pick up on these leitmotifs and those who remember Crimes and Misdemeanors, the plot will not surprise, but do not worry. The characters are despicable (every single one) to varying degrees and the actors take to them with relish. Match Point is easily the best-acted Woody Allen film to come along since Sweet and Lowdown; I would argue that acting here trumps that in just about any Allen film not named Manhattan, Interiors, or Crimes and Misdemeanors. As Chris, Jonathan Rhys Meyers is a perfect cipher: beautiful, charming, and everything everyone wants him to be (he is, in that way, like a Tom Ripley). He also has a habit of allowing people to push him around, though he is far from spineless. Scarlett Johanson is no less stunning as Nola; sultry at first, the layers peel away to reveal an exceedingly emotional, unstable, and wounded woman. Her cries of liar near the end of the film are gutwrenchingly believable. <br/><br/>Why else should you see Match Point? Well, there's the operatic soundtrack, which melds perfectly to the action on screen, and the photography, which is actually a presence in this film. Never known for a definable visual schema, Allen has had wonderfully photographed films (Manhattan, Interiors, and Crimes and Misdemeanors in particular); Match Point falls into that category. The framing Allen employs creates a sense of claustrophobia that encapsulates the characters appropriately. <br/><br/>Not quite as great as Crimes and Misdemeanors, Match Point is a fantastic film that, I hope, will get Woody Allen back on track for another great run of films. I shouldn't be greedy and should be happy with his extant body of work, but I await his films each year with bated breath, knowing that the next jewel is just around the corner."
"finding-something","9","1","3","2 May 2006"," Patience is Rewarded
","This film is not boring. Not in the least. What is routine, what is everyday, does admittedly consume the first, oh, 45 minutes and requires patience from the audience. But after that, and one cannot really mind all that much as the cast is absolutely gorgeous, the suspense piles and piles until it is quite unbearable. One of the most satisfying suspense films ever.<br/><br/>What Meyers does playing Wilton, the protagonist and tennis pro, is phenomenal. His smoky eyes speak volumes and his mouth is absolutely expressive. From early in the movie, Dostoyevskian themes are suggested, and Wilton's behavior and psychology slowly shift into a complexity worthy of one of the Russian author's own heroes. Indeed, instead of confusing the pace and content of the movie, Woody Allen's allusions to books like Crime and Punishment is woven integrally, with care, into the film.<br/><br/>The movie itself plays, almost, as a tennis game. Characters act, and the audience feels batted back and forth as we take short leaps in time and discovering events directly as well as indirectly. If there is a net the audience passes over, it's the films score. Opera music provides a continuous thread and boundary to anchor the story. There is hardly a superfluous line in the movie, much less any criminally unnecessary scenes. Speaking of scenes, I love how classically the movie is filmed. Often times, two characters are framed very properly without the camera cutting for whole minutes at a time. While camera shots become more complicated and disjointed in popular cinema, here, Allen's simplicity was a treat. Beautifully filmed.<br/><br/>Undeniably, Scarlett Johanson is a beauty, and is on her way to greatness, although, do not expect it here. At times, her performance is a little reserved, but her subtlty is reamrkable. One laugh in particular had me distracted even scenes later.<br/><br/>As I said, patience is rewarded. The plot is tight and thick, though slow-going at first. One thing is certain, if you commit to it, you'll never imagine, or be disappointed, where this movie will go."

After the police find Nola's diary, Chris obviously becomes a prime suspect so in no particular order here is why I think the plot is full of holes: <br/><br/>(1) In the scene where Chris phones Nola and asks her to meet him that evening, her co-worker asks if it is him and she says yes. It would make sense that she would have told her that she is going to meet Chris after work. Don't you think the police would have questioned the co-worker? <br/><br/>(2) With the tenant knocking on the door of Nola's neighbor and knowing when Nola finished at work, the police could easily establish the approximate time of her death. Chloe would be able to tell the police as to what time Chris met her at the theater so his alibi doesn't hold water.<br/><br/>(3) If the police talked with the employee at the theater she could have verified that Chris checked in a tennis bag which was quite heavy, very capable of holding a shotgun. His co-worker at his office (when Chris leaves) notices the bag too so he could verify it, as could Chloe.<br/><br/>(4) Chris takes a cab from Nola's apartment to the theater. He is running late so it is not likely that he walked a distance before hailing a cab. Couldn't the police check with all the cab companies making a pick up close to that location and ask the driver for a description of the person they picked up? They can calculate when Chris would have to have taken a cab as the time frame is quite narrow. If they showed the driver a picture of Chris wouldn't he able to identify him? <br/><br/>(5) The police mention about discreetly checking out the shot guns that Chris' father in law own. Don't you think they would conduct ballistics test on those guns to see if there is a match? Or is it because shot guns cannot be matched using ballistics?<br/><br/>(6) Wouldn't the autopsy on Nola reveal that she is pregnant? Wouldn't that further explain Chris' motive and increase police suspicions? <br/><br/>7) In the end the police conclude that a drug addict killed both Nola and her neighbor but there are no signs of forced entry in to the neighbor's apartment. It doesn't make sense that the neighbor would let in someone she didn't know (she even says that before she lets Chris in). Given that Chris was having an affair with Nola, it would be logical to think that her neighbor had previously met Chris. <br/><br/>(8) Does the drug addict have a ""history"" or record of using a shot gun or sawed off shotgun? If not, isn't a handgun much easier to conceal so wouldn't the fact that Chris' father in law has a number of shot guns be another clue? <br/><br/>I can even overlook the astronomical odds of a drug addict finding the neighbor's ring, being killed in a shootout, and having the police find the ring in his pocket as part of the theme of there being a lot of luck in life and the ring teetering on the handrail as a tennis ball would on a net but all the above makes the events in this movie totally implausible."
"Illymovies","3","1","3","14 April 2006"," Dramatic work? More like comedy to me!
","I enjoyed the movie, as I found it relaxing and I liked some of the landscapes and the story was sort of fun, although very stupid at times. The lead actor was very silly...but perhaps that's how his character had to be.<br/><br/>Before seeing this movie, I saw the trailer for it to get an idea about this movie. And it seems like you are better off just seeing the trailer, rather than the whole thing. There are a lot of things to criticize. First, there are certain phrases or dialog that seem extremely fake. And all the talking in between these fake phrases seem to be there just to connect them together. It's extremely cheesy/cliché..not sure what to call it. ""I married a girl...family has nothing but money..."". PPPppppplease! Although I understand what this movie was trying to be about, I don't like what it actually was. Yes, there are the so called ""social climbers"" that have the ""luck"" to get infiltrated into rich families like that, but it just seemed way too easy in this case. Everybody seemed to work just for the benefit of the lead actor. Scarlett J. liked him although she was involved with someone else, Chloe liked him almost immediately, the father liked him immediately...and the mother who apparently had a problem with Nola could see nothing wrong with Chris. I didn't like Scarlett's role (her acting was okay but I didn't like her character so much in the movie)...so she was American, so she was from a poor, broken family...so she didn't want to be poor...so she had no luck with acting...just a stupid character altogether. She was always giving interesting looks to the camera and she was always teasing with her presence and her eyes. She would go from being totally put together and relaxed about things, to drinking too much in the middle of the day and turning into a very lusty/flirty woman to taking pills and being desperate to confessing to us that she has had a few abortions before??? It all seemed very ridiculous..and if she was really that desperate she wouldn't look as well and as relaxed as she did at other times. Should I even go into the crime scene??? As soon as Chris made that pathetic move of stealing or borrowing the shotgun from the basement...I was just laughing ever since. The way he put it in his tennis bag and the way he had troubles putting it together and ...finally the way he killed the poor old lady....and finally...hello Nola...bang!...extremely stupid...!!! So, if you want to have fun, and maybe even laugh a little...while enjoying beautiful London images like the London Eye and the financial district (the camera work was good and I thought there were some great artistic shots that captured well the greatness of the city, and it tied in well with that great opportunity that London was for both Chris and Nola) and the calming yet very typical and simply presented life of the ""higher class"" then this movie is for you. Don't expect it to be great, don't expect any hidden or philosophical meanings, and please don't comment on how cool the whole LUCK thing was. He was lucky...ya, okay...but in a very simple, stupid sort of way!"
"pyrocitor","8","1","3","8 April 2006"," Relentlessly gripping from start to finish
","After a slew of less than successful films, it seemed that Woody Allen, who it seemed at one point could never fail, had lost his touch, become too dated and formulaic to appeal to modern day audiences. Wisely enough, Allen seems to have realized the best way to stay fresh and interesting is an abrupt change of pace, of base of operations, of genre and of style. The most noticeable difference in Allen's latest, 'Match Point' is the fact that he forgoes his usual NYC setting, replacing it instead with upper crust English society. Also, gone is the light comedic tone and neurotic lead characters who seem only a shallow echo of Allen himself - here we have very different personas spouting significantly different lines than those we are used to hearing in an Allen film. <br/><br/>Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) is a fallen from grace ex tennis pro who marries into wealth to raise his social standing. With a beautiful and enthusiastic wife (Emily Mortimer), her very British brother who Chris instructed in tennis and introduced him to the family (Matthew Goode) and more importantly, their very rich and generous father (Brian Cox) who lands Chris a high ranking position in his business firm, it seemed that Chris had gone from virtually nothing to everything he could ever want in a nauseatingly short time. But Chris' stable and very successful life is rapidly brought to a staggering halt when he is introduced to American actress Nola Rice (Scarlett Johansson) who he instantly falls for, despite her being engaged to his future brother-in-law. Complications ensue as Chris and Nola try to decide whether their affections for each other would be worth compromising their very secure lives for each other. <br/><br/>Although the main feel of the story may be different territory for Allen, the underlying profundity of the narrative is still there. All throughout the story, we as an audience find ourselves forced to confront the issue ""is passion more desirable than stability?"" and likely applying it to our own lives as well. Allen's script is excellent, making so much more out of what could have been a very cheesy and unoriginal story, with numerous great lines only touching on being pretentious at times, but this is largely masked by the two excellent leads and great supporting cast. <br/><br/>Performances are excellent across the board, especially from the two leads, who are the main focus of the show, and are easy capable enough of maintaining our interest. Jonathan Rhys Meyers is excellent in the lead as Chris, the ex-tennis pro who grows bored and unhappy with his unnervingly stable life - he really brings Chris' conflicting emotions to play in a truly compelling fashion. Scarlett Johansson is also great as Nola Rice, the unsuccessful actress who also finds herself tempted to choose passion over stability in her life. Despite common sentiments that she was only cast due to her looks, Johansson gives a very strong performance, though it's true that her absolutely stunning beauty is a highlight of the show. There is also excellent support from Emily Mortimer as Chris' wife, who is very nice though not terribly interesting with her constant desire to get pregnant, the very British Matthew Goode as Nola's fiancée, and Brian Cox as Chris' very rich father in law, who essentially secures him a position in life. Cox avoids stereotyping by underplaying the feigned kindness with a streak of intimidation, and his performance is superb - as are everyone else's. In fact, the only real downside of casting is the horrendously stereotypical British police officer, who comes across as hilarious at one of the most crucial and not intended to be funny parts of the movie. <br/><br/>Allen has created a truly excellent piece of work here, as Match Point is relentlessly gripping from start to finish. Despite its seemingly simple storyline, we as an audience still manage to be taken aback by each twist of the story, and the ending is nothing less than genuinely surprising, as well as very satisfactory for having not taken the easy way out in storytelling terms. Intrigued? You'll just have to see Match Point for yourself... chances are you won't be disappointed. <br/><br/>-8/10"
"rginsberg","4","1","3","3 March 2006"," Great ending; mediocre movie.
","Felt like he came up with a wonderfully cleaver twisty ending and then built a mediocre movie around it. It certainly took off after he decides to kill her, but until then who are you supposed to like or care about or even marvel at a-la-Hannibal Lecter? At one point, during their first kiss in the rain, I thought Woddy was purposefully making a movie with wildly clichéd language: ""No good cam come of this..."" What tripe. Maybe I'd heard too much good about this before going, but it really did nothing for me. It certainly has been fun discussing it with friends, many who disagree with me. The tennis ball hitting the tape -- ring hitting the guard rail is great stuff. And the fact that it seemed like this was bad luck (big spoiler ahead) and it ended-up being the thing that exonerated him is pure genius. But sheesh! I must admit I'm no fan of Ms. Johanson and I found them entirely without any on-screen chemistry. And the moment when, in the heat of passion, she uses his necktie for a blindfold was the second lowpoint (after that rainstorm kiss). Insert eyeroll here. Just awful. I do have to wonder if anyone would be giving this much praise if the director had done it under an assumed name..."
"diane-34","10","1","3","3 March 2006"," Perhaps the Master's best.
","I am a self confessed coward when it comes to movies and I mentally threatened myself many times that I would walk out of this wonderful film simply because it was too strong for me. At the end, however, I was glad I had stayed for the absorbing twist that ties the movie all together.<br/><br/>The script was a tough one for me. Allen wrote it beautifully with the tension slowly building like a spring wound too tight but with nothing that can be done to release the tension; the inevitability of the drama that unfolds made for seat-squirming for a coward like me. Alen's direction was superb; as I mentioned the tension was built slowly but inexorably to the climax. His directional timing was brilliant and all of the cast worked together perfectly.<br/><br/>Allen's shot selection was also superb as was Adefarasin's cinematography and Cardine Smith's set decoration. The visuals of Match Point were therefore as stunning as the acting and as one critic wrote, ""This may be Woody Allen's best film ever"". I believe that assessment to be totally accurate!"
"PiranianRose","10","1","3","15 February 2006"," Woody Allen, you did not disappoint me. Bravo
","Walking into ""Match Point"" as my first Woody Allen experience proves that I have a long way ahead in exploring cinematic excellence. Here Allen deftly plays with our expectations. At various points, the film appeared to be falling into conventional traps; for example, when the attraction between Nola and Chris became unbearably evident, but one of them was afraid to be seen together, I suspected the story to branch into the ""forbidden love"" territory a la ""Brokeback Mountain."" But not so! Or, when Chris was reluctant to accept an office job, I thought perhaps this film would explore his unhappiness with the business world, and where his heart really belonged, as a conventional film is expected to do after establishing the character's reluctance. My foreshadowing was off, and I'm glad that the seemingly conventional plot was nothing more than a warm up for the dark, haunting side of the human experience that is often overlooked because the truth hurts. If you have not seen this film, here is a word of warning to set the right expectation: do NOT expect to walk away charmed, and do expect ""Match Point"" to explore psychologically frightening territories. The story progresses through several phases, and Allen demonstrates that he refuses to give in to popular expectations. Nevertheless, keep in mind that Allen stated in an interview that he was not aiming for a depressive tone -- merely a realistic one, not that it isn't funny occasionally!<br/><br/>""Match Point"" is my first Woody Allen experience, and I would rate it as a daring and powerful effort that transcends the limitations of popular cinema; I would not have expected any less from the legendary director."
"Kryzak","9","1","3","9 February 2006"," Thrilling and Complex!
","Wow! ""Match Point"" was my first Woody Allen movie, and DANG it was good! I came out of the movie all giddy and excited about how good this movie was, no wonder it's now sitting at #5 in my top movies of 2005! The movie was clever, exciting, suspenseful, involving, artistic, and powerful all at the same time. I must say that Jonathan Rhys-Meyers (who was also in ""Bend It Like Beckham"") outdid himself and delivered a knock-out performance as the social-ladder climbing/adulterating husband in the movie! His portrayal of his guilt, indecision, and passion are so raw yet nuanced that I can fully appreciate the dilemma that his character has to go through in the movie. It seems that there are so many good performances by a male lead in the past month that the Oscar race is definitely shaping up to be a slug-out! All the other supporting actors in the movie were very good, though not as many got the chance to shine like Meyers. I believe he stole the show.<br/><br/>As for the screenplay and directing by Woody Allen, I must say that I am very very impressed! The story had twists and turns that kept me guessing. Every time I thought I figured out the ending, something else (believable) pops up. The whole theme that was set in the beginning (""I'd rather be lucky than good"") was laced throughout the movie, to a very good effect. I especially loved Allen's inclusion of literature, art, and music into this movie, and the story draws its strength from all three aspects. The movie explores many topics including adultery, wealth vs love, guilt, passion, and of course, luck vs skill. All this, mixed in with some great music (mostly from an tragic opera - is that a redundancy? ), led me through a roller coaster ride of emotions and lots of anxiety for the characters' fate in the movie. I attribute that to Woddy Allen's superb directorial skills! I remember reading a review for this movie that said, ""To call this movie Woody Allen's comeback is an understatement!"" I fully agree with that assessment! The *only* flaw I found in the movie was Jonathan Rhys-Meyer's tennis forehand... for a pro that supposedly played against Agassi and Rusedski, his forehand was quite painful to watch... haha! But hey, the movie is so good I can forgive him for that! So what are you waiting for? Go see the movie already! You'll be thrilled!"
"csicasto6","9","1","3","9 February 2006"," Its worth getting a sore ass from the theater seats...
","The movie starts off really slow, and this was the first film I'd seen after Brokeback Mountain, and started to wonder if this was the British version of Brokeback. Thank God it picked up.<br/><br/>The end was phenomenal!! I normally am able to ""predict"" what the movie's going to do next, but this film kept me guessing. This movie had almost every genre in it. There were moments where it was a crime drama, a romance movie, a comedy, and the list goes on. I suggest that everyone should see this film, because it gives the audience a great message.<br/><br/>The acting overall was average, but Jonathan Rhys Meyers was amazing by the end of the film. The use of classical opera added such serenity to the film, it can't go unnoticed. Woody Allen has created yet another great film."

","Brilliantly genius? not a chance. Does it come close? Ehh, nope. I am really surprised it got 8/10 stars! I gave it 6.5/10 stars and here is why. <br/><br/>I love movies with a nice message, albeit corny at times ;) BUT, a movie with only a semi-original message doesn't make a great movie ..if it lacks other necessary aspects. Yes, this movie had an interesting metaphor, but it lacked a great screenplay and believable characters! I have a simile of my own. This movie was like a sinking ship! It took really long time to go down, sucked you in for a couple of minutes and left you for bare/alone for the sharks. <br/><br/>Here is my opinion and I just watched this movie today. Few Spoilers<br/><br/>-I got annoyed by the product placements. Can they be more obvious? Yes. Sure they do this in movies, but come one! They started right from the beginning of the movie with the Hewlett computer. And guess what ? since nothing else is happening in the scene, your attention is going to be wandering around. I have to say, the other movie with Scarlett (The Island) had a lot of product placements too. Coincidence?? If I'm fully enjoying the movie, i don't mind as much. But when the movie slows down and gets boring , it really starts grating on my nerves.<br/><br/><ul><li>the movie started really really slow. This guy's life is changing. He's getting married, having an affair with a beautiful woman. Has a new career because of his new father-in-law. You would think he would be more happy/excited! But no...</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>the plot started to pick up in the middle. I can't say why because I'll spoil the whole movie for those of you who want to watch it. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>the ending flunked. Scene with the cops was a joke. I'm sorry to say. I can see how this movie can remind other people of previous movies they have seen of love ,lust, sex, betrayal. But this movie surpassed all that. Aha! Luck seemed to be their additional ingredient. Sadly, the movie reminded me of the Scott Peterson trial/case. </li></ul><br/><br/>-the message of the movie was...just ..can't finish this sentence. ""Depends on your luck"".. and there goes the message!? Can see half the audience agree with it and the other half rolling their eyes. Yes, the movie spoon-fed the message from the beginning...but was this really necessary?<br/><br/>This movie wasn't THAT bad; had it's redeeming qualities. The screenplay was bad (conversations b/w the lead characters was corny/laughable) and the ending sucked/rushed . But the movie had an important message and a nice trailer. If they like the trailer, more people will see it. Who cares if they come out of it entertained/satisfied or not. At least that is what happened to me. Anywho, here is the message once again ""It's your luck"" ...and that is how many times they reminded you. <br/><br/>Good luck in watching the film...if you do decide to watch it after all."
"essex9999","Null","2","12","15 January 2006"," Dull, Prententious ... Classic Latter-Day Woody Allen
","First of all, I'm sick of WA's obsession with upper-class people and the life he thinks they should lead. As is typical in his movies, the characters in MP exist in some weird never-never land untouched by popular culture. Here we have a group of 4 affluent urban people in their 20's, but none of them ever go to a club, watch a football match, listen to music less than 100 years old or, apparently, watch television or go to movies that aren't French. Even the bars and restaurants they frequent are stuffy rather than trendy and modern.<br/><br/>It's not that I disdain high culture or particularly love modern pop culture or trendiness - often the reverse; but, c'mon on, nobody under 50 nowadays leads this rarified a life, let alone a group of young, wealthy, pretty Londoners. It makes the characters less believable and less sympathetic to portray them as being so remote from the cultural universe the rest of us inhabit.<br/><br/>Secondly, Chris' character is flat and uninteresting because we don't know about enough about him to understand or care about his motives. If he was a poor boy, how did he come by the posh accent? (If that is indeed a posh accent; JRM's mode of speech was so stilted it was hard to tell.) Is it put on? Has he always been a climber, aiming to marry a rich girl, or did he just happen to fall into the company of these rich people and like what he found? Who cares? If WA was trying a make a point or build a story around class differences, he failed - there is not enough conflict and contract between the characters to work on that level.<br/><br/>Overall, although Match Point was pretty look at, by the last half-hour I was peering at my watch, anxious to get out."
"buff-29","6","2","12","14 January 2006"," Stilted dialog, contrived plot
","How can this movie have gotten so much praise? British reviewers have not been especially kind, but on this side of the Atlantic the compliments have been tossed around quite recklessly. It is always fun to watch Scarlett Johansonn, but there is not a lot of other entertainment offered in this very long movie. The opening is handled well enough and the first hour of the film passes without causing undue pain. But then: oh my heavens. Characters drift in and out of character, and the plot becomes one contrivance built on another on another. By the time the end rolls round, one has been checking one's watch every 5 minutes for what seems like hours. Woody Allen may still have some movies in him; I just hope that he keeps them, if the rest are as sorry as this."

","This is in many respects a film with a very old-fashioned feel about it. Despite a vibrant young cast (who do add suitable amounts of passion) the story is the familiar one of marital infidelity - but the nature of the infidelity, its setting and its ultimate resolution are all reminiscent of great British films of the 60s.<br/><br/>Interestingly, I think this could have been a great retro film - set it back in the days when class ruled the business world, when nepotism was rife, when London was chic, before feminism - and the whole thing makes much more sense.<br/><br/>Now the ending - why? If you've seen the film, you'll know instinctively when it should have ended - with the slow-mo at the riverside. That was enough. It would have been subtle and elegant. The rest is superfluous."

","Woody Allen has a deserved reputation as a highly skilled film maker. He has a place in the history of Hollywood. Despite this... critics and the public have been both suspicious and doubtful about his work over the last 20 years or more.<br/><br/>This film confirms beyond any doubt that Mr Allen is a master of his trade. To be able (as an American) to create such a plausible and accurate portrayal of English manners may not be a wondrous achievement in the way that Hollywood is so desperate to make us 'wonder'... but it is a delight. It is an experience to treasure because the story (transported by an exemplary cast) provides an insight into what being English really is. Smug, self satisfied wealth, sits alongside social conformity and naked lust. It completely ignores harsh reality of course... but what the hell!<br/><br/>If I was better read... I am sure I would be able to give you all sorts of literary references to reinforce my opinions about this film... but I watch films for the emotional responses they drag out of me, and not much more.<br/><br/>I like it.

","From Oscar and twice Golden Globe nominated actor-writer/director Woody Allen (Annie Hall), his first in Britain, this is quite a good film that doesn't have any comedy at all. I didn't really pay much attention to the first few minutes of the film, but basically Chris Wilton (The Tudors' Jonathan Rhys Meyers) is a retired pro tennis player, and gets married to Chloe Hewett (Emily Mortimer), who it is quite obvious he is not in love with entirely. So he starts an affair with the girl he has much more passion for, struggling American actress and Femme Fetale Nola Rice (Golden Globe nominated Scarlett Johansson). They have a great secret passion, but she gets very demanding on when they should get together, causing him problems sticking to schedules with his wife or other stuff. As Chris gets more and more harassed by the demanding mistress, he must make a decision on which woman he wants more, he chooses his wife, and decides to kill an innocent old woman, Nola's neighbour Mrs. Eastby (Margaret Tyzack), and then Nola, making it look like a robbery, where Nola got in the way. Chris does have to give an alibi to the police, and of course he has to tell them about the affair when he knows Nola kept a diary, of course, Inspector Dowd (AVP's Ewen Bremner) and Detective Banner (James Nesbitt) realise this plan, but in the end, we never see him get arrested, it's more a will he stay free ending, he should have got what he deserved. Also starring a variety of British stars, including Brian Cox as Alec Hewett, Matthew Goode as Tom Hewett, Penelope Wilton as Eleanor Hewett, Rupert Penry-Jones as Henry, Alexander Armstrong as Mr. Townsend, Paul Kaye (aka Dennis Pennis) as Estate Agent, The League of Gentlemen's Mark Gatiss as Ping-Pong Player, Colin Salmon as Ian and The League of Gentlemen's Steve Pemberton as Detective Parry. I may have seen affair films many times, but this is actually pretty original, with some good acting and interesting realism, well, maybe not the murdering, but everything else. It was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama. Very good!"

","Even though it was very well acted, expertly filmed, and professionally directed, about 2/3 of the way through the film I began to detest the main character. He is selfish, deceitful and betrays people who love him. He ends up abusing some people he should have loved and some totally innocent people as well. He cares only for himself and the benefits he can gain from his relationship with others. This film left me with a terrible, empty feeling. The ending was depressing, not pleasant at all. In fact it was very disturbing. Call me old fashioned but I prefer movies where those who do evil get their just reward. The real villain in this movie doesn't get punished for his/her misdeeds."

If you are thinking about this movie, please, get something that is actually worth watching. I know that I could make a more entertaining movie given the budget that Woody Allen was given. I don't think Woody spends enough time with his story! This was not a thriller at all! it was a bore! A thriller would not have 45 minutes of set up time till something happened. I think he's been spending too much time thinking about young girls and not enough time working on films!! It took so long for something to happen in this movie; too much set up. The acting was average at best. Watching this movie, I wonder if Woody Allen was directing in his sleep. Maybe, he's just in it for the money and looking at Scarlett Johanson's chest!

Whether or not the director chose the right backdrops or scenes to show of London, I couldn't tell you. This wasn't Before Sunset people. This movie was different and worth seeing and I am surprised that some thought it was terrible. Its always refreshing to see a movie where none of the characters are stupid."

He did a couple of such kind of movies recently.<br/><br/>""Match Point"" does not it either category. It is shot as a ""genre"" film, which Allen loves to do, shot and taken place in Britain, as an Ivory movie, underlying the inside perversity of British high society. The story is full of questions, the actors are tremendous, but... I am disappointed! Why? I did know at first sight. I believe that the movie is challenging, and that Allen did not achieved his goal. Nola's character is finally not deep enough, despise the great talent of Scarlett Johansson. She even get us hoping more about the depth and tragedy of her character. Unfortunately, she does not appear to be such a fatal woman as she is supposed to be one, because of her appearing sensibility.She really loves Chris. And the scenario treats her character as a supporting one, explaining Chris'choices. Chris as well, did not succeed in being a tormented person, choosing deliberately to have a classical and healthy life, even if it is fake. The moment of the choice and the final ending are too quick. Only the ghosts of 2 dead women are there to suggest the terrible inside dilemma and guiltiness. The British actors (devonian, londoner and Scottish ones)are perfect in their supporting roles. I guess it is not the fault of the actors. It simply does not work, after having been mostly promising. That is a pity!!"

","After seeing the Scarlett Johanson is going to be in a Woody Allen picture I had to check it out. I could not of been anymore pleased.<br/><br/>Films now a days has a typical plot and no effort on camera shots. This film had it. The movie started off very slow for me. Actually, to be honest with you, I wanted to turn it off after 45 minutes! The movie's plot is one very crazy love triangle. The acting was so good I could relate it to my favorite movie of all time, 25th Hour. You could really feel for the guy that was in the situation and understand the pain he was going through.<br/><br/>Woody Allen tricked me with his great shots making you lean towards a negative effect but turning out to be a positive effect, or vise-versa. This movie was very original and really required a great script. Of course we know how good Scarlott Johanson can be (excluding the Island - my opinion).<br/><br/>My advise to you is not to turn this movie off after the first 45 minutes but be patient as this movie turns out to be one of the years best thrillers! I give the directing a 10, editing a 9, acting a 9, plot a 8, writing a 9, and message a 9. This movie will make you think!"
"TxMike","Null","1","4","26 May 2006"," I like this one better than most Woody Allen movies.
","So, it isn't in New York. It isn't even in the USA. There isn't even a role for Woody Allen himself. There are no characters that seem like Woddy Allen. I really enjoyed it, kept me wondering all the way through, more like a Hitchcock movie or a Shakespeare play. It has very interesting and witty dialog that Allen is famous for, but not in the usual Woodyesque manner.<br/><br/>Set in modern day London, Jonathan Rhys Meyers is Chris Wilton, excellent pro tennis player, but not good enough to be a big winner. So he decides he has enough of the touring life, and looking for some stability takes a job as a teaching pro at an exclusive London club. A series of ""lucky"" events take Chris on a journey he could never have predicted. In fact, this is the whole theme of the movie, illustrated at the beginning, with a tennis ball that hits the tape, bounces up, and introducing the concept, whether it is lucky enough to bounce over can influence who wins and who loses the match. Life really happens that way, and it is good to see a movie that treats the subject well.<br/><br/>SPOILERS FOLLOW. Chris' first student is a former college tennis player, son of a very wealthy business man. Whether it was set up by Chris we are not sure, but mentioning that he enjoys opera, his student Tom Hewett (Matthew Goode) invites him to a performance, where Chris meets Tom's single sister, Chloe (Emily Mortimer). Chloe is moving past the marrying age and falls hard for Chris, who in turn falls hard for Tom's fiancée, American actress wannabe Nola (Scarlett Johansson). In fact, we never believe he loves Chloe, but marries her as a way to stay near Nola, and to get a nice job in dad's company.<br/><br/>The story takes a big twist as Tom and Nola break up, Nola goes back to the USA, and Chris is stuck with a wife he is not sure he wants. But, when Nola shows up again, Chris cannot control his lust for her, sees her every chance he gets, they develop a torrid affair, always barely avoiding getting found out.<br/><br/>Then Nola gets pregnant, Chris is caught between a wife and security and a passionate woman, who wants a father for her child. Chris, always lying to everyone, decides the only way out is to kill Nola and make it look like she was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. He takes a shotgun into the landlady's apartment right before Nola is expected home, shoots the lady, messes up the apartment, steals some drugs and jewelery, then goes into the hallway and shoots Nola. Police question him, looks like he will get caught, aided by Nola's diary, but a copy murder happens, the thief has the ring stolen from the landlady and cops assume the same thief had killed Nola, they keep the affair secret. When Chris had tried to toss the ring into the river, it hit the top rail as he turned his back, bounced up and back onto the sidewalk, where the eventual thief found it. Match point, decided by chance!!"
"fwomp","4","1","4","12 May 2006"," You're Headed In The Right Direction, Mr. Allen
","Some reviewers and movie-goers have been stunned by the transformation of Woody Allen as a director because of this film, and there's no doubt that this is a step in the right direction. His horrible, horrible, horrible film THE CURSE OF THE JADE SCORPION completely turned me off (not to mention some of his less-than-appropriate personal behavior but that's another story). Woody had trouble seeing himself as an older guy in many of his more recent releases and seriously miscast himself in roles that were never intended for a short, balding, and aging man.<br/><br/>Thankfully, here in MATCH POINT, Woody's balding pate never makes an appearance. He's planted firmly behind the camera as director, and this is a very good thing (but not a great one).<br/><br/>I will give Woody Allen credit; he's gone off his previously overly beaten path and is branching out into realms unknown to him. Match Point is a case in point (no pun intended). Here we have a young tennis pro stud named Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) who comes to London from Ireland in pursuit of a better life. He meets up with a nice, wealthy young man named Tom and is quickly introduced to his sister Chloe (Emily Mortimer). A relationship starts to build but not before Chris runs into Tom's fiancé, Nola (Scarlett Johansson), a blond bombshell who's ready to ignite anything near her. Chris marries Chloe but not before having ""an encounter"" with Nola, setting the stage for a relationship nightmare in the future. Tom breaks up with Nola, thus allowing Chris more access to her, but when pregnancies, family fortunes, and the future of everything Chris has been working for comes to a head, he has to make a choice; a terrible and wrong but lucky choice.<br/><br/>I don't want to give too much away here in case some of you decide to watch the flick. If you've seen it already, let me say that I don't agree with Chris' choice (obviously) but one can see why a man (or woman) could be driven to do such a horrendous thing.<br/><br/>I'm gauging this film based on other movies, not just other Woody Allen movies  thus my ""thumbs down"" rating. Although this is a giant leap in the right direction for Mr. Allen, it still held a narcoleptic pace. The acting was okay, nothing extraordinary, but nothing to jump up and down about either. The sets eh. Nothing great there either. The dialogue was okay but sometimes felt forced and speedy. When Chris first meets Nola over a ping-pong table, their actions and emotions feel rushed.<br/><br/>Match Point has been compared, in theme, to Hitchcock. I beg to differ. Woody isn't that good, but perhaps with a little time he'll get there."
"djmig","10","1","4","5 March 2006"," The confirmation (another) of a genius
","With this remarkable film, Woody Allen reassures both fans, non-fans and critics that he is still one of the few genius cinema has left. I am definitely going to label it as a masterpiece. Again Mr. Allen shows his deep knowledge of the human behaviour, and specially his most irrational (or not so) actions. An immoral and cynical story, where such things as love, lust, welfare, greed or luck play a more important role than the characters themselves. Its a case study about the concrete and the abstract. Jonathan Rhys Meyers plays the non-chalant Chris Wilton, a poor Irish boy that fought his way up (you may say he is a social climber), and after finding his El Dorado (marries the sweet and rich Chloe), is faced with a terrible choice (as he says, he must choose between love and lust), Scarlett Johansson, as a sexy actress that has not yet found her way to the top, and all the crew have astonishingly intense performances. The dialog is both clever and literate, the environment is elegant and charming. The very first minutes of the movie particularly dazzled me, and you really become aware of the important role luck plays in one's life."

","I love old movies. If it's in B&W. I will probably watch it. Why don't they make them like that any more? They do. At least Woody Allen does. He captured the British aristocracy, Irish easy, and American money-lover in a dynamic dance of suspense and lust.<br/><br/>I could feel the tension in the theater as the plot twisted and the viewers' minds tried to grapple with passion, deceit, and crime. At the end of the movie, there was an audible gasp - ""Is that it?"" ""Wait, go back!"" ""What happened?"" I'll be thinking and talking about Matchpoint for quite a while. I rate it second to Crimes and Misdemeanors which had a better motive for ""eliminating the problem"".<br/><br/>Not to be missed if you like movies the way they used to make them!"
"happy_hangman","Null","1","4","31 January 2006"," Allen Loses the Match
","'Match Point' is Woody Allen's most serious film in many years. Like the superb 'Crimes and Misdemeanours' it has at it's heart a cheating husband who seeks to murderously remove the obstacle posed to his prized familial happiness by a pushy mistress. Sadly Jonathan Rhys-Meyers Chris (the poshest working-class-boy-made-good in cinema history) is no Martin Landau, and, though he sweats and pouts in a conspicuously angst-ridden manner in the latter stages of the film, his performance, overall, is seriously wooden - a woodenness which surprisingly extends to many of the supporting characters, which is unusual for Allen. Emily Mortimer as his doting wife and Scarlet Johansson are capable and consistent as, respectively, the love and lust of his life, but Rhys-Meyers' character is not solid enough for them to work with, or for audiences to care about them or him. Given the murderous conclusion to the film this makes for a peculiarly passionless love-triangle. Penelope Wilton and Brian Cox, as Mortimer's parents enjoy much less screen time, but are more convincing as characters than any of the younger leads. John Fortune, Mark Gattis, Ewan Bremner and a host of very fine British actors are given very little to do other than stand around like extras. A shocking waste of potential uncommon in a director who can normally be counted upon to use character actors well.<br/><br/>Odd trans-Atlantic clunkers in the script (""I thing you've had one too many G-and-T's, dear!""  the British middle-classes only ever talk like that in US films) aside, the serious tone of the script is maintained until, surprisingly, the final twenty minutes, when we are confronted by a few staggeringly ill-judged comic moment which jar astonishingly with what has gone before  and with the sudden spectral visitations of Chris's victims which follow. The ending is muddled and discordant. A shame  as otherwise it's a creditable addition to the Allen canon, far superior to other recent efforts."
"RiseShine","2","1","4","26 January 2006"," Is this normal with Woody Allen's movies?
","I would like to know, whether it is normal that Woody Allen's movies are quite boring like Match Point? So far I did not watch many of his movies, but if this one is his masterpiece, I think I don't have to watch another one. I found the plot very uninteresting, there was nothing new within it. Basically one guy gets successful by lying all his way up. And of course he gets everything that he wants. The only thing mentionable was that he did not get caught and punished at the end. What I want to know: maybe the movie was without any suspense, because Woody Allen is from New York and does not like the usual Hollywood stile? I cannot understand why people speak of this movie as Mr. Allen's masterpiece. Annie Hall was by far better than this one. To say something good, too: I think it was filmed brilliantly, especially the scene where Nola and Chris were sitting in the pub and drinking. From a certain PoV he suddenly looked much better than in the rest of the movie, and that was because at this moment she was at the point of finding him more interesting. Anyway, it was very interesting to learn more about Woody Allen, but this was definitely a very uninteresting movie."
"majikstl","4","1","4","22 January 2006"," ""You were collateral damage.""
","MATCH POINT makes its point right up front: ""I'd rather be lucky than good!"" is the philosophy of the film and its protagonist and it's director, Woody Allen. However, neither Woody, nor the film, ever make it clear just what he means by ""good' -- good as in talented or good as in moral. Not that it matters, since the film's protagonist proves to be neither in particular. Moreover, the axiom doesn't really mean anything. It is like saying ""I'd rather wear a hat than a necktie;"" the inference being that you have to choose. It's not an either/or situation; one can certainly be both lucky and good -- or neither. And no one can choose to be lucky or would choose to be unlucky. Thus, it is a meaningless premise: MATCH POINT sets out to argue over a non-sequitur.<br/><br/>MATCH POINT was greeted with praise as Woody's ""comeback"" film -- such nonsense! Given that Allen had directed and written and/or appeared in 24 movies in the decade and half prior to MATCH POINT, it is absurd to suggest he needed to make a comeback. Whether good (DECONSTRUCTING HARRY, EVERYBODY SAYS I LOVE YOU), bad (MELINDA AND MELINDA) or indifferent (ANYTHING ELSE, THE CURSE OF THE JADE SCORPION), his films have always been worth watching and debating. And they have all been distinctively Woody Allen movies; despite a variety of genres and attempts to experiment with styles, his films have bore his imprint. Until MATCH POINT, which is so generically mundane in style and attitude that it could easily be mistaken for a Lifetime cable TV movie. Rather than rebirth, as some have suggested, MATCH POINT seems to suggest an artistic coma.<br/><br/>Though described as a thriller, the film is mostly soap opera. Jonathan Rhys-Meyers stars as Chris Wilton, a middling tennis professional who takes a job instructing the game at a high-toned London club. By chance he is befriended by an heir to the wealthy Hewitt family and little by little becomes part of their inner circle. As a matter of course he ends up with a wealthy wife, a bothersome mistress and a murderous solution to this predicament. The story plods along with its unending backstory, not gaining any sort of thriller or murder mystery element until the third act, where the crime and the aftermath are played out with little intensity. Let's face it, Woody is not Hitchcock; the film is sadly lacking suspense, not to mention momentum.<br/><br/>Devoid of Allen's keen sense of humor or even an attempt at being witty, the film lacks his New Yorker's self-deprecating musings. And even though it is his first film made in England, you wouldn't know it were it not for the actors' accents and the occasional appearance of those little black London taxis. The story seems to want to make something out of the British class structure -- working class social climbers marrying into old money -- but there is no sense of time or place or social standing in the film. And even though Allen makes repeated references to opera he fails in his attempt to make this meager drama seem like a grand tragedy.<br/><br/>Like all of Woody's ""serious"" films, MATCH POINT is slickly produced and well crafted, but it lacks a certain style, neither reflecting the mannered, pretentiousness of his artsy films like INTERIORS or ANOTHER WOMAN nor the haughty refinement of a typical Ivory-Merchant adaptation. The result is a film that is coldly efficient, but not engrossing. This is not helped much by the two leads. The supporting cast (Matthew Goode, Emily Mortimer, Brian Cox, etc.) are just fine, giving warm and intelligent performances, but Rhys-Meyers and Scarlett Johansson as the neurotic mistress are, at best, just annoying. Together they are a pretty, albeit shallow, pair, but they exhibit no chemistry; lacking romance, passion or eroticism, their affair is a mere plot contrivance. Apart, Rhys-Meyers is painfully passive almost to the point of lacking a personality; how he charms his way into the benevolent Hewitt family, let alone upper-crust society, is the film's true mystery. Coming off as a sullen teenager, Johansson's never lives up to her character's image as an alluring temptress in the first half and then degenerates into a self-obsessed demanding shrew, not unlike Anjelica Huston's similarly neurotic harridan in CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS. And, quite frankly, since neither character is ""good"" in any sense of the word, why should we care if either is lucky. Allen defeats his premise long before he serves up his foregone conclusion.<br/><br/>Though there is no ""Woody"" character to act as his surrogate, the film is not devoid of all traces of Allen. The film boasts his standard theories about the randomness and pointlessness of human existence and the totally arbitrary nature of morality, ideas he has talked to death in previous films. But as trivial as his ""lucky vs. good"" theory sounds, it is sadly pessimistic to suggest that all good things truly spring from the accident of existence, while striving to be good, either morally or professionally, is relatively pointless because it has no guarantees. ""Why bother trying,"" he seems to be saying, ignoring the fact that relying on luck has even fewer guarantees. Plus, it is astonishingly hypocritical for Woody to promote this self-defeating philosophy. Though he often claims his success has been based on luck, it is dishonest of him to embrace such false modesty when his career has been built on his constant effort to make better movies and to improve his craft. But as luck would have it, MATCH POINT can't be pointed to as a good example of that."
"dieter-verhofstadt","7","2","13","21 December 2005"," Some negative marks
","Since all the comments here have been very positive - and you may read those splendid reviews first - let me give a few negative marks that I'm surprised few people seem to have given.<br/><br/><ul><li>It is difficult to believe Rhys-Myers' personage is capable of deluding his allegedly intelligent wife, while keeping his lover hanging on the telephone. You wouldn't give him that credit. - It is even harder to believe he has been a professional tennis player, holding his own against Agassi or Henman. His being a pro player wasn't necessary for the plot, so I wonder why they insisted on having him display his mediocre tennis skills. - While the movie does a very good job in giving us the feeling of boredom and superficiality that govern the posh atmosphere he's gotten into, several scenes take simply too long. - Finally, I couldn't bear with the tension building and hardly ever resolving, but that may be a strong point of the movie as well.</li></ul>"
"cmusni","5","2","14","14 January 2006"," Didn't like it
","Sadly I found this movie particularly dull. The first thing that comes to mind is the dialog because it lacked wit. One way to judge clever dialog is that it makes you feel, and many times makes you laugh. This movie didn't do either of those things and actually I think my conversations are more interesting than the ones in that script. Believe me that is not compliment. But my main problem is that the main character isn't interesting. Until he does his deed towards the end of the movie, he doesn't do anything challenging or make any decision. All great characters from any great story always make decisions based on their situation. Our guy in Matchpoint never does that and just lets life happen to him without making his own choices. To me that seems weak and counterproductive to making an interesting person. Oh, one last thing. This is a small point. For the story to work the way it did, the main character and his lover meet (or at least run into each other) 3 times in London. Now I didn't do the math but I think the population of London is at least 10 million people. What are the chances that that would happen. Think of it this way, how often do you run into your neighbor who lives 5 houses down the block and then expand those chances by 10 million. Since the theme in this movie is luck I think our characters would have been better off playin the lotto."
"stephenm-18","2","1","5","14 June 2007"," Awful awful awful!!!
","Where do you start, when attempting to catalogue the many flaws in this awful, awful film? Let's see....<br/><br/>1. The script. Gah! What nonsense! Here's a tip for Woody Allen - If you're going to write a story about English people, try listening to how they talk, before putting pen to paper, man! It just didn't sound like the English we here spoken every day in this country. Simply inserting the word ""bloody"" into every the odd sentence (and incidentally, inserting it in the wrong part of the sentence), does not make a script ""English"". In particular, the cringe-worthy scenes with Jonothan Ryhs-Meyers and his ""chums"" from Wimbledon came across as Dawson's Creek meets Shakespeare in Love by way of Dick Van Dyke. Also worth dishonourable mention were the constant, clumsy reminders to the viewers that they are watching a film set in England. Constant references to ""Big red London buses"" and everyone having ""G&T"" on the lawn! What ho!<br/><br/>2. The principle characters. Rhys Meyers is a fairly charmless leading man wandering through most of the film doing a faintly camp impression of Pierce Brosnan, and all this film taught me about Scarlett Johannson was that a) she's quite athletic and b) she's not much of an actress. Even so, had the leading man and lady been the greatest actors of our generation, they would have struggled to breathe life into such lazily sketched characters. The characters were immoral, vacuous and thoroughly unpleasant to watch - but these crimes could be forgiven if only they had shown a fragment of charisma, just something, a little glimmer that might have indicated to the audience that we were watching two good looking robots. The whole thing is just lazy, that's all I can say. When Brian Cox gets Rhys-Meyers' character a job ""In Business"" (capital i capital b), it's almost skipped over as an afterthought, oh and the dreadful scenes in ""the office"" - Meyers takes an Important Phonecall, Meyers Studies Important Reports - all smacked of a rather cack-handed attempt to illustrate that the young protagonist is now in the exciting world of ""Business"" and it's never explained as to what the father character sees in this sinister, unlikeable young fellow.<br/><br/>3. That ghost-story nonsense tagged on at the end. I mean, really! I think as an audience, we're owed a little more credit than that.<br/><br/>What really broke my heart about this film is that despite dodgy accents, acting and scripting aside, the premise is excellent (which side of the net the ball falls on - although they laboured that a bit after a while). It's quite interesting in the first half too, and seems to gather pace once he's decided to do away with Miss Johansonn. But it's not long after that that the whole jalopy runs out steam, and loses direction.<br/><br/>Just to give you a clue as to how bad I think this film is - I watched it when it came out at the cinema - and I still feel slightly cheated over 18 months later. At the time, after the first hour I tried to get some sleep, thus trying to ensure that although my money had been wasted the rest of my time would not. I couldn't sleep. I was too angry.<br/><br/>On the sunny side it features the excellent Brian Cox and Penelope Wilton, and I'd say that's about the only reason I gave it a ""2"". Even that however would not be enough to make me want to watch this film again. I doubt torture would be enough to persuade me to waste anymore time on this film.<br/><br/>In seven words - ""stick to films about New York Woody"""
"aleesha_hansel","2","1","5","19 November 2006"," No game, set and match for this film..
","Quite possibly one of the worst films I have seen. The script was bland, the story plot was not really there, and the acting was cringe-worthy.<br/><br/>On first inspection of the cast list I was excited to see the film, as I have been pleasantly surprised by their other films. However, the dialogue was slow, almost as if they had only just learnt their lines.I understand that Mr.Allen was perhaps going for the 'reality' view point, and therefore keeping in lines upon which the actors stumbled, and spoke over one another, but instead it just felt unprofessional.<br/><br/>The quality of acting was actually quite upsetting, at one point actually making me laugh out loud at how bad it was (Scarlett Johansson). They just didn't seem as if they wanted to be there, and the only passion exhibited was during the 'love' scenes.<br/><br/>Jonathan Rhys Meyers had put on a somewhat English accent, which was rather confusing when the other characters called him 'Irish'<br/><br/>The plot which was uninspiring, didn't emerge until the end, and by then it was too late.<br/><br/>All in all a disappointing film,"
"mv-angel","10","1","5","14 July 2006"," The vision in the eye of the beholder
","I am in general quite hesitant to watch Woody Alan's movies. I find them too pretentious, snobbish and just too ""american"" to deal with. However, ""Match point"" was a different story. Unlike so many movie out recently, it has so MANY dimensions and story themes. Usually a movie is made by just one of the many dimensions reviewed to the eye of the beholder in the movie.<br/><br/>Let me try to quickly point our why I give it 10 out of 10 for this reason only (not to mention that the action was superb, carefully matching the story lines). 1. The traditional Greek tragedy story line. Just listen to the music, and read the definition from Aristotle who write that tragedy results in a catharsis (emotional cleansing) of healing for the audience through their experience of these emotions in response to the suffering of the characters in the drama. He considers it superior when a character passes from good fortune to bad rather than the reverse; at the time, the term ""tragedy"" was not yet fixed solely on stories with unhappy endings. Chris is such a classic example of a character that went from good fortune to bad and reverse so many time, accompanied splendidly by the music. 2. The cotinuous reference to luck and the ""match point"" theme. It was done in a splendid way so many times! 3. Love and lust theme. Or in other words the feelings we can live with and the feelings we need to live with! 4. Longivity! Chris could not create a live when he was not putting his mind into it. Or something else... But anyways, despite of the mechanical aspects of the act, he managed to create live when he did make love the women he cared about. Not only when he had to do it for the sake of making babies. 5. ""Crime and punishment"". No this is not Dostoevsky neither Shakespeare, even though we had our ""Hamlet"" moment, but it was clearly shown that no crime goes unpunished. The detective knew he was guilty. He was going to be sent to jail as he did use a well known weapon he could had access to. BUT we are shown, again in relation to the Greek tragedy theme, that like ""Antigone"", the moral values could be much harder than any punishment men could cause as our here is practically dead at the end of the movie. Yes he DID deserve to be send for life to jail, but the jail in his soul he is living in is much harder punishment that anything else could cause him... 6. Family values. Yes this is a family values movie. The father character is just great. Always supportive and almost flawless. Is Chris trying to be like this? We will never find out, as his future is doomed...<br/><br/>Happy to read your thoughts. Cheers. Mike"

The story is about a tennis obsessed man who moves to England to become a tennis coach (one for beginners), but realizes tennis isn't going to make a life since he's good, but not pro level good. But, he gets lucky when he gets a certain pupil. This man is the very wealthy son of one of the richest men in England. Of course, the two become fast friends when they find a common interest in Opera, and many things lead to another. Soon he meets the man's sister, and the two become fast lovers, too fast.

","Frankly, I don't see a point in making a movie like this. The main theme of it is extremely old and boring and was exhausted maybe 20 years ago. There were no performances that would make this movie memorable, either. For an hour and a half I was asking myself, ""Why should I care?"" (still don't know the answer, by the way) and ""When is this going to end?"". With very few exceptions, the dialog is terrible and so is the narrative, very schematic, predictable, and full of stereotypes. I couldn't believe Woody Allen wrote and directed this.<br/><br/>So it was, extremely boring and uninspiring, until the plot took a twist in the last thirty minutes. Then there were indeed a few non-stereotypical turns some of which I enjoyed (and they are the only reason I give this movie a 6 instead of a 3) but overall, was this last half an hour worth waiting, dying from boredom in the meantime? Definitely no if you ask me."

","This movie is truly a disappointment to watch. I find the acting by Meyers and Johansson are dreadful, one with a plain face throughout the film and another seems to be a little girl slip into mom's dress and pretend to be sexy. <br/><br/>But let's talk a little bit about the classical music Woody Allen used in this film, and how wrong they are:<br/><br/>1, There are two scenes in the Royal Covent Garden opera house, with what I believe ""La Traviata"" and ""La Boheme"" on the stage performing, and Woody Allen actually used Piano Accompanied opera singing in the sound track. This mistake is laughable! Anybody who has being to an opera house would know there be a full orchestra in the pit playing.<br/><br/>2, Piano playing opera score music is also used in the big party scene in Hewitt family country house. I think this is an obvious mistake too because the plot implies that the Hewitt family is playing their proud old opera collections, not that they hired a pianist to play the opera score in the party.<br/><br/>3, There were great opportunities for Woody Allen to choose opera music that can related to the story line, and represent Meyers's character, or even Johansson's gold digger character. But instead, Woody Allen just used whatever he could find old sounding LPs, and patch them here and there randomly in the film. Every time the movie uses Donizetti's ""Una furtiva lagrima"" from opera L'Elisir d'Amore, (for example during the title credit,) it starts with this aria's Second verse. One just have to wonder whether there is Anybody knows about classical music at all in Woody Allen's crew."
"Danusha_Goska","6","1","7","17 January 2006"," Smooth but Shallow; Exists to Serve Its Trick Ending
","""Match Point"" is smooth but shallow; its main reason for existing seems to be its trick ending.<br/><br/>The trick ending is interesting, but it would have been more satisfying had it come at the end of an hour-long television mystery, rather than a feature length film, which should have, but didn't, delivered more depth and range.<br/><br/>""Match Point"" consists mostly of shots of attractive, well dressed, upper class Londoners having polite conversations in stunning London apartments, cozy country estates, restaurants, and upscale art galleries.<br/><br/>This is all very well done. It's smooth and slick. Fine direction, naturalistic script, perfect sets.<br/><br/>Jonathan Rhys Meyers is first rate. His charisma, complexity, and star power, and his combination of tender, young, humanity and brutal contempt, brought to mind Laurence Harvey in ""Room at the Top."" If you want a voluptuous temptress who will threaten a marriage and slide from irresistibly attractive to shrill and creepy, you couldn't do better than Scarlett Johanssonn.<br/><br/>There is extramarital sex, handled very discretely. We've seen this material -- man cheats on wife and begins to panic -- many times before. The movie really needed to treat it in a new way to really come to life, and it didn't.<br/><br/>Near the end, a murder is committed, and the film attempts to address issues of human character, destiny, and meaning. Here the film falls short.<br/><br/>I won't reveal any spoilers here, and I won't reveal the trick endings. I will, though, talk a bit about the murder and the murderer.<br/><br/>I didn't believe that the character that the movie created would commit the murder he committed. The film is bumblingly obvious in its efforts to set this character up as a highly ethical, very decent, young man. He reads great literature; he insists on picking up the tab at lunch.<br/><br/>Otherwise, he's a bit of a cypher; we really don't know anything else about him, except that he's a highly ethical, very decent, young man.<br/><br/>In other words, the script uses him as a plot device. When the script wants him to be decent and ethical, he is made to appear decent and ethical in painfully obvious ways. When the script needs him to commit a murder, he commits a murder. The script wants to shock us, and so it creates this unlikely about-face.<br/><br/>The script wants us to believe that any one of us could commit this same murder. Baloney. I will no more commit a murder like this than I will be president someday, and neither will you.<br/><br/>The murderer's friends and family also make the film completely unbelievable.<br/><br/>The murderer begins acting strangely. His behavior would set off alarms in the most simpleminded of people. And, yet, though the murderer is surrounded by very, very sharp and successful international businessmen, people who make millions before breakfast, they *never suspect* his heavy sweating, his sudden, unexplained departures, transparent lies, emotional outbursts, twisted schemes, etc.<br/><br/>The script wants us to believe that any of us could be a murderer without our peers realizing it. It never makes this idea believable.<br/><br/>The script wants us to believe that the murderer believes that committing a murder is his only route. But everyone in the murderer's world supports him, loves him, forgives him, dotes on him. He is handed money, and jobs, and love, and forgiveness. In that environment, it would be much easier for the murderer to solve his problems by any route *except* murder.<br/><br/>""Match Point"" is just not believable. Thanks to tabloid television, we've all had murderers in our living rooms. The murder committed here bears some resemblance to the Scott Peterson murder.<br/><br/>Thanks to the years-long, multimedia, dissection of Scott Peterson, and other murderers', characters, we know more about murder, and murderers. We know about their narcissism, and their bizarre warning signs. None of that insight has been incorporated into ""Match Point."" Ultimately, in spite of its slick and professional sheen, ""Match Point"" is hackneyed, unbelievable, and boring."
"leonblackwood","3","1","9","14 September 2014"," The pace was way too slow! 3/10
","Review: I didn't really enjoy this movie. It seemed way too long and I was waiting for ages for something to happen. An hour and a half is about a married man having an affair and then it takes a weird turn with the unnecessary shooting. The acting wasn't that amazing and I wasn't that impressed with the ending which didn't give a great moral to the whole story. It's a different side to Woody Allen's writing which shows that he can do serious films as well. The only problem is that the storyline wasn't that great and the whole rich, English family concept was a bit pompous. Basically, I didn't really enjoy the film and I just got bored after a while. Disappointing!<br/><br/>Round-Up I'm surprised that this movie took so much money at the box office because most of Woody Allen movies don't usually make that much money. On the plus side, you do end up sticking with the film because you wonder how the whole situation is going to pan out, but apart from that, it's just about your average love affair that turns sour. Anyway, if your into your slow romantic dramas then you will enjoy this film, I but was expecting something a bit more entertaining. <br/><br/>Budget: $15million Worldwide Gross: $85.5million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into there romantic dramas about a love affair that goes terribly wrong. 3/10"
"mfsor","5","1","9","12 January 2006"," Rehash
","The lead male is a really good actor; Johansen is a competent professional, but not a great actor. The story is a rehash of A Place In the Sun (Montgomery Clift, Elizabeth Taylor, Shelley Winters). I liked the idea of luck, and the ring/tennis ball thing was clever. They skimped on locations and variety of scenes, everything happening inside the same apartments. It took a long time for this movie to get going. I also question the ability of the lead actor to carry out the gruesome actions he did. There was a disconnect between what it would take to do it, and the rest of his feelings shown in the other scenes of the movie. Too many extreme close-ups. Liked the old opera recordings."
"olethrosdc","6","1","9","30 December 2005"," Different from usual Woody Allen, well-made, but bland
","The movie is apparently written and directed by Woody Allen. It did seem rather different from anything else I've watched of his; somehow it brought the Hitchock Presents short film series to mind in how they seemed to be have been made with Hitchock's advice, but without him being very much involved personally. This could be an explanation, or perhaps WA is exploring new directions - or possibly he did this kind of thing before in a movie that have not seen.<br/><br/>The movie is paced amazingly well - the visuals are not breathtaking, but they are not the important point. The important point is the characters. The acting is great throughout, and although perhaps we see too much of the protagonist altogether, the supporting cast never fails to deliver and come off as truly genuine and complete characters.<br/><br/>The following, why not directly spoilery, will help you guess at some events before their occurrence.<br/><br/>The story is reminiscent of Crime and Punishment in some ways, with the obligatory Dostoyevsky references and heavy opera music. It is extremely easy to follow as everything is relatively subtly hinted before hand. The climax to the actual crime follows a pattern: the protagonist just keeps on going, saying: I decide I want to do A. To do that, I'll have to do X. So he does it. When circumstances change, he never considers maybe doing something other than A instead. A is what he had decided to do, and A is what he will keep on doing.<br/><br/>There is a brief passage in the movie where he discusses whether he wants to continue with A or not - and from this discussion he immediately realises that he is going to continue with A. And when something gets in his way, he will stop at nothing. And thus the crime is committed.<br/><br/>The inexorable progression towards the perpetration of this crime mystifies me completely. The character's actions were simply not believable. This is not a problem with the acting, but with the script. And with a story centered around 'real' characters rathern than space/action heroes, one expects a certain realism for character motivation and plot development. Unfortunately, this was completely lacking in this movie. <br/><br/>So: pacing, acting, music, all excellent. But plot? Abysmal."
"Dave-189","7","1","10","8 January 2006"," Good film; too bad it has an unnecessary anti-Christian remark
","I haven't seen a Wood Allen movie in years; I guess it's my personal protest against his affair (and marriage?) to Mia Farrow's adopted daughter. I've always thought that Allen is a sick man; but, no doubt he's also quite talented.<br/><br/>This movie is a bit slow, but offers some interesting twists. The movie starts by referring to one rather being lucky than good, and no doubt our main character reveals on multiple occasions how luck can be quite beneficial.<br/><br/>The one thing I didn't like was a totally unnecessary anti-Christian remark: at dinner, a remark is made about someone loosing their legs and then finding Jesus; the response was that it wasn't a fair trade, and laughter followed (from the characters, not the audience, fortunately). Why? Woody Allen, who is SO sensitive about being a Jew, can inject an anti-Christian comment, that was (a) unnecessary, (b) served no purpose), and (c) was offensive in what otherwise is a decent movie. Fortunately, it was the only such remark, but I guess just reinforces the fact that Woody is, I guess, anti-Christian. The only answer I can come up with.<br/><br/>Would I recommend the movie? Yes, it was quite good (I gave it a 7). And, offers a lot to reflect upon following it, which I quite enjoy. Too bad his anti-Christian sentiments had to be revealed."
"damfaz","5","0","1","27 May 2020"," What's the (match) point?
","The first part of the movie seemed interesting, even if this is not my kind of film, for sure. I enjoyed the adultery thing but it could have been written in a better way (did they really have sex under the rain without getting a cold? Lol). Too many repetitive moments and too many indefinite time jumpings.<br/><br/>By the way, I liked how the rich guys have been represented as stupid pampered people with no substance. But not the wife. Damn the wife is too stupid, that's unrealistic! She is assumed to think only about having children with his husband, yet she doesn't understand that there's something wrong with him.<br/><br/>But nothing really terrible until the ""thriller"" part.
I understand that this movie is something about fortune, but again, this is unrealistic. I neglect the ridiculous police work: that part should have not been filmed to me. Chris' murder plan has been smart, but not so much that he could get away with it. This is not about being lucky, this is about
being sorrounded by stupid blind people.<br/><br/>And what's the consequence of the murder? Just an hallucination?<br/><br/>So the question is: what's the point?
The main character has been an angel-looking bad guy for the whole time and no one noticed that. He is able to do whatever he wants, it doesn't matter: fortune would always help him. This makes no sense to me.<br/><br/>At least I agree on the fact that Scarlett Johansson is attractive to everyone."

4. The conclusion is strangely satisfying, and it ends up concluding the story in an unexpected, but satisfying manner.<br/><br/>Cons:

2. The dialogue, specifically in regards to the romantic triangle, is incredibly clunky, cheesy, and too in-your-face.
3. Chris Wilton as the main character is exceedingly unlikable, and only becomes interesting towards the end of the film.
4. Chris Wilton is introduced as an ex-tennis player, yet it becomes clear quite quickly that it's irrelevant to the plot.
5. The movie, aside from the last 15-20 minutes, is full of forced melodrama that is, for want of a better word, boring.
6. There is absolutely no set-up to the thriller turn, and although it's the most entertaining part of the movie, it feels massively out-of-place."

","I know Allen has a fairly wide raging filmography but I tend to think of him as a comedic director. Further many of his films always seem to have a comedic edge to them. Match Point is one of a handful that isn't comedic at all. It is instead a dark sensuous thriller about the life's haphazard way of dealing out fates by chance not moral standing. It consciously borrows from Crime and Punishment to make this point and the novel is incorporated directly into the text. Chris is a fascinating character and there is a maddening ambiguity to when he became awful morally. This is just a well put together film. I like how minimal a lot of it is."

","Match Point recalls Crimes and Misdemeanors, which also had a passionate affair threaten to rip apart the marriage of a wealthy high-class couple. But in the latter there was never an excruciating task to pull off, a immaculate getaway and attempt to cover his tracks. Judah convinces himself that the hit is his brother's idea, has someone else do the dirty work for him, and is never once threatened with the possibility of getting caught. It was his own moral conscience that created the tension. In Match Point, there are numerous ideals thrown around about luck and fate and determinism that really take away from its moral centre - and in the tense, quiet manner in which Chris commits his crime, and waits agonising for the neighbour to walk away, it becomes a detective thriller rather than posing meaningful questions. <br/><br/>Chris is a retired tennis pro, which conveniently allows Allen to begin with a simple metaphor about his life's philosophy. He is from a poor background, but does not speak like it, and seems to have said goodbye to that world all together and never leave the world of luxury and riches when he becomes acquainted with the Hewett family. Early on, he seems rather embarrassed to receive a helping hand from Alec, but as time goes by, he gets more accustomed to a certain standard of living and would even kill for it. <br/><br/>The supporting characters are rife with cliché. Bride to be Chloe does not have an ounce of responsibility and shamelessly encourages the buying of her future spouse, all while spouting nonsense such as ""I don't believe in luck, but hard work"" without a hint of irony. Johansson's Nola is the wildly beautiful mess of a struggling actress with a deeper cleavage than back-story, and the Hewetts are of course disdainful of anyone that would seek to sabotage their legacy. Allen, on the financial incentive of BBC Films, shoots them on the backdrop of London's high class elite, but it feels more like a tourism advert with the annoying habit of them announcing every iconic destination they visit. <br/><br/>This marks a distinct departure from Allen's usual style and not in an overly impressive way. He has never been so openly critical of the high- class intellectual but paradoxically make it so enticing and seductive for the lowly Chris. These are shallow, shallow people who breed ever so carefully to maintain their legacy (there's even a quick quip about interbreeding like some royal family). In Allen's best films such as Hannah and Her Sisters and Annie Hall, his blocking was clever and inspired; it allowed the actors to breathe and display their insecurities through their body language in simple long takes. Here, he has a tendency to shoot closeups and move the camera indiscreetly to imitate a furtive glance or sign of attraction rather than trust his actors to do it - or even frame a single subject just to highlight how obvious their actions are. Chris and Nola will be shown in bed together several times, but cut away from before they reach peak physical passion - it's certainly not the post-coital chit chat that they sneak away for. And its easy to mistake Rhys Meyers broody, edgy performance for something of great depth and conflict; he does well for what he is given, but there's no substance to the characterisation that makes the drive for murder believable. The two shots from the sawn-off are over in a second, and he is allowed no time to linger and react.<br/><br/>Luck is purported to be the universal element. Allen is not subtle about this; it is brought up in conversations it has no right to be in, and in moments of dramatic climax, the soundtrack fades to make way for an opera backing, and a tiny incident of chance gets slowed down for faux poignancy. The script contains these little clues and red herrings that would not be out of place in a cheap thriller; an acquaintance near Nora when she gets that fateful call, an painfully long interrogation of Chris at the dinner table that is awkwardly thrown in for tension, and when Nora gets pregnant right away after months of toiling with Chloe, he winks at the audience and says: ""What unbelievably bad luck!"" And there are these cops which provide a very convenient ending. First they are hesitant to poke into family affairs. What sort of murder investigation would ever consider this? And then, almost insultingly, he comes to the perfect solution in a dream. Allen's writing might at times be snobbish, high-brow or overly pretentious, but it's never been this lazy. In the end, Chris is lucky that these detectives are written so poorly."

Scarlett I always find great although she seems to play the sex bomb every time but at least she plays the part well. I felt ""Chris's"" wife was incredibly annoying and was hoping he'd knock her off but then that's perhaps the character she was supposed to play.

His job is high paying but he isn't saving the world.

","Poor young tennis instructor falls for his client's girl friend, and who wouldn't? It's smoldering Scarlett Johansson from Boulder, Colorado, whose beauty is of such peculiarity that from some angles she looks like a creature recently emerged from the sea.<br/><br/>The attraction between Johansson and her swain, Mathew Goode, is understandable. Not only does Johansson look good but, as she remarks, ""Nobody ever asked for their money back."" However, her boyfriend, Goode, is a high-end British aristo, soon to be Lord of Cummerbund-and-Peplum or whatever it is. The family is ill disposed towards an aspiring American actress with only one commercial behind her and a distinct lack of interest from any casting directors. I mean, what is she going to do when her looks fade -- make him flapjacks for breakfast and prairie oysters for supper? Not that it matters much, because Johansson and Goode are soon quit of each other. The young tennis coach who had fallen for her and had a roll in the meadow with her now seeks her out again, although he himself is married to the high-end sister of his tennis client.<br/><br/>Are you following all this? I followed it but I had to organize as much concentration as I did when learning to solve quadratic equations.

The problem is that it DOES drag on for a long time. It isn't funny and it's not gripping. In ""Manhattan,"" I didn't care who wound up with whom but enjoyed the little gags, like Allan in a boat in Central Park trailing his hand through the water and coming up with a twisted clump of slime.

At first look, the screenplay might look like so-so or not quite original. But I think that everybody was surprised after seeing the whole two hours. That's what happened with me. I rented, started it and I just couldn't pause it until the end. I was just totally absorbed by the story and I was always asking myself : oh my god, what's gonna happen next?, every single minute. That is exactly what I'm looking for in the movies and very few of them can do that. This is certainly the best film by Woody Allen. Now, everybody's gonna say: nope! nope, it's Annie Hall. Well, I wasn't so much amazed after seeing Annie Hall than Match Point. This film is awesome because it made me think for a long, long time after seeing it. And I watched it about a dozen times and I still enjoy it! And also, the actors are just great. Even if Jonathan Rhys-Meyers didn't get a lot of prize for this role, I still think that his performance was awesome. Plus, this film shows perfectly the lifestyle of wealthy Britain people, which I love. And the music, Oh! the music. So perfect, just so melodic, enjoyable, classic. A real true masterpiece."

","Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) is a tennis pro who befriends wealthy Tom Hewett (Matthew Goode). Tom's sister Chloe (Emily Mortimer) falls for Chris but Chris has only eyes for Tom's fiancée Nola Rice (Scarlett Johansson). Nevertheless, Chris marries Chloe for her family money.<br/><br/>I found the story moved slowly. I feel like the movie can start much later. Starting the story from when Chris meets Tom seems unnecessary. Squeezing the timeline would help increase the tension. Although a tense thriller isn't necessarily a Woody Allen trademark.<br/><br/>Jonathan Rhys Meyers gives an interesting performance. He's suave enough to catch Chloe but creepy enough when he's with Nola. Scarlett's performance is basically looking hot and do a bit of yelling. I don't think she stretched very much. We all know she's hot. Everybody else plays it straight."

","""Match Point"" has a well-constructed story and good writing, and I found it generally entertaining. The professional reviewers cited it for its dark exploration of the role of fate and chance in our lives, but without Woody Allen actually making it clear that this is his theme, as he does on a few occasions in the film, the movie is not particularly deep. Basically it boils down to the story of a young married man's obsession with a sexy Other Woman. Eventually it evolves into a thriller.<br/><br/>As often happens in Woody Allen's dramas, it is difficult to care about his characters. The young man, Chris, is fixated on rising in the world, though he has only vague notions of what he wants to do and is easily seduced by the wealth and luxury of his wife's family and the plum job handed to him by his father in law. The Other Woman, Nola, is distinguished mainly for her sexiness. There's no question of love between her and Chris.<br/><br/>Nor, for that matter, does Chris really love his wife, whom he damns with faint praise by calling her ""sweet."" Sweet she may be, but even she tried my patience.<br/><br/>It's an emotionally arid, cold movie with not much to say about chance, luck, and fate except that chance occurrences do happen.<br/><br/>The worst thing about the movie, for me, was the unrelenting opera music on the soundtrack--loud and passionately insistent as only opera can be. I found the music irritating, distracting me from what was after all a pretty intricate story with some tense moments."

","I never thought I watched another Woody Allen movie until I was about half way through Match Point and decided to check on the whole cast.<br/><br/>I thought on giving up on the film, I do that a lot specially for acting reasons. The two leads weren't all that good except for their looks. Their two supporting actors were much better and I stuck it out. What a surprise at the end. Let the characters say it in their own words or was it Mr. Allen speaking?<br/><br/>You can learn to push the guilt under the rug and... go on. You have to. Otherwise it overwhelms you.<br/><br/>And what about me? What about the next-door neighbor? I had no involvement in this awful affair.

You'll have to watch the whole movie to get to those juicy words of.. a psychopath. And trying to have us believe it was all due to poor origins is to suspend disbelief. How many will fall for it though? Way to go for making a totally unwarranted diversion. Now even though the lines were taken after 'Crime and Punishment' by Fyodor Dostoevsky, (I haven't read the book and don't intend to), it's a poor excuse to know that duplicity has always existed and to this day if only worse. We have 9/11 as an everyday reminder."

","Is it just me or did monsieur Allen recycle an idea and add a murder scene? That aside it is definitely one of the best looking pictures he has done (Scarlett Johansen may have to take some credit for this fact... she pretty... ). The cast are all quite swell and quite delightfully British but i think the fact that it does have a British cast and it takes place in the UK gives it a little bit of undeserved suaveness. I feel people ranked this much higher due to its 'sleek' smart blah blah blah but the fact is that if this was an American cast uttering these lines people wouldn't be quite so impressed and/or dismiss the lack of humour (i'm using the u cause thats the way they do it across the sea) in a Woody Allen movie. All in all though a good movie that tackles those tough and saucy issues of fidelity, economic standing and whether Scarlett Johansen is just a bad actress with a dashing looking face (and other parts too) or...well one cant concentrate looking at such a beautiful face.

","Hitchcock = suspense. Scorsese = gritty drama. Ford = westerns. Allen = comedy.<br/><br/>What you have read above is all true. Except for one thing. Hitchcock is the master of suspense, Scorsese is the master of gritty drama's, Ford is the master of westerns. Allen is the master of comedy, suspense, drama and thriller. And he proves it, he really proves it, in Match Point.<br/><br/>Young retired tennis player Chris Wilton accepts a job as a tennis instructor at a posh tennis club in London. One day, he shares a court with Tom Hewett, destined to become his brother-in-law. He marries Hewett's sister, Chloe a few months later. Wilton climbs his way up the ladder at work, working for his father-in-law. He basically is very well set. He has a bright future. Only one problem, he is also involved in an intense sexual relationship with his brother-in-law's fiancée.<br/><br/>The film is definitely one of the best thrillers ever to hit the screen. The performances by Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Scarlett Johanasson and Emily Mortimer are excellent. Rhys Meyers and Johanasson are especially noteworthy. The film's setting suits it perfectly. Then there is the fact that it's directed by Woody Allen.<br/><br/>I might be stressing this point a little too much but, it's. Directed. By. Woody. Allen. There I think I got my point across. Allen, Annie Hall, Manhattan, Hannah and Her Sisters, The Purple Rose Of Cairo, Midnight In Paris. That Woody Allen. That being said, it is probably Allen's second best film (after Annie Hall). It is a great stylistic thriller. His direction is flawless. The screenplay, also written by Allen contains some of the best crackling, suspenseful, witty dialogue written in years.<br/><br/>The film is a must see for any Allen fan, or a fan of any good thriller. It is, in my opinion, the best film of 2005, and one of the greatest thrillers to hit the big screen since the 70's. It's stylish, intense and thoroughly evolving. Match Point is a great film."

","After watching my first Woody Allen movie a few weeks ago, Midnight in Paris, I decided see more about what he had to offer. My mother highly recommended Sleeper, but I decided to start with some of Allen's more modern work, and along came Match Point.<br/><br/>This is one of those few movies that leaves you fully engaged the entire time you're watching, everything flowed so naturally until I found myself gasping and my heart pounding as the credits began rolling. The characters were well suited for their roles, and the acting was all suburb. I did not feel that anything was left out, or that any line was not absolutely relevant to the story.<br/><br/>Jonathan Meyers was highly inciting and sophisticated in his role (as Chris Wilton), and the way his character battled between love and lust was a true showmanship of his acting skills, as well as Allen's amazing ability to capture genuine human emotions. I was recollected with all the feelings and justifications I've put myself through while pursuing relationships of love and ones of lust, and especially the conflicts of both at the same time as you can see with Meyers' character.<br/><br/>Scarlett Johansson brought her best performance I've yet to seen, she brings on the sex appeal without being slutty about it... and I have to admit I have a new found lust for her thanks to this film. She plays the role of the incredibly hot, but yet not so successful woman who every man wishes to sleep with... yet is torn by the fact that she will likely not be a suitable long term spouse. It's absolutely shocking how well Johansson was able to capture that persona since she's been so highly successful for most of her life.<br/><br/>The whole twist with the moral of the movie, ""luck,"" as well as the epic battles between love and lust, how Christ Wilton handled his dilemma, all the character's masterful roles, and Woody Allen's exceptional capture of human emotion makes this movie the absolute best drama/romance movie I've seen in a very long time, if not ever."

How a tennis ball hits the net at pivotal moment in a match and how an inch will decide the victory or loss. This philosophy is going to come back later, we know in the Woody Allen's Match Point, a story of lust and luck.<br/><br/>For the first time Woody Allen leaves his beloved Manhattan and sets this one in London where Chris (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) moves from a small town as tennis instructor at a high class club. He has given up career in tennis because he admits he has the talent but not the focus. We believe him. He is sort of guy who will take the shortcut to success and avoid the hard word. He is befriended by an upper class lean bloke Tom Hewett (Matthew Goode) who acts entry point to a world of wealth and luxury. They bond over common love for opera where he meets Chloe (Emily Mortimer) Tom's sister, who can't take her eyes off Chris. He plays his cards well without coming off as desperate and is on his way up the ladder where easy money is.<br/><br/>Trouble enters in form of a sultry siren Nola (Scarlett Johansson), a struggling American actress and Tom's fiancé.

These are two outsiders in the world they are about to commit. Nola says he is going to do good unless he screws the whole thing by making a pass at her.

Thanks to the trailer it's not like am giving away anything.<br/><br/>It's debated Woody Allen made come back with this film which is partially true. This is Woody's one of the best works, his personal favorite. This is polished assured work from the man in top form making his frame as lustful and glowing as the characters in them to deliver its cynical themes. They are blissfully free from his influences and reference talks and stays close to the ground without losing any Allen incisiveness in dialog. Movie a pleasure, an entertaining drama deals with the nature of lust, its consequences (pointed self-reference would be Allen's own Crimes and Misdemeanors) and third entirely new angle luck, which gives this movie its final splendid kick. It is Allen's imagination and cruelty of fate movie finally settles on.

","Chris is a former tennis pro who gives it up to teach at an exclusive club. The club owner's daughter falls for him and a romance blooms. Unfortunately, things are not that simple: his passion is for another woman, a struggling American actress.<br/><br/>This is not your traditional Woody Allen film. The man himself does not appear, the humor is toned down to the point of being non-existent, and the verbose vocabulary Allen often employs is not to be found. We are also placed squarely in upper class London, not the usual stomping grounds of Manhattan. Indeed, there is little here to suggest an Allen film at all.<br/><br/>The closest we come to any obvious intellectual subtext is early on we see a copy of the ""Cambridge Companion to Dostoevsky"", something that comes into play later on, with Chris invoking the spirit of Raskolnikov. What is the significance of ""The Motorcycle Diaries""? Do the operas they take in tell a parallel story? If so, and I would not be surprised, this was clearly over my head.<br/><br/>There is a dichotomy of ""luck"" and ""faith"", with the protagonist preferring the former and abandoning the latter. The concept of faith does not come up often, but luck sneaks in every now and then, and could be said to play a crucial role at a few points, twisting the plot is unforeseen directions. Indeed, if you watch the first hour and do not understand the high praise this film gets, keep watching. The sharp divergence in the second half will keep you glued to your seat -- this is tension at its very best.<br/><br/>There is a second dichotomy of stability and passion. Clearly, being involved with the boss's daughter has a certain appeal. Wealth, connections and not a care in the world. But the sex is ""mechanical"" with such non-arousing comments as, ""I want you to make me pregnant."" The foreigner is something exotic (literally), unpredictable, and enticing. Is love grounded in passion or something else? Who knows? But passion is a strong force on man.<br/><br/>There could have been a social message about class. Chris is clearly from a lower class background in Ireland, and through hard work and diligence has worked his way up to the good graces of the upper class with their tennis, opera and exclusive clubs. Nola is also from the lower class, with a hard-drinking mother, but she hides it well. Yet these class distinctions never seem to come to a head -- the same story could have been told any time in any place. It is, above all, a parable of fidelity.<br/><br/>Ironically, even though not a comedy, this ranks among Woody Allen's best work. The story is strong, unique and looks sharp. We can feel sympathetic with Chris while simultaneously despising him. And Scarlett Johannsen looks sexier here than any other film I can think of, which is a feat in itself. Solid script, directing, acting and more... this truly is a masterpiece in every sense of the word."

Scarlett is very suited to the role and perfectly annoying at the same time. I'm so glad Woody has taken on London.

"eddiez61","9","0","2","24 February 2011"," Woody Allen's Stunning Film Noire Tribute to Stanley Kubrick
","Woody Allen is fond of quoting other great artists, and often includes samples, snippets and glimpses of their work in his own. For Match Point, a very sly subtle murder thriller, you would think his inspiration must be Hitchcock. Or maybe Dostoevsky. Or F. Scott Fitzgerald. Or possibly even himself. You'd be wrong. Dead wrong. The most direct influence this time is the great Stanley Kubrick whose classic Eighteenth Century period piece Barry Lyndon sets a clear model of high style and languid pacing. Kubrick's sprawling tale of an Irish commoner—whose fate is no more determined by his own ambitions than it is by sheer arbitrary luck—luxuriates in visual splendor. Woody, too, lavishes great attention on the continual procession of impeccable London locales and rambling country estates, and on the stunningly attractive characters who inhabit them. Scarlett Johansson's radiant beauty, Woody seems to suggest, is reason enough to film her. When she's on screen everything is suddenly so intensified, so much more visceral. She may have a clumsy delivery and often awkward physicality, but her voluptuous contours and magnificent face mercilessly seduces the camera. Likewise, her counterpart, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, possesses a face engineered for film. His full sensual lips echo Scarlet's, as if implying that their ill fated lives are not only metaphysically preordained, but also genetically inevitable.<br/><br/>Kubrick, himself a native New Yorker (Bronx) who transplanted himself to England in 1961 to work independent of the Hollywood nonsense, enjoyed film simply for its own aesthetics. He took excruciating care in composing, lighting and staging his scenes and the results are often breathtaking moments of cinematic art. Woody saw in Barry Lyndon an enviable standard of indulgent visuals, and like his own masterpiece homage to his cherished hometown, Manhattan, he spared no effort in capturing iconic views and vistas of posh London and the Arcadian countryside. While Kubrick's tale meanders for over three hours, Woody has limited his to just two, but even this modest length out lasts his usual film by a full thirty minutes. This extra half hour Woody invests in both developing well rounded complex lead characters, and also reveling in the often spectacular country landscapes. Some viewers will undoubtedly find fault with the intentionally thinly drawn support characters—more elegant props than actual personalities—but this contrivance only heightens the allegorical quality of this severely morbid morality tale.<br/><br/>It moves along gracefully at first, gently developing a hypnotically pulsing rhythm that gradually builds and quickens as the predicament surprisingly grows dire. After a series of exceptionally well paced set pieces confidently establishing the form that this thrill ride will take, it eventually, inexorably, explodes into a frantic, feverish fit of mayhem. <br/><br/>Upon reflection I realized that there's an awful dread that haunts most of this film—a palpable evil presence—that Kubrick would be proud of. And Hitchcock, too, for that matter. The crime is utterly ghastly, unspeakably horrible, and all the more shocking for the early languorous pace. This is a Woody Allen few, if any, fans will recognize. For this one he has fully unleashed the dark demon that he only tentatively brandished in his earlier similar tale of spiritual nihilism, 1989's Crimes and Misdemeanors. The sin in that one was second hand, distant, and therefor rather abstract and theoretical. But in this deeply sinister picture, the transgression is total and absolute; the hands of the killer are now intimately near the heart and soul of the protagonist. Allen has built an even more confining cell for his monstrously guilty prisoner, but ironically, outrageously, horribly, he also has also entrusted him with the keys. It's so disturbing, this story. It's utterly bleak.<br/><br/>The final paradox of this jet black film is that the one to which it owes it's greatest debt was in the end Kubrick's least disturbing, most gentle, most buoyant creation. In Barry Lyndon there's the occasional gentlemanly duel, the odd minor war injury, or the temporary pang of unrequited desire, but virtually no gore, menace, or mayhem. Woody's Match Point, however, is the most darkly chilling horror he has ever conjured. It's a shiver to the marrow that grows deeper and darker."
"jzappa","10","0","1","14 October 2010"," A Seamless Convergence of Philosophical Matters and Unfaltering Emotional Experience
","Match Point, an utterly absorbing and stimulatingly tight experience, seems to imply that you can just commit any horrible deed you want and get away with it, but really, we have to accept that life is arbitrary and existence is indiscriminate, often an insignificant and dismal experience with no purpose, and that love relationships are exceedingly arduous, and that in spite of everything we need to stumble on a way to not only survive but lead an honest and gratifying life. Many interpret that what the film is saying is that anything goes, but I think it essentially poses the matters: given an impossible situation in which we're all alone, how does a certain individual persevere, or even why should he choose to persevere? Sure enough, the choice is hardwired into him, and us. Spiritual people don't want to allow the truth that cancels out their myth. And if it is an arbitrary life, they're bust.<br/><br/>There are masses of us who choose to lead totally self-interested, careless lives. They feel, because nothing signifies any absolutes and one can prospectively get away with anything, they will. But one can also make the choice that we're alive, other people are alive, we're all hanging by the same interdependent threads and we've got to try to make it as honorable as we can for ourselves and everybody. This is why Match Point's story makes such perfect sense to me, because this is so much more virtuous and even much more Christian. If you accept the uncomfortable reality of human life and choose to be an honorable person despite it instead of living in denial that there's going to be some sacred prize or some penalty, it feels more sincerely dignified. If there's a prize or penalty and you act well, then you're acting well not out of such selfless intentions, the same professed ""Christian"" intentions.<br/><br/>The lack of God in the universe matters, however. It's a shame, and yet just when you can acknowledge that, ironically, can you then continue to lead what people call a Christian life, namely an honest, just life. You can only truly lead it if you recognize what you're up against at the outset and shuck off all the fabrications that lead you to make choices in life that you're making not truly for honorable reasons but for securing a nest egg in the next world.<br/><br/>Match Point is a millennial fable about class, the unpredictable reversals of destiny, the base thirst for gaining access to the social echelons, and living with skeletons in the closet. And this shifty fable of social luxury merges Allen's droll scripting with the puzzlement and difficulty of making such crucial life choices. Our main character likes the easy life he's married into but is claustrophobic. He's a character who gives us no traditional, conventional or ethical reason to care about him, but we follow him and hope that he gets what he wants. It's not that what he wants is bad, it's that it's a shame that that's what he wants. But this is his life at thispoint. This is all he, and we, have. What difference does the outside world's morality make if the outside world has no bearing on his truest feelings and doings.<br/><br/>It's a silky ethical dilemma, well thought out to its very last shot. Much of the story's friction grows from the expectation that our man will soon be exposed. This genre anticipation is generally gratified in stories concerning infidelity, deceit or higher crimes. Also, not that this is by any means one of his comic efforts, Allen also draws on the British setting to infuse a dormant sort of social satire technically reminiscent of a comedy of manners, which also brings the convention of a class impostor. Allen outwits the anticipated finale by having the decisive clincher work opposite its conventional purpose as the straw in the wind.<br/><br/>It's this understatedly amusing and roguish attitude merged with such an acutely urbane and stately atmosphere that makes Match Point not actually a homecoming to form for Woody Allen but one of growth: an elegant piece of gliding camera movements, artfully composed shots and seamless edits. He gives conceptions of his characters and tensions with palpable sharpness. But honestly, Match Point is a story intended more to demonstrate a line of reasoning than to observe a societal situation or a certain cast of characters. It is one of the very few film experiences that is at once an object of scholarship---an exemplary merged perspective of the contemporary cultural and environmental situation as a psychological and anthropological school of thought---as well as a seamlessly inflected emotional experience---insatiably carnal abandon, crossed with the pervasive social pressure for gaining right of entry to privilege and money, and living with shameful secrets you can never, ever, share or confess to anyone, that you must carry with you to your grave, when you cease to exist."

","This is one of the best movies Woody Allen has put out as of late. I wasn't that big of fan of Vicky Cristina Barcelona, but I got this film from the library, because I liked one of the supporting actors in it. But I found out Jonathan Rhys Meyers was one of the leads and I like much of his work. I got this not expecting anything about the film, didn't know it was a thriller or anything like that. I was quite surprised. It almost plays out like a romantic comedy at first, but then takes a more sinister turn. Just when you think the once cop has had his Twin Peaks Cooper moment, seeing things in what I think was a dream, it turns again. I thought there might be even more turns, but the ending was decent. It was a far cry from Woody Allen films that are mainly talking without much action. It is a very nice modern film noir and I would recommend it to people who like good acting and interesting stories with a bit of darkness thrown in their for good measure. And it also has a good deal of psychology and philosophy put in there as well."
"bobsgrock","10","0","1","26 August 2010"," Woody Allen goes deeper and darker than ever.
","Match Point must be a pivotal turn in Woody Allen's career, for it is nothing like his previous work yet still maintains that unique style he is so loved for. There are definite elements that echo Allen's previous films Crimes and Misdemeanors and Interiors, but there is also a Hitchcockian flair that raises the stakes and the tension to a degree far above what is usually expected of Woody Allen.<br/><br/>Allen has said this may be the best film he has made because everything simply ""fell in... I caught a lot of breaks."" Indeed, nearly all aspects of this film are in top form. The cast is superb, led by the stylish and passionate Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, brilliant as the reckless and amoral Chris willing to go to any length to please any and all desires. Emily Mortimer is sunny and sympathetic as Chris's wife Chloe, whose own life is filled with simple pleasures of love, marriage, children and family. Scarlett Johansson is also quite effective as the femme fatale in white Nola Rice who is instrumental in this plot. The supporting cast, photography, editing and art design also merit high praise.<br/><br/>So why is this such a departure for the usual Woody Allen? First of all, it is set in upper-crust London rather than the hustle and bustle of Manhattan. This allows for some stunning sets of big flats, estates and beautiful countrysides. There is also more of a dark undertone to this story than even what is expected of Woody Allen. Of course he is the perennial pessimist, but he delves into nihilism in some sequences and all you can do is look, shocked and amazed.<br/><br/>Because there is such a different feel to this film, I would recommend this to anyone who is not a Woody Allen fan as a warm-up. It is very entertaining, keeping you on the edge wondering what will happen next and also pondering what should happen and how it will. This is a conversation starter for sure, but it also is wonderful to look at and definitely stays with you after it ends. Agree or don't agree, one cannot deny Woody's deft ability to provoke and entertain."

","One of the most underrated films of all time, this is Allen's come back to glory, and what kind of glory are we talking about? <br/><br/>This film, as I mentioned in the title, is simply perfect. The main actors give the performance of their careers and the supporting ones give their all to make the whole project work.<br/><br/>I'm young, and I got my young friends. They told me Scarlett is the sexiest woman in the world after watching this movie, so fascinated at her lips that they forgot the story of the movie, but I only went close to being distracted once (in the ping-pong scene), other than that I was stunned by her interpretation of the role. When I saw her first some years ago, I expected her to become another flesh-actress like Jessica Alba, but now I'm convinced she's the new Angelina Jolie, a great talent whose acting abilities outshine her looks.<br/><br/>And Rhys Meyers, WOW! Did you expect it? I didn't after seeing his last not-bad works. I saw myself in him, exactly the way I might cry or act in times of anxiety or being distant, so I assume he was so natural and believable as a confident boy whose intellect beats his desire and emotions, who finally makes a devastating decision.<br/><br/>Oh, and Allen's screenplay, what can I say? It's the first time that it occurs to me, after watching almost 2000 movies, that I see the lover kill the wild sex doll instead of the innocent woman, and that's an achievement. The twists are extraordinary in this title, a fact that makes it all the more exciting and surprising.<br/><br/>One also mustn't forget to praise the top class cinematography and greater than that, the editing. The sequences are so coherent and fluid I can't remember when I last saw something equal, let alone better.<br/><br/>About the Philosophy of the film, I guess this should be one of those of which each person will pay attention to one of the aspects. Until the very moment he squeezed the trigger I couldn't believe my eyes, and that was the moment that I found out this isn't an ordinary thriller of poor & rich, but a genius mix of many meanings. <br/><br/>Allen is a marvel, does anyone acclaim him the way he deserves? He's written and directed in all and acted in a majority of his 40 movies, isn't this an unbelievable accomplishment? Are the world and its residents aware of a little four-eye guy who's not a fast-talking clichéd clown, but a rare living treasure who offers one fine movie every year and a masterpiece once in a while?

","Chris seems a conscious social-climber of poor Irish origin who has normalised his accent past that of his tennis audience towards that of London executives. He offers moral support to a beautiful aspiring actress lacking confidence for her auditions and seduces her by forthright approach, only immaturely to spurn her pregnancy and clumsily prevent its disclosure to his upper-class in-laws. Stolen jewellery, seemingly incriminating him, distances him further from the shooting when blind luck contrives to place it into the pocket of a drug-addicted robber apprehended by police; tallying with the film's basic premise: that it is better to be lucky than good."

","Woody Allen's 'Match Point (2005)' is both a tribute and a counterpoint to the classic Hollywood film noir thriller. During the reign of the Production Code from the 1930s to early 1960s, it was a narrative obligation for cinematic criminals to suffer due punishment for their crimes. A typical thriller ideally works towards an unpredictable outcome, but with censorship came a foregone conclusion – thus, directors began emphasising the mechanics of Fate. No matter how perfectly-planned a murder or heist may seem, there is always a single lapse of judgement or fortune that brings down the bad guys (see 'Rififi (1955),' which Allen himself references in a cinema scene). 'Match Point' deconstructs Fate as a driving factor of film noir – there is no overarching providence, only the chance that a tennis ball may fall on either side of the net. Our familiarity with the traditional noir formula thus becomes a red herring; just when you think you know where the story is going, Allen takes another direction.<br/><br/>Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), a former tennis player living in London, seemingly has it all. A sequence of fortuitous events leads him to date and later marry Chloe Hewett (Emily Mortimer), a pretty if homely woman from an exceedingly wealthy family (headed by Brian Cox and Penelope Wilton). Whereas any other man might be satisfied with such an arrangement – a high-paying job, an expensive home, a lifetime of financial security – Chris Wilton finds his eye wandering uneasily towards Nola Rice (Scarlett Johansson), a failed American actress who once dated his brother-in-law. This scenario recalls Jack Clayton's 'A Room at the Top (1959),' in which Laurence Harvey was forced to choose between the woman he loves, and the woman who can offer him the most. Woody Allen further muddies this dilemma by portraying Nola as little more than a sexual object – basically, Chris is torn between the two sins of greed and lust. That each character, except perhaps for the pathetically-devoted Chloe, is snobbish or unlikable forces the audience to take a more detached, objective viewpoint.<br/><br/>'Match Point' is my first non-comedic Woody Allen film, and I was pleased to note that the director's singular flair for sparkling wit and high-brow cultural references (Dostoyevsky's ""Crime and Punishment"" aptly makes an appearance) translates just as well to drama as it does comedy. Also impressive was the manner in which the film progresses, with disarming rapidity, from drama into a full-blown noir thriller. When Chris finally makes the decision to do the unthinkable, his actions seem, even then, coolly rational, as though it is the only action now available to him. The ending, too, is a complete surprise. The film methodically sets up the failure of its protagonist – the witness with whom he collides outside the building could easily have been Chris' downfall – but Allen relents with a wholly improbable turn of events that leaves a murderer in the clear. Against all odds (and, indeed, against all narrative convention), a heinous crime goes unpunished, and the audience is left feeling as hollow as Chris Wilton as he stares vacantly out the window, towards nothing."
"bryanus","10","0","2","18 November 2009"," Great, and yet hard to watch
","This is not your typical Woody Allen movie. This movie tears up your insides and spits them out. There is a certain ambivalence felt towards the characters, you don't know if to hate them, or feel for them. This is a very intense movie, I don't recommend it to the sensitive viewer. I myself am not easily stirred emotionally, but yet found this movie hard to watch. If you thought that Woody Allen was a comedy master and that's it; think again. This movie at the same time that it reaches a peak of intensity, also hits a fair degree of symbolism; especially towards the end. It's kind of hard to talk about this movie without revealing the end, but I definitely recommend this movie; for the emotionally stable. Ha,ha. Jonathan Rhys-Meyers is one of the best things about this movie as well."
"jandesimpson","Null","0","1","8 October 2009"," Woody's masterpiece?
","The problem about the really prolific artist is that compulsive creativity can so often generate work that is inferior to that artist's highest standards. When it comes to outstanding directors with a large oeuvre there is generally agreement about their finest and least good films. I would imagine that few would make out a case for Bergman's ""Now About These Women"" when compared with ""Cries and Whispers"", or Hitchcock's ""Jamaica Inn"" vis a vis ""Vertigo"". But what to make of Woody Allen's substantial output? Here opinions tend to be more sharply divided. Most of his admirers plump for ""Annie Hall"", ""Manhattan"" and ""Hannah and her Sisters"" as among the finest. But wait...here is one viewer who derives much less pleasure from these than some of the others such as ""Radio Days"", ""Everyone Says I Love You"" and ""Manhattan Murder Mystery"". When I intimated to my eldest son - a great Woody fan - that I thought ""Small Time Crooks"" the maestro's funniest film in years, I was sharply berated for my admiration of ""such a pile of cack"". So, even among fans and the most closely knit families there can be the sharpest of divisions about the relative merits of these sometimes splendid but often dire entertainments. Of only one thing can one be generally certain. Woody's fans, in my experience, tend to be men. In the circle where I move, the women seem to share a universal detestation bordering on the pathological. Which is by way of leading up to the admission that I have recently discovered a film that I feel could be his masterpiece. I whisper this as there could be many out there ready to shout me down. I find ""Match Point"", the first of his London films, extraordinary in a variety of ways. First it is unlike any of the others, not an iota of humour, apart from a slight smile at the two cops toward the end and not a Woody sound/look/feel-alike in sight. It is the darkest of psychological thrillers dealing with adultery, ambition and murder. ""Thriller"" is certainly an apt term as it generates a quite breathtaking tension as to what will happen next, and this for characters who, like those in Ang Lee's ""The Ice Storm"", are not particularly nice and worthy of our concern. As far as tension goes there are echos here of Truffaut's great adultery piece ""Le Peau Douce"" combined with elements of ""An American Tragedy"" and Joseph Losey's perceptive examinations of British class malaise, a rich concoction that Woody succeeds in mixing in a way that gives so many clichés an entirely new flavour. The only Woody touch as far as I can see is his richly affectionate snapshot depiction of a great city, substituting his beloved New York for London. But perhaps the film's most satisfying feature is the brilliant use made of the tennis analogy when a ball substitute fails to make its intended destination - a moment of pure genius. It was my intention not to issue a ""spoiler"" for a film where the element of surprise is crucial. I hope I have gone one degree further by not mentioning anything about the plot in such a way that will stimulate curiosity,"
"gilgamesh-1985","9","0","1","6 October 2009"," Crime without punishment: MATCH POINT
","Chris Wilton, a young Irish tennis player who retired from racing, he decided to move to London to teach in the privileged club. Falls in love with Chloe, a wealthy girl sister of Tom Hewitt, one of his pupils. The two married and he will attempt success. Woody Allen changed genre, or at least the kind that has distinguished career especially in recent years. But most change city and the translation seems not to bother with this great filmmaker who exceeded the threshold of seventy years, shows have a talent and a clarity that are the envy of everyone. The young social climber (a resounding Jonathan Rhys Meyers) is some experience with the natural environments of high finance in London as the same train for the first time out of his ""lair"" in a strange city, and so far from his beloved New York and describes the English capital with equal thoroughness. ""Match Point"" is a psychological drama about fate, greed and luck that subtly govern our lives: the initial image of the tennis ball hitting the tape of the network and remains suspended for a moment not knowing which way will, serves as a paradigm to the entire film. Everything is going wrong until the meeting with Nola, Tom's girlfriend, actress penny but highly ambitious, creates chaos in his life. And it is during the first time the irrepressible sensuality of Scarlett Johansson, the temptation made woman, is the host: seduces Chris with every glance at the first appearance in the hall of unsettling in a game of ping pong ups well calibrated by Allen. Irresistible, magical, fatal. Body and spark the passion flares, clouds the mind, in the pouring rain in that house. But the reality lies. And the news of a future unwanted pregnancy as the protagonist is forced into a corner. Yeah, because that son that his wife worked so hard to conceive for a mocking sign of destiny is born from the wrong woman: the object of desire has now become an obstacle to his rise to power. And in a ''sleepless night'', tormented by a thousand thoughts, get used to a certain standard of living and scared of a possible ""return to origin"", will take the drastic decision. Even the most cynical of another director's previous masterpiece ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"", there was at least present a subtle religious background who tried in vain to untie even the character which had fallen from perdition and bring them away to starboard, ""Match Point"" is a film purely atheistic. No one is exempt from sin in a universe composed of pieces, where human beings are manipulated and manipulators. A constant struggle for survival with no holds barred which has as its primary objective to preserve intact their social status: unlike a game of tennis here, there are no rules. Woody Allen is aware of this, the film embellishes the opera songs that infuse more of a climate of tragedy in history. What is more dispersed in the course of the special literal vision, travel, food and loud calls style Hithcock which are fully visible than in the character of Scarlett, (which has the same morbid fascination of Kim Novak of ""Vertigo"") in the evolution of the story increasingly taking implications from Thriller. His staging is simple and essential: fields, reverse shot, soft wheels and meaningful close-ups. Cold air is detached in London is perfectly rendered by an impeccable photography. Final pessimistic as unforgiving: you can live with a perpetual sense of guilt, but in the complete immorality of a world adrift punishment would be useless."
"thomascrown00","8","0","1","13 July 2009"," One of Woody's Finest Films
","Sophisticated, urbane, beautifully crafted, shot and scored, this is one of Woody Allen's finest films, although I confess that I by far prefer him behind the camera and not in front of it. There are a few letdowns in the acting (Scarlett Johansson, while beautiful, is not up to the superb acting of the other key players), and a few scenes between lesser characters -- the police, for example -- where the acting falls woefully short, and a digression into the nature of guilt that is gratuitous and distracting, but these are minor quibbles in a thoughtful and compelling film. There are some interesting parallels with Allen's very fine ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" as well -- the theme of murdering one's troublesome mistress and getting away with it and the role of luck...in ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"", in fact, the rabbi tells Martin Landau that ""A little good luck is the best plan"" or words to that effect. The same might well be said here."
"shoujuan","9","0","1","28 January 2009"," An interesting subtle film
","People keep saying this film is overrated. However, I think it is underrated. I'm surprised to see its score under 8 now. This film is very interesting yet subtle. Lots of reviews focus on its plot, characters, or morality stuff. I admit the film is good at those views. But what interest me most are the numerous hints through its subliminal channel.<br/><br/>Chris seems to be an intelligent and ambitious guy who always got his luck and passed through difficulties. The match points are always pro to him. While Nola, on the country, is not so much lucky. However, in fact, every thing is under surveillance by Hewett family. If it is not Hewett family, Chris would be definitely caught by the murder case. In the last scene, Chris worked overnight and fallen asleep. Then Nola's ghost (in his dream?) showed up and told him: ""you left so many evidences as if you intended to be caught."" As a matter of fact, Chris is not a professional criminal, and he is not prudent enough. He did lots of mistakes and did leave lots of evidences. He passed through this case not by his luck (He is lucky, but not that supernaturally lucky), but with the help of Hewett family, who settled everything from behind. When the two detectives showed the diary of Nola to Chris, he was shocked and became very nervous. The thin detective (Banner?) looked at him jeeringly and held his laughing. Banner must be laughing that Chris is so naive and left so many evidences. In fact, Banner has been already bought by Hewett family. He talked to the other detective (Parry?), who has been suspecting Chris from the beginning, and finally persuaded him to stop further investigating. Of course, the most powerful excuse is the ring found from a dead criminal, who took all accuses. But again, it is not a supernatural coincident. Hewett family set it up. However, I must admit it is Chris' lucky (match point) that the ring bounced back when he tried to throw it to the river. And I think Chris's most critical match point is that his wife Chloe is pregnant, which he did not plan at all. Otherwise, it is very likely that Hewett family will give him up, as they gave up Nola before.<br/><br/>This film is full of such hints through its subliminal channel. For example, when Chris went to basement to steal the guns, Chloe was looking for him and intended to go down to find him. But her parents stopped her and asked her to go upstairs. They must have found out Chris' plan and they do not want to stop him. However, Chloe did try to stop him when she insisted to check Chris' bag which held the guns. But she failed and let it go. Some other examples, when Chris had an affair with Nola for the first time, they could be seen through the window of the castle; when Chris and Nola met at Nola's apartment, they could be seen through the window in the building cross the street. But obviously, Hewett family would forgive Chris for that. As Banner told Parry (which might be told by Hewett before): ""It is understandable that Chris can't resist a woman like Nola."" <br/><br/>It's not always the luck that helps Chris. He prepared a lot. For example, Chris read some classic and profound novels to enrich himself, which later made Mr. Hewett sing high praise for him to his family: ""I like him. He is not shallow."" On the other hand, Nola is not that lucky. She did not do her work well either. She joined the family half year earlier than Chris, while Mr. Hewett could not even remember her. In order to win the match point, you do need some luck. But you need practice a lot and have good techniques first. Everything may have a reason behind it. Probably that is what the film tries to tell its audience. IMHO, this is an interesting yet subtle film. And it tells a good story with some believable characters, which interest lots of people including me."

","A young Irish tennis instructor marries a woman he's not very much in love with to gain prominence through her family, but begins to have a fling with an American girl (Scarlett Johansson) and then a real dilemma he has to contend with. This glorified Woody Allen film really lived up to its hype. All I figured going in was that it was going to be a love story with a boring tennis backdrop, but I got a lot more than I bargained for, especially with the wild direction things took later in the story ... I never expected it.<br/><br/>I loved the camera work here, a lot of really beautiful cinematic touches. It helped a lot that the story takes place in England, which is a much-welcome break from Allen's typical Manhattan scenarios and affords an opportunity for some very nice scenic touches. The sex scenes are hot and steamy, and it's a credit to Allen that he manages to make them so exciting even without resorting to showing blatant nudity.<br/><br/>Scarlett Johansson is physically beautiful, but she leaves something to be desired for me in the acting department, at least during the first half (she got better later). The real star of the piece is Jonathan Rhys Meyers as the tennis pro whose life is in turmoil. He's just superb and runs the gamut with a varying degree of emotions in a multi-layered character. And I'm glad there wasn't too much tennis in this! I had feared the worst on that score from the start. This is a great achievement for Woody Allen, one of the best films he's ever done, and a triumph he needed in recent years. It's so different from most of his other movies. *** out of ****"

She was so clingy, and I couldn't stand her voice Lol :-P She was such a daddy's girl, a spoiled lil rich snob who worshiped the ground Chris walked on- hated her the entire movie.<br/><br/>As for Scarlett- this and Girl with a Pearl Earring is the best work she's done to date. She was good in Other Boleyn Girl, but the other two films, she was so raw and you felt everything she felt.<br/><br/>Jonathan- I hated his character, but his acting was spot-on too. Chris had all the feelings and thoughts (other than planning and committing murder) that a man who's having an affair does. The chemistry between he and Nola- omg! The sex scenes were soooooo electrifying, so raw, so deliciously portrayed.<br/><br/>If he'd gotten caught at the end, I'd given it a perfect ten.

","The trailer offered another affair movie. Hasn't this really been done before? But the film talks more about affairs. It goes on about the elements of luck, money and sacrifice for love or comfort. Jonathan Rhys Myers does a good performance as a poor tennis coach who happens to meet Chloe, a sweet but somewhat unadventorous girl who falls in love with him and helps him achieve financial success. Yet Chris (Myers) is attracted to his brother in law's fiancé, Nola Rice (Scarlet Johannsen) who is luscious, sexy and mesmorising. What becomes a casual affair soon turns into a decision that will change Chris's life and situatino forever.<br/><br/>What is appealing and intriguing about this film is its themes that while cliché, are done quite convincingly from all performers. Johannsen is extremely terrific as an American girl trying to find her way in life, and you can see why Chris is memmorised be her and not with his wife Chloe who is an extreme bore to him. The pace of the film almost feels like it is set out in acts like a play, but gets right to the point of what the director Woody Allen wants to convey. The ending is a bit far fetched and feels a bit clumsily done but nevertheless makes an extremely good watch."

After Anything Else, Melenda and Melenda and now this there's no doubt Woody Allen is back making wonderful films and this is clearly his best one in decades. This certainly has Allen doing his Ingmar Bergman impersonation and he hits all the right marks with his direction, especially the love scenes, which are highly erotic without having to resort to nudity. The two stars do very good jobs especially Johansson who should have gotten an Oscar nomination. The first 2/3rds of the film aren't really anything special or different than films we've seen before but that final act is downright shocking and goes in directions you'll never expect.

The direction was so good. Very atmospheric. A top class drama. A very British film, even though written by Woody Allen. This film revolved round a wealthy middle class English family and a typical potential mother in law, Prejudice was an undercurrent and the main character was a selfish young man who wanted his cake and to eat it too. The sex scenes were cut short and mainly left to the imagination. Therefore, it was just as revealing as if they had been graphic. Great London locations added to the atmosphere of the piece.

","Personally I was never really into Woody Allen's work. But then there was Match Point, with a story that was very appealing to me, starring people I somehow felt comfortable with. Jonathan Rhys Meyers plays an impressive lead as Chris Wilton, an ex tennis pro who becomes a teacher in an expensive tennis club in London. <br/><br/>Here he becomes friends with Tom Hewett (a very decent Matthew Goode). As they get closer, Chris meets Tom's sister Chloë (an ever so sweet Emily Mortimer), and Tom's fiancé Nola (a very attractive Scarlett Johansson). Nola becomes an extremely dangerous aphrodisiac to Chris. From the moment they meet, Chris will never feel the same again. When the relationship between Tom and Nola ends, Nola disappears out of Chris' life for a while. During this time he builds on a future with Chloë, but Nola is never really out of his thoughts. She becomes an obsessive addiction, that affects his entire life. The development he makes during the film is really scary. From a steady and down-to-earth guy he becomes an obsessive and deceptive person, unable to choose between a good wealthy but boring life with Chloë, and an unstable but passionate relationship with Nola.<br/><br/>Allen takes time to play out all the events taking place in this film. Every emotion without dialogue comes across perfectly, making you really feel Chris' impossible situation. Another important thing you genuinely feel is the erotic tension between Chris and Nola in their scenes together. There is no original score, making you focus on the characters even more.<br/><br/>There is not a single bad performance in this film. Every character feels real, natural and deep, as if everything is actually taking place as you're watching it. For instance Brian Cox plays a very gentle character, as you've never seen him before. Everyone on screen makes it very easy for you to get into this very human story about passion and obsession, and you are kept in, for the full two hours. Adding in the realism is the London setting, that is simply there, without any unusual production design. A splendid achievement.<br/><br/>If you like down-toned and real character drama with great performances, Match Point is your ticket."

","Unfortunately, I hadn't seen the movie up to now, after it's about a month I've seen 'Scoop', but it doesn't matter. It's a masterpiece that one should not suppose that everybody knows and understands what Allen wants to visualize.<br/><br/>In the recent years, Allen has gained the courage to put on the little tiny facts that ordinary people would not feel and understand in their lives. Sometimes comedy and drama are such mixed up that you cannot differ like 'Melinda and Melinda' and sometimes the comedy part is so strong that one may think is't just a cheap TV series like 'Small time crooks' and sometimes the drama part is heavily taking your breath that you forget that you have to expect some comedy in this movie like 'Matchpoint'.<br/><br/>Maybe matchpoint is too drama and maybe one of the reasons is that Allen is not playing in it with his unique dialogs and accent; but it's lovely. And, believe it or not; it's lovely that an American in Hollywood dares to use such ordinary facts in life (which are quiet important to European and Eastern artists) as the main line of his stories and develops and expands the case in such a comedy noir/drama style that none of the a.m. artist cannot even think about that, maybe some exceptions like Emir Kustarica or Roberto Benini are 'SOMEHOW' alike Mr. Allen. This is why Allen is 'UNIQUE'...<br/><br/>How many times have you think about 'LUCK' in your life? There are quiet several periods in my life that I tried to prove that we are making and ruining the luck for ourselves and quiet several periods of time that I really have believed that it's out of our control. But what Mr. Allen thinks about that? The point is it's not important for him, although it is said in the beginning narration that some people are afraid of the fact that it's uncontrollable but the movie is about something more important that I believe the main comedy part is hidden behind this fact:<br/><br/>Is Chris lucky? What is luck by your opinion? Was the reflex of the ring good luck or bad luck to Chris?<br/><br/>Specially think about the last question. I think that when the ghost of Nola told Chris 'You have to pay for what you did' the next sequence is the officer waking up and finding the true answer, but ...<br/><br/>... we are wrong! This is not about what Nola's ghost said. What Nola forecasted (maybe) was finding the bounced ring in the pocket of the killed addict which resulted in finding Chris not guilty. I mean, the point is successful escaping for law is BAD LUCK for Chris as he has a miserable life in a golden cage ( like an Iranian idiom: The inside of my life in burning me and the outside of my life is burning the others! ) Maybe finally when he is about to dye or even much sooner he would wish that he had not escaped for what he had done.<br/><br/>This is the real comedy side of this movie that leaves you in confusion that what is good luck and what is bad luck. Please do not suppose that Allen can answer you because this is the question that no one can answer ... no one. It depends and just the one who is experiencing the case has the right to talk about that. <br/><br/>This is what makes me love Mr. Allens masterpieces. The works that every person can understand some layers of it and it is obvious that why during the recent years there are many people who hate his works. They just want the basic layers that right now Allen is not worried for them and as he gets older and more experienced he is concentrating on the deeper layers. I think that Allen has his own - very unique - style that can just be achieved by someone who is talented and thoughtful as Woody Allen AND has directed, written, acted and ... in more that 50 movies."

","...but very typical strong direction by same of engaging cast kept this night-owl's attention quite handily. I'm not quite the avid fan that many Allen aficionados are, but certainly recognize ""Match Point"" as one of his finer works. Faultlessly framed in the lens of DP, Remi ""Elizabeth"" Adefarasin, Allen's tale unfolds in the best Syd Field tradition, wrapping up with a neat little thematic ending. Although Jonathan Rhys Meyers is a bit too mannequin-pretty for my taste, and I always felt he was up to no good right from the get-go, the rest of the cast is outstanding. From the radiant Scarlett ""Eight Legged Freaks"" Johansson to the wonderful Emily ""The Pink Panther"" Mortimer, Brian ""Braveheart, no, Rob Roy"" Cox, suave Rupert ""Spooks"" Penry-Jones, geeky character actor Ewen ""Black Hawk Down"" Bremner, and the winning Penelope ""Shaun of the Dead"" Wilton, the entire ensemble is perfect. I'm almost surprised that the core IMDb cohort of 18-29-year-olds liked this one so much; it gives me faith in their taste in film."
"buster780","9","0","2","18 January 2007"," Great Movie (SPOILERS IF YOU Haven't SEEN IT!!!)
","Yes, this is definitely one of Woody's best films in a while. Yes, its about luck, but its as if he took Raskolnikov from Crime And Punishment and worked him backwards: the events of the movie, his justification for murdering lead UP to the murder, not the murder first. So in essence, he works up to justifying killing Nola and the old lady, and quickly resolving that personal crisis. Thus does not see the need to suffer to feel ""alive"" There's no doubt that this film is about luck, but i think most people have completely ignored the tie in with Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment (maybe perhaps because they haven't read it). Its mentioned in the movie that Chris and Chloe's father often discuss Dostoevsky and its an important element, the central element in my mind, of the movie. Chris's quote in the beginning: ...""It's scary to think so much is out of one's control."" Already there is a sense that he sees and acknowledges the need to have control, and how scary it is to be without it.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the story, he is lost, confused, and just walking the earth. He belittles himself and doesn't think that much of himself; very humble, especially when tom offers him a job. Much like Raskolnikov at the END of crime and punishement, after he has suffered the moral and emotional ramifications of his murder of an ""ordinary"" woman; He thought himself as superior, ""superhuman"", in the beginning of the book, which is why he was able to justify the killing of old woman pawnbroker. Going back to the movie, Chris feels exactly this way towards the end of the film, especially when he does make the decision to kill Nola and the Old Woman, he does it methodically and with precision.<br/><br/>Which is why, when he talks to Nola, he tells her how he didn't even flinch when he pulled the trigger. He feels he is completely justified in his actions, and if it meant stepping over some old lady to do it, so be it. Unlike Raskolnikov in crime and punishment, who at first feels justified in his actions (because he is so much smarter than the pawnbroker, more human than her, and a much better person overall), and then slowly becomes debilitated by his conscious into finding salvation through suffering and through his relationship with a prostitute whom he falls in love with.<br/><br/>Chris has already suffered, he has already fallen from grace (failed tennis career) so when his luck seems to change (his relationship and connections through Chloe) he feels that Nola is his way out of his humdrum life and marriage, but after reevaluating his life, he felt entitled to his new riches and new life, and slowly Nola slips as his lusty love to a mere nuisance. A problem that needed to be solved.<br/><br/>One of my favorite moments in the movie, looking back after watching it, was when Chris threw the ring, and it hit the rail and bounced back onto ground instead of the river. Im sure, like most in the audience, we all thought it meant his luck was over with, but it turns out that bit of luck enabled him to get away with his murders. Its the total opposite of the opening credits, when the tennis ball does the exact same thing the ring does, only this time, hitting the net and it falling on the ground meant loosing.<br/><br/>While he won the life he felt entitled too, he also lost the only woman whom he felt passionate about, and probably truly loved. So is he to forever live in a state of purgatory; living with a woman whom he doesn't love? Or is the life he's living outshine that? Yes, Chris was lucky in meeting Chloe, in his rise among the rick and powerful of London, in his love and relationship with Nola, and in getting away with murder So the question remains: did Chris really win, or did he really loose? ""Luck favors the prepared mind"""

","Matchpoint is a powerful repudiation of the perception that artists do their greatest work when they are young. It is far away Woody Allen's finest drama and indeed one of the cleverest, most disciplined and seamless examples of the film noir genre that I've encountered. Allen explores the all too common dilemma of a man drawn to two different kinds of women, the good woman who offers him success and stability, and the bad woman to who offers him excitement and desire. His resolution of this dilemma seems inevitable without ever being predictable. Further, the film has important, indeed, almost profound things to say about the nature of reality itself as the story vividly illustrates. Matchpoint is not merely a good movie, but, in my opinion, a great one which is second only to Body Heat and Fargo as a compelling exploration of the themes of love, lust ambition and evil."

","This is an overall great piece of film-making. Woody Allen's most complete movie since 'Manhattan'. A movie, and how surprisingly so, set in London instead of Woody's beloved New York metropolis.<br/><br/>The U.K. capital is, however, a perfect setting for this film-essay on luck, social discrimination and, most importantly, fate. The plot of the film is outstanding, leaving the average viewer completely unaware of the ending. The music is carefully chosen by Allen to accompany the flow of the film, and ranges from classical to heavy opera.<br/><br/>Jonathan Rhys Meyers, as Chris Wilton, plays a retired top-notch tennis player who starts working as a tennis coach at a high-class tennis club. It is there that he becomes friends with Tom Hewett (Matthew Goode), an aristocratic family heir. He starts attending social events with Tom's family & comes close with his sister, with whom he ends up having an affair. Chloe (Emily Mortimer) is Chris' passport to financial independence, success and social recognition, a factor that is outlined throughout the film. Chris, however, unable to resist Tom girlfriend's charms starts a casual affair with her as well. The affair with Nola Rice (Scarlett Johansson), an American wannabe actress, becomes regular after her break-up with Tom. Chris marries Chloe and at the same time becomes CEO in one of his father in law's firms. Chris starts getting accustomed to the high-life his wife's social class offers him but continues the affair with the young American. <br/><br/>Chris' wife, Chloe tries desperately getting pregnant and Chris, avoiding to raise speculations for his illegal affair, is agreeing to her every wish. The couple's efforts, however, bares no fruit and this is the point in the film where fate makes its presence more than obvious. Chris, by no intention of his own whatsoever, get Nola pregnant and the cards are dealt again....<br/><br/>A wonderful that definitely leave you with a smile on your face at the end. Not only a promising way to spend an evening, but also a film that gives you plenty of food for thought. Highly recommended."
"fish_stix03","9","0","2","1 October 2006"," Allen shows us his darker, subtler side
","Match Point is a film that isn't about the blurriness of right and wrong, but is about the struggle between various degrees of evil to come out on top. As the film reminds us countless times, it's a struggle that doesn't rely on skill or guile, but luck. This film is a pleasant return to form for Woody Allen, after his last fifteen years of churning out insipid comedies that aren't indicative of his enormous talent.<br/><br/>The first thing I should say about this film is that it is unrecognisable as a Woody Allen film. It's not a comedy (although there are one or two Woody-style laughs), he's not in it romancing Scarlet Johansson (thankfully), and it's set in London instead of Manhattan. For those of you out there who generally don't like Woody Allen (and as much as I love and respect the little guy, I know his style doesn't click with everyone), I think you'll be pleasantly surprised with this film. It's not full of the whimsical humour and confidence (many would say, borderline arrogance) of his comedies, but instead is imbued with a sense of darkness and tragedy that we haven't seen from him in a very long time.<br/><br/>Jonathan Rhys-Meyers puts in the best performance I've seen from him as Chris Wilton, a former tennis pro who meets Tom (Matthew Goode) and kind of falls for his sister Chloe (Emily Mortimer). I say ""kind of falls for her"" because as the film unfurls, it becomes clear that he's after a higher status, is willing to do anything for it, and almost everything that he does is questionable. Chloe's father (Brian Cox) is extremely wealthy and offers Chris a job as an executive at one of his companies. Chris meets Tom's fiancée, Nola (Scarlet Johansson), an American wannabe actress who is also seeking a marriage into wealth and status. Tom's parents don't approve of her as much as they do of Chris, which is made clear during a conversation she has with Tom's mother (Penelope Wilton) regarding her acting 'career'. <br/><br/>Unfortunately for Chris and Nola, they are more attracted to each other than the lifestyles they are trying to acquire. Now, Chris is torn between greed and lust, and the way he handles this situation is where the true genius of the film lies. Unfortunately, I can't reveal too much more of the story without spoiling any surprises, but trust me in that aside from being one of Allen's best character pieces, it is also an incredibly effective psychological thriller. I think much of the film's success has to do with Chris's feeling of fear. He's afraid that he'll lose the lifestyle he wants so badly, but is also afraid that Nola will cause his downfall if he doesn't keep her happy. He wants to satisfy both his greed and his lust, and is too selfish to let one of the two go. Oh, what to do, what to do? You'll find out.<br/><br/>Scarlet Johansson is ridiculously sexy in this film. I suppose she has to be in order to make it believable that she would seduce Chris to such an extent that he would consider losing everything to have her. Rhys-Meyers and Johansson have incredible chemistry that makes the film impossible not to become engrossed in. The sex scenes (and they certainly are sex scenes rather than love scenes) are incredibly raunchy, despite the fact that there is no nudity and the most we see of either of them is Rhys-Meyers' chest and Johansson's bra.<br/><br/>A lot of this film's second half is a modern re-telling of a certain novel by a certain Russian novelist (I won't tell you which book or which author in order to preserve the twists, but there is a hint of what it is early in the film). Match Point is Allen's finest film since Bullets over Broadway and I'd like to think that the reason his twelve films in between are so comparatively poor is because he was building up the courage to make this masterpiece, which is an opera in movie form. Upon further thought, I think I'm wrong. I think Match Point has been a film Allen's been torturing over and writing in his head since the beginning of his career, and I'd go so far as to say it's one of his top two or three best films."

","""Match Point"" (2005) is the latest film by famed director/actor Woody Allen. This wonderful film find its strengths in the acting - mainly between Jonathan Rhys Meyers as the British Chris Wilton who must decide between marrying into richness or going out with the American wannabe-actress Nola Rice (played expertly by Scarlett Johansson). The story also has a very smart twist at the end of the film - won't give it away but it does involve a ring. This film also marks a different take for Woody Allen - this film not only takes place in Britain instead of New York, but also is very serious in its subject matter. Definitely a must-see film - at 8 out of 10."

","I had very high expectations for this movie. Almost everyone had given it good reviews. And I was not disappointed.<br/><br/>This movie is so good that I have thought about it for some time, trying to find holes in the plot: 1. On the actor-side, I don't think that Jonathan Meyers did a good enough job. The transition from being in love with Nola to wanting to get rid of her is to superficial. It's like one day to the next he is suddenly tired of her.<br/><br/>2. I don't know if it's the character of Jonathan Meyers or the manuscript. But the above transition seems to come out of nowhere from where he is in love to where he wants to get rid of Nola.<br/><br/>3. Indeed the main character can be compared to Raskolnikov, the main character in Dostojevskij's Crime & Punishment - which is also referred to in the beginning of the movie. Clearly Woody Allen must have been influenced by this (great) book. When Chris' dad-in-law said that he had had an interesting talk with Chris about Dostojevski, I would like to have seen or heard more about the issue. Because Chris also develops into a character that thinks he can get away with crime - and as opposed to Raskolnikov, he gets away with it. But at what price?<br/><br/>Otherwise, still a fantastic movie with great performances, especially by the two young actresses, Johannson and Mortimer."

As if your reasoning was serving and your common sense wanted to return it, neither wanting to loose.<br/><br/>Then, the ball hits the net and hovers in the air.

"jib122-1","9","0","2","7 September 2006"," great movie - what IS chance?
","Allen is at his best here, and while at the narrative level it is similar to the Martin Landau sub- plot from Crimes and Misdemeanors, it is primarily concerned with the relation between chance and fate - which is always at stake in tragedy, both in Opera, but especially in Greek tragedy (Sophocles is, of course, directly mentioned in the film, and there is also ""Mighty Aphrodite""), So, I am a little surprised so many people reviewed the film without mentioning chance, and how it is played with in the film. It is not chance that the lovers meet again, it is his character leading him to search her out. Then, at the end (spoiler coming!) with the ring playing th opposite role we expected, the ball goes back into the other court, so to speak, and it appears that chance played a much larger role than the film led us to believe was Allen's own belief for the majority of the film. Brilliant, masterful, amazing, playful and wonderful twist - far better than any simple ""plot twist"" could ever be. <br/><br/>Also, there are lots of class issues at play (with the interplay between character/fate and chance at the heart - why do poor people stay poor? Is it chance? etc) - with the film they go to see early on being explicit in raising this issue - The Motorcyce Diaries - I wonder what Allen is saying, or, trying to get us to consider on this interrelation between class and fate and chance?"
"ginger_the_Wolf","8","0","2","3 September 2006"," Well made, but disappointing...
","While I did enjoy this film, I can't help feeling a bit disappointed. Perhaps if it had not been Woody Allen, and critically acclaimed as one of the best films of last year I would have taken much more from it. Without being able to provide any concrete examples, the story felt at times to be a little too familiar for comfort. I felt as though I'd seen this before, and there were very few actual surprises.<br/><br/>A less skilled director would have completely made a disaster of this film because of what I mentioned before. It feels like you've seen it before, and the twists feel almost as a way of counteracting faults in the original storyline. However, Allen with some clever almost Hitchcockian editing creates suspense where there is that doubt. The first half of the film, the build up, I found to be quite tedious, and difficult to get through, but when we reach a decisive moment, Allen drops in those visual hints that let the viewer know only so much, leaving something floating in the air, and this is where your heart starts to beat. The climactic scene is done to perfection, with clever editing that puts you right at the edge of your seat. The tie-in with tennis, and luck was fairly well done,although it left little to the imagination.<br/><br/>The cast is quite excellent, I don't think anyone hits a false note. You actually barely think of the acting as you are in the process of watching the film, it's something of an afterthought. Furthermore, the use of the opera music throughout is absolutely excellent. It creates a very specific, eerie atmosphere (maybe because I don't listen to Opera music...). Worth checking out, I think this is a film I'll enjoy more on a second viewing."

"DonFishies","8","0","2","17 August 2006"," Renewed my desire to continue watching Woody Allen films
","I am not a huge fan of Woody Allen, but continue to give him a lot of chances to redeem himself. I understand the very small niche he contributes to, and can appreciate it for what it is, even if I never seem to end up overly liking any of the films I have watched of his. But after getting tons of great reviews and even an Oscar nomination, I knew I had to see Match Point. I am very happy to say that after viewing it, I was actually impressed.<br/><br/>Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) has moved to London and is looking for a job. Being a minor professional tennis player, he gets a job teaching at a local country club and ends up meeting Tom Hewitt (Matthew Goode). Tom happens to be a member of a rather rich business-orientated family, and happily welcomes Chris to join his family to watch the opera, and later to go to a party the family is hosting. Chris meets and almost instantaneously becomes very acquainted with Tom's sister Chloe (Emily Mortimer), while charming his parents (Brian Cox and Penelope Wilton). At the party however, he ends up meeting Nola Rice (Scarlett Johansson), a sexy American actress, who just happens to be engaged to Tom. He is obviously smitten for her, but attempts to resist his primal urges and stick with Chloe.<br/><br/>It may not sound like too much, but the movie is not really that complicated. It is fairly straight forward and like every other Allen film, is very dialogue driven. The film itself feels very slow and pretentious for its first half as a result of this fact, but then picks up and does not let up afterwards. By moving and sticking to a London setting instead of his traditional New York, Allen has transcended his standard film-making process, and has carved himself out something almost totally different than his past films. It has its darkly humorous moments, but for the most part, is a slow building, and totally worthwhile thriller. 2005 was a year of maturity for many prolific Hollywood personalities, and Woody Allen is no different.<br/><br/>The cinematography really captures London, albeit from a very tourist looking prospective. It does not feel gritty or glossy, just very much in vein with something that feels a bit amateurish. It still looks wonderful of course. The editing is quick and does not bother lingering, something that many of Hollywood's newest filmmakers need to master. The script is very well rounded, and has the sense of being created by a master auteur. The dialogue is great, and very individual for all of the characters. Unfortunately, it does get a bit unrealistic at times, and becomes slightly silly. There were a few exchanges that just felt out of place in the film, and really beg the question of why they were even there in the first place. It is not terribly original (begging the question of the real reason for his Oscar nomination), but it still works and is much more clever than most modern cinema is. <br/><br/>The addition of the opera music is a particularly great touch. It ascends and descends majestically and artfully throughout the entire film, and is absolutely fascinating to listen to and revel within. I have never seen a real opera in my life, but I feel Match Point would be a fairly close representation of one.<br/><br/>Meyers is great as Chris. He is a bit flakey at first, but as his naivety begins to get the better of him, his performance really begins to shine. Much like the film, his performance is a graceful build right into something worthwhile. Not to give anything away, but as the film nears its ending, you can tell that this guy is really going to make something of himself in years to come. Johansson is her regular smoldering gorgeous self, and much like Meyers, gives her performance a while to build up. It is nowhere near as strong a performance as Meyers, or even some of her previous work, but is still very much proving that she is one of the best young actresses in Hollywood today (and obviously, one of the most beautiful). <br/><br/>Supporting work is excellent across the board, from Goode to Cox to Wilton to everyone in-between. Allen has put together a very good ensemble, and all of them work wonderfully together. Mortimer is of particular mention, as her character's transition throughout the film is outstanding.<br/><br/>Quibbles aside, the film is a great watch, and renews my desire to watch more of Woody Allen's older films. It is a very well made film, and is a definite worthwhile watch.<br/><br/>8/10."
"glocksout","10","0","3","14 August 2006"," There is no moral ambiguity
","I heard some good things about Match Point, but I never expected what I got from this. I usually appreciate knowing little about a film before I see it, this is one of those times. Written and directed by Woody Allen, this beautiful masterpiece, set in England, has a subtext of the opera (perhaps if Dostoevsky wrote it). There is no soundtrack except some opera in the background of some scene transitions. The protagonist, played by Jonathan Rhys Meyers, begins as a tennis instructor and ex-tennis pro who finds a mutual interest in the opera with one of his students, and is introduced into his family and the beginning of this turmoil. Throughout the film, he attends the opera several times. This is all fitting well with the tragic tale Allen tells.<br/><br/>The man who said ""I'd rather be lucky than good"" saw deeply into life. People are often afraid to realize how much of an impact luck plays. There are moments in a tennis match where the ball hits the top of the net, and for a split second, remains in mid-air. With a little luck, the ball goes over, and you win. Or maybe it doesn't, and you lose.<br/><br/>The movie opens with this narration, and it moves through the film as a mode used in various plot turns. Luck. Meyers finds himself in the social elite through a friendship turned to family. His life moves from ex-tennis pro to social climber with new opportunities, family that loves him, and a generally comfortable life. He even (in his own mind) finds himself lucky to satiate a lustful desire to have Scarlett Johansson, even though he is soon to be married to her fiancé's (his best friend) sister. And we find the ""match point"" that I've succinctly called a ""double entendre"". A match point is the last point made in a tennis match to win the game, but it's also indicative of the head of a match that, if struck, would ignite into flame. Meyers lives his life in the time the tennis ball is hovering over the net. If he's lucky, it will land on the right side and he will win, or it will land on the wrong side, and his life is shattered. The end of the movie lands a ""match point"" that doesn't bring joy, but pensive guilt. The ball lands on the right side of the net, but nobody has won, and many have lost.<br/><br/>The production of the film is, as some have said, what a film should look like when everything is done right. The colors, the acting, the backdrop, everything is beautiful. I was thinking to myself that the cinematography looked how it would if I were to make a film. The screenplay is so personal the dialog and characters are believable, and you can really see into their lives. The protagonist is his own antagonist, and this tragic story leaves you trying to figure out if you should be sad for, or angry at, Meyers. Woody Allen created an opera for a new age."

","A real return to form for Woody. An absorbing drama, great acting and beautiful cinematography. Jonathan Rhys-Meyers reminds me of a young Malcolm McDowell, he has a intriguing and intense face, and acting skills to match. One could say that its a variation on Martin Landaus plot line in Crimes and Misdemeanors. Match Point is one of those Allen-films were you are not missing the comedy, and it works very well as a drama/thriller. Some small dialog things might feel a bit out of date (Nola: ""I need a drink"", Chris: ""This way""). I sense that directing sex-scenes is not Allens forte, and they are mercifully brief but makes their point. Maybe the policemen near the end are a bit broad in this serious context, but those minor things aside, this is a compelling movie. My theory that directors past their sixties has their best work behind them, is subverted here. Hopefully we have more great films to expect from Woody."
"kintopf432","8","0","2","9 August 2006"," Odd, clever film
","Odd, clever film, if a cold one. At first, it almost numbs the viewer with its frankly clichéd scenario of marriage for money and cheap adultery. This is stuff of melodrama  the production's emphasis on opera is no coincidence  and yet, surprisingly, Woody Allen chooses not to emphasize the emotional aspects of his story, which might seem the best, or at least the most usual, way to make material like this work. Instead, he presents us with characters who aren't really even characterized  despite the over-the-top setting (it's amusing that critics called this a departure for Allen; it's true that here we get the Stately Homes of England instead of the Upper East Side, but it's still his same upper-class fantasy world), they're simply left to be dull, ordinary people, from naïve Chloe and her family to Nola, who, despite the magnetic effect she has on the men of the film, isn't really anything more than a typical stupid young American abroad, first trying to live a starving artist life (and succeeding too well for her liking) and then turning into a panicky, dependent child when she learns she's pregnant. Into this mix of un-characters comes Chris, a person so blank I had trouble remembering his name, about whom we learn nearly nothing over the course of the film. He's a foreigner who comes from humble beginnings (the others very Englishly nickname him ""Irish,"" despite his successful downplaying of his accent) and yet we learn nothing of his background beyond his reasons for leaving pro tennis. It's (somewhat unbelievably) suggested that Chris is a great reader, but, like many real people, for the greater part of this story he is neither a thinker nor an actor. He accepts the affections of Chloe (and the privileges associated with them) more out of politeness than anything else, even to the point of marrying her; when Nola enters into the picture he acts, but still doesn't think. By the time he decides to murder his now-inconvenient paramour in an incredibly careless way (with a shotgun! in her flat!), we're strangely absorbed that such action could come from such a ho-hum character in such a ho-hum plot, and then shocked when he actually goes through with the killing, wondering how this unthinking, unclever, almost amoebalike character possibly thinks he can get away with it. Though similarly prettyboyish, Chris is neither a blood-lusting overachiever like Patrick Bateman or an I-just-wanna-be-loved sociopath like Tom Ripley  he hasn't the calculating ambitions (or the charm) of either, and it's hardly plausible that he could stumble out of his unpleasant situation as thoughtlessly as he stumbled into it. But stumble out of it he does  Allen's misanthropy extends to the entire world of this film, and just as Chris's frankly doltish wife is easily distracted from her husband's odd behavior, so too is the one police detective who manages to put the obvious clues together easily talked out of his theory by a chipper subordinate. Though not marketed as a comedy, ""Match Point"" offers a coldly comic version of the world, and viewed in this light the film becomes almost paradoxically entertaining. Allen almost ruins it at the end with a twee bit of existential artifice that seems juvenile in the context of the adult tone to that point, but perhaps the oddest thing about ""Match Point"" is how watchable a mix of not- pleasing-in-themselves elements it is. It's probably too clever for its own good by half, but it contains enough incongruity to surprise just about any viewer. 8.5 out of 10."

","Stark, menacing. Echoes of Hitchcock and Allens earlier movie Crimes and Misdemeanors. A young man's ride of opportunism that leads to some extremely difficult choices. For me this is one of Woody Allen's best movies. London was an excellent backdrop for this theatrical tale. Excellent cast ..the performances ranged from solid to excellent. Scarlett Johansson is great as an Amercican femme fatale actress wannabe .. a fish out of water amongst the London posh set. Johnathan Rhys Myers sullen oportunist is entirely believable. I loved the art direction and camera work. The visual style created an interesting backdrop for the emerging dread. No dark corners or mood lighting. The sinister plot that evolves is always brightly lit and in your face."

There obviously was some meaning to the choice of the opera scores used in the movie to emphasize the story but I am not the expert to tell what it was. Emily Mortimer knows how to act and is delightful whilst Scarlett is to Match Point what was Lana Turner when she put on her sweater.

Woody Allen has done a most terrific job pulling in the classical themes of tragedy and lust. He quiet possible has done something no modern day film director has done and that is to follow in the foot steps of the the great writers of long ago.. Shakespeare, Dante, and the rest. *************SPOLIERSS FOLLOW****************<br/><br/>The character that I felt most competed to understand was Chris. He in my mind has an odd view of life and the things important to him. As you watch the movie you see that you don't see his and Cloe's wedding but you see his brother-in-laws wedding which the focus is on the fact that he did not marry Nola. Then you see the meeting in the art gallery where he is chasing Nola down and lying to Cloe absolutely amazing because he makes a point of memorizing Nolas number on the spot because he is that infatuated. <br/><br/>I am confused on why Nola would think that he would leave the life he has with Cloe also. A pampered pet will never leave the hand that feeds it. Cloe in some respects was way to Navies and possible unrealistically so. She is my only problem with characters. As for Chris.. BIG SPOILER....<br/><br/>Getting away with the murder of the collateral damage ( aka the old lady) and the intended target ( Nola and his unborn child) through pure luck alone is amazing Iago and all of the other lofty souls who have dipped where he has been and to come out with no societal consequences amazing but the guilty you see eating him at the end of the movie will make his life short and miserable unless he is completely with out conscience and his ending mantra "" The ends Justify the means"" statements are really how he feels.<br/><br/>TOTALLY Recommend THIS MOVIE AND GOOD LUCK WITH THE INTERPURTATION!!!"
"jupiter2-6","10","0","3","11 June 2006"," Surprising and effective update
","This is what Woody Allen should have been doing all along. ""Match Point"" is a well-written and surprisingly, natural updating of ""An American Tragedy"" aka ""A Place In The Sun"" with only minor tweaks to character and circumstance. Transplanted to London, where the distinction between class structure is still more obvious, this version never seems unrealistic. Using the original premise of a man who seems to have talent but not the right set of social qualifications required to get ahead of the crowd, the main character has fortune and notoriety fall into his lap. The distinction here is that Woody Allen has married the story to the suggestion that not all our success has to do with the class we are born into, rather, a large part of who we become rests on basic luck, depending on how the wind blows on any one day. In this version, Chris Wilton (the George Eastman character in ""A Place In The Sun"") remains the same but our sympathies tend to lie with his wife this time. Oddly, as in ""A Place In The Sun,"" the film twists our morals into ultimately hoping that he gets away with murder. Scarlett Johannson (in the Shelley Winters role) excellently portrays the desperate but determined role of the abandoned character except in this version, she has a much less passive role. A clever scene turns up towards the end when the gold ring bounces off the Thames River railing much in the same way as the tennis ball volleys into the net at the beginning, hinting at the idea that one's fate is determined by the smallest changes or mistakes. This film never lags and, ultimately and disturbingly, questions where our loyalties lay; with common decency or with the most evil of crimes. The slight change to the ending is a perfect twist."
"golem3","10","0","4","6 June 2006"," The Rare Genius of Woody Allen
","Once in a while, in the midst of the movies Mr. Allen produces annually, one will stand out and shine. Match Point is just such a film, and the story is quite perfect. Finally, Mr. Allen has come to his senses and put aside the stupidity of the art world, the false coffee shop philosophy, and his own pretentiously fidgety idiosyncrasies to create a movie about not-so-legitimate modern life issues.<br/><br/>Match Point is about the confluence of yuppie life and criminal behavior. In this movie, there is no difference, for pushing ahead and striving for the first task means an inevitable downfall into the second path. This is exactly what has been done well, and this is what makes this film worth seeing.<br/><br/>Unlike Mr. Allen's other movies, he takes a dive into attacking elitism. This is carefully done, without overcooking, and we see that the whole movie begins to surround greed and lust, common trends in films, from the very beginning. No doubt, Mr. Allen's camera angles are evident throughout  highlighting his passion for the characters and who their inner personality really is.<br/><br/>It seems almost impossible to separate the ideas that are presented in this film. Truly, Mr. Allen's departure from his normal work is a positive sign, for he hasn't lost his touch at all. In fact, his touch is sporadic. There are some sporadic moments of genius in most of his films, but the rare genius of Mr. Allen is not so often a continual presence in his movies.<br/><br/>The film stars Scarlett Johannsson as the seductive Nola, and no one else is important enough in Hollywood to be noticed. Rated R, I am sure, for a film in the vein of realism.<br/><br/>RATING: 10/10 <br/><br/>""Sometimes, you just need a little luck"""

","It did Woody Allen much good to look at the world through an English eye. This got him out of his usual thing. And thanks God, he doesn't act in the movie. <br/><br/>Suddenly, there is depth and culture in this clever study of British bourgeoisie faced with the more rugged type of an American aspiring actress, a cute orphan who's mother drank. <br/><br/>On the other hand, the main concerns of the British aristocracy are their sense of duty, and the need to breed an heir. <br/><br/>But above all, it's this pervading love of Verdi, a typical European trait. The music is from the ""the Traviata"". And the soundtrack bares much due sound of scratch. And as the action heats up, leading to a brutal double murder, Verdi's opera gets more pathetic, and the voices start to quiver.<br/><br/>Match point is a master's work : the turmoil of young harts with an intrigue that is razor sharp. The story's hinges are subtle, just like tails or heads. <br/><br/>Scarlett Johansson is a natural as wannabe movie actress. Whereas her mother in law would love to see her do anything but that.<br/><br/>British wit with Italian Bel Canto : Woodie Allen, at last, is as good as Bergmann."
"SandyLiz","8","0","2","30 May 2006"," Knowing who the writer and director was.....spoiler
","I selected this DVD because Emily and Scarlett were in it. I didn't realize until I got it home that it was by Woody Allen. As far as I am concerned his movies are usually weird if not awful. All the characters usually sound like him. I did like Deconstructing Harry and one other of his comedy movies. Anyway, I was surprised at how well the screenplay was. The story certainly gives you plenty to think about. I was literally feeling sick to my stomach when Chris was caught up in all that trouble and the suspense was killing me. I didn't really want him to get away with what he was doing but my instinct felt for him as he was trying to beat the odds and commit the perfect crime. I am glad that I knew it was Woody Allen's story, or I would have been really creeped-out. I think knowing the history of Woody Allen (his personal life that we DO know) and knowing the rest of his works, helps us deal with this distressing movie. First of all it seemed to be a British movie (prob, filmed in NY as I have seen those sets on TV shows, say Sex and the City or whatever) But not typically an American movie. So congrats to Allen being able to do that. And it's shocking to Americans to see a ""bad guy"" get away with murder. We are used to the bad guy getting caught no matter what; not so in foreign movies which rarely explain anything but leave it to the viewer to decide what is really happening. Congrats to Allen again for that, excellent! I have a feeling that the character Chris was acting out some of Allen's hidden or inner rage when acting on his driven-ness so to speak and blowing his lover (and his own unborn baby) away with a shotgun. I am assuming that Allen has felt like doing that on occasion given his history with women and children. Any other director and I wouldn't have understood it as well. Anyway, the story was also a comment on the typical wishy-washy Englishmen who are so stuck in societal demands that they have to play along and deny their real selves. An American would never do that. (A crazy American would only kill someone like that as a result of psychosis not as a thought-out solution, at least in movies.) This guy killed Nola for the sake of sticking to the British upper class traditions, she was a fly in the ointment and had to be gotten rid of, of course, like any other unpleasantness wealthy people deal with. Not only did he sell his soul for money and to continue with his upper class lifestyle, he saw it as the only ""right thing"" to do. Also, it was interesting that his habit of hitting the tennis ball right on the net so it falls back to you--making your LOSE, this time having the ring fall onto the ground instead of into the river--helped him WIN (or get away with murder--unless you see it that he lost again in having to live with his sins.) I can see a character such as he portrayed going right on with life, telling himself ""OH WELL, water under the bridge"", he did say collateral damage and he would force himself to believe that for the sake of his own sanity. And he would not look back or regret it after awhile of justifying it. Maybe he'd become a bit of a drunk on weekends and holidays but expected to do so and tolerated. He would continue participating in the typical stuffy English lifestyle as if there was nothing else he could do. His wife was obviously in charge of his life by then and he would just go along with it. I also thought, like some comments I read, that he could go on with this lifestyle and having blonds on the side would be perfectly acceptable later on down the line."
"Laredos","8","0","2","30 May 2006"," Luck Is All
","First of all, while there are similarities with this film and previous Woody Allen films as well as many other films, novels, the Bible and life in general, this is a new approach for him. This is a larger departure from his earlier films than might first be evident and it would best be viewed without too much glancing backward over the shoulder. There is a new level of steadiness, maturity, pace and control in his direction of this movie, but still an effortless continuation of his traditional irony. The result is one of his finest films.<br/><br/>In the opening scene, a tennis balls hits into the net, bounds upward, hangs for a second in mid-air and then suddenly falls squarely on the net to then fall on one side or the other. Which side it falls upon is entirely due to simple luck. Someone wins on its fall and therefore someone else must certainly lose.<br/><br/>Match Point is a study in the irony and vagary of the force of luck. Allen subtly capitalizes on the fear that most people have of this uncontrollable force on their lives. People like to feel they are personally in full charge of their destinies. It is unnerving to consider that ones fortune, loves, friends, enemies, and health are largely determined by luck, no matter how hard we try to overcome its power.<br/><br/>To prove his point, Allen dishes up an array of English characters flitting in and about London, being very British, with a single American girl swirling along with them in her various moods of joy and despair. The girl, played by a captivating Scarlett Johnasson is an actress that draws your eyes and thoughts to her by just being on the screen. Her performance as Nola Rice, a would be actress, is the focal point of the film and is absolutely essential to the film working. She brings it off with an easy skill that can only be accessible from an exceptional and inherent talent.<br/><br/>Needless to say that an ex-professional tennis player, Chris Wilton, coolly and perfectly played by Jonathan Rhys Meyers, quickly takes notice of Nola at their first impact at a ping-pong table. The actors are able to produce an electrical tension in this first meeting generating a crackle of energy that fills their room. There is a restrained passion in their bantering conversation barely under their control.<br/><br/>The superb English supporting cast consists of, among others, Matthew Goode, Brian Cox, Penelope Wilton and Emily Mortimer playing the Hewetts. They seemed to have been born in the estate where many key scenes are staged and totally in place in other plush locations and seem utterly at home as members of the British upper class.<br/><br/>When Chris Wilton marries into the Hewetts, he is taken into the family business and is awarded success, security and luxury, but then he and Nola suddenly find themselves together. They then find themselves together more and more and for much more.<br/><br/>Chris Wilton then is presented with the dilemma that countless men have faced over hundreds of years. He will have to decide between the Hewetts and all they have to offer him or Nola, who has become increasingly difficult, emotional and irrational. While this dilemma is certainly not original, it has happened so regularly over the centuries it must be accepted as incontestably viable.<br/><br/>As pressure steadily builds on Wilton to solve his dilemma, he takes action and then in the end, his destiny is decided in the same way as foretold by the opening scene. An object goes up into the air and then falls one way or the other, setting off a sequence of events that ultimately decides Wilton's fate as a matter of simple luck."

It's always a fun experience, because in the trailers, all movies look great. When I saw the trailer for Match Point, I was in a mood where I was sick of Scarlett Johansson and all the attention she was getting. But then I saw the beautiful face of Jonathan Rhys Meyers, and I kinda got excited for this one. When I found out that Woody Allen was directing sealed the deal. Too bad it was rated R. Being only 16 with restrictive parents, this was a bad sign.<br/><br/>When I turned 17 and got a Netflix account, Match Point quickly moved it's way to the top of my queue. I popped it into my DVD player at around 11 o'clock at night and settled in for a night of Woody Allen flavored goodness. It was nothing like I expected, yet still served it's purpose. <br/><br/>Scarlett Johansson plays an almost-but-not-quite stereotypical obsessive, sexy, psycho mistress. Through the first hour, I was pretty sick of her because she looked like she was just showing up for the paycheck, and not really giving it the talent I know she has. Then when the big plot twist comes, everything changes. She turns in one of the best performances of her career thus far. Her and Rhys Meyers have explosive chemistry that lights up the screen from the first time they meet.<br/><br/>This film was definitely worth the wait. It is a rare movie that can keep me awake past 12:30. It's so Un-Woody Allen, but you can see a few elements of his genius. I'd definitely recommend this to a friend."

Each time I felt that way, though, I recognized that the film was reflecting real life--because desperate people commit unreasonable acts, forgetting the potential consequences.<br/><br/>The movie title fits perfectly, which is not often the case. In fact, every viewer should give special attention to the opening scene, which sets the theme.<br/><br/>While many movie fans think of Woody Allen as a comedic actor and writer, all of us have to tip our hats to him for this memorable drama.

","""It's amazing how much of our lives depend on luck."" Fatalist or not, by the end of the film you will definitely be contemplating that line from the opening scene. In fact, the idea that luck defines our lack of control only emphasises the definition of fate.<br/><br/>Powerful in many respects, Woody Allen's intimate, depiction of everyday life gets woven into the thick canvas of Dostoyevsky's 'Crime and Punishment'.<br/><br/>There are hints to his previous films but Match Point is a completely new style. I would like to say, if you are a fan of Woody Allen, watch this; be warned though: this is no comic portrayal of a neurotic man; this is the examination of a mind torn between love and lust, symbolised by a tennis game.<br/><br/>I believe that it starts off on a bad foot; too slow and unconcerned with story, but then again, is this the way Woody Allen builds up a relationship between these externally-simple characters and the viewer?<br/><br/>The cast give satisfying performances: Scarlett Johansson proves that she is a competent and sexy actress, but there are some frustrating aspects of Jonathan Rhys Meyers' persona; his accent and manner nauseatingly overshadow the important history of his character. Nonetheless, you do grow accustomed to it and in the respect of consistency, he does give a good performance as the man torn between Johansson and his soon-to-be-wife, Emily Mortimer. I am not going to summarise the story; it may have more of an impact if you don't have any presumptions.<br/><br/>If you haven't yet, I do recommend you watch this film.

","Just saw this movie last night, and I have never been an overly enthusiastic Woody Allen fan.<br/><br/>Did not really know what to expect, but I do know Woody Allen more for his comedies and love of New York. So what is he doing making a drama in the UK? It's hard to say.<br/><br/>This movie started off as a drama full of infidelity and explores how much a man will risk to get what he wants. The main character, Chris Wilton, was annoying and totally compelling at the same time, and much of the credit for that goes to Jonathan Rhys Meyer (you will remember him from Bend it Like Beckham as the coach). His performance made me want to reach in and strangle him, and ask, ""what the hell are you doing?"" His best friend is his wife's brother, his father-in-law is supportive, and has set him up with a great job, and even his mother-in-law loves him. Yet, he is willing to risk it all for a bit of ass (Scarlett Johansson's, to be exact).<br/><br/>At times you want him to get caught having his affair, and yet, at the same time, you empathize with his wife, Chloe, played by Emily Mortimer, and you don't want to see her get hurt.<br/><br/>After about 3 quarters of the film, you start to believe that this is yet another of those movies where the main character heads toward self-destruction bringing down all those around him as well.<br/><br/>Then the movie turns on its head in such a subtle way that you almost miss it, and comes up with an ending that makes you uncomfortably comfortable (when you see it, you will know what I mean).<br/><br/>The first three quarters may seem slow, corny, unnerving, and unintentionally funny, but I found the ending was worth it."
"MrBiddle","10","0","3","16 May 2006"," Luck?
","Luck. That is what Chris Wilton describes at the opening scene of MATCH POINT... Please take note that the thoughts explored in that opening are exactly what is explored in the closing scene. The film is a matter-of-factly depiction of the troubles one has to face during extra-marital affairs, or forbidden relationships for that matter. Jonathan Rhys Meyers plays the character with the much needed intensity and bustling pressure that occupy Chris Wilton. Johansson is able to stand out as the strong-willed Nola Rice, aggressive and anxious to put things to a resolve suspense builds as she always desires to make things her way if Chris's actions aren't enough for her... Bryan Cox is excellent as Alec, the father-in-law of Chris, this is the first time I have seen Cox with an English accent... same with all other players, they shine in this Woody Allen piece. Woody Allen handles his work with the D.P. and camera operators very well, some interesting shots, long takes e.g. the scene where Chris bumps into Nola in the sidewalk and walks her into her audition and many more.<br/><br/>The suspense in this tragic drama builds to an almost unbearable level when Rhys-Meyer's character decides to do the deed that will be the turning point towards the climax of the movie. The intensity of his portrayal of what Chris is going through in those scenes is perfect and only appropriate. As with most of the movie, that turning point of a scene is accentuated with some opera music as well, and more spine-chilling in it's melody at that during the sequence.<br/><br/>Well, the movie does not end as ... Nola Rice (Scarlett Johansson) would have had it, but it does not end on an ""up"" note either. And it does not end the way you think it would, if you can tell my train of thought (no, not a happy ending) but not that either. Instead it closes with a little discrepancy, in fact a little twist that happens against Chris Wilton's act in the end of the film... and as mentioned in the opening scene, it closes with a little bit of luck. Just watch what I mean. The ""lucky"" element is a visual parallel of the first thing you see when the film opens. Excellent filming of the ""objects"" involved in what I am referring to.<br/><br/>Allen has done a terrific job in weaving a tale of passion, obsession and the release of self-control and decisiveness and the consequences of it in this life. Whatever his intentions have been, MATCH POINT has been a most engrossing, suspenseful and riveting experience of cinema.<br/><br/>Grade A+"

","The Genre of this film was beautiful and its climax was hard to imagine. Scarlett Johansson was Beautiful and that makes this film even more worth watching. The Script and plot development was beautifully done. When talking about the script. This Movie is about a guy who is stuck between two woman at a time and is finding it difficult to cope up with both at the same time and has therefore have to make a decision in the end. The Title of this Film is very symbolical to the whole movie. The endings pretty SAD and i m sure no one would walk out with a happy face after watching this movie. Well people who love Scarlett Johansson ..this is the right choice !!!! The actor also has done a pretty good job. The audience will also face the formal British conversations in the movie. This movie is definitely worth watching once and it wouldn't be a risk renting its DVD or buying it."

","first of all I love the characters- the setting-the acting-and the locations and only quibbled with the length of the picture - until I saw it the second time and realized just how many times there are ""coincidences"" that detract from integrity of the story. The museum-the street corner -- spotting Chloe out the window in a rainstorm --a friend spying Chris hailing a cab and busting him on another chance meeting in a restaurant ---Nola spotting Chris exiting the store (!) It seems every time they go outside there's a fickle happenstance waiting to occur.

","I don't know if any critics have realized this. Chris even reads Dostevesky in the movie, warning us of what is to come... His actions follow the same actions as the main character, Raskolnikov, who murders an old lady, makes it look like a robbery and then can't live with the guilt. So we kind of know what happens to Chris in the end... In the book, Raskolnikov, turns himself in because he can't stand having the hallucinations of his victims, which we see Chris also having towards the end of the film as well. Also, the book is similar in that there is shoddy police work that allows Raskolnikov to get away with murder. There are coincidences that throw the police off his trail just like the ""junkie"" who was arrested for the ""robbery."""

","This movie is amazing, in the EXACT sense of the word. The relationships portrayed between all the characters has a reality to it. It wasn't the crap that they make nowadays where everything is way too rushed and not really showing how the character progresses. As you might have read in other reviews, this movie is about a tennis player who basically is woven into a family that is quite wealthy. He meets his client (he coaches tennis) sister, and instantly she pulls him by her side, feeding him job opportunities. She basically gives him everything he never had. His clients fiancée (whos just a poor starving American actor), he meets and instantly he has lust for. He wants what he can't have, and his comments apparently justify exactly that. Not only this, but he also falls into a lustful romance (maybe romance is not an appropriate word, but i don't know what else to call it) with his tennis clients fiancée. He marries the sister, and he continues to have the affair (long after the client and the fiancée break up).<br/><br/>The affair really keeps on going until he gets a phone call that she has to see him at that immediate point of time. She's pregnant. He freaks out, he considers leaving his wife but when the time comes, he just can't tell her. He decides there's only one thing that he can do. The whole entire movie is not thankfully.. graphic in the sexual or the violence. It's all really left for the mind to imagine. He's already gotten used to the comfortable way of life. He kills her, and heres the punchline, he gets away with it."
"spooly_montana","10","0","4","3 May 2006"," Masterful film-making in this romantic thriller
","Woody Allen's latest opus, MATCH POINT, poses an interesting philosophical question: how much of life is determined by chance or just plain luck? Scarlett Johansson and Jonathan Rhys Meyers star in this romantic thriller set in London. Originally from Ireland, Chris Wilton (Meyers) is hired on as a tennis pro in an upscale country club. He befriends one of his wealthy pupils, Tom Hewitt, and pursues Tom's sister Chloe, all the while getting drawn into this upper-class world of estates, nice clothes, fancy cars and the box seats at the opera. Chris is integrated into the Hewitt family, an apparent future son-in-law. That is when he meets Tom's alluring American fiancée, Nola Rice (Johansson), who catches Chris's eye. Illustrating a basic male trait, of being able to separate thoughts into ""sections,"" he chases Nola covertly, while marrying Chloe and trying to have a child with her. Chris is given a great office job in the Hewitt company, and is being groomed for future leadership and considerably more wealth. His obsession however with Nola is always present, and he juggles both his boring stable home life, and his torrid affair with Nola. Previous Woody Allen films have handled such infidelity with a bit of comedy and wit. Match Point proceeds into darker territory, with many twists and thrilling turns. Woody Allen transitions into an operatic tone, free of shtick, trading his beloved Manhattan, for London. Woody treats us with the same loving eye for location and storytelling, and surprises you with thick suspense and rich drama. This is Allen's most acclaimed film in years, and marks a return to his masterful film-making form. I greatly anticipated this film, and it did not disappoint."

","Very much of an Ingmar Bergnan's complicated personalities and voices meets a modern version of Fyodor Dostoyevski's Crime and punishment. Woody Allen's latest movie examines those 50/50 moments when life can go one way or the other, audiences will be equally split. Others bored of a decade of more misses than hits, will find it pretentious and stale. Whatever you think, its clear that Allen's first UK based film has given him some fresh settings and a big target in the shape of super posh Brits. The film portrays Chris, a social climber who befriends rich boy Tom, then marries his sister. But soon starts an affair with American actress Nola that threatens to destroy all he's worked for. Not very charismatic acting but there are several comic moments and its well worth a watch."
"Bunuel1976","7","0","4","1 May 2006"," MATCH POINT (Woody Allen, 2005) ***
","I wouldn't say that I'm Woody's biggest fan but, along the years, I've found his writing to be of a consistently high quality. As I was watching this film, I felt guilty of having neglected his recent work - the last Allen title I've watched is SWEET AND LOWDOWN (1999) and, in all, I still have to catch up with 14 of his pictures! - but, by the end of it, I reconfirmed my opinion that his work needs to be taken in small doses...<br/><br/>Considering the praise heaped upon MATCH POINT, many claiming it to be some kind of (belated) turning point in Allen's career, I didn't quite know what to expect. However, when I watched the film I was relieved - but, at the same time, disappointed - to discover that it's nothing if not the old Woody all over again! While I wouldn't quite call his films boring, the relentless barrage of cultural name-dropping in historical/fashionable surroundings - more than his Bergmanesque study of male/female relationships and their neuroses (which is not as pronounced here as in some of his earlier, more austere work anyway) - is decidedly exasperating...and, in the case of this particular film, is further augmented by the posh lifestyle of the characters and the dreary London setting. Besides, listening to Allen's distinctive dialogue being delivered with a British accent proved quite unreal and took some getting used to! <br/><br/>Anyway, what made the film for me was the presence - in both senses - of Scarlett Johannson: not only is she breath-taking to look at (I was extremely lucky to get to see her, and even attended two Press Conferences she did, at the 2004 Venice Film Festival!) but her tackling of the difficult role - as was the case with LOST IN TRANSLATION (2003) - was outstanding, and knowledgeable beyond her years; I've watched only two of the performances nominated for the Best Supporting Actress Oscar, but I can't help feeling that she has been snubbed (and that's twice already!).<br/><br/>As for the much-touted final third which turns the film, unexpectedly, into a thriller (not a first for Woody, by the way): Allen directs these scenes like a pro, even taking care to include elements of black comedy and capping all with a devastatingly ironic ending. Bravo! Well, even if the film is not up to the standards of his best serious work (alas, only the first of them has received more than one viewing from me!) - ANNIE HALL (1977), MANHATTAN (1979), HANNAH AND HER SISTERS (1986), CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS (1989) and HUSBANDS AND WIVES (1992) - writing these comments just now has all of a sudden put me in the mood for more of the director's films: I do have four on VHS (though both my VCRs are currently out-of-order!) but, then, my local DVD outlet carries most of his recent work..."
"bersarhin","10","0","3","30 April 2006"," Allen's Match Point
","I had never watched Annie Hall. I had bought several Woody Allen movies including Annie Hall some time ago, and Annie Hall was the only one still wrapped in plastic. I finally opened it and was marveled at the universe inside the characters' minds Allen had created. It also made me see Small Time Crooks and Hollywood Ending (which I had originally liked) were a piece of ****. I saw the real Woody and the ""new"" Woody.<br/><br/>Woody Allen had one more chance at showing why he is considered one of the best directors in the history of cinema. It could go either way. It was Woody Allen's Match Point.<br/><br/>""There are moments in a tennis match where the ball hits the top of the net, and for a split second, remains in mid-air. With a little luck, the ball goes over, and you win. Or maybe it doesn't, and you lose."" This phrase with which the movie starts presents what Match Point was in the career of Allen. Allen's ball could go either way. He could either lose or win. And he won.<br/><br/>Match Point is my favourite movie of the year after Me and you and everyone we know and Brokeback Mountain. It has solid performances from the whole cast and especially good performances from Johansson and Rhys-Meyers. Match Point is the kind of movie which you spend hours thinking about. You think about the motifs behind every character's acts. You think about the use of certain scenes. You think about the beauty of the screenplay.<br/><br/>The screenplay was very strange for me. If you cut the movie into different scenes you'll definitely say: ""I've seen this a thousand times before"". Every scene in Match Point is a cliché. To quote some examples: The Ghost Scene and the Introduction of Nola. But that's why it's so original: Because no one had ever thought of doing the least original screenplay.<br/><br/>Now, if you check the trivia in IMDb of any of Allen's films you'll find many Director Trademarks. You won't with this movie. For example, there's not a single writer in this film. If I had seen this movie without knowing it was Allen's I would have thought it was another director's (for example Mike Nichols), and it's not because it's a drama. Woody's other dramas, such as Interiors, have his special touch. But this movie has none of his mannerisms. It is a new Woody. A Woody who has finally learned after a decade of failures (excluding a few such as Melinda and Melinda) that it was time to change or die. He won that match point."

","Chris Wilson (Rhys-Meyers) a tennis pro works his way into British upper class society, marries the rich girl and gets a cushy job with her father's London business and has the world by the tail. Then Nola (Johansson) becomes available and Chris wants her. Some luck, eh? <br/><br/>This was directed by Woody Allen and if there are laughs in here, they must be a British thing because I didn't see them. No one did. Not even the British. But, that's okay, this is a good, although too long, movie. Jonathan Rhys-Meyers still looks an awful lot like a young Elvis Presley and Scarlett Johansson looks like, well.. heaven.. where all prayers have been answered. The movie is worth seeing just to gaze upon her beauty.<br/><br/>Match Point in tennis means that whatever side has the advantage and wins this point, wins the match. Woody Allen opens the movie with the match point ball hitting the net cord and if the Ad side hit that ball and it goes over, the match is won. If it doesn't go over, then the game continues until one side has the opportunity to get to another match point. Some will say luck plays a very important part in this game and maybe in life itself. The tennis ball hitting the net cord that opens the movie comes full circle later on and is extremely cleverly done.<br/><br/>Okay, so it's not a comedy, but a drama and later on a thriller..sort of. That's not so bad. Just when you think everything will be revealed and the characters start running for cover, Chris does something quite unexpected and this is where I sat up and took notice. I was shocked at what he was going to do. I couldn't believe it and hoped I was wrong. And, this was the only part of the movie where I began to care for the characters. Before that I didn't care. OK, I lied, I cared for Nola from the minute I first saw her. Come on, she's Scarlett Johansson!<br/><br/>Now, which way did the ball bounce? Over the net or did it stay on this side? Let me sum it up this way, be careful what you wish for and hope that you get lucky when you do get it. I suppose the real question here is was Chris on the Advantage side or the other side when the ball was deciding where to go?"

The acting was just under average and i hate being left to assume at the end. I also hated that the ""ghosts"" came. it seemed out of place and never really tied in! Not my favorite movie.

"cardiobest","10","0","3","29 April 2006"," Extra-marital affairs are never without risks
","This is a great movie It is about the risk of a married man (into a wealthy family)having an affair with a young, much poorer, and aspiring actress. The affair, like most other affairs, starts off with pure passion, lust and wild sex, not love, before the man is married and before she is separated from her rich boyfriend. After the marriage, he is bored with his rich wife sexually and is tempted by her and he rekindles the affair with the now-single actress. He loves his wife and the luxurious life she brings to him through her rich father but he enjoys the wild lusty sex with her. So he does not want to leave his wife for her until an important life event happens that tests the strength and the foundation of the affair and his love for his wife and his lust ( ?? love) for his mistress. The movie shows what a man is forced to do to resolve this dilemma.<br/><br/>I think this movie warns those who are married NOT to have sexual affairs as most affairs end up tragically especially if the affair is conducted between a married man and an unmarried, poorer loser........unless you have the audacity to leave your spouse, children and comfortable life for the sake of love for the person you are having an affair with. Sadly most affairs start off by lust and passion and not love and as most people have human feelings, one-night stands and short-term affairs often create more feelings and lead to something more and they cannot stand the test of time and important and tragic life events unless the two partners really love each other."

Loved the scene with the tennis ball and how they related it with another scene at the end of the movie. I say people will love it or hate it because it deals with emotions, moral, beliefs, luck, i mean, subjects that usually get a strong reaction from people, and since you become part of the movie you will hate it or you will love it but it is very difficult to feel no emotions about it. This film will keep you tense, there's always something going on, and the twist in the end is something you can not see coming if you don't know anything about the movie.

","I am not a huge fan of Woody Allen, mainly since after he got involved with his real-life adopted step-daughter Soon Yi, just too weird for me. But this film is a well-scripted, well-crafted product from what a lot of people refer to as ""a brilliant film maker."" ""Match Point"" is set in contemporary London. The first few minutes are a little slow but you have to bear with it-it picks up. Jonathan Rhys-Meyer plays a confused Irish guy named Chris,who has a love of the opera. Though he is in a relationship with a wealthy woman whose family adores him, he realizes his attraction towards an American woman, is a lot more intense. Scarlett Johannsen plays the American girl, and aspiring actress, Nola Rice. Both Nola and Chris are involved with someone else. Later in the movie, in the midst of having an intense affair with Nola, Chris cannot decide who he'd rather be with: the woman, Chloe, whose family has given him a promising job and a beautiful flat, or Nola, the frequently unemployed, young aspiring actress whose future is uncertain. Without giving away too many details of the movie, it takes an unpredictable turn and starts to remind the viewer of ""The Talented Mr. Ripley""-obsession, anger and love will cause someone to do unthinkable acts. This movie is not what I would call original in any shape of form, but it is highly viewable and well done all around. 9 out of 10 stars."
"come2whereimfrom","6","0","1","27 April 2006"," not Woody's best but still good.
","I don't think there is grey area with woody people seem to either love him or loathe him. I think he has done some excellent films I also think he's done some bad ones. I've heard people say that match point falls into the bad section but I disagree. I think that relocating to London from his usual Manhattan backdrop has invigorated him. With a typically sharp script its business as usual for woody and although the acting is mediocre it doesn't seem to spoil it too much. There is a great twist at the end and recognisable places in the locations. We are presented with age-old dilemmas about love and loss to deal with and once a conundrum is set up the audience is challenged to see themselves in the characters and realise the situations that we as flawed humans can get ourselves into. Of course this being a film it may not pan out as it would in real life but the basis is the same. Shot in his own unique style and injected with operatic background music match point is the first of a supposed trilogy set in our fine capital and on the basis of this I look forward to the next few outings from one of my favourite directors"

"gradyharp","10","0","3","26 April 2006"," An Engrossing, Brilliantly Played Work of Chamber Music
","Woody Allen is always at his finest when he stays away from self-parody: the man can write and direct brilliantly and create solid gems of cultural/society examinations with the best of them! MATCH POINT is a case in point. From the opening credits, to the keenly meaningful voice-over about the significance of luck in molding the course of our lives, to the arresting pause of a tennis ball frozen in its rise from a struck net before falling to either side, to the use of scratchy Enrico Caruso recordings - all of these are indications that Allen is about to lead us into a world defined by walking on razor blade edges. Match Point is an intelligent, burnished, glowing little masterpiece of movie making, a thriller that keeps the viewer bound until the surprise ending.<br/><br/>Chris (Jonathan Rhys Meyers, groomed and handsome and magnetic in his first role as a non-quirky oddball) is a lower middle class ex tennis pro who begins his new life as a tennis teacher in a wealthy club where he encounters the Hewett family, a family of immense wealth lead by a benevolent father (Brian Cox), a class conscious mother (Penelope Wilton), a handsome son Tom (Matthew Goode) who is dating a middle class American wannabe actress Nola (Scarlett Johansson), and daughter Chloe (Emily Mortimer). Chris' good looks and manners win the family's affection and he is melded into the fabric of wealth through his attention to Chloe and his movement into the father's business. Sadly for all Chris is attracted to the sensuous Nola who, despite her physical attraction for Chris, knows the steps to climb up the ladder to wealth by being engaged to Tom.<br/><br/>Chris falls in love with his new life of luxury, marries Chloe who wants to have children immediately, and yet he lusts for Nola. In time Nola and Tom part (the reason to be outlined later in the film) and though hesitant to shake Chris' marriage to Chloe, Nola becomes physically involved with Chris. The inherent dangers of Chris' infidelity grow to tragic proportions and his knotty dilemma of choosing his new life of comfort versus his lust for Nola result in bits and pieces of luck that determine the outcome of the film.<br/><br/>For this viewer it is difficult to fault any aspect of this film: the cinematography by Remi Adefarasin is not only stunning visually - it also captures the tension of the film in mixing tight shots with panoramas isolating the characters in motion of betrayal; the film's music score is almost entirely opera excerpts from old Caruso recordings (know the opera excerpts and the story is enhanced!) and from 'live' stage performances at Covent Garden (superb singing and staging oddly accompanied by only a piano!). But the brilliance of this ensemble is Allen's keenly sensitive eye and timing and pacing of a suspense thriller that always has as its base a fine dollop of social comment and lusty romance. The cast is impeccable, from the consistently superb smaller roles to the tour de force acting of Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Scarlett Johansson, and Emily Mortimer. This is clearly one of the finest works of Woody Allen's long career and hopefully he will continue along this vein. Highly Recommended. Grady Harp"
"Christoph56","8","0","1","22 April 2006"," A Chilling Second Half
","Going into this movie, knowing quite a few of Woody Allen's films, I thought that there would be a little romance, but overall it would be mostly a comedy. Comedy usually seems to be what Woody is all about, but I know understand, it isn't in times like these.<br/><br/>The first half of the film seemed to be bland, and generic. Every shot that was made seemed quite basic, and the plot made me prefer to make out then continue to watch. I kept to it though, and when in the second hour, when the twists started to come it made me shrivel up. Everything got so tense as all of the facts that seemed bland from the first half started to come out, and all of the reasoning for them would just hit you in the face. This film became much more intense then many that I've seen, and it blew away all the reasons that I haven't been interested in romance movies.<br/><br/>There isn't nearly as much comedy in this film as comes from a regular Woody Allen film, but he did quite an amazing job on this deep, romantic drama. If you're with your lover, though, try to keep away from each other's lips so you'll understand the entire film. Trust me, you'll thank me for that by the end."
"foomonger","9","0","3","16 April 2006"," A master at work.
","Essentially, this is a very tense moment teased out to just over two hours. <br/><br/>All the elements of a masterpiece are here; incredible cinematography, crackling, multi-layered script, knock-out acting by the players, and an ultra-fine tuned directorial sense pulling all these wonderful strands into one infinitely tangible whole. I mean that in the real sense of the word. This is a WHOLE film! A rare thing these days.<br/><br/>The acting is top-notch; Brian Cox has never been so subtle, nor Scarlett Johansson so highly seductive. Her close-up shots almost feel like slow-motion, as if she could somehow expand time with those luscious lips, do weird things to your perception of time, at any rate. And Woody isn't afraid to make the most of her ample charms, either. Oh yes!<br/><br/>I didn't like Chris Wilton from almost first glance, and it's difficult to express how I felt about him by the end without giving too much away, but suffice to say his performance alone makes the piece worthwhile. But that's all so true of the other players; Matthew Goode was bang on the nail, Emily Mortimer just keeps getting better, etc., etc. Where to begin?<br/><br/>I mean, in a regular movie, any of these performances would have stood out as being extraordinary, but as they are *all* that, it's difficult to pluck out any single performance for especial praise; a mark of the exceptional direction as much as anything, but whatever the individual elements, it works; Woody placing the viewer at the precise point between the lead character's inner and out self, where we may experience both. Fantastic stuff.<br/><br/>Yeah, I've just seen Match Point, and so I'm still buzzing about it, and by morning, when the deeper layers of the film have worked their way into my subconscious, I'll likely feel different about things, and all this talk of performances and cinematography will seem trivial and mundane, but still, it's the wee details that make the masterpiece, and this film most certainly is that.<br/><br/>I want to see Match Point again, and soon, soaking in some more of that detail; it's simply not possible in a single viewing. Sure, the story's essence may be the matter of ""Luck"", but nothing here has been left to chance; London suits Woody's temperament methinks, perhaps the air is cleaner than Manhattan. Ley Lines, maybe? Whatever it is, everything appears in sharper focus, as if Woody's vision is getting better with age. To have this beautiful script (and a great story) brought to life with such clarity and finesse did actually take my breath away, sometimes for minutes at a time. <br/><br/>You know how those really scary Japanese films can jiggle your fear cells by means of carefully placed everyday objects, well, Woody doesn't exactly follow this school of scary film technique, but his masterful use of objects has a similar, though infinitely more devastating impact on the sensory system. How is it possible to induce such panic with the lights on? You will see!<br/><br/>The structure of the piece is remarkable, too, but to broach that is to jump the train to spoiler city, so I'll leave you to ponder. In fact, I realise now that the review I *want* to write is *all* spoiler. To be woven so tightly into the thoughts and motivations of a character that you know what he will do before he does it, not because it's obvious, or because there's some dumb talk-over, but because it's what *he* would do, is perfectly crystallised motivation. There's comes a point in the film when you suddenly think ""No! He's not gonna do it!"", and know perfectly well that he is. Actually, there are a few moments like that, quite a few, and the skill in which the elements that conjure these realisations are placed and guided through the visual field is simply stunning. I finally understand what the word ""Director"" means!<br/><br/>Okay, I've enjoyed his films since I was a kid, but the truth is, though do I respect and admire his work, I've never been able to shake that image of Woody in a Jester suit, jousting the lock of a chastity belt, desperately attempting to unleash the magic within, and, of course, making a fool of himself.<br/><br/>Two things have changed.<br/><br/>1. Woody has finally unlocked the belt, and released the magic. 2. I no longer see the Jester suit.<br/><br/>Good Work Mr. Allen!<br/><br/>-fm<br/><br/>ps.. Don't die until until you've made few more films! And, Come to Scotland!"

"colonel_green","10","0","1","3 April 2006"," Well, it's safe to assume that Woody thinks life is a tragedy.
","Woody Allen's most recent film ""Match Point"" finally arrived in the theatre here this week, and I saw it last night. Everyone was talking about how this was Allen's best film in years (some say since 1989). While I haven't seen much of Allen's work, I thought this was a great movie.<br/><br/>Plotwise, it plays like ""Crimes & Misdemeanors"" distilled to only the Martin Landau plot, without the Woody Allen/Alan Alda comic plot interlaced. In both movies, a successful man is having an affair, and when the mistress won't keep quiet, ponders whether he should kill her to cover up his secret. This could be called derivative, but I actually liked it more than C & M, because the Martin Landau plot is by far the more interesting of the two. In MP, Jonathon Rhys Meyers plays the Martin Landau role (philandering spouse), Scarlett Johanssen is Anjelica Huston, and Emily Mortimer plays the wife role (Claire Bloom in C & M, but Mortimer's role is at least three times larger). While C & M was a very intellectual meditation on whether or not God exists, MP is about how much of our lives are determined by totally random, often implausible factors that we can't control.<br/><br/>For instance, both movies have fundamentally the same ending: the murder is carried out, and while some suspicion falls on Landau/Meyers, they ultimately get away with it, and, even more horrifically, they each reach an accommodation with themselves, accepting their decision. As well, another person is fingered for the murder. This happens in both cases, but how it happens and how it is played is different. The details of how Martin Landau gets off are essentially unimportant, since the focal point of the film is whether he can accept what he has done. However, MP has an extended epilogue to the murder where we see how random events (including one really brilliant twist on something that had earlier seemed a visual flourish) allow Meyers to get away with the crime.<br/><br/>Ultimately, Chris (Meyers) and his oblivious wife Chloe (Emily Mortimer, terrific) conceive a child, and Chris gets another promotion in the company owned by Chloe's father (Brian Cox, essentially the same ""nice dad"" roll he played in ""Red Eye"").<br/><br/>I'd recommend that anyone who likes thrillers (honestly, it would be impossible to guess Allen had directed this if his name wasn't on it), or Woody Allen movies."

","This movie is the latest from the distinguished British writer-director, Sir Woodford Allen. In a dark tale about an upwardly mobile young tennis pro who marries into an upper-class family while carrying on with his brother-in law's wayward fiancé, Sir Woodford, moving effortlessly through his natural milieu, expertly dissecting both the toffs and the pretenders. It can now be revealed that Sir Woodford is but a persona of that Dostoyevsky of the cinema, Woody Allen, who in fact has made a film which could be set almost anywhere. It seems the original script had New York and the Hamptons as locations, but the story plays just as well in London Paris, Sydney or Tokyo would have done just as well. It is wonderfully back grounded by some of the fruitier Italian Opera (especially Verdi)  the sound track is worth the price of admission alone.<br/><br/>Chris, the tennis guy is played by the Irish actor Jonathan Rhys Meyers. It is a remarkable performance, owing something to the early Malcolm McDowell (""Clockwork Orange ""and ""O Lucky Man""). It also reminded me of Patricia Highsmith's ""Ripley"" (the character as played by Matt Damon not John Malkovich). It is an accomplishment to be able to radiate innocence while lying through your teeth, and Meyers does this beautifully, while keeping you guessing as to what he is really up to.<br/><br/>Scarlett Johansson as his paramour Nola also puts in a powerful performance, even though her character is less mysterious. We can certainly feel the attraction - she is blond, beautiful and ""spirited"". Later, the magic fades, and we see her still handsome, but just another bad-tempered failed actress. This of course is what Chris sees also.<br/><br/>The family Chris has married into rather reminded me of something a British real estate agent said about the English Aristocracy  ""deeply ordinary people mainly interested in country pursuits"". Wife Chloe (Emily Mortimer) just wants to breed, Mother in law Eleanor (Penelope Wilton) is disapproving and Father in law Alec Hewitt (Brian Cox) just wants to help. Dim brother in law Tom (Matthew Goode) just wants to improve his serve. I can only assume Alec inherited his money  he shows no sign of the abilities required to make it. Still, all this makes the Hewitts the perfect set of milch cows for Chris, who has all the qualities required for success in the dog-eat-dog world of high finance.<br/><br/>Woody, or is it Sir Woodford, clearly wants to remind us of the role of chance in human affairs and indeed you could say chance determines the outcome here. But with all respect to Sir Woody, the forces of nature, and Chris is one of those, have a habit of prevailing despite the fall of the dice. Don't get me wrong  this is great entertainment, but it wouldn't do to take it seriously. In the real world, it is more likely that the competent Detective Banner would have been examined the matter more closely. After all, James Nesbitt usually plays coppers who get their man."

","An earlier reviewer is on target for a first viewing. First viewing the film, I did think of Patricia Highsmith, Laurence Harvey, even Dirk Bogarde, and, of course, ""A Place in the Sun."" Then I saw the movie a second time. The Allen film is much more sharp-witted, more intelligent, and at the same time deeper than the echoes one hears or sees in references that Mr. Allen makes. Mr. Allen touches Shakespeare and Sophocles. Remember opera emerged from an effort to revive Greek drama. <br/><br/>Yet, there are moments that echo Alfred Hitchcock's playful humor and that reveal the humor rather than mere irony masked in much of the dialogue and plot. Humor frequently seems about to erupt into plain view. The second audience that viewed the film with me did laugh and then failed to laugh when the joke turned on them. The third audience was silent. <br/><br/>Every nuance in this exquisite movie shows discernment and balance. Archetypal operatic arias from ancient recordings support but simultaneously overturn the oppression that the story presentsjust as the somber references to dark film turns on itself. With my first viewing, I experienced dread during much of the film until just before the very end. This film seems to emerge from the earlier ""Melinda and Melinda."" The films make companion pieces.<br/><br/>Is life fair? You must be joking, if you must ask. In the end, maybe the first viewing got it right. Do you laugh or do you cry?"

Scarlett Johansson is amazing in this movie, all the characters are really convincing and the movie is very well filmed and you also will find a bit of British comedy including a mother-in-law acting just like a monster-in-law.

","A Woody Allen film shot in London! An retired Irish tennis star Chris (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) quits the circuit and takes a job teaching rich people how to play. He becomes friends with VERY rich Tom Hewett (Matthew Goode) and starts romancing his sister Chloe (Emily Mortimer). Then he meets Tom's girlfriend Nola (Scarlett Johansson) and falls in lust for her...<br/><br/>This isn't a comedy. It's a very grim tale of adultery. This has been praised as a comeback for Woody Allen--his last few films have been laugh less comedies. It's also been described as a masterpiece. It is good but not THAT good.<br/><br/>To be totally honest I don't understand why this is being praised so much. The story is downbeat and moves VERY slowly (this film could easily lose 20 minutes). The affair between Chris and Nola comes out of nowhere--I never believed it for one second. Nola comes off as shrill and having no idea what she wants out of life. Her character is very unlikable--you wonder what Chris sees in her. The film really falls apart during the ending. Nola acts seriously deranged and Chris goes WAY too far. I also saw the resolution coming from a mile away. Also Allen has no feeling at all on how to shoot London. In his New York films you got a real sense of the city--not here in London. Also ALL the characters (with the exception of Nola) are nice--all the time. They're TOO nice. I didn't believe them for one second.<br/><br/>The acting really carries this film. Meyers is drop dead handsome and very good in his role. Goode and Mortimer are also good. I didn't like Johansson but that's mostly because of her character.<br/><br/>So I don't really like this film but I don't hate it. I was fairly entertained and it was OK.

","I don't believe this is a spoiler, but the plot appears to be exactly the same as the opera ""An American Tragedy"", commissioned by the Metropolitan Opera ten years ago and first performed last year. The first clue (unconscious?) was that the sound track is almost exclusively old opera recordings, ranging from the opening (the 2nd strophe of Donizetti's Una Furtiva Lagrima from ""Elixer of Love,"" to the uncannily well-matched dramatic denouement (Iago/Otello except from the Verdi opera). Perhaps this is all just coincidence; the opera is based upon a book about a true story that happened in upstate New York in the 1930s; the movie is set in present day London. But the analogies are consistent throughout. Is this a bad thing? I think not; it is masterfully done."
"barberoux","7","0","1","31 January 2006"," Good but miscast
","""Match Point"" was Woody Allen's best movie in years. That isn't saying much since I consider his recent attempts to be really bad. The story was similar to ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" where a married man has an affair that threatens his marriage. Performances by most of the major characters were very good. Brian Cox and Penelope Wilton were especially good in their roles. I also liked Matthew Goode and Emily Mortimer. Jonathan Rhys-Meyers was at times a bit over doing it but still his performance was believable. Unfortunately the only one I was disappointed with was Scarlett Johansson. I like her as an actress and I've enjoyed her in her other roles but I think she was miscast as the sexy femme fatale. She is gorgeous but she seems too intelligent to fit into the role as a troubled would-be actress. I think a more bimboish actress would have fit the role better. It isn't that she was bad just awkward in the role. Still the movie is worth seeing. Now for the problems of the movie. Mr. Allen typically portrays members of the upper middle class. His characters move through the rarefied sets like people from 1930's movies. They are impeccably dressed and often are portrayed having drinks. ""Match Point"" was no different but this time it was set in London instead of New York and the switch maybe helped since the characters were more familiar, at least if you watch Masterpiece Theater. I don't particularly like his characters. I find them to be spoiled and complaintive. There is no portrayal of people on the street. You know the street. The place between fashionable enclaves and expensive apartments, between trendy galleries and smart restaurants. The characters move through a world untouched by most of the moviegoers and suffer problems caused by their own selfishness. How are we, the movie watchers, supposed to feel any empathy with characters who are so removed from our lives. His movies aren't escapist fare where muscled jocks and hot babes raced around in expensive cars avoiding the law while pulling their latest caper. Mr. Allen's movie explore the humanness of life but lately they feel very removed from real life. I have a real problem caring what happens to the characters. They don't appeal nor resonate with me. Maybe Mr. Allen is portraying the group he is most familiar with. I think he needs to get out more."

","""Luck, bad if not good, will always be with us. But it has a way of favoring the intelligent and showing its back to the stupid."" John Dewey, Human Nature and Conduct.<br/><br/>For the first time since Crimes and Misdemeanors (1989), I can spy a theme in a Woody Allen film that unifies the work through social combat and thriller suspense. Match Point is a decidedly unfunny Woodman work, more a satire of Brits and Americans than even a discourse on the wages of sin. But overall, Allen emphasizes the randomness of the universe, a slick reprisal of his nihilistic notions that have always posited luck a bigger player in the universe than God.<br/><br/>Chris (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) a tennis coach in London, hooks up with an exceedingly wealthy family, marries into it, and carries on a dangerous liaison with his brother-in-law's fiancée, Nola (Scarlett Johansson), an American actress and less-accomplished social climber than Chris. Like Allen himself, Chris is adept at crashing social barriers (Where more challenging can that be than in England?) and remaining on top through whatever means are available. That similarity is the best I can do for those who want to see another Woody clone as the lead (Will Farrell's bumbler in Melinda, Melinda comes immediately to mind) because Allen is determined in this film to prove his thesis about luck, to hell with older-guy neuroses and Annie Hall-like sweethearts.<br/><br/>As an Anglophile, I was delighted with cinematography that crisply makes love to London without overwhelming the audience (One shot reminds me I still have to ride the ""Eye"" and another, from the window of Chris's new digs on the Thames, reminds me how expensive yet stunning the right apartment can be in a great world city). The high artistry of lens shows Allen doesn't need Manhattan to be a great director.<br/><br/>Match Point will remind some of the tragic triangle in Dreiser's American Tragedy (more to the point, George Stevens's adaptation in film, A Place in the Sun). For those who think Mr. Rhys-Myers is the newest Jude Law, the character resembles Patricia Highsmith's Ripley, whom Law played in The Talented Mr. Ripley. Die-hard Woody fans will relish the tossed off references to Dostoyevsky and Strindberg, both of which have thematic relevance for the former's interest in punishment ant the latter's attitude toward women. Beyond these signposts, Allen has hidden his persona in order to offer an entertaining lesson about the injustice of luck in a random universe."

","""Oh what a tangled web we weave, when first we practice to deceive"". Unless of course we get lucky, and the crime gets blamed on someone else.<br/><br/>I liked this movie if only because the baddie DIDN'T get his come-uppance, and we weren't required to sit through the requisite, predictable, Hollywood moralistic ending. My spouse said Match Point made him feel uncomfortable but couldn't quite put his finger on why. Maybe the lack of justice for the protagonist, maybe the squirm inducing look at the unpleasant and exclusive face of upper class England (and I'm saying that as Brit born and bred in London who spent the 3 worst years of her life at a posh English boarding school alongside many of these sort of people.) Actually the fact that the movie is set in London is mostly irrelevant; it could have been the upper classes of any nation  I suspect they all behave in much the same way. The movie explores themes of infidelity, hypocrisy, patronage and deception, and makes much of the rather uncomfortable idea that our fate in life is decided by sheer luck as much as anything, despite the fact that we all like to fool ourselves that we are really in control of our destiny.<br/><br/>Poor boy made good Chris, takes a job as a tennis coach at an exclusive club and finds himself drawn into the world of the landed rich. Marrying into a monied family, he gets accustomed to their style of living and is happy to accept the patronage of his father in law, rising in the family business, spending weekends at the country house, and generally worming his way into a world hitherto barred to him. Fine, except that he lusts after a woman other than his nice but naïve wife, and he's living a complete lie. Which will win out? An ignominious life with lusciously sexy but poor, screwed up and rather humourless Nola (gorgeous Scarlett Johansson who gets better in every movie she does), or the rich pickings of life with sweet but dull wifey Chloe, and the comfortable shelter and patronage of her family? The family admire Chris for having ""pulled himself up by his bootstraps"" and made something of himself from humble beginnings, but the truth is of course, that Chris is utterly amoral and totally weak, and when forced to make a choice, he opts to commit a terrible crime rather than give up his pleasant lifestyle.<br/><br/>The crime he commits is very far from perfect, in fact it's really amateur and botched, but by sheer good luck, he gets away with it. We hate to think that could happen, but in real life, maybe it does? I thought the performances reasonably good, but the casting choices rather strange. To be honest, I never could quite understand why either Chloe or Nola had the hots for Chris, who seemed to me to be rather too self absorbed and moody to attract a girl like Chloe, even before the great deception began, although he was certainly pretty to look at. Penelope Wilton seemed altogether too middle class to fit convincingly into the upper class lifestyle - although that may be my problem not hers, as I kept thinking of her performance in Shaun of the Dead - and Brian Cox (who is a wonderful actor) seemed a bit out of place as a dynamic businessman, looking more like a slightly crumpled engineer. Also not entirely convincing, Chris's meteoric rise to the top in the family firm. Britain is not quite the class riddled place it used to be; businesses there are run for the bottom line, just like they are anywhere else. You don't get to be a hotshot purely by connection to the boss these days, you actually have to be good at what you do and efficient, and we saw little evidence of that in Chris.<br/><br/>But altogether it was gripping and quite entertaining, and I wanted to see how Chris's dilemma was resolved. Certainly not a wasted night out."

","OK, so Woody Allen's worst is better than most people's best, but this is drivel. Perhaps he thinks posh Brits speak like Noel Coward characters, but apart from Matthew Goode as Tom and Emily Mortimer as Chloe, none of the main characters sounded like real people. Thank goodness for Ewen Bremner and James Nesbit's appearances in the final section - they managed to bring something vaguely normal to proceedings. I would have thought Woody Allen knows enough about London to know how not to make a film look like low-rent Richard Curtis, but perhaps 'Notting Hill' and 'Love Actually' are his source material. Would it have been too much trouble to employ someone to work as a language consultant to make the dialogue sound like something other than a bad translation of Ibsen? Was the ridiculous first encounter between Scarlet Johansson and Jonathan Rhys Meyers meant to sound like an an out-take from a 40s film noir? Perhaps, to use that favourite Hollywood catch-all excuse, Allen is being ironic. No, to use a truly British phrase, he is just being a bit rubbish."

"DICK STEEL","8","0","1","24 January 2006"," A Nutshell Review: Match Point
","Written and directed by Woody Allen, it surprisingly doesn't feel like what I would have expected from an Allen film, nor did I think that I had the patience to sit through one. However, this movie had converted me to wanna watch what Allen had to say in his earlier movies, not that this movie, in my opinion, is representative of the legendary director's style.<br/><br/>Match Point, through its trailers, looked like another Closer, with its look at one aspect of the modern spousal relationship - that of adultery and fidelity. However, Closer had a more sophisticated plot and relationship tangles amongst the chief characters, while Match Point took on a more straightforward approach. You could say it's like The Talented Mr. Ripley, with the similar focus on one man and his actions to deceive all around him.<br/><br/>Jonathan Rhys-Meyers plays Chris Wilton, an ex-tennis professional turned coach in England. He befriends one of his students Tom Hewett (Matthew Goode), and is somewhat smittened by his sister Chloe (Emily Mortimer). Being aimless and at a cross junction of his life, Chloe and her wealthy family presents Chris a possible path down a ready made high flying boardroom career and a stable family.<br/><br/>But of course, the fun and trouble comes in the form of Tom's fiancée Nola Rice, the one with the come-hither looks, played to scandalous perfection by Scarlett Johansson. It's a dilemma to men with the lack of self-control, as Chris goes all out to straddle two boats, and starts to question which is love, and which is lust.<br/><br/>One cannot expect to take the cake, and eat it as well. What was really neat is the presentation of the dilemma in a cold, calculated manner - do you want to continue being with your wife who endears herself to you, for all the material comfort enjoyed thus far and knowing that you have a known future laid out in front of you, or would you seek to give them all up to be with someone volatile, with an uncertain future for both when you seek to choose the mistress? This is possibly Allen's longest film to date, and it really feels that way. He takes the time to set up the entire premise, treating us to operas as the philandering Chris enjoys marital (and economic) bliss, while at the same time scheming to bed his mistress regularly on the side with loads of quickies. But the beauty of it is in the second act, where what exactly will go wrong in such an adulterous relationship, will.<br/><br/>The final act, while probably fitting for a man in extreme desperation, seemed a bit too Hollywood, despite this being done in collaboration with BBCFilms. It relied too much on Luck, just as the opening sequence of the determination of a match point when the ball hits the net. It's plainly simple - either side will mean you'll either win or lose.<br/><br/>Rhys-Meyers put on a convincing performance as the guilt-ridden, pleasure seeking Chris, with his loathing of being with his wife, and oh-so-eager puppy dog looks when being with his mistress. At least while she's still not that demanding. As I mentioned, Johansson played the sexy-come-hither chick to perfection, but somehow I felt that she lacked the ability to exude the emotional depth of a mistress who steps up her almost impossible to meet demands from a man who cannot decide, or have the strength to tell his wife of his affairs. Glenn Close she is not.<br/><br/>So be warned that this film might seem to plod on, with scenes that you might think could be excluded to tighten up the pace. However, do pay attention to the dialogue, as it often proves rewarding, and to those who are thinking of having affairs, think twice - the trouble when you happen to get yourself attached to an emotional wreck, could be tough to deal with. Luck may not be on your side."

"Chris Knipp","10","0","2","7 January 2006"," Game, set, match: Woody scores a big one
","""Match Point"" is elegant and peculiar. There are some classic conventions that are followed, but followed in Woody Allen's own ways. It has three main elements: social climbing, adultery, and crime, all in a posh English setting that plays two arrivistes, an American girl, a would-be actress, Nola Rice (Scarlett Johansson) and an Irish boy, fading (but still young) tennis star Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) against a rich London family, the Hewitts. When everything falls into the boy's lap -- wealth, position, a doting wife-- and against the odds he is immediately adored by the family patriarch, Alec Hewett (Brian Cox), Chris is nonetheless compelled from first opportunity to pursue the American girl. To begin with she is taboo because she's his brother-in-law to be Tom Hewett's fiancée; then she is taboo because Tom has let her go and she is effectively banished from the family, which has accepted Chris as the partner for Tom's sister Chloe (Emily Mortimer). Chris's relationship with Nola stands to ruin everything, yet he can't resist it.<br/><br/>Allen follows conventions that are expedient rather than realistic. It all happens so quickly: Chris is hired as tennis pro at a fashionable club. After a lesson from him, the tall, patrician Tom Hewitt invites Chris to the family box at the opera. He is immediately admired by Chloe, and they begin going out together. Alec likes Chris, and approves him for Chloe, so he's given a good post at one of Alec's firms. He's soon offered a chance at, and gets, a very high position at the firm with perks, car, and driver. He and Chloe take an enormous flat overlooking the Thames paid for by Alec.<br/><br/>When this rapid rise is barely beginning Chris meets Nola because she's with Tom. Johannson and Rhys-Meyers are given screen-devouring closeups as in a private moment Chris comes on strong to Nola. Her warnings and demurrals only whet his appetite. As the story is smoothly and rapidly filled in, nothing really matters for the movie's progress so long as Chloe is doting, Alec nurturing, Tom debonair, and the family spreads splendid. The important thing is that Rhys-Meyers and Johannson be strong and intense, that their personalities seem vivid and their chemistry convincing. It works. The two actors have the same mocking intensity; they even have the same lips. They're attractive misfits, perfectly cast. You can believe they'd be drawn tightly together. These two people aren't dolls in a Woody Allen movie. They're alive.<br/><br/>Rhys-Meyers, who has played wicked or androgynous roles (but also the decent coach in ""Bend It Like Beckham"" and George Osborne in ""Vanity Fair""), gets to be here something more like what perhaps he originally was in life: an ambitious young man of talent from a poor Irish family. Johansson, who has a bold, ironic presence, is fine in the early scenes when she is simply saying no in a way that can only inflame an eager young man, and then acquiescing with growing passion in the forbidden affair. The scenes between the two may not be the world's hottest but they sparkle. It's only later when Johansson has to be more and more needy and doting that she turns shrill and ordinary. But by that time the plot has wound so tight it may not matter.<br/><br/>Chris marries Chloe. Tom also marries someone more approved by his mother (same cleric, church, and shot). Chloe wants children from Chris as soon as possible, but she can't get pregnant. This effort becomes increasingly tedious and mechanical for Chris as his sexual affair heats up with Nola, newly returned to London from a spell in America after the break with Tom and many failed auditions. Though she's brazen and sassy with Chris, she wilts when she tries out for a part. It's a classic film convention that every setting is beyond nice, and so somehow Nola on return has found a terrific flat though in a rather dicey neighborhood. This is as far as we can go except to say that the final sequences include not only references to Greek tragedy but Hitchcockian cross-cutting to create suspense, and a police procedural segment that moves rapidly. Yes, there have been repeated references to the role of chance in life and somebody does read ""Crime and Punishment."" The ending makes Chris not a little like Patricia Highsmith's Tom Ripley, but also has links with Dreiser. Come to think of it, the whole setup suggests Henry James. The look of the scenes is bright and beautiful. The use of Caruso arias as background music works remarkably well, and idiosyncratically, to suggest illicit (""operatic"") passion, and toward the end, to provide a sense of near-hysterical tension.<br/><br/>""Match Point"" isn't without flaws. Ms. Johannson's unfortunate shrillness toward the end has been mentioned. Besides that, the early section is flatly expository. We can see the wheels turning, even if they're well oiled. The middle section, whose adultery becomes a bit too sweaty for this glamorous exercise in nihilism, is more tiring than farcical. The last part is thrilling, but almost seems spliced on from another more suspenseful movie. Nonetheless because of lively acting and swift pacing it all works, and works surprisingly well. Though it may be taken as serious -- Match Point is hardly a comedy -- this new Woody Allen movie, despite plot similarities to some earlier Allen oeuvres, notably Crimes and Misdemeanors, indeed is a bright new departure after a long spell of tedium from the Manhattan auteur. It may be thought-provoking, but before anything else it's engaging, exciting, and fun. One of the year's best American films."

","While many hoped that changing genres and filming outside of New York City would re-energise Allen, Match Point fails to live up to expectations.<br/><br/>Jonathan Rhys-Meyers plays Chris, a tennis-pro who proves to be an amoral narcissist, doing terrible things to retain his wealth. He is a man with only desires, obsessions and hollow passion, and his silent anguish is one of the few highlights of the film.<br/><br/>To say that the film gets off to a slow start would be an unforgivable understatement - for best part of the first hour Allen tortures the silently suffering audience with his view of upper-class England. The dialogue is just awful - it made me want to get up and leave after 10 minutes. I sat with my hand over my mouth, astounded that the production company allowed this to be released. It is shocking, and ruined the whole film for me. I suppose it is a result of the combination of very poor scripting and amateur delivery, especially on the part of Jonathan Rhys-Meyers. Even veteran actors such as James Nesbitt (playing a small part as Detective Banner) cannot make such a limp script come to life.<br/><br/>The second half of the film brings some welcome respite as the pace quickens and suspense builds - Jonathan Rhys-Meyers performs much better when he doesn't have to open his mouth! Emily Mortimer plays her part as Chloe (Chris's wife) admirably, but Scarlett Johansson is fails to impress. The final few twists of the story bring it alive, and the ending is really the high point of the film. Nevertheless, the dialogue consigns Allen's latest offering to a lowly 5/10."
"Martina_Helene","6","0","5","16 January 2006"," Needed a test audience.....
","You know how in some movies, there is a test audience, and sometimes if the audience really dislikes one part of the movie, the writers and editors change it? For, example, in American Beauty, the original ending was that the next door neighbor boy got taken away in a police car for the murder. But the test audience really hated it, so they changed the ending.<br/><br/>Match Point needed a test ending for the entire second half of the movie. The first half of the movie was a romantic drama, about scum bag people, basically. The lead was such a liar and a scum, he makes the combination of Jude Law and Clive Owen's characters in Closer look like saints. Especially with the ending and the second half of the movie. It was beyond my comprehension to see the motivation and this buried evil person inside Rhys Meyers' character, to have killed his pregnant lover and her neighbor in order to make it look like a robbery. And most of all get away with it. But, hey, look at Scott Peterson, right?<br/><br/>Usually, in movies there's this redeeming character(s) to make the bad characters even out. Not, in Match Point. Johannason's character was basically a stupid b*tch, Rhys Meyers' wife was so incredibly annoying I don't know how he couldn't have strangled her. The parents were social climbers and so self involved it was ridiculous. The brother had to be the least immoral character in all, even though he left his fiancé for another lover. But, hey I guess that's better than marrying just for money, especially in Rhys Meyers' case right?<br/><br/>There were a few acceptable things in this movie, that did make it bearable and even a bit likable, but I definitely wouldn't go as far as saying this movie is a movie I love to hate. I will not be watching it a second time.<br/><br/>The acting was exceptional. Scarlett Johannason was really great, she's such a vision, she's so good to watch. Very understated, I can't think of a movie where I have seen someone act drunk so on target. I thought two of the funniest parts of the movie, was when she says ""I'm just a small town girl from Colorado."" Sorry, Scarlett, even with your acting skills that's hard to believe. And when she said ""My career hasn't gone exactly as planned."" I'm sure Scarlett had no idea that she's be a 21 year old legend.<br/><br/>The chemistry was there, and the tension. The cinematography was nice, especially because London and the countryside are so lovely.<br/><br/>I was so built up for this movie, so excited, was disappointed and felt almost nauseas after watching it. Basicially, I thought this movie was good, but I would NOT recommend it."
"ThurstonHunger","7","0","5","14 January 2006"," ""Match Point"" pros and cons
","I am inclined to say, see this when it comes out on video, but if that's the case you should really try to avoid any commentary about the film in the papers, on TV, among friends and of course herein.<br/><br/>Spoilers below so please stop reading if you've not already seen the film. Indeed I think most of my huff and puffery here at IMDb are meant for reading after seeing the films that I rate a 6 or higher. And this gets a 7/10 for me.<br/><br/>Of course Die-hard Woody fans like my wife and I will see this film no matter what... I should say I am decidedly *not* in the cramped camp who feel that Woody is done, I enjoyed at least one whole Melinda and about half of the other. I also found ""Small Time Crooks"" sweet enough to share with a grandparents and/or grandkids<br/><br/>So I don't think Woody is done by any chance. Nor am I (yet) the moralizing hypocrite who will denounce him for actions outside the celluloid frame. <br/><br/>Speaking of moralizing hypocrites...<br/><br/>...how many successful, septuagenarians do you think are so willing to contemplate the role of luck's dice in their paradise? I'd sure like to meet the other two. How many, even tangentially, will approach how the rich devour and destroy the poor?<br/><br/>Well the latter might be a bit of a stretch here, though the patriarch does prophesy that he'll make a shooter out of his young post-proletarian protégé. Anyways, clearly the meditation on luck is vital to this film. <br/><br/>If I have a complaint it's that the first 3/4 of the film is doggedly straight-forward, and sort of obvious. Much like a man pursuing a potential affair, there is nothing of the interesting reverse pursuit that I would have welcomed. <br/><br/>I thought the film could have used more overlapping subplots for distraction, instead of the single-mindedness on display. All we really need is the ping-pong scene, a few cloying moments with Chloe, a less cringeful version of the Motorcyle Diaries scene and then the courtside confession and rejection of that dirty Rice. Isn't all the rice in NoLa, dirty?? <br/><br/>And then the affair, this needs to have a lot of footage to draw us into the discretion. Make us the silent partner to their extra-marital menage, still I thought there was more than enough of this. At least we did see Chris occasionally at work (something that doesn't happen enough in these films of the rich and richer).<br/><br/>Then there's the agonizingly long, he'll-never-leave-her scenes, and the telegraphed pregnancy. It almost seems like I didn't enjoy the film, and up until this point I did, but I was not drawn deeply into it. Then the passion is gone, and the crime remains (which even without Scott and Laci Peterson would have bugged me, but as we've been pumped opera all along, I knew the lover had to die).<br/><br/>Only after the little deaths and the big death did I feel my interest piqued. I actually thought Rhys-Meyers did a pretty formidable job through-out. Polite and internalizing, an audiences's friend. Scarlet's A for acting came not in the adultery, nor her later languishing anguish but for that scene in the bar. Her work with her eyes, the sense of her letting the alcohol let him think he could push his agenda was really well done in her post-screen test vulnerableness. This is the reverse pursuit, the two in the tango.<br/><br/>I thought Allen's best work came with the deceptive scene at the crime station. A nice piece of misdirection, with Chris volunteering a little too much after his first feint of innocence. I think that scene helped to point the luck arrow in a different direction than it would turn out. Or did it?<br/><br/>Ultimately this is a film that puts a lot off towards the payoff, but I hung in there in part because of some gorgeous footage (how can people who champion Woody's love of Manhattan and its milestones take issue with his love of London's landmarks??). <br/><br/>Other things helped me along; Woody's use of music, notably opera which I'm not expert on, was key. The theme played whenever Nola appears is later finally allowed to go a bit further, when things go to far. As always great casting in smaller roles (I saw more help for Juliet Taylor this time around). Penelope Wilton (seems often the last name of a key actor winds as one of the names in the film) as the meddlesome mother, with or without G&T injection. Matthew Goode was dandy as a Mommy's dandy. And Ewen Bremner was greet.<br/><br/>But Woody is even better when mortality is on the line. When Woody summons the ghosts of the deceased to confront our tennis pro turned con, that scene complete with Chris spilling wine/blood and trying to cleanse himself was compelling. I immediately wanted to see it again, to hear it again. That scene also contains a twist to help direct or misdirect us. <br/><br/>In all, worth watching, with some patience to get to the ending. Hmmm from the few operas I've seen, could that be a bit of the rule there as well. In this case, I really thought that the ends were a reward to the earlier meanderings, not exactly how I feel about means and ends in ""Match Point"" or in general."
"cwrdlylyn","6","0","9","11 January 2006"," MATCH POINT : An Awful Performance From Rhys-Meyers Damages The Entire Film...
","MATCH POINT <br/><br/>As such an avid film fanatic, it's amazing that it's taken me this long to ever see a Woody Allen film in it's entirety (sp?). Aside from bits and pieces of ALICE, ANNIE HALL, and DECONSTRUCTING HARRY I have never seen Allen's work. Odd that the first film of his I see, MATCH POINT, is deemed as a big change of pace for him.<br/><br/>The film is a very elegantly crafted romantic sex-thriller. It is rich with analogies and symbolism that are obvious enough for the audience to pick up on, but not overtly blatant. The symbolism/message of that first tennis match is well maintained throughout the film with a subtle, gleaning style well managed by Allen.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the concept in the script, and thought that London was filmed beautifully. Allen made brilliant use of the scenery, with London coming across as a sophisticated New York.<br/><br/>However, a main weakness in this film is the disappointing performance of it's leading actor, Jonathan Rhys-Meyers. A charismatic and talented star who has exhibited potential in his previous films... Rhys-Meyers comes up noticeably short here. His performance is monotone, and all surface. He plays Chris, an ex pro-tennis player who is now entering high society through his relationship with Chloe (Emily Mortimer). However, as he becomes more and more comfortable living the comfortable life, he becomes less and less fulfilled by marriage. He seeks out a passionate affair with Nola Rice (Scarlett Johansen) and struggles to continue getting everything he wants.<br/><br/>Though we see that he is torn between a comfortable/luxurious life and the passionate one he has on the side, Rhys-Meyers does little to emphasize this. He seduces when he needs to seduce, he cries when he needs to cry, and he yells when he needs to yell. But I never noticed a constant tone of a man torn and tormented by his own greed. It just seemed Meyers didn't bring enough to the table here. The performance is especially terrible in the opening scenes. This is where Rhys-Meyers has the chance to establish the man Chris is aside from all the situations he is in later in the film... but Meyers delivers nothing but monotone and empty lines.<br/><br/>Thankfully the film has some life pumped into it every time it's leading females are on-screen. MATCH POINT features strong performances from Emily Mortimer and Scarlett Johansenn as the two sides of womanhood that men truly desire... comfort and mystery. Mortimer's Chloe is a less explosive role, b/c she's never given much to react to. However, Mortimer fills her with an ignorant optimism and love that remains endearing. She is subtly suspicious when the affair is obvious, but realistically lied to by a conniving husband.<br/><br/>Johannsen has received most of the acclaim and buzz surrounding MATCH POINT... and it is not entirely unwarranted. She energizes the screen every time she appears (thankfully keeping the audience interested while Meyer's stands there)... and her sexual allure has never been more compelling. She also manages to keep Nola entirely sympathetic. Johannsen's first few scenes had me wary, and I found her initial deliveries to be as monotone as Meyers... however, from the moment Nola has a few drinks with Chris after a failed audition, Johannsen is spot on.<br/><br/>Overall, it's an intriguing film... and it kept me interested for it's 2 hour running time. However, it suffers from an awful leading performance, some plot holes in it's conclusion, and a truly unlikeable and despicable male lead. Perhaps Chris could have been a more sympathetic and tolerable character had he been played by an actor with more talent... but as is, I never once liked the character of Chris. As a matter of fact, I loathed him. My word of choice upon leaving the theatre was ""douchebag""... and neither Allen's writing or Rhys-Meyer's performance was able to elevate the character.<br/><br/>For me, MATCH POINT is an interesting film with a terribly handled leading male... and in the end, though the film is interesting, it is far from perfect. I left in a bad mood, and I don't think that was completely necessary. Some additional balancing of Chris' motivations from a directorial viewpoint (Woody Allen) and recasting Chris (kick Rhys-Meyers to the curb on this one)... and MATCH POINT could have been great. As is...<br/><br/>... C- ..."
