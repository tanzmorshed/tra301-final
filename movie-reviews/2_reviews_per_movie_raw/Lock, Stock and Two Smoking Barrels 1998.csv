"CriticNick","10","421","489","18 December 1999"," Seriously addictive movie - The most balanced movie ever made?
","The first time I saw this movie I had difficulty in understanding a lot of the dialogue not just because of the weird accent, but because the actors spoke so damn fast.  But despite this I became literally addicted to it. To begin with my wife got pretty annoyed because any other movie we rented would be ejected after about 20 minutes of viewing and in would go LS&2SB. Now she is hooked as well.<br/><br/>I have lost count of the number of times I have seen LS&2SB and still cannot put my finger on why I find this movie so good to watch.  I suppose the most obvious feature of this movie is that it is beautifully balanced between being serious and humorous at the same time.  The characters are two-dimensional.  The villains are menacing, and yet they are made to look like idiots, and the good guys think they are so smart yet keep getting the rug pulled from under them.  They are all projected as 'cool' yet the situation is always out of their control.  Maybe it could be called a satire on true life.<br/><br/>The style of this movie is unique, full stop.  I cannot think of any movie that can be compared to LS&2SB.  Quite a few people say that the style is a mix of 'Pulp Fiction', 'Goodfellas', 'Trainspotting' and 'Reservoir Dogs', but I think that you would make that kind of description only if you are really desperate to match LS&2SB to something.<br/><br/>The best description I can think of is 'MTV does a crime comedy', and I honestly don't think there is anything wrong with that.  Like music videos, it is all non-stop movement and sound.  Something is always happening but unlike music videos, not without reason.<br/><br/>The humor is incredibly sharp yet 'as a matter of fact'.  No one is really trying to be extraordinarily funny, but again it is the balance between being menacingly serious and funny that the humor really flies at you. I think that it is for this reason that a few people are really disappointed with LS&2SB.  If you are expecting a 'belly laugh Leslie Nielson, Jim Carrey, Steve Martin, typecasted' type all out comedy, or a serious 'Al Pacino, Andy Garcia, DeNiro typecasted crime thriller, you will find this movie a big let down.<br/><br/>My favorite characters are Rory Breaker (Vas Blackwood) and Big Chris (Vinnie Jones) mainly because their two dimensional over-the-top characters are the most obvious.  Big Chris takes his son with him debt collecting, and while he beats up someone who owes chastises him for swearing in front of his son and Rory Breaker is the most idiotic drug-lord you could come up with.<br/><br/>I haven't even mentioned the excellent and unique camerawork, speaker blowing soundtrack, beautifully threaded plot, perfect ending and the grittiest visuals I've seen.  You wont see any reflective glass laden sky scrapers here, or 'over head city shots', or incredible special effects. This movie has actors I have never heard of, dialogues that you have to rewind and replay to understand, buildings that look as though they have been condemned for demolition, cars that wouldn't even be seen in our scrap yards, has probably been made with a budget that most movies in Hollywood use for make-up alone, has no love scenes, or romance or complex relationships, no Oscar-worthy performances, and yet is perfect entertainment.<br/><br/>Where our movies normally rely on budgets, this movie works on human talent alone.<br/><br/>If any movie deserves a 10 out of 10, then this is it.<br/><br/>'And there's one more thing...............it's been emotional'"
"doktor d","Null","160","186","19 February 2003"," The essence of late 90's cinema -- hip, highly stylized, VISUAL
","Guy Ritchie's hip, highly stylized 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' is a truly remarkable film, not only for its appropriately pyrotechnic camera work, but also for its seemingly flawless, puzzle-perfect script/screenplay. While the picture's main focus is on a group of lads who invest money in a high-stakes, rigged card game and lose, the broader story concerns approximately eight different groups of criminals whose paths cross (more> than once, in some cases) during various illegal pursuits: money, guns, drugs, even revenge. The film is quite violent, both on and off screen, but it's also uniformly humorous throughout. It's important to note that the four central characters (a cook, a card sharp, and a couple of guys who sell ""discounted"" items) are interested only in acquiring the money to pay off their enormous debt; they kill no one. The same applies to the laid-back college boys who ""grow copious amounts of ganja"".<br/><br/> The cast is comprised of mostly young, veteran, male actors. In fact, the only female in the film doesn't even speak, though she handles a machine gun fairly well. Sting appears briefly in several scenes as a bar-owning father figure. While his secondary performance is solid, as usual, it is also unmemorable. The soundtrack is first-rate, from the 60's hits of James Brown to the contemporary beats of London's underground. The groovy, pulsating music and lyrics are often succinctly synchronized with the action and dialogue in the film, creating a theatrical rhythm that is fairly uncommon in cinema (from any period).<br/><br/> Critics and audiences over the years have often dismissed stylized camera work as pretentious and unnecessary, stating that it detracts from the story, bogs it down, or pads it; however, the film medium has the luxury of actually ""displaying"" a story for its audience, unlike the written word alone. It's what the medium is all about -- it's VISUAL. Hence, one of the reasons a filmmaker chooses such visual displays is to ""brand"" his or her work, in the same way as writers like Cummings, Hemingway or Joyce did with their medium. It's hard to imagine a cinema without Hitchcock, Kubrick, or Scorsese to represent it. To this end, Ritchie has taken his first step in establishing his own brand. His energetic, ultra-contemporary camera work incorporates (through a fresh perspective) such devices as slow motion, fast motion, and freeze-frame coupled with narration. It is at times reminiscent of (and actually expands upon) Martin Scorsese's patented visual stylistics and camera movements, like those found in 'Mean Streets' and 'Goodfellas'. But the similarities with Scorsese's work end there.<br/><br/> Critics' endless comparisons of Ritchie's film with the works of Quentin Tarantino and Danny Boyle's 'Trainspotting' stand mostly unwarranted, as these comparisons take away from the inventiveness and originality of 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels'. Ritchie's film is a much more involved, complex, layered work than the aforementioned comparisons. While Tarantino's films are very strong on dialogue, screenplay, and editing, they often lack creative camera work and direction. Boyle's 'Trainspotting' does have a resembling ""feel"" to 'LS&TSB', but aside from its Great Britain origins, there really is no need for comparison. 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' is essential viewing."
"Quag7","10","207","255","1 March 2002"," Have a butchers...
","I was a total and complete sucker for this film.<br/><br/>If I were to write and direct a movie about gangsters or crime, this would be it.  I wouldn't change one damn thing.  Not a thing.  Everything in this film was, to my eye, perfect - casting, the camerawork, the excellent dialogue (""It's been emotional."")<br/><br/>Now I don't have much to compare this to, and I've heard some criticism that it basically draws quite heavily from older British crime dramas.  I've got a bunch of these on my queue to rent, but I doubt you could make a crime film better than this.<br/><br/>This film oozes with style, class, dark humor, plot twists and turns, and doesn't drag one bit.  The casting and characterization is perfect, and Ritchie isn't afraid to move the cameras around; no pretense is really made here at ""realism"" - Ritchie doesn't mask the fact that it's a film and he runs with it.<br/><br/>I really don't think of myself as easily impressed, and I have seen a hell of a lot of films in my time, but this one instantly made my Top 10 after only a single viewing.  Yes, I'm raving about it, and while it may not be ""spiritually enriching"" or contain any deep sociological content (which I actually do look for in films), somehow it still scores as one hell of a film; memorable and entertaining, and stands up well to multiple viewings.<br/><br/>I am a bit dismayed to see some of the marketing of this film comparing it to other things like Quentin Tarantino films or Trainspotting.  It really does it a disservice because this film really is its own phenomenon and stands on its own two feet; if anything it is similar to  Trainspotting and Tarantino films only because it actually has its own bold style.<br/><br/>Can't recommend it enough."
"ExtraCrispy-2","Null","75","92","15 February 2000"," Comedy Noir well done
","I'm not sure whether to call this a black comedy or a comedy-noir. The story is about four working class lads who have each managed to save up 25,000 pounds to spot their card-shark friend for a high-stakes poker game with ""Hatchet"" Harry, the local gangster.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Harry's game is rigged and the four end up owing Harry half a million pounds, with just one week to come up with the cash. What ensues is a set of schemes, counter-schemes, rip-offs, and bad/good luck that demand you pay attention. On several occasions I had to pause the video just to take stock of which gang was planning what.<br/><br/>The final thirty minutes of the film, as the plots all collide and overlap, turn set-piece shoot outs into comedic punchlines.  The comedy is driven by exploding our expectations of what are otherwise pretty standard scenes from the film-noir genre.<br/><br/>The acting is strong and the script very tight. Although I am not normally a fan of voice overs, this one informs without spoiling the action. And I liked the use of the slow-motion to disrupt the action and keep me paying attention.<br/><br/>While this film may not be for everyone, if you enjoy a darker pallette, this may be right up your alley."
"s-dewitt","10","10","10","13 October 2004"," Brilliant
","I have watched this film countless times and it is always funny, entertaining and visually appealing. It combines a great story (actually about 8 stories), lush cinematography (a personal must have), and superb dialog. When I first saw it, I thought it was a good rip-off of pulp fiction (a common theme on the message boards), but later you come to realize that this simply is not the case. IMO, it is much more like ""The Usual Suspects"", another great film.<br/><br/>The visual appeal puts it in my top three list for this (along with The Good, The Bad and The Ugly, and Das Boot).<br/><br/>There is no weak character - everyone is perfect and fits into place and has their own role in the whole story. But my personal favorite is Rory Breaker. He manages menacing and humorous at the same time in perfect combination.<br/><br/>Favorite lines (from Rory Breaker) ""If you hold back anything, I'll kill ya. If you bend the truth or I think your bending the truth, I'll kill ya. If you forget anything I'll kill ya. In fact, you're gonna have to work very hard to stay alive, Nick. Now do you understand everything I've said? Because if you don't, I'll kill ya."""

","LOCK STOCK AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS ( rating, * * * * out of 5 )<br/><br/>Four lesser thieves from the East End of London find themselves dangerously in debt to a local smut peddler - the result of a fixed poker game. The consequence being that until they repay the money owed, each one will lose a finger for each day the payment is late.<br/><br/>While trying to figure their desperate predicament, they overhear their gangster neighbors setting up a score from some slumberous marijuana dealers and decide that knocking over the neighbours is their only way out.<br/><br/>After the triumphant thievery, they discover that the pot belongs to the same menacing individual they want to fence it through - a black psychopath whose history reads like the Anti-Christ's resume. Enter a miscellany of desperadoes and hoodlums who target our four lads.<br/><br/>For the first time since 'Pulp Fiction', a movie comes along that breaks the shackles of tedious cloning. This film is entertaining and moves along at a cracking pace. Guy Ritchie's script is a tapestry of well-written characters, sharp dialogue that says what needs to be said and leaves the unsaid as food for thought, and a mesh of sub-plots that interlace together with imagination and expertise.<br/><br/>His direction is crisp and inventive allowing the cast of eccentric characters to move about freely while maintaining that erratic edge. In this slick piece of film making, Guy Ritchie denies hackneyed Hollywood trends by scripting no true good-guys just varying degrees of bad ones.<br/><br/>This is a terrific movie. It is violent but not extreme considering the subject matter and cast of cut-throat characters. The language is strong and the humor is black where you'll find yourself belly laughing at the brutal misfortune of others. If this makes you uncomfortable, then this film is not for you. It is also not for those who have been trained by television sit-coms to laugh on cue.<br/><br/>Broadminds are required to enjoy this fine British film where it will definitely add some zing to your day. So stick your tongues firmly in your cheeks and hop on the thrill a minute ride that is 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels'."

","You all may know the story at how Tom Cruise saw this movie at a screening in London, and afterwards said, ""This movie rocks.""  Whatever you may think of Mr. Cruise, I happen to agree after watching this film.  Although I had trouble following the story at times, it was a lot of fun, and Ritchie managed to juggle all the characters around and keep me interested and compelled to watch.  I also didn't have any trouble understanding what the characters were saying, and I think those who blind themselves to films like this by saying, ""Oh, I can't understand them"" lack patience.  I also liked all the actors, particularly, of course Lenny McLean and Vinnie Jones(one of my few complaints is I would have liked to see more of them in the film). And for a film which feels violent, there's surprisingly little actual violence, which is refreshing.  Overall, not a particularly deep film, but a lot of fun."
"Flagrant-Baronessa","8","10","11","29 June 2006"," Watch this with subtitles, if you can
","Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels features a lot of local slang and Cockney accents and, while it is far from impossible to comprehend, you will be doing yourself a favour if you follow the dialogue in subtitles. In fact, even the unbearably annoying 'hard-of-hearing' option is welcomed. It follows a group of four very ""working class"" blokes as they try to help their friend Eddie (Nick Moran) get out of an enormous debt he amassed one night, playing high-roller with a local gang-boss that cheated. The lads resort to illegal ways to get the money, like ripping off their pot-selling next-door neighbours.<br/><br/>This is a really excellent filmentertaining; funny, exciting, and extremely realistic. The style is gorgeous. In fact, I have nothing bad at all to say about it except that it may not be everyone's cup of tea. You also have to be patient with it. That may have been my problem the first time I saw it because I can remember mixing up quite a few people when not paying attention.. Still, the realism of the situations make up for its occasionally slow pace and dialogue-driven plot. For instance, none of these working-class guys know how to handle a gun when they need to, and the result is hilarious. They're not goofy by any means, but they're just normal guys that struggle with the life of crime that they are forced to turn to in order to repay Eddie's debt. Also note the fantastic use of ""I Wanna Be Your Dog"" by The Stooges. 8/10"

"Chrysanthepop","Null","19","24","11 May 2008"," ''And there's one more thing...it's been emotional' says one of the Slickest 'Gangster' flicks ever!
","'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' is one of those films that I can watch x number of times and still enjoy it as much as I did in the first viewing. This is pretty much what an action gangster flick should be like. It has all the required ingredients. The action, humour, drama and suspense balance extremely well. Ritchie's writing and direction are excellent as not only does the film keep one at the edge of his/her seat but the characters (including minor ones) are rich. They're over-the-top but that only works for the film. While the bad guys think they're powerful and all, they're actually portrayed as dumb and the good guys think they're clever and have all the answers to their problems when they're actually not so bright. The characters are portrayed as cool yet they end up getting caught in a mess. The film too is somewhat satirical as it reflects a part of life e.g. the closeness between the four friends, the son following the father's (Big Chris's) footsteps. The humour is mostly dark with sharp, witty and funny dialogues and hilarious situations. It all seems a 'natural' part of the story. Shot in DV, the camera-work and use of music is very effective. The film has a raw and gritty look yet the execution of it makes it very stylish. Richie uses the same style in 'Snatch'. He should become an auteur and make more movies of this kind as it is clearly his fort (remember his disastrous attempt at romance with 'Swept Away'?). All the actors, whether it's Jason Flemyng, Dexter Fletcher, Nick Moran, Jason Statham or more recognized faces like Vinnie Jones and Sting, seem to naturally fit their parts. 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' is one of the coolest 'gangster' flicks. A must watch to those who love action films that have both substance and entertainment."

","If this film had been dubbed for American viewers, (even if it would have lost the magic of the cockney accent), not one person from the States would have said this wasn't a really good film. I didn't even understand most of the dialogues, but the weirdness of the characters and of what they did was really funny.  Not hysterically funny, but Funny! The mixture of comedy and violence was the thing that most amused me.  The story itself isn't of the most original, but surely efficacious. The photography and the soundtrack were also brilliant and to finish, I saw Pulp Fiction, I loved it, but after seeing LS&2SM I was too busy thinking over and over how much I liked it for noticing a whatsoever similarity with PF. 10 out of 10 is a bit too much but  9/10 definitely isn't!

","This is one seriously funny movie. I've probably seen it close to 10 times and it hasn't gotten old yet. Guy Ritchie brings us a hilarious look into the London criminal underground in one of his earliest features. The story revolves around four friends who become indebted to the local crime lord after a card game goes horribly wrong. The humor in this movie is sharp and fast-paced. At times, it becomes a little hard to keep up with the thick British accents and the cockney rhyming slang but overall, it doesn't detract from the movie. The movie keeps you guessing as to the outcome when the story becomes complex with multiple lies and double-crosses but the ending satisfies.<br/><br/>This film marks the debuts of two of England's coolest new actors: Jason Statham (who went on to do 'Transporter', among other movies) and Vinnie Jones (now a familiar cinema tough guy). Jones is especially good as Big Chris, debt collector/family man. The majority of the cast aren't common faces in America (aside from Sting) but they all have the charisma to keep the audience interested. Another plus is the film's soundtrack, ranging from reggae to 70's soul. It adds to the movie's already laid-back feel.<br/><br/>Everyone I've seen the movie with enjoys it (once they get past the thick accents, anyway) so I can say with confidence this is a fun movie. I recommend it to anyone looking for a good comedy and I feel this movie's humor hits more often than it misses. I'd recommend giving this movie a chance at least once and I don't think you'd be disappointed."
"poolandrews","9","14","18","5 March 2008"," Very funny, very witty & very excellent British crime caper.
","Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is set in London where four close friends Eddie (Nick Moran), Bacon (Jason Statham), Tom (Jason Flemying) & Soap (Dezter Fletcher) all chip in £25,000 to make up the £100,000 entrance fee to a big high stakes poker game held by hard as nails villain & crime boss 'Hatchet' Harry Lonsdale (P.H. Moriarty). Eddie is an expert poker player & figures he can make each of them a clear £100,00 profit, if they play their cards right (ha!). Unfortunately 'Hatchet' Harry doesn't like losing & cheats, Eddie not only loses the £100,000 but actually ends up owing 'Hatchet' Harry £500,000 after borrowing it from him to continue in the game. 'Hatchet' Harry is not the sort of person you owe money to, Eddie & his friends must find a way to raise a half a million pounds in the next four days or start losing their fingers...<br/><br/>This English production was written & directed by Guy Ritchie & has already deservedly reached pretty much classic status, in fact it still resides in the IMDb's top 250 films list over ten years since it was originally released & for me it throughly deserves to be there. It's just a wonderfully entertaining, witty, funny, clever British crime caper with bags of personality & at the time it was made originality although in the ten years since it was released many a British film has ripped it off trying to recreate it's success. There are a few things which make Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels so brilliant. First it's just so funny, I have seen Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels several times now & I laugh my head off every time, the really funny dialogue, the spot on performances, the hilarious one liners, the use of funny cockney rhyming slang & the things which happen along with the often bizarre situations the character's find themselves in means there isn't a scene that goes by where something funny doesn't happen or there isn't some instantly quotable insult or one liner. Secondly the character's are great, they have real depth & the good guy's are very likable so you root for them while the bad guy's are real nasty pieces of work so as a consequence you don't root for them, just the way it should be. Then there's the plot which at the time was fresh, new, original, clever, witty, full of great twists & turns & there's certainly plenty going on which rather improbably all come together at the end in a somewhat far fetched way but when a film is as entertaining, clever & downright funny as Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels you just tend to go with it. A brilliantly funny British comedy crime caper, one of my favourite films ever & it's as simple & straight forward as that.<br/><br/>Director Ritchie really injects some style, pace & energy into the film with various tricks which never become gimmicky or intrusive & only help tell a brilliantly story with style, originality & panache. Not only did Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels revolutionise the British crime caper genre with it's story telling but it has also influenced plenty of films since with it's slick editing & visual techniques. There's a fantastic soundtrack too, I really can't think of one bad thing to say about Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels which is pretty high praise in itself as I am not easily pleased. There's a fair amount of violence but nothing overly graphic & a lot of it is played for laughs as is the bad language & profanity of which there is a lot. In fact I don't there is a single scene which doesn't involve the use of strong language at some point.<br/><br/>According to the IMDb Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels had a budget of about £960,000 which is simply amazing, a film this good & this stylish for less than a million? Shot on location in & around London Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels were the film debuts of both ex footballer Vinnie Jones & Jason Statham who have both done very well off the back of it. During the final credits the film is dedicated to ex bare knuckle fighter Lenny McClean who played Barry the Baptist & who died of cancer shortly before the film premiered. The acting is great from all involved, there's boyish charm to downright menacing criminal unpleasantness.<br/><br/>Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is a brilliantly funny, witty, clever & entertaining British crime caper that is a true genre great & one of my own personal favourite films ever. Ritchie followed Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels up with the equally brilliant British crime caper Snatch (2000) a couple of years later."

","After being in love with ""Snatch"", my cousin and I began to look out for this film and finally we saw it on a bootleg of the imported DVD. That was about 3 or 4 years ago and the last year I saw for the very first time the Region 4 DVD so I get my own copy of the film and enjoyed for the second time. Last week I saw ""The Transporter"" and I decide to enjoy once again this magnificent work so I'm here writing, after a third view, my thoughts about Guy Ritchie's first feature film.<br/><br/>The story introduce you this four friends: Eddie (Nick Moran), Tom (Jason Flemyng), Bacon (Jason Statham) and Soap (Dexter Fletcher). They have different ways to get money but finally they decide to enter in a big game. They put together £100,000 to play a card game, taking advantage of the great abilities of Eddie. But they are playing against ""Hatchet"" Harry (P.H. Moriarty) who is a porn king and now they owns him £500,000 and Harry is the kind of man that if you own him you better pay him. I really love how the story makes that you care and, at the same time, feel sorry for the four friends because they put in that card game all of their savings and now they need a real miracle to get the money in only one week. At the same time were are watching this, we also watch some other characters that, if you think first, doesn't have anything related with the four friends but you will see how little is the world. There are many secondary characters but basically there are just group of friends and partners: the drug growers, the criminal neighbors of Eddie, the two guys from the North and Big Chris (Vinnie Jones) with his son, Little Chris. And all know Harry and Rory (Vas Blackwood) that are the ""big bosses"". There are two more characters that are the ones that connect everything, specially the second one: Barry the Baptist (Lenny McLean) and Nick the Greek (Stephen Marcus). This story might look a little complicated with a lot of connected subplots but the way that is shown is just perfect, enjoyable and easy to follow. The style of Guy Ritchie is just so cool, for example the first sequence is just brilliant, and there are many funny situations just as many ironies in the entire story, being the one in the very end the biggest of all.<br/><br/>Cast: Just brilliant. Eddie could be the main character and Nick Moran is just great. Jason Statham is great but he has a support role as part of the four friends so he doesn't stand out of the four because the four are a team and are great. As I watched first ""Snatch"" I found here many familiar faces like Vinnie Jones and Alan Ford. The last one has a very small role as the bartender but he is also the narrator with his unique voice. Also Sting appears as Eddie's father making a really good performance and ""the hardest man in Britain"", Lenny McLean, is terrific as Barry.<br/><br/>Conclusion: Well for me this is nothing but a brilliant film. Great story, great characters, funny situations with a lot of irony. I mention in this comment many times the film ""Snatch"" and the only reason is because is a similar film, brilliant too so I highly recommend both. In this case ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" deserves a perfect and beautiful 10."
"pswanson00","8","4","4","6 September 2007"," Hilarious, for the right audience.
","I like this film a lot, but it is REEally not for everybody. Firstly, it will help non-English viewers if they watch a lot of BBC America, because the accents are a bit thick. There's even a scene in which a lot of Cockney rhyming slang is flying around which sometimes is broadcast with subtitles...and it needs them! Secondly, there's a fair amount of violence in ""Lock, Stock,""... and even though some is humorous, it's decidedly black humor. The scene toward the end where you might say ""everybody gets his"" could be used in a horror film, if it weren't for the ridiculous circumstances which brought the participants together. Guy Ritchie did a masterful job of relieving tension almost as it was being created, without spoiling either the tension or the laughs. The casting of this film is a fine example of getting a good portrayal of a tough guy by hiring a genuinely tough man to play him. Vinnie Jones, P.H. Moriarty, and the late, great Lenny McLean all had real hard-man credibility established before they started acting, and it brought a reality to their work which is hard to get. Sting's work in a small role is perfect, by the way; he should act more. To sum up: pour a Guinness and enjoy L,S, & 2 S.B. -- it is great."

","Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is about four London class act stiffs who put their money to a test in a card game until things end up horribly wrong as they owe half a million pounds within a week to come up with the cash. The movie is by all means, enjoyable. The characters are all likable and their sense of humour makes the movie tick up a notch. I found myself laughing a couple times in the film to the jokes. All the actors played their parts pretty well, but my favorite character of the film had to go to Big Chris as Vinnie Jones. He was the most entertaining and how he was always correcting his son if he ever made any mistakes was priceless. The dialogue was really well done by Guy Ritchie, as well as his directing. What I noticed about the movie, was how much it was alike to the 1992 film, Reservoir Dogs. Lock, Stock had colorful characters, robbery that ends up bad, unexpected tragedies, good screenplay as well as directing by one person, and a good sense of humour. All those resemble to Reservoir Dogs, it's not even funny. Overall, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is a good and entertaining comedy/crime film that shows a good future to Guy Ritchie aka ""The Next Quentin Tarantino"", to many. Although it's not up to par with Reservoir Dogs, I still enjoyed it and will be paying a lot of attention to Guy Ritchie's films. I recommend it.<br/><br/>Hedeen's Outlook: 8/10 *** B"

","For what this film was, I don't think it could have worked on the main criticism I have for it.  The fast paced nature of the film combined with the many different characters leads one to be confused as to who is mad at who and who has what.  However, I could follow it well enough to see absorb the skeleton of the plot and see Ritchie's creativity in storytelling.  This film begs for a second viewing, and I will probably give it that.  Highly entertaining and very creative.  Tough to get the accents sometime though. 8/10."
"Popcorn-28","9","94","161","12 December 1999"," Now do you understand everything I've said? Because if you don't, I'll kill ya
","I've avoided this movie for sometime now.  Firstly because friends told me that it was 'Pulp Fiction'-ish (and boy do I hate that movie). Secondly, because its British and although I'm from South East London myself and love British television comedies, I have rarely found British humour well translated onto the big screen.  Normally it is toned down to plain slap-stick goofy uncomplicated Inspector Cleuseau type humour tailored for American audiences.<br/><br/>But to find not just British, but straight-faced East London cockney-slang and swear filled humour in a really stylish movie was a revelation.<br/><br/>I have always believed that British humor, especially East London humor is much more sophisicated than American humour.  Maybe the reason why American audiences have been more forthcoming with LS&2SB is that despite the accent, they finally 'get it' without having to have it remade into an American version, ala Faulty Towers and Threes company and other British comedies. Yet, I believe Tom Cruise is remaking the movie with an American cast.  I suppose for those who just cannot understand English unless its spoken in an American accent.  That is really a shame as there are so many diverse accents all around the world and LS&2SB could not have been done in any accent other than cockney.<br/><br/>Still, there are bits only the British will get, like the scene with the three guys pouncing on the traffic warden in the back of the van.  That scene had me clutching my sides.  Only someone living in London can feel true loathing for a traffic warden, the most hated person in Britain.<br/><br/>Cinemtography was superb.  I wont go into who's already done the slow-mo's and stop action argument.  It is near impossible to do anything in a movie today that has not already been done.  You can either do nothing - or do whatever you can as long as it suits the mood and the flow of the movie, and Guy Ritchie just cannot be faulted.  He projects the seedy, thin laned, miserable weathered London, yet with such style that you want to see more. The camera work could not have been better.  Just see the projection of Eddy's unsteady, light-headed wooziness as he gets up from the gambling table having lost everything and owing even more.  Brilliant.<br/><br/>The Soundtrack was as diverse and yet brilliant as I have ever heard in a movie.  I dont want to look like waving the Union Jack here, but this movie shows that the British have a more diverse taste in music.  From Reggae, to Ska, to Rock, to Mikis Theodorakis every track played just added to the scene showed.<br/><br/>In short, LS&2SB is a movie that just does not stop for a second, is full of refreshing humour, filmed with style, has a lively soundtrack, some violence thrown in for good measure, and a story with more twists and turns than a bowlfull of spaghetti.<br/><br/>Dont let this movie slip you by.  You'll either love it, or hate it.<br/><br/>If this movie was not British, I'd give it an 8/10, but since it is, it gets 9/10 from me.<br/><br/>Favourite dialogue: Rory Breaker: If you hold back anything, I'll kill ya. If you bend the truth or I think your bending the truth, I'll kill ya. If you forget anything I'll kill ya. In fact, you're gonna have to work very hard to stay alive, Nick. Now do you understand everything I've said? Because if you don't, I'll kill ya."

","For $8 million, this is a fricking monument of 1990's film.  The first time I saw it I laughed at most of the jokes and followed the plot with pleasure. That's more than I can say about any number of movies in the 1990's that cost ten times as much to make and starred pricey talent.  The editing is clever and cute.  The casting is just short of flawless.  Of the four principles, only Bacon seemed consistent to me.  The minor parts were sometimes spectacular, esp. Big & Little Chris and Barry the Baptist.<br/><br/>There are some legitimate complaints about this movie.  The big one is that it doesn't really go anywhere or mean anything.  It seems like an awful lot of flash and talent to end up saying nothing about anything.  But um it's not like Lock, Stock is trying to be anything it isn't, so maybe it's not a valid critique after all.  Considering how long Tarrantino's influence has been around, it's a little unfair to call Ritchie on imitating him.  There are some similarities  large casts, distinct characters, clever dialogue, rapid shifts in narratives from one string to another and shifting in time, and few other things.  I think the problem is that years of dumbing down by Hollywood have almost eliminated all these things.  The influence is there certainly, but it would not seem as pronounced if there were any other hugely exposed filmmakers in recent memory that put as much emphasis on dialogue and character besides Tarantino.<br/><br/>I haven't watched MTV since the mid-1980's, so the style of Lock Stock and Snatch didn't seem trite to me.  Some people I talked to said that the film style was too much like the average car commercial or pop video, which is getting the influence backwards, but I could see how those associations would spoil the experience."
"Keyser Soze-12","9","6","7","20 January 2001"," Easily one of my all time favorites
","I didn't know what to expect when I popped this movie in my VCR.  On one hand, I had heard this movie is hilarious, fun, and three steps from Pulp Fiction.  On the other hand, it's British and it may not transfer into my American head very well.  I had heard also that the movie is a rip-off of Pulp.  Well, let me tell you what I think.<br/><br/>When the movie was over I found myself on the floor laughing like a giddy schoolchild.  I was laughing for two reasons: 1) This movie is as funny as they say it is and 2) THE MOVIE IS SO GOOD!  I haven't been this giddy after a movie since, well, Pulp Fiction, which is why people compare the two I guess.  But don't let anyone convince you that Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is a British remake of Pulp fiction, because anyone who says that is a fool.  The two are completely different.  Okay, maybe not completely different, but they're different enough.<br/><br/>For one thing, Lock is no where near as serious as Pulp.  Don't get me wrong, Pulp had its funny moments, but Lock is 100% comedy.  The movie's laughs come from two places.  The first place is the funny dialog.  Once you get past their accents, which are a little on the thick side, you will find that these guys are just plain funny.  The second place is where most of the laughs come from: the plot.  The plot is so damn funny; I can't even begin to talk about it.  Watching these fine British lads get caught up in this mass confusion is good ol' fashion entertainment my friend.<br/><br/>The only problem I have with this movie is that the director, Guy Richie, can get a little on the music-video-direction side.  With all the twisted camera angles and the pumped up music one could almost mistake this for a music video on TRL.  This really didn't bother me that much.  Just like in Pulp Fiction, these guys spent some time compiling the soundtrack.  Great soundtrack people!<br/><br/>If you liked Pulp Fiction, you'll love Lock, Stock, etc. so pick this movie up.<br/><br/>9/10"

","Never seen a more entertaining gangster film than this one. It elicits belly-laughs with its black humor. <br/><br/>Guy Ritchie lures us deep into an intricate world, a world only belonging to streetwise charmers, merciless debt collectors, dope drug dealers, paranoid marijuana growers, eccentric Afros and inept burglars. In this criminal subculture, they cheat and rob each other. <br/><br/>Such a film as it is, if shot by a less intelligent, would be a disaster. But Guy makes the story full of twists and coincidences and weaves them all into his well-craft web. Elements like guns, knives, corpses and claret are indispensable parts for a gang film. In Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, guns are replaced by air rifles and antic shotguns, knives by kitchen ones and some kicking. And the bullets fly and corpses aren't that bloody since most are off-screen. And I couldn't help laughing at Soap's theory like "" guns for show, knives for pro"" especially when he soapboxes it with a seriousness on his soft-soap face. <br/><br/>The dialog is recommendable and quotable. The shooting angles, especially close-ups cannot be more suitable for this films. See a label sticker under the sole of Harry? To crown them all, the cliffhanger ending is peerless."

It may help to view the Cockney Rhyming Glossary on the DVD beforehand to get the gist of the slang ahead of time.<br/><br/>This film has a bit of Tarantino in it but it isn't nearly as serious as Reservoir Dogs.  Although bloody, it isn't particularly gory.  It maintains a whimsical perspective throughout its length as the various parallel subplots throughout the film suddenly clash together in a satisfying climax.<br/><br/>The characters are all quite entertaining as they seem to maintain a perfect balance of realism and cartoon-like qualities.<br/><br/>Overall, an entertaining film, funny script, and a well-conceived story."
"morpheus247","7","6","8","13 June 2005"," Good fun, but ultimately failing to live up to the comparisons
","I will be honest, I turned on 'Lock, Stock' with very little hope - I had been led to believe that it was a senseless action movie, the type of film that FHM give 10/10, and the rest of the world wouldn't touch with a barge pole. I was pleasantly surprised upon viewing the film, but still could not see how people compare the film to the Pulp Fictions and Trainspottings of this world.<br/><br/>Upon reading the comments on 'Snatch', which I am yet to see, I noticed someone saying that the performances on both films were excellent across the board. Not having seen 'Snatch' I am unable to judge that, but i can certainly say that I was disappointed with the acting in 'Lock, Stock'. I felt that while Vinnie Jones made a good debut, and there was the odd good performance, the main quartet certainly let the film down. At times the focus on reeling off snappy dialogue took precedence over actually acting, and to a certain extent this led me to stop actually caring about what happened to the characters. While the thrill of their audacious attempts was great, and some of the lines were hilarious, most viewers get too swept up to really care at all about the characters. Some will say that this doesn't matter, but it certainly does to me.<br/><br/>Ritchie's style of direction at times baffled me - at times I saw glimpses of cinematic genius, and realised exactly what the 'music video style' could bring to film, (e.g. Eddie's departure from the poker game) but occasionally shots felt amateurish and lazy - for example look at the two Kennys' 'get the guns' argument near the end of the film. This meant i could occasionally see what the plaudits were on about, and occasionally jumped right back to my original feelings about the film.<br/><br/>There is normally nothing that I hate more than pretentious film critics rubbishing a film because it isn't a) a postmodern satire on what it is really like to be a man or b) a documentary on Ukrainian house-husbands, and I did thoroughly enjoy Lock, Stock (I gave it 7/10). However, it is not, in my opinion, worthy of top 250 entry, and will always remain for me a post-pub fun fest."

","""Right! Let's sort the buyers from the spiers, the needy from the greedy and those who love me from the ones who don't"" Bacon (Jason Statham) and Eddie (Nick Moran) work a street crowd with their hot merchandise. Cops. They flee. When the film suddenly crashes into super-slomo, and a hard, street-savvy narration kicks in (Alan Ford's voice) telling us of Bacon's and Eddie's street chicanery on its last legs, we hark back to the opening of *Pulp Fiction* (where Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer are dialoguing intriguingly and cooing like lovebirds over coffee in a diner one minute and in the next, suddenly viciously holding up the joint). Like *Pulp*, this Guy Ritchie-penned and directed trash whore promises to be a dialog-luscious film with a rabid style all its own.<br/><br/>It is.<br/><br/>With a frenetic energy that few films today possess, *Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels* is the work of a film-maker who remembers that movies are, first and foremost, Entertainment. Guy Ritchie is Danny Boyle (*Trainspotting, 28 Days Later*) on crank.<br/><br/>Along with Statham and Moran, Dexter Fletcher (as Soap) and Jason Flemyng (as ""Tubby"" Tommy) round out the quartet of twenty-something East End street friends who pool their cash to enter Eddie, a card-shark natural, into a life-or-death stakes card game with local gangster and porn king, ""Hatchet"" Harry Lonsdale (P.H. Moriarty).<br/><br/>Which Eddie, through Harry's cheating, promptly loses.<br/><br/>So begins Eddie and the boys' crooked quest to deliver ""half a million knickers"" to Harry before Harry's bulldog, Barry ""The Baptist"" (Lenny McLean) starts claiming their digits as vig.<br/><br/>That's the short version. In the final telling, Lock, Stock - filmed with a leached look that makes London look even stinkier and gloomier than it actually is - is a Mobius strip of black comedic robbery and nihilistic bloodletting, shot through a revolving-door of criss-crossing, cross-killing, kill-switching plots.<br/><br/>Concurrent with our desperate hero foursome (calling them anti-heroes does not even suffice for their level of ""anti,"" so let's drop the prefix and stop pretending we don't support bad guys), there are the dazed and confused marijuana farmers led by the willowy Winston (Steven Mackintosh), whom we first meet inanely arguing over locking the front gate; there are Eddie's neighbors, a gang of thieves as ruthless as they are inept, led by a chilling sadist, Dog (Frank Harper), whom we first meet as he swipes golf balls off the nose of a victim while machete-ing another hanging upside down; there is a black gang of giants led by a cockney midget with a fashion-challenged 'fro, Rory Breaker (Vas Blackwood), whose introduction to the story sees him setting a man on fire for insisting he change the pub television channel; then there are the two clueless, low-rent bandits (Jake Abraham and Victor McGuire) who burgle the smoking barrels of the title with plot-twisting consequences; there's Big Chris (Vinnie Jones), a merciless hit-man who is yet intent on raising his son with manners, and a hardened bar owner, JD, who shuns the maelstrom, not for want of street-cred, but because he is miles beyond mustered (played by Sting, as hard as the day he formed The Police).<br/><br/>With a source-music soundtrack that swivels effortlessly between savage, scarring guitars to ska figures and traditional Jewish plucking, and slang so rich your ears will gain ten pounds (""not with Liberia's deficit in ya skyrocket,"" ""orders an Aristotle of the most ping pong tiddly in the nuclear sub""), Lock, Stock wends its complex way to a furiously satisfying climax, twists aplenty and a final shot that will renew your faith in creative storytelling like a date with a drunk Hans Christian Andersen.<br/><br/>This movie is a modern classic.<br/><br/>No matter the Serious Critics denigrating style over substance, this movie - stylistic to a fault  defiantly does not lack for substance. It is no secret that the nature of the medium is *reliant* on style, so it is as silly to say that a movie should lack ""style"" as a rock band should lack ""image""  these are the selling points of the products. Style is an integral aspect of a modern director's toolbox and Ritchie has consciously chosen to present his product this stylishly - and his cup overfloweth with substance too.<br/><br/>Yet Ritchie's stylistic verve earns him his share of detractors, some rationally decrying the new breed of crash-cutting, shotgun storytellers, some just too slow-witted to keep up with the swagger of the Ritchies, Tarantinos and Boyles  subsequently, there are only two ways to take this movie: either not at all, or lock, stock and two smoking barrels<br/><br/>(Movie Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)"

This is Guy Ritchie's full length feature debut. It shows that he has skills but it's not quite as polished as 'Reservoir Dogs'. The accents are quite thick. The comedy doesn't always translate well.

"Movieman02","8","4","5","20 August 2005"," It'll blow you away.
","Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels is one of those rare movies that flies under the radar until it gathers a cult following.<br/><br/>This is Guy Ritchie's directorial debut. The story focuses around five groups of people, but mainly four friends who are now in deep trouble when Tom, a highly skilled card shark, loses in a card game that was rigged. They find themselves a quarter million dollars in debt and have only a week to get out of before ""Hachet"" Harry will start chopping their fingers off. The other story lines come into play when Tom and his three friends try to figure out a way to come up with the money.<br/><br/>What I like about this film is the fresh script writing and odd humor. The opening sequence (Jason Statham street peddling with help from Jason Flemming) sets the right pace for a comedic and fast paced flick. From there we are introduced to every other character in their own unique way. My favorite characters have got to be Big Chris and Little Chris. Big Chris (played by Vinnie Jones) is the kind of character that was placed in the script to be the tough guy. Usually the tough guy is someone rather generic, but Guy Ritchie places Little Chris (Peter McNicholl) as Big Chris's young son to show a soft side to Big Chris. Big Chris tries to keep Little Chris from becoming a mindless thug by showing him how to do things properly without using foul language and such. The two characters become very comedic and do not become tired over the course of the movie.<br/><br/>Another great element of this movie is the soundtrack. I actually got ticked off when one of the songs stopped playing when I wanted it to go on. Very stylish and the music seems to go right with every scene.<br/><br/>Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels is highly enjoyable and won't disappoint you.<br/><br/>8/10"
"Chrissy-4","7","4","5","22 September 1998"," Hugely enjoyable, but ultimately lightweight
","This is a well-written, well-acted and beautifully shot gangster movie in which Vinnie Jones is as good as everyone says (though playing a menacing thug was not perhaps the greatest test of his acting abilities). However, like most of the other films which constitute the `renaissance' of British cinema (e.g. The Full Monty) this is a thoroughly enjoyable, but ultimately lightweight offering.<br/><br/>The plot revolves around a number of caricatures; we have the ruthless gangland boss (into collecting expensive guns and beating people to death with dildos), the `soft' marijuana-growing public-school boys and a couple of thieving Scousers who would probably be more at home in a Harry Enfield sketch than in the East End, while the heroes are essentially the bunch of bumbling amateur criminals so beloved of the British psyche. Despite the inevitable comparisons to Reservoir Dogs et al, this is a very British film which in general rejects the slick wit of Tarantino to play on its caricatured characters with a mixture of understatement, sarcasm and dark cockney humour, with the occasional slice of slap-stick comedy thrown in for good measure. The plot twists and turns engagingly backed by an excellent soundtrack, and the ending is a relief from standard Hollywood predictability. However,  I was surprised to find that a lot of the much-touted violence was more comic than genuinely unnerving which was perhaps a shame  sustaining a more chilling atmosphere to contrast with the laughs would have contributed some depth to this film.<br/><br/>Do go and see Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels- it is fun and well worth the entrance money. But it is as likely to change your perspective on life as Lethal Weapon 4."

I enjoyed this movie of treacherous West Enders a lot.  The funniest scene was when Rory set the drunk on fire, and there were little subtitles to little sub-titles to translate the Cockney slang (although the whole movie could have done with sub-titles!).

It seems that most of the reviewers only saw the film recently and since then it has lost its freshness.  When I saw Snatch, although I very much liked it as a film in its own right, I thought it was just a poorer version of lock stock made with a higher budget.  Lock Stock, for a first film in particular is quick, snappy, gritty, funny and best of all none of this soppy sentimental crap that you get in so many of todays films."
"mr_popcorn","10","6","9","5 June 2008"," McCheesy's take on ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels""
","Guy Ritchie is a genius. He turned a seemingly generic card-themed flick into something magnificent I don't even know where to start. Okay, so basically four guys, Nick, Tom, Bacon and Soap shell out their life savings so they can join a high-stakes card game with local mob boss Hatchet Harry. It turns out the game was rigged and the four of them ended up owing Harry half a million pounds and they have a week to come up with the money. Their ""genius"" plan to come up with the money draws the ire of some notable figures of London's underbelly like marijuana-dealer Rory Breaker, old school London thug Dog and debt collector Big Chris. The events that will follow is either a) funny, b) hilariously funny, c) wickedly entertaining or d) just pure black comedy genius.<br/><br/>This film is just too darn good. Its a healthy mix of black comedy, style, flair, wickedness, dark humor and awesome, magnificent turn of events. The casting and characterization is perfect, and Ritchie isn't afraid to move the cameras around; no pretense is really made here at ""realism"" - Ritchie doesn't mask the fact that it's a film and he runs with it.<br/><br/>The dialogs were perfect that is if you understand what the hell they're saying. At first if you don't understand the dialogs, just be patient because you'll get used to it.<br/><br/>The last 30 minutes or so is probably the highest point of the film. All these colorful characters collide each with their own agendas and you will be laughing until the end. The closing frame of the film will either shock you or leave you in a cliff, hanging. The ending of the film is probably one of the greatest movie endings of all time with the accompaniment of that catchy song, this film is overall one heck of a treat. I had a blast watching it and I'm pretty sure it will stay with me forever.<br/><br/>""Its been emotional"" - Classic. A must-see. 10"

THIS is how comedies should be made.<br/><br/>It has a plot that's so complex it's hard to explain, but they pull it off brilliantly. All comedies have a screwball plot, but not all of them can pull it off. Sometimes you're so fixated on the fact that ""this film makes no sense"" that you can't revel in the humor. With ""Lock, Stock"" that is NOT a problem at all. You can go with the flow, and can be amazed as all these diversely bizarre threads come together at the end.<br/><br/>The movie also dives into that great comic well -- known as Lower Class Britain -- and delivers everything it can possible promise. Copious profanity. Indecipherable (for us Americans) Cockney slang. Seedy locales. Multicultularism that blends in famously. And stuff that only is funny out of a Brit's mouth (if an American delivered these lines it would be horrible).<br/><br/>The timing and pacing of this movie are spot-on. Only very rarely are there bits that ""hang"", most of it is just one spot after another, bang bang bang bang. These folks really have comic timing down to an art form.<br/><br/>Love the over-the-top hints of violence, too. In true Brit fashion they don't throw violence on the screen like Tarantino might. It's all there, though, and in great form. The ludicrousness of it is suggested, both in off-screen sounds and in the hilariously gruesome aftermath. Utterly brilliant in delivery!

In england we complained about what mel gibson chose to do in his awful awful films of braveheart and patriot but we seem to be quite happy to let someone british do the same thing. i suppose that i should feel grateful that noone from birmingham was in it, we would have been portrayed as having a broad accent and being thick no doubt.<br/><br/>before anyone accuses me of having a humour bypass, yes i know that this is intentional. i know that they are cardboard cutout villains but that really is no excuse for having a cardboard cutout script. never before have i watched an entire film in which every line appeared to be written down before it was spoken. everything was delivered as though it was all some little in joke that we should all find funny. and i agree with one of the earlier reviewers, vinnie jones CANNOT act. he was in good company here however, since nobody in this film.<br/><br/>it appears that this is no-more than a remake of the 'Italian Job' except without a few things, like the 60's style, noel coward, the script, the acting oh, but we were at least rewarded with not one person being michael caine, but at least 6 people trying to be him. only they all failed. badly.<br/><br/>this really is the film that launched a thousand british gangster films, they have all been bad. but in that sense they have lived up to imitation being the most sincere form of flattery. for the british readers of this, to me this was like watching an extended episode of 'only fools and horses' with more guns and swearing. pitiful and grotesquely overhyped."

The other critics on this website debate that Lock Stock has a better ending and story, but i didn't really see that. The pacing of Lock Stok is astonishingly slow and the characters feel like their cardboard cutouts without a soul. This also brings a negative thrall over this poorly directed and acted mess.<br/><br/>I cant begin to tell you how much i disliked the cast, i mean awful.

The story line is complicated enough --- you can't tell the bad guys from the good guys because there are no good guys --- but the thick east end London accents make the dialogue incomprehensible for the most part.

The film is billed as being a crime comedy but I don't recall laughing once.  The characters are your typical cockneys, aside from the irritating accent, all you hear is various people being referred to as muppets, mugs and slags and then indulging in glorified violence.  Nothing wrong with violence, some of my favourite films are heavy on the bloodshed, including ""Goodfellas"" and ""Reservoir Dogs"" but this is a dismal attempt to make it seem funny, when it really isn't.  <br/><br/>Guy Ritchie, despite the reputation he is building for himself strikes me as being a director of a lot of style but very little substance and I don't care how many people tell me otherwise, VINNIE JONES CANNOT ACT.

A lot of the humor in Tarantino's film has grown stale over time, but this movie is even worse. ""Pulp Fiction"" at least has some fresh lines, and the actor's are more believable as criminals. Guy Ritchie's effort seems as if he wants to become the European heir to Tarantino. He plays all too hard to try for the pop-culture youth demographic. This takes away from the film. All throughout it emits the feeling of a director looking for his Muse; but he can't find one so he ends up trying to imitate Scorsese and Tarantino - but convert them ""hip"" to young Anglo culture. The editing is wretched. When I first saw this film over in the British Isles I could tell it was directed by some young hot-shot who used to make music videos and was trying to hand at feature-length film - but using the same video techniques he employed in his previous works. It's choppy and stupid. If you want to see a film made with real insights of the crime underworld, which also contains genuine moments of laughter see ""GoodFellas"" or ""Mean Streets"". This movie is a waste, and in due time people will realize that it's pop-culture feel is paper-thin and no longer wears well."

After a bright start, the film eventually descended into a farce with people shouting at each in silly Cockney accents. Perhaps I've missed the punchline or lost my sense of humour but this film was like an adult version of Scooby Doo with its cartoon violence and characterization.<br/><br/>Apart from some touches -ie the slow mo's during the card game - this film had a very made for tv feel about it.

There are too many characters and not a single one of them is likable. It's difficult to keep track of the three gangs, who all seem to have similar looking young men.

","Eddy has been good with cards since he was a youth but more than that he is good at reading people. So he makes an agreement with friends Bacon, Tom and Soup to raise the cash to enter the £100k game organised by ""Hatchet"" Harry Lonsdale. Unknown to Eddy, Harry cheats and it isn't long before Eddy is in debt to Harry for losses of £500k. With a week to pay, the four friends are desperate but things look good when Eddy overhears of a weed den run by a handful of former public schoolboys who have lots of cash and lots of drugs. However as they try to get it, the web of gangsters and thieves just gets more and more convoluted.<br/><br/>Although he has found out that it cannot produce a career. Guy Richie's debut film is a wonderfully fun piece of silliness and style. The success of this film can be seen in the vast number of inferior copies that came out in the years following Lock, Stock's release but although this is not a strong film, it is very energetic and fun. The script is a mix of characters all spouting exaggerated cockney dialogue in a plot that has plenty of twist and turns but very little depth. This isn't really a problem though because most viewers will come to this knowing what to expect  and few of them will be looking for a serious look at gangsters in London. No, this is nonsense but it is cool, funny and (if you ignore what came after) very fresh.<br/><br/>For all his inability to work with serious stories, Ritchie knows how to use a camera and this film is full of visual tricks that work really well. Freeze-frames, slow-mo, different shots etc; yes they are all style without substance but the visual feel of the film is cool. The soundtrack is also really good and works well within the film, never hitting a bum note and always lifting the energy anytime any track plays. The plot is well written in regards the funny dialogue and the slick narrative but those who worry about films making violence and crime look cool should probably just avoid it because this is what it does in the place of substance or moral consideration. Of course this doesn't matter because Ritchie and the cast totally buy into the slick, violent comedy that they are making. Flemyng, Fletcher, Moran and Statham all do well in the lead roles  Statham being my favourite because he introduces the film with his cheeky sales pitch. The support cast are all fun even if some of them are unusual choices. Jones doesn't deserve the fame he got off this film but he is solid here even if his range is limited to say the least. Loads of familiar faces fill out the rest of the cast with good caricatures from Blackwood, McLean, Marcus, Flint and others.<br/><br/>As we have seen, it has been difficult for Ritchie or anyone else to repeat the success of this film but for his debut he got it spot on. Although it lacks any sense of morals or character substance it is fresh, funny, violent and, most importantly, fun. Not to everyone's taste of course but cool, slick and enjoyable."

There are few redeeming values to this film at all. I really enjoyed (note the sarcasm) the slow motion and ""trippy"" camera work that were used at certain points. They were not the least bit necessary, as they did not reveal anything about the character or the scene.

The film didn't contain an original idea, and stole shamelessly from 'Reservoir Dogs', 'Trainspotting', 'Goodfellas', 'Only Fools & Horses' and 'The Italian Job'. The humour and stereotypes were like a bad episode of 'Minder'. It was shot in a grainy stock to compare with some of the British 70s classics.

Why this movie didn't come with subtitles is beyond my comprehension.  <br/><br/>Despite that, this movie still became a hit worldwide.  However, I wasn't stimulated by its unique but often dry sense of style.

Now, I read in a screenwriting book that ""sit-down"" scenes are like a kiss of death in writing a movie, and unless it's pulled off with pure genius like in ""My Dinner with Andre"" it will make the audience fall asleep in no time.  We have all these scenes where people are sitting in darkly lit pubs, when you know there's supposed some ACTION going on!  This is one of the few dialogue-driven action flicks I've seen.

It was certainly violent in places, had a few neat twists towards the end, but ultimately left you thinking that the director Guy Ritchie was just trying to be Britain's answer to Quentin Tarantino - well sorry Guy, you lack the characterisation and humour.  Remember Pulp Fiction?  We all laughed when John Travolta shot that guy in the face - to laugh in the face of shocking violence takes the work of a genius - Guy Ritchie has two goons being shot by an unseen airgun marksmen with the ultra-violent ""boss"" shouting ""will everyone stop getting shot"".

","What was the point of that? I'm going to go do my laundry.<br/><br/>End of review. 0/10.<br/><br/>Okay, I really wish I could end there, because that's all the credit Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels deserves. It's one of the few movies I've even seen that is so bad it's actually below me to sit here and write a negative review. I've watched a lot of overrated films, but I've never once gone as far as to call a single movie ""The Most Overrated Film of All Time"", simply because there are a lot of movies that could be called that. Naming one single movie ""The Most Overrated Film of All Time"" is just ludicrous. But I am seriously reconsidering my own line of logic right now and giving this film that title. That is how much I simply cannot understand the hype and mass love for this film. At all. It's like a movie that should be on the bottom 100 movies of all time, but then somehow, some way, it gets loved by the public. I simply can't comprehend it.<br/><br/>Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is a generic film noir piece set in a generic film noir world with generic film noir ""quirky"" characters and a generic film noir plot. Everything, every last thing, is copy/pasted from otherbettermovies. Critics trash movies all the time for even minor unoriginality, yet this has to be one of the most unoriginal movies of all time and it's critically acclaimed? It's impossible not to see the unabashed rip-off scenes from Pulp Fiction, most notably. Not to mention the Reservoir Dogs inspired scenes. By the middle of the movie I literally forgot which wannabe Quentin Tarantino movie I was watching, because I've seen so many of them they all just blur together because they're all basically the same movie. They all repeat the same variations of Pulp Fiction quotes. They all have the same basic drug-kill-money plot. They all think they're so genius because they have one sub-par plot twist that isn't even a plot twist because we expect it in movies like this.<br/><br/>Look, I like film noir, too, but I don't love everything just because it's a stylish crime movie. It has to be different. Film noir started back in the 40s, and I think it says something when the only few films in the genre that become anything more than a small cult success are the ones that are truly genre-defining and added much-needed originality to the genre, not the ones that just tag around the bandwagon. In other words, I can see some people possibly finding Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels entertaining if you're a genre fan. But overrating it to the point that its at is simply stupid. It's generic. It's exactly like everything you've seen before. It's just a frozen McDonald's hamburger in the generic fast food storehouse. Get over it.<br/><br/>If you're not a film noir fan, don't bother watching it at all. You'll fall asleep. If you are, and you're in a good mood, I suggest you try it. If the first five minutes bore you as much as they did me, just know that the rest of the movie doesn't get any better. The jokes are the same jokes you've heard in all the other genre pieces. There is nothing good that can be said about the acting. Some of it is borderline terrible. It isn't cool. The pansy camera cutting away from every single act violenceeven as tame a punch in the mouth!gets so annoying I wished more than once I could turn it off. It isn't cool.<br/><br/>There isn't a single thing about this movie that is likable or entertaining unless you get it up by watching generic middle-aged men trying to be cool.<br/><br/>I'm done.<br/><br/>This film noir fan has officially given up on the entire genre. I'm done. Instead of ripping-off Pulp Fiction a hundred more times, why don't directors actually do what Pulp Fiction did? Bring originality to the tired genre.<br/><br/>0/10"
"MovieAddict2016","5","8","16","11 June 2005"," Visually and cinematically, ""Trainspotting"" meets Tarantino -- story-wise, an unfortunate case of style over substance
","""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" (1998) has become something of a cult classic (particularly in the UK) and has a devout fan following. In the wake of the Quentin Tarantino self-knowing genre imitators this is one of the few to stand apart from the rest and make a name for itself.<br/><br/>Unfortunately that's all it really is -- a Tarantino imitator. It's entirely coincidental that it's had any more of an impact than, say, ""The Way of the Gun,"" or other failed Tarantino spawns.<br/><br/>There have been some people on the IMDb message boards saying, ""...Tarantino just rips people off so how can this be a rip off of Tarantino?"" Tarantino does indeed rip off, or ""borrow,"" other filmmakers. But his visual style is a distinct one -- his raw, edgy, down-to-earth directorial style with the dark shades and grungy grain -- and ""Lock Stock"" copies this way too often.<br/><br/>Guy Ritchie got his start in TV commercials and that's very clear. I suppose most Americans wouldn't be able to tell since the commercials in America are so stupid and banal. In the UK, commercials (particularly those such as the Stella Artois ads) tell stories and have a clear visual edge that is lacking in the US. Ritchie's style is identical to the sensuous and dark adverts being broadcast in the UK. The camera angles, styles and hand-cam shots are all straight from TV; the gambling sequence where a character's head is blurred and spun around, or when the camera bursts out of a cook's boiling pot of water, are straight from the tube; Ritchie's background is instantly recognizable. In my opinion, it's not a good style for film; it's like a mix between Soderbergh and Tarantino, and I don't like it much. (Although admittedly it's great for adverts.) This picture is alive, sure, because of the TV-style flair. But that doesn't mean it's any good. To be totally honest I found it to be a huge bore and a wannabe Tarantino flick crossed with Irvine Welsh.<br/><br/>I couldn't care less about any of the characters. I liked Jason Statham the most, but the others are introduced so poorly, and examined so recklessly, that I quickly lost track of their traits and felt as if I was -- yet again -- watching some extended TV commercial: style over substance.<br/><br/>The dialogue is OK, I guess, and in fact the actors all bring it alive because they do very much sound like Eastern Londoners. (Can't say how many people I've met who talk just like this!) That would be the highest praise I can give it.<br/><br/>""Trainspotting"" is the best UK film of the 1990s, in my opinion, and ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" is a pale imitation of both this and the Quentin Tarantino generation. Its dialogue, directorial style and hip self-conscious vibe have all been over-used to such an extent that it just comes across as pretentious, showy and artificial -- not fun, just dumb."
"griffolyon12","4","5","9","17 June 2008"," Style Over Substance
","Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is a film that is often at times fairly entertaining, and funny, but it seems to stop just there as a film that favors style over substance. This film is fairly basic fare as far as the plot goes for crime movies: four guys lose a bunch of money and have one week to get it back, and they decide to turn to thievery to obtain it.<br/><br/>First off I will mention what I really liked about this film. First and foremost the cinematography steals the show, proving just how beautiful a film shot on 16 mm can look; as well the directing by Guy Ritchie is really well done, and he definitely gives the film a visual flare that is very reminiscent of a young Martin Scorsese; then the music is really great throughout, the whole soundtrack consisting of great British rock; on top of all that the acting is really well done through out. All of the stuff mentioned above really helps lend this film to a style that is both pleasing to the senses and often entertaining, and you might wonder where I found a problem with the film, and it is the story. The story seemed like a good, entertaining concept, but it never fully met its potential. The story just got bogged down by way too many characters and plot twists, there were just way too many. Now the screenplay had some truly terrific dialogue and some funny scenes written in, but majority of the comedy had nothing to do with the overall story. Then to cap all of that off, the film ran on for at least a good 15-20 minutes longer than it probably should have.<br/><br/>Overall it is a film that is only worth watching for its well done style, but for no other real reason. Now if you love cinematography it is at least a definite rental, but if you don't, you should definitely skip it because you will most likely find the story too overstuffed to enjoy. It just seemed like it was trying too hard to be Pulp Fiction, but it failed.<br/><br/>I give Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels a 4 out of 10!"
"jriggins","5","5","9","13 August 1999"," Didn't live up to critics' rave reviews...
","Despite a decent plot and dialogue, this film did almost nothing for me with the exception of irritating me tremendously.  Of the cast, at least three were blatant Steve Buscemi mimics while another might as well have been a contestant in a Dennis Leary wannabe contest.  The characters seem to be overtly modeled, directly mind you, after characters from Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs.  Overall the movie seemed like a weak attempt at matching Tarentino's genius character development from those films. Not to mention the less obvious Kubrick rip off with their version of Nadsat (the dialect used in Clockwork Orange).  During one scene a bartender is telling a story using a dialect consisting of words meaning things other than their conventional definitions.  While this definitely has potential, as Kubrick demonstrated, the director chose to use subtitles for the bartender's dialect so the audience would be better able to understand him. It could have been better if a similar dialect was used throughout the movie and the audience was forced to learn the language in order to understand the dialogue. Aside from these irritating facets of the movie, it was generally good. The plot shifts were creative as was the overall cinematography.  I might have given it a 6 or 7 based on the plot, but because of the rip off characters and dialogue, I have to give it a 4.  It's worth seeing if you don't think you'll have similar grievances as I did, but if you watch a lot of movies, this will probably serve to annoy you as much as it did me."

","I have watched this movie at least 2 dozen times, and every time I see it, it just keeps getting better!!! All the characters have depth, and you cant help but find Brit humor funny in this one! Jason Statham & Jason Flemying are top notch, hard to believe these two were just getting started in the industry! I recommend this to everyone that can appreciate a good laugh at Brit humor. From the poker game, to the robbery, to the shoot out that follows, everything was great. The best part is when girl appears our of practically thin air with the Brain gun in hand... you'll have to see it to know what I'm talking about. Second to that, the part about the traffic warden is another good running gag."

","Guy Ritchie made his mark on the world with the madcap ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"", about organized crime in London's underbelly. I remember that when it came out was right after Columbine, so some people got irked by the violence, but I suggest that you ignore that and luxuriate in the pure hilarity. As great as the plot - maybe better - is the soundtrack. The song ""18 with a Bullet"" may have also reminded people of Columbine. But anyway, this is a movie that you're sure to like. Ritchie followed it up with the equally great ""Snatch."", but unfortunately followed that up with the dreadful ""Swept Away"" remake. But this one is a hoot."

Eddie and his three friends have seven days to find the money to pay off the debt, or face the consequences.<br/><br/>It seems a little crass to state the bleeding obvious, but Lock Stock And Two Smoking Barrels is the British blood brother to Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs. It's also that particular films equal and the best, and most successful, of the post Dogs imitations. Guy Ritchie's first full length picture has a knowing vitality about it, oddly seeming fresh even tho it harks back to crime movies back in yore. The plot plays out as an amalgamation of crooks and wide boy Londoners whizz around robbing and beating each other with care free abandon, all of course armed with cockney swagger to go with their respective weapons. On the surface it looks quite complex in structure, but Ritchie ties it all together with brio and a sheer belief that these characters are capable of winning over the audience. And they do. The violence in the piece is tough and at times wince inducing, but another laugh, or a beggars belief scene is just around the corner, and on it goes. Till the collage unfolds and the ending is nigh, and here Ritchie gives us the final nudge in the ribs to close the sale of the century. 9/10"
"blierer","10","3","5","9 December 2008"," Low Budget, Big Hit
","Film: Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998) Genre:Comedy/Crime/Thriller Written and Directed by: Guy Ritchie Budget:£960,000 Box Office Sales: US: $3,897,569 International: $21,400,000 Total: $25,297,569<br/><br/>My Critique: Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is one of my favorite movies. Not only is it a great film, but it gives me inspiration as an aspiring film maker. The storyline is set in England, about four guys who lose a fixed card game and owe £500,000 to a mob boss. The four of them are forced to come up with schemes to raise the money. It ties in a lot of interesting characters in an excellent storyline. Any gangster movie lover needs to own this movie. I also love how the movie was low budget and yet had such high production value. The lighting was simplistic but captivating, and the actors weren't famous, but they fit the parts perfectly. In the bonus materials you learn how they made parts of the movie. They described some of the editing techniques involved like messing with frame rate, a first experience with a stunt man, and shooting with high speed cameras. This movie was Guy Ritchie's second film and so they were pretty new to this and it gives me inspiration because I felt like I could relate to the guys in the bonus features. It showed me that I know how they made it, and I have the ability to make something just as good. You don't need an outrageous Hollywood budget to make cinematic gold. If you really like this movie, I think it compares to and rates as high as the sequel Snatch, Reservoir Dogs, and Pulp Fiction."
"anjoost","10","3","5","20 December 2007"," One of the most funny movies to date
","I watched this movie without having a clue what to expect. And I ended up watching it two times in a row. The acting is laid back but great. And the dialogues are excellent. But most of all it is simply hilarious. There are many characters that all have enough depth. And equally many sub-plots. As it isn't until the end that the many plots all come together, like with Pulp Fiction it is a movie you can watch numerous times and it only gets funnier. The English Pulp Fiction wouldn't do it justice though as it provokes much more than a smile on your face. Expect some serious bursts of laughter. And if you are a fan of celebrities playing some great side roles: Vinnie Jones and Sting are the one to watch out for."
"bwanabrad-1","10","3","5","15 December 2007"," The return of the smart Brit crim flick.
","Kudos to Guy Ritchie for almost single handedly resurrecting the Brit crime flick. Without him there would be no Sexy Beast and no Layer Cake, there would most likely be no Vinnie Jones or Jason Statham either. The intertwining of multiple plot lines has been been before, and most likely he has used Pulp Fiction here as a model. Only his plot is much more involved, his dialogue more believable and his characters more real than any one figure in Tarantino's vehicle. The result is a smart, sassy and savvy film, that takes us into a seedy underworld, where the characters convey more menace with a single look, word or gesture than Pulp Fiction can sustain throughout. As a result l found myself far more engaged and wondering how the story was going to be resolved than in any other crime film l can recall in of the last couple of decades. <br/><br/>Bloody excellent stuff."
"gavin6942","10","3","5","21 February 2006"," Pure Bloody Genius
","Guy Ritchie has a skill: the skill to take multi-layered gangster plots, weave them together, and come out with a fabric of the finest quality. I first watched ""Snatch"", which came after this film. Loved it. Watch this film, which had a similar set-up (the interwoven gangster theme). Loved it. As far as I'm concerned, if Ritchie can maintain this level of creativity, he can keep on making these films until the end of time. His characters are so well scripted and the actors so well chosen, there is a three-dimensional quality to this film, as if you can almost taste the sulfur in the shotgun blasts.<br/><br/>To describe the plot is difficult, unless we choose one character as the hero and the rest as the anti-heroes... but that's hard to do. While certain people seem to be on our side, they're all equally involved in the plot. Kids playing poker, a porn king who cheats at cards, Big Chris the hired thug, the stereotyped black ganja dealer, Barry the Baptist... all great characters.<br/><br/>Another aspect of Ritchie's films is that instead of good vs. evil, he offers us bad versus evil. All the characters do bad things: steal, drink, smoke dope and kill if necessary. But some are simply ""bad"" (people who would be morally upright in a different setting) and others are ""evil"" (no moral code at all, black all the way to the core of their heart). This almost non-dichotomy is probably not unique to Ritchie, but is something he excels in. Highest possible recommendation, you nonce!"
"Nick_Charles","9","3","5","12 November 2005"," Among the best British films
","""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" is a classic comedy noir about misunderstandings, coincidences and overconfidence. Four young men, three of whom are relatively harmless black marketers, try to win a lot of money by playing poker with the local gangster, Harry. This backfires horribly, and they owe £ 500,000.<br/><br/>The rest of the film is about their search for the money. It involves their far more dangerous neighbours, naïve university dropouts who sell marijuana, a drug dealer described as ""a madman with an afro"" and, of course, the Harry and his men, most memorably Big Chris, the debt collector. Whether the characters are two-dimensional or just trying to live up to certain underground stereotypes I do not know, but it doesn't matter. They are parodies, but good ones.<br/><br/>Guy Ritchie's experience as a music video director is obvious; there is a certain MTV-feel about it. Added to that, this film is so London-oriented that most of us will feel as if we're missing half the jokes, and there are times when subtitles will come in handy, even for a native speaker (e.g. ""He then proceeds to order an Aristotle of the most ping-pong tiddly in the Nuclear sub""). In short, this film is a lot of fun, slightly absurd, always fast-paced, well directed and really, really British. Well worth your time."

","It still amazes me!!! How could such an intricately interwoven plot be... 1) Written ... 2) Shown on screen with such brilliant aptitude. This movie is an ode to writer - director Guy Ritchie. HE IS CLEVER, REALLY CLEVER!!! The inter-threading of different scenes in a movie was something never seen before Lock Stock... The scene in the first half where a burning man comes out of the Samoan Bar and Tom, Soap & Bacon just look at him and go in as if nothing new has happened is damn hilarious!!! However, its only in the second half, when you come to realize how that man was burnt (..by Rory..), and that is the inter-threading I'm talking about....THAT IS BRILLIANT!!! This is also one of those rare movies where you tend to fall in love with almost every character, no matter how big or small his role is. But if I had to pick my favourite characters from the movie, they would be Barry the Baptist, Big Chris, Soap and Rory. And its also filled with these humorous dialogues spoken in that endearing cockney accent!!! All in all, it's a humorous, intelligent entertainer, this one!!!"

","Before Jason Statham was a big name action hero With little acting ability ( see Cranked, Transporter 1 & 2) , he had tremendous ability which was best displayed in this tricky little film buy Guy Ritchie. Throw in some all-time likable tough guys like Vinnie Jones Lenny McClean and you have the mix of a good crime drama. The thing is, this wasn't a crime drama. Lock Stock was much more than this, it made me laugh, sweat, act squeamish, and still made me attached to some of it's characters. In my opinion this movie was better then Snatch although Snatch had the big American actor to back it, Brad Pitt. This simple but ingeniously scrapped together story about a mean porn king and a group of underachievers in London taps all the emotions of the viewer. It's a shame Lenny Mclean passed after acting in this film because he was easily one of the true tough SOB's both on and off the set and would have been a great actor for some time.

The acting is atrocious, particularly by Nick Moran and Val Blackwood. (Blackwood's over-acting is the only thing that made me laugh.) Vinnie Jones is decently cast, but is given the idiotic role of a hitman who carries around his 12 year old son to ""teach him the ropes."" <br/><br/>    The script is a mixture of robbery cliches, and Guy Ritchie displays minimal talent as a writer/director. Jason Flemying has the only watchable performance in the film as Tom. The soundtrack is good, but here's a tip Guy, a good soundtrack doesn't make a good movie.

","A complex, ultra-black comedy packed with violence and profanity, this is one of the best films to come out of Britain in recent years. Ignore the seriousness of other thrillers like FACE, and instead concentrate on the hilarious dialogue and fun characters which this film is full of. From 'Hatchet Harry' to 'Barry the Baptist', this film has an endless parade of clichéd villains who are an absolute delight to watch, not least Vinnie Jones' hard debt collector who enjoys slamming people's heads in a variety of doors.<br/><br/>There's an obvious influence here from Tarantino's work, but the two directorial styles are very different. Director Guy Ritchie has some weird, trippy moments in this film, to counteract the smoothness of other scenes. The comedy comes from the increasingly confused situation in the film, and is consistently funny. The acting is all pretty good, with top marks going to Dexter Fletcher (""Guns for show, knives for a pro""). The violence is frequent but never done in a serious matter; there are loads of shoot-outs and bodies everywhere, but they're not to be taken seriously. Basically, this film is perfectly done and one of the liveliest London gangster films ever made. See it!"

Though I did understand 85% of the dialogues but only could comprehend the 15% left after turning on the subtitles. This does not mean the dialogues are not good. They are excellent. The accent - great! I'm going to try and get it in fact. Some of the dialogues are delivered so fast that they cannot be comprehended. The dialogues contain gems and exposed me to English slang like no other piece of art. Sample this ""Eddie: They're armed. <br/><br/>Soap: What was that? Armed? What do you mean armed? Armed with what<br/><br/>Eddie: Err, bad breath,colorful language, feather duster... what do you<br/><br/>think they're gonna be armed with? Guns, you tit! ""<br/><br/>The camera work is brilliant. Some of the techniques were fairly new at that time which have been hailed as path breakers for example the camera work when one of the protagonist looses a card game. <br/><br/>The actors, some of whom I have never heard of till date, fit their roles like hand in glove.<br/><br/>The music is just about perfect yet diverse. A soundtrack worth buying.<br/><br/>Some viewers would categorize it as comedy or black comedy but I would beg to disagree.

This plot remains fast-paced and fresh throughout the film, wasting no time in bringing out the next scene. The ultra-fast method they deliver their lines also plays into the movie's strong points. It becomes almost incomprehensible at times, but it's all okay because it is such a cool way of going through the movie. It also contains a kind of humor in it, the kind that persuades you to laugh at all of their hopeless situations and blunderings.

Outside of that, just about everything else in the film, from the quick cut  editing to the lead gangster's jherri - curl afro, is far too similar to ""Pulp Fiction"" to merit any praise. Tarantino's work is one of my favorite films of all time, but people have been going to his well way too often. LS&2SB does a better job at it than most, which is nice.

To do that the need guns so buy a couple of antique shotguns from a contact who got them from a couple of Scousers who'd committed a burglary for Hatchet Harry not knowing the guns were the real target of their job. When the jobs start happening things get bloody fast and the body count rapidly climbs.<br/><br/>This, director Guy Richie's film debut, impressively intertwines several plot strands with a large cast of varied underworld types without getting confusing. There are plenty of exciting moments, a lot of violence and a good number of laughs. Sometimes all happening at once such as when a group of hardened criminals armed with shotguns and a Bren gun are pinned down by three posh boys armed with an air rifle! The film looks good with its slight sepia tint and the way it never needs to visit 'tourist London'. The dialogue is sharp and witty, although some may be confused by the slang at times! The characters are solid; all the main characters may be criminals but many of them are still likable, especially the four protagonists. Jason Statham, Dexter Fletcher, Nick Moran and Jason Flemyng impress as Bacon, Soap, Eddy and Tom and the rest of the cast are solid too; the most notable of these is probably ex-footballer Vinnie Jones who proves that he can act rather than just being an example of novelty casting. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to anybody wanting a mixture of violence and wit."

","This film is a legendary classic, and the directorial debut (as well a writing credit) for Guy Ritchie. It's also one of the top UK films ever made. Let's not forget it's also that film that introduced us to superstar Jason Satham. Everything about this film was done to perfection and aside from being a UK film, it's one of my favorite gangster-crime drama/comedy films of all time. This is a must see film for anyone that enjoys a good action film with substance. It was a film ahead of its time and one you need to watch if you haven't already done so. It's a 9/10 from me!"
"ElMaruecan82","8","1","1","14 June 2017"," Some kind of a bloody joke...
","""Shotguns? What, like guns that fire shot?"" ""Oh, you must be the brain of the operation!"" ""What d'you do when you're not buying stereos, Nick? Finance revolutions?<br/><br/>""Sorry, didn't know your father."" ""Never mind son, you just might meet him if you carry on like that."" And I could go on and on, mentioning an epiphora-driven monologue involving the act of killing a Greek whose stupidity might be the one saving grace or some snarky remark about Liberia's deficit in a skyrocket. It all comes down to one observation, if there is one deficit Guy Ritchie's ""Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" doesn't suffer from, is in one-liners. If anything, this is a film that made me aware, in my late teen years, of something called a screenplay. This is the work of a talented screenwriter, there's no doubt about that.<br/><br/>Now, how about the director's perspective? And how about my appreciation, now that I'm twice the age I was when I first saw it? Well, the film still got it, as far as my enjoyment is concerned, but there are a few buts (and I'm not talking of marijuana cigarette butts or the lovely one belonging to that stripper's who caught the attention of Barry the Baptist, before assigning two Northern slobs some theft job involving the two titular barrels).<br/><br/>So, ""but"", I was saying.<br/><br/>I don't know if ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" is more about revealing the talent of a British director making his spectacular and stylish debut, or if it more consolidates the status of an American director as the most defining and influential director of his generation, quite a stunt for someone in his mid-30's. While it is obvious that Ritchie has a great way with words and his screenplay features one of the highest ratio of one-liners per minute from any film, it was still Tarantino who exposed that new vision of the underground world, one that would never be afraid to be offensive and raunchy if laughs were the pay-off.<br/><br/>It was easier to embrace that form of entertainment once it was done, so let's give QT the credit he deserves and get back to Ritchie. Indeed, it would be unfair to associate his 1998 hit film only to the influence of Tarantino, you can actually spot many influences that cover a wide range of cinematic genre and directors, you have a nod to Sergio Leone's ""For a Few Dollars More"", Zorba, you have smart-ass lines like the kind Groucho Marx would deliver, and in fact, the whole movie that seems like a kaleidoscope of all the archetypes nourished from years of movies, poker-games, drug trafficking, caper story, shaggy dog stories and other mix-ups, except that Ritchie used to direct ads' clips.<br/><br/>This might be the one part where he diverges from Tarantino, one started from scratch, mostly through imitating other directors, Ritchie had his own style. And there are instances where you can tell the film is directed like a video clip, or an ad.<br/><br/>""Lock, Stock"" is like a big, boisterous, joke whose only purpose is to entertain, and I respect that, because entertainment is Guy's strongest suit. He doesn't even need a main protagonist, the leading quartet, Eddie, Tom, Soap and Bacon, whose most notable presence is Jason Statham and to a lesser extent Tom Flemyng (but to play fair with the cast, let's mention Jason Flemyng and Dexter Fletcher), these guys are all down-on-their-luck outcasts, with one toe in the criminal world, and another in traffics, so benign it would never raise the attention of Scotland Yard. These guys are so 'inoffensive' really that they're not even affected by the bloody chain of events they caused.<br/><br/>And the whole story relies on the four protagonists' luck when it comes to their mission about getting the money to pay for a debt Harry Hatchet (PH Moriarty), or avoiding to get their fingers cut off by Barry the Baptist (Lenny McLean), or cross the path of Big Chris, convincingly played by former soccer player Vinnie Jones. It is very ironic that the main concerned one don't ever realize what has happened, and no less ironic that Jason Statham, the ultimate tough guy isn't given enough occasion to be the celebrated bad-ass he is. The film is like a private joke between Ritchie and the audience, because what matters is what we see, who cares about the rest. We don't even see the blood, which is a nice touch that keeps this film in a sort of jolly friendly mood.<br/><br/>Ritchie knows we're familiar with all these archetypes and what he does is providing a little twist, never wasting a moment for a wisecrack and a smart-ass line, it's almost a signature in his films. And it works, because he's like Tarantino, he belongs to the generation of directors influenced by other directors but who demonstrate how much of fans they are by adding a touch of modernity, and this modernity is made of close-ups, slow-mo, shootouts, every trope of the action genre. You can call it ""exercise in style"", the term isn't to be used negatively, it's got style, it's fun, energetic and crazy. And it's got a terrific casting, too, but it's mostly for Lenny McLean who died shortly after the film and Vinnie Jones that the film works,, honorable mention too for Van Blackwood who with Nick the Greek, form a nice duo.<br/><br/>This is a film that shows a new face for British movies, one that comes right after ""Trainspotting"", ""The Full Monty"", a popular British type of movies that completes the work of Tarantino. It's a product of its era that encapsulates the level of creativity reached by directors who didn't have much budget, really one of the gems of the 90's."
"tomhart_53","9","1","1","8 June 2017"," 'Robert's your fathers brother.'
","Lock Stock is a superbly put together film. In just under an hour and 45 minutes it will throw you into a corner of London, dominated by thugs, drugs, violence and Cockney slang that you'll never want to leave. From the tight knit main characters to the outsiders in it for a few bob, the films mastery of over-arcing story lines left me laughing out loud and gritting my teeth in suspense. <br/><br/>Guy Ritchie's writing is brilliant throughout; as an Englishman from the north, it felt like the dialogue was in a language I could almost understand, but gave me the warming sense like had I have been a character in the film, I most surely have been out of my depth. <br/><br/>I loved the adventure of it, it's an incredibly immersive film that only my top scoring IMDb rated films are partial to receive. The film has unsurprisingly gone on to be an unmissable classic and should be welcome in almost anyone's film collection. It's a film that i would be happy to watch again and again, and that I likely will, for years to come."
"eric262003","8","1","1","5 December 2016"," Comedy Caper And Crime Guarantees a Good Time
","If you combine Quentin Tarantino movies with a bit of Marx Brothers slapstick humour you get ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"". All you have to do is picture Chico severing your fingers. The quirkiness may be fun to watch, but this comedy crime caper is overwhelmingly wallowing in its complexities and is handled quite efficiently. It comes as an obvious trait that Guy Ritchie used to direct commercials if you noticed a scene where a man is throwing vegetables into the water and we get a close-up to the bottom of the pot. <br/><br/>The plot focuses on a poker star from the rough side of London's East End named Eddy (Nick Moran) who gets hired by three alliances to gamble up his profits to a high stakes game against Hatchet Harry (P.H. Moriarty), who is a kingpin in the gambling a porn industry. Harry uses dirty tactics to win which leaves Eddy in a bind and Harry's guard Benny the Baptist (Lenny McLean) gives these suckers three options,either pay up, take over the pub that's owned by Eddy's father JD (Sting) or get your fingers severed. <br/><br/>So Eddy and his friends snoop on the neighbours in their apartment who happen to be crooks with a master plan to rob from a rich druggie. All this is happening, Barry hires two bumbling thieves to confiscate some authentic antique guns for Harry . The guns wind up in Eddy and his gang, rob the drug money and then the rest of the way needs no further explaining. Or do you if you want me to give away spoilers which I won't. <br/><br/>The movie turned out to be a very successful film back in Britain. In North America it came out first at the Sundance Film Festival. Although it was entertaining fun, you could still get lost in the shuffle due to the confusing plot and the English lingo in a very British film. But after a second viewing, I understood the dialogue better and plot felt less convoluted. <br/><br/>It's safe to say the characters were a little miscast due to the fact that they might be a bit too young and inexperienced for a very gritty film. Unlike Tarantino who in ""Reservoir Dogs"" used veteran performers in his film. Eddy's gang comes across as a bit too youthful to be dealing with scumbags or even running around London with these scamps. And with the neighbours being druggies, it's hard to come by as to who is who. <br/><br/>The more convincing cast members are from the antagonists Harry and Barry and even impressive was the character who played Big Chris (soccer star Vinnie Jones) who was notorious for choking a rival by the balls. But through the mindset of the East End it looks believable in the settings being that it is dark, cold and the scoundrels that surround the area add to the authenticity that London is not all blessed with royalty and fish n chips. <br/><br/>In spite of its dreariness, there is a lot of excitement that comes with this movie. The soundtrack featuring mostly rock music is the perfect choice of the atmosphere. The narration keeps the story to a steady flow and is not afraid to add runaway gags if feel the need to. When Eddy and his gang enter into a pub we see a man in flames staggering at the door. They stare at him concernedly, nod their heads and walk in. The pub they walk into is called Samoa Joe's a spoof of ""Pulp Fiction"" with Big Kahuna Burgers and and Jack Rabbit Slim's restaurant and they're also sipping drinks with the little umbrellas too. <br/><br/>There's a lot of Tarantino influences this movie has to provide and spotting the references can almost feel like a game. That and along with other Hong Kong based film and British noir films of the 1950's. The closest this film comes to a striking resemblance is the 1950 British noir film ""Night and the City"" which is a criminal caper set in the East End and a high stakes kingpin hires a buffed up bodyguard to do his dirty work. <br/><br/>As the film comes to the close you try to decipher what had just transpired. As it turns out the style fairly outweighs the substance and it never tries to deny such claims. We don't care much about the characters (though I was intrigued by the character Barry the Baptist over anyone else). The film's humour factor lies within the style of utilizing freeze frames, witty subtitles and speed-up and slow-motion angles. But it's still a fun slapdash film with exuberance and intrigue so if you can't encode to their English dialect, the characters add enough excitement to overcome that obstacle."

"Horror-yo","7","1","1","21 May 2016"," Tons of fun
","I'm no Guy Ritchie supporter or anything and therefor in reviewing this film I remain more objective than some might be. This here is a heavily English action-comedy, I emphasize its country of origin as some might be too foreign to its cultural tinge and should be mindful of that during its viewing. Slang, talking speed, the attitudes overall...it's definitely different, and this film wasn't made to be a polished flavorless ready-to-sell-internationally item. It's authentic, rough in places but never too much and showcases an effortless (and surprising ?) balance of humor and comedy, along with hard-hitting, raw action. Its main plot is uber simple, but that's totally fine. In fact, it makes it better. Because now the movie has its trigger and the movie-makers can focus on all the rest: the little subplots, the humor, involving other characters and parties to the core of the story, before unleashing an ultimate climax at the end that is, again, very simple, almost too simple; and yet, at the risk of sounding over-complacent, it works - fits that story and mood perfectly. No reason film shouldn't be this way from time to time. Yeah it's simple, but it's effective, lots of fun, runs so smoothly and where it isn't deep and what not, it's highly entertaining, and you can't just make 'highly entertaining' if you don't know movie making."

I've just watched for the 3rd time in my life and indeed, this movie is pretty accurate, the dialogues, how it put you into context, also the way of introducing the characters -something he tried to repeat in Snatch-, the random performance of Sting, also this dark filter in the whole scenography, that gives you this weird feeling of dirty suburbs, of dangerous grey alleys... Is a good representation of London when it comes to the heist sub-genre. Is curious how good it is in comparison to other Ritchie's movies.

","Ritchie uses almost every known British character actor/soap star for his gang romp revolving around the simple premise of some guys owing a gang boss a large amount of money. The cast is impressive you gotta admit, of course you gotta be British to probably get the most from it, but the collection of oddballs and gangsters are all so well performed by the cast, it just shoves the seedy, gritty, dirty Del boy London grim in your face perfectly.<br/><br/>There is certainly a Tarantino style going on throughout as the story tends to twist n turn amongst all the dreary looking locations, the whole film seems to have a brownish tint to it. Almost an enforced grimy hue to really bring the rough dilapidated streets of London to life. To be honest you don't even need to follow the story you just watch it for the continuous use of cockney slang and hints of vicious violence between various ruffians (a case of less is more with the violence), at the same time all this is accompanied by a glorious soundtrack.<br/><br/>A slick cool visage of thugs and wheeler dealers of varying levels of intelligence all mixed with a dark gallows humour that makes you unsure whether to giggle or shy away. The four main characters are a good balance of your classic 'EastEnders' types with a dollop of 'Only Fools n Horses' comedy on top in a world where the Kray brothers could still be walking the streets and where Vinnie Jones as Big Chris brings another level of atmosphere with his final act.

","I watched Snatch way before I watch this one. So the movie is really predictable to me. And with Snatch as my standard for a Guy Ritchie movie, it really isn't any disappointment to see this movie turn out to be beneath the former in terms of overall watching satisfaction. The movie is indeed one that shaped a general image of a Guy Ritchie movie, a greatly funny and ironic crime movie, a heist movie in sub genre. Though the movie being ironic an funny is more or less predictable for me, I was still curious about how the story will unfold. Also the quirky and shady characters developed are the things that add much curiosity to the movie. The acting overall is a great job for me, especially in how the performances feel so natural because they are done by natives. It's quite bad that not all the alumni of this movie's cast made it into bigger stages and careers."

"troyputland","8","1","1","5 June 2015"," Loc, Stock and Christ this is a good film!
","Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is a British film with bona fide, British humour. A bunch of bombastic, mini-stories are unfathomably linked by weed, money and two rare, expensive shotguns. Not the kind of story you hear on a daily basis. Every thug, youth, gangster and pot-head gets equal screen-time. Four Londoners bite off more than they can chew; Eddy (Moran) owes some serious dollar to gangster/porn shop owner Hatchet Harry (Moriarty) after losing in a poker-style card game. Tom (Flemyng), Soap (Fletcher), Bacon (Statham) and Eddy have 500k to find in a week, or they're dead-meat. Their plan? Snatch money from drug dealers who plan to snatch money from drug dealers. Who's involved? An ex-footballer who pulls off thug-life considerably well (Vinnie Jones), a real life bare-knuckle fighter (Lenny McLean), a Russian with anger issues and a couple of naive Scousers that spearhead every scene they're in. The conclusion is catastrophic but highly engrossing; Lock, Stock's black comedy hits all the funny bones in the right places, even with its mildly haphazard narrative. This film is a defining British classic, with an ending more sensational than The Italian Job."
"bowmanblue","10","1","1","31 March 2015"," The best (modern ) British gangster movie
","Yes, we all know that Guy Richie married Madonna and, ever since then, many considered that the quality of his work somehow suffered. However, long before the 'Material Girl' entered his life (and his films even had – unsubtle – hints towards her music) he made films like 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.' And they were good.<br/><br/>Okay, so you'll probably have to be okay with gangster films in general, not to mention plenty of foul language, unlikeable characters, excessive violence and probably some more bad language. If you can overlook all of those then you'll probably enjoy Lock Stock.<br/><br/>They say that the simple ideas are the best and normally they're right. However, Lock Stock is anything but simple. Yes, the story is primarily about four lads who get in deep debt with a particularly unsavoury character, but that's only a small portion of it. There are numerous characters, each with their individual story lines. It just so happens that all of these story lines are somehow relevant to the central story and they all come together perfectly (and possibly violently). Along with the violence, language and nasties, you have to be prepared to concentrate. If you don't, you're likely to miss something vital to the plot and lose track of what's happening.<br/><br/>But, if you do, you'll be rewarded by one of the most darkly comic, twisting tales of backstabbing and double-crossing. And, like I said, it's damn good.<br/><br/>I won't go into the plot too much, simply because it's pretty complicated, but mainly because I wouldn't want to spoil it for anyone. There's so much to be enjoyed about this film, you really have to experience it for yourself.<br/><br/>Not to mention it contains the first ever on-screen appearance of Jason 'The Stath' Statham. What more could you want? You want more? What about the first ever appearance of ex-footballer Vinnie Jones in a role that was simply made for him? It has that, too. You really can't ask for more (unless you want to see someone executed with a s*x toy, but then it has that, too)."

","In their attempts to get out of a jam, the four East End lads seem to be digging themselves deeper into a hole. They decide to pony up a wad of cash and send in their best card player, to a high stakes game in order to bring home some gold. However, their host Hatchet Harry has rigged the game to rook the lads for all they're worth and by the end of the evening, they're half a million in debt. In order to repay Harry, the four hatch a new plan to intercept a shipment of drugs. What follows next is a hilarious series of accidental double- crosses, botched heists and other bungled crimes. And the violence, while always nerve-wracking, is more implied than graphically depicted. Part of the fun of the film is trying to figure out who, if anyone, will be left standing.<br/><br/>The plot is very clever and has a delirious pace that threatens to draw you from your seat at every turn as the fortunes of the protagonists change in flashes, from sky-high to rock bottom. Thus begins a violent, dangerous and funny ride to the unexpected conclusion of the film. Ritchie's camera work is sprightly, and he has a definite rhythm for slang and profanity in his dialogue. His artistic use of freeze- frames, slow motion and other camera trickery proves he is a precocious talent to be reckoned with. He orchestrates the plots and anti-plots with the delight of a sadistic child. Even when the accents are as indecipherable as the plot, Ritchie keeps the action percolating and the humor on high. <br/><br/>This movie is loaded with a troupe of unforgettable larrikins, played with boisterous enthusiasm by a solid, ensemble cast particularly the four who make up the lead quartet of Moran, Flemyng, Fletcher and Statham - they are hilariously dazzling, playing complete screw-ups with believable camaraderie and a kind of goofy charm. They're losers sure, but you will find yourselves rooting for them through every twist and turn. <br/><br/>Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels works beautifully as an exercise in joyful anarchy, an unsentimental roller-coaster ride that is both violent and funny.

","LOCK,STOCK AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS is an amusing and adroitly handled comedy thriller,but with the benefit of hindsight not particularly memorable or profound,and it's considerable success has led to many other British filmmakers like Guy Ritchie himself to churn out innumerable,and eventually,resistible derivative 'mockney' gangster dramas.<br/><br/>At least LOCK,STOCK has the advantage of not taking itself seriously,with the advantages of a clever plot,a decent ensemble cast and satisfying script.So LOCK,STOCK is in fact very enjoyable,but not without faults.One is the overtly jokey,""guns n' geezers"" theme that is an obvious imitation of the style that Quentin Tarantino carried off so successfully in his first two films (RESERVOIR DOGS,PULP FICTION);Ritchie is not as subtle,electing to indulge in some shoot-em-up action that often comes across as knockabout slapstick,and the toughest gangsters on show here considerably lack both the terrifying menace and scatological wit that QT achieved with such style.There is also the undeniable feeling that Ritchie seems overwhelmingly pleased with his own directorial bravado,with it's various visual flourishes and narrative tricks,which superficially entertain but seem rather shallow and pointless soon afterwards.And Vinny Jones' much vaunted appearance is not so much acting as a continuation of his Wimbledon FC 'Crazy Gang' persona,with it's manufactured,exaggerated machismo.Mr.Jones abilities as a actor are identical to those he had as a footballer: fairly effective,but in a crude,heavy-handed manner.But like his soccer career,Jones has managed considerable and unexpected success as a big-screen performer,despite critical apathy and adulation that is rather out of shape and proportion to his aptitude as a thespian.<br/><br/>LOCK,STOCK is still fine entertainment despite these concerns,though Ritchie since has become increasingly carried away with his follow-ups;SNATCH had it's merits but was even more bloatedly self-indulgent and ostentatious,and SWEPT AWAY and REVOLVER were considerable box-office and critical mishaps.Ritchie can direct alright,but with more humility and less attempts at flagrant exhibitionism he may be more appreciated and respected universally. I hope my doubts about him can be dislodged one day;his chances are running out.<br/><br/>RATING:7 out of 10."

","I'm not normally one for violent films - the only other one I really liked was ""Reservoir Dogs"" - but this one was such great fun despite the blood-splatter and the overall nastiness meted out to everybody. The story felt a bit like last man standing, and definitely a mythical look at life in the East End (""EastEnders"" being another). But hugely enjoyable to watch and I really didn't care which side would come out left standing and alive. I've always had a bit of a crush on Dexter Fletcher when he was in Derek Jarman's Caravaggio as a 20-something but he hasn't aged well 20 years on. Mind you, neither has Sean Bean, who was also in Caravaggio. But I digress. Sting definitely is a great actor and his eye close ups looked scary and creepy. But the real hero of the story is Vinnie Jones, who as a doting father just made me laugh out loud when chiding his son for using bad language while perpetrating the most sickening violence himself.

However last night for some reason or another I sat down and watched it and yes it really was that dame good . The dialogue was classy , the jokes hit the spot and I did find it to be some what addictive viewing . This film goes up there with Pulp Fiction , it does require a close following to but once you get sucked in , trust me you will love every second of it ! The plot is wacky , the ride that follows after that is a barrel of laughs . The main character's are not trying to go OTT on acting like hard men but it flows naturally even their dim-witted behaviour . I would say that my favourite characters would have to be Soap for his witty comments especially when it come to knives , Vinnie Jones who seems to play a very questionable roll model to his son as his line of work is not totally kosher but my absolute favourite has to be the football loving yardie Rory Breaker played with brilliance by Vas Blackwood (His I'll kill ya speech just can't stop making me laugh ) . This one Britian's finest exports , highly entertaining stuff , not to be missed with plenty of reply value , but thats what you would expect from the man who gave you Snatch . I would like to say more but I feel that will be killing the buzz of movie , so just check it out for your-self .<br/><br/>LOCK , STOCK AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS : 8.3 OUT OF 10<br/><br/>FOR NOW THIS IS THE SHADOWMAN WISHING YOU GOODNIGHT AND GOOD LUCK ."

","Now I've seen just about everything. After watching Snatch last week I thought movies couldn't get any funnier than that. Well, I was most certainly wrong. They can, and Lock Stock Two Smoking Barrels has. The array of its dynamic scene proportion is just amazing. At first you can barely follow the storyline since there are so many characters present and so many plots, that keep getting more and more complex. But as the time passes, it all comes to logical disentanglement. Camera moves strictly according to the momentary state of the character in momentum.<br/><br/>Though actors were unfamiliar to me, they did their part one hundred percent flawlessly. Their lines are absolutely hilarious, yet clinging to the edge of tasteless swearing. However ending seems rather confusing, since audience doesn't get to see whether its happy or.... well a bit less happy. My judgement tells me this is a solid nine and I hope to see more movies in such genre in future."

"mayur_goyal","Null","1","1","30 November 2002"," fast paced and sometimes ridiculous events strung together with seemingly natural developments
","Lock, Stock ... and Snatch - these two masterpieces of Guy Ritchie have a common format: fast paced and sometimes ridiculous events strung together with seemingly natural developments. Both of these movies tend to explore the London underworld and they have made me believe that this underworld is really small - any action taken by any goon affects the whole scheme of things. With a plethora of characters, Guy Ritchie spins such a web of events that beyond a point of time, I stopped trying to remember the origin of any development and just soaked in the fast paced beauty of the current sequence - whether it is (black) comedy or gore or a music video on techno-beats. These movies have a very cynical tone - things never go the way they should, or, more correctly, the way the characters would like them to go. The resulting despair leads to more things going wrong until the whole mess of characters clears up with the help of enough bloodshed. Whether it is a squeaky ball eaten up by a mobster's dog resulting in a squeak whenever the dog tries to bark (Snatch) or a gangster making a totally one-sided deal with two street smart goons to steal antique guns (Lock, Stock .) or a self-confident pea-brained monster of a goon beaten up to death by a small gypsy (Snatch) or a whole gang of mobsters annihilated by a victim's drugged girlfriend who stumbles upon a machinegun (Lock, Stock .), the dry and dark humor inherent in almost every sequence makes these movies very different and interesting.<br/><br/>Both the movies have mostly British and talented ensemble of actors. Direction, film editing and presentation are very music-video-ish at times and that adds to the chic and youth nature of the movies.<br/><br/>These movies are recommended for those who a) want to indulge themselves with fast paced, dry and bloody comedy, or b) want to learns the tricks of the trade of London underworld"

","It is impossible these days to make a funny and exciting crime movie without Pulp Fiction and Quentin Tarantino comparisons.  So with the obvious similarities aside, it is safe to say that Guy Ritchie's movie has brought new life and new twists to the genre, and succeeded where so many other clones have failed.  Some of the reviews I read before seeing this movie complained of a plotline too complicated and dialogue too accent thick as hindrances to understanding the movie.  Three things, first of all, don't underestimate the audience, I had no trouble following the plotline. Anyone who watches Seinfeld, with its separate plotlines coming together at the end, will get it.  The accents I got used to quickly, Amercian audiences loved Trainspotting which had even thicker accents, so that's not a problem. Lastly, complete understanding of the plotline is secondary in a movie like this.  This movie is about comedy, high-energy fun and Ritchie's innovative style that, instead of coming off as showy and unnecessary, puts the right frame around things and keeps the eyes glued to the screen and the butts in the seats."

","England has Lock, Stock, And Two Smoking Barrels... what does America have? Pulp Fiction. Says it all really. Unlike Pulp Fiction, LSTSB is actually funny, entertaining, and it coincides with things that happen in real life. The score music makes it as funny as hell, and the dialogue is so riveting that listening to the film from start to finish is almost mandatory. When was the last time you saw an American crime story with these attributes?<br/><br/>At it's heart, LSTSB is a story of four young men who invest their money in a card game that turns out to be rigged, and they wind up owing five times their investment. They then have a week to come up with the cash before they start losing fingers. But what really makes this film is the myriad of stories that are interwoven with this central theme. The grass-growing hippies, the thugs who plan to rob them, and the insane black crimelord who actually employs them are the main ones here. Then there's the bumbling idiots who are employed by the crimelord our four heroes owe money to, who are entrusted with the task of stealing antique shotguns. Oh, and let's not forget the machinations of Big Chris, who spends most of the film being so polite to the people he's employed to rough up that it immediately brings up images of ""Chopper"" Read. Trying to find good guys amongst this lot is somewhat like trying to find a good Tarantino film.<br/><br/>The best part of the film is undoubtedly Rory Breaker's conversation with Nick The Greek, the one in which he finds an affinity for repeating ""I'll kill ya!"" several times. But unlike most American films where everyone is vying for their unfair share of clever dialogue, everyone gets a chance to say something funny in this film and it all flows together so smoothly like a mid-1970s David Bowie album.<br/><br/>The best way to watch LSTSB is in groups, with the sort of people who don't normally watch British movies.

Can anyone out there honestly say that this is otherwise? 2) the script is equally crap. The story is an amalgamation of every gangster film you've ever seen, totally unoriginal, and the characters are so jaw-droppingly cliched as to stagger belief! I could just about take the Cockney wide boys, the naive students and the nasty neighbours, but what on earth were those two Northerners all about????? 3) I'm told that there were elements of comedy in the film - I, frankly, found it as amusing as those terrible, bland sitcoms we Brits are so good at making these days. I've seen more sophisticated humour in an episode of Sesame Street! 4) and the direction was way over the top - if you want to know how to be flash, Mr Ritchie, I suggest you go back and watch the real masters (again, since you so obviously pinched many bits straight from the likes of Scorsese..!).<br/><br/>In conclusion, it's no points for LS&TSB, and a bottle of cider for the marketing men, who seemed to convince enough of you that this was a ""with it"" film.<br/><br/>Cool?

Even three stars is probably at least one too many. First off: it seemed to take forever to get going. I kept thinking, when is the story going to start? Second: I couldn't separate the various gangs --- they all looked more or less the same, and spoke in the same incomprehensible patter, dull, witless and obscene. Three: the whole thing felt like a continuous rip-off of earlier films. Not homage, simple-minded rip-off. The ending was so strongly reminiscent of The Italian Job, I could hardly credit it. After reading the one-star reviews I now recognise the lifts from countless other gangster movies, all better than this one. One constant cliché in English crime movies is the lovable criminal Cockney, nearly always incompetent. Personally, I find Cockneys, real as well as cinematic, uniformly unlovable. The Long Good Friday I thought was a very bad film, and this reminded me of it. LSTSM also reminded me, sadly, of True Romance, which is a great, great film.<br/><br/>I was glad to see that many of the negative reviews come from British reviewers: they are not fooled.

","Gangster films have never had the same pedigree in Britain that they have long enjoyed in America. Part of the reason is that the formative years of Hollywood in the twenties and early thirties coincided with the growth of organised crime fuelled by Prohibition, a period when the doings of Al Capone and his contemporaries provided a rich source of inspiration for film-makers. Another part of the reason is that during this period the British Board of Film Censors tended to discourage home- made gangster movies. This form of censorship owed little to moral concerns about violence- the BBFC were quite happy to allow cinemas to show American crime flicks- and a good deal to political considerations. British governments, of all political complexions, liked to play down any suggestion that the country had a serious organised crime problem. (And, by American standards, it didn't).<br/><br/>There have been a few isolated British gangster films which have achieved classic status- ""Brighton Rock"", ""Get Carter"", ""The Long Good Friday""- but nothing on the scale of, say, the ""Godfather"" trilogy or ""Road to Perdition"". There have also been a few great British films noirs, but they often (as in, say, ""It Always Rains on Sunday"" or ""The Third Man"") featured criminals who operated as lone wolves rather than as part of a mob. <br/><br/>""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" is another, more recent, British gangster film for which some have claimed classic status. The title is a play on the phrase ""lock, stock and barrel"", literally referring to three parts of a gun but having the colloquial meaning in British of ""everything"" or ""the whole lot"". There is also a reference to the use by criminals of double-barrelled shotguns as weapons, and to a plot by one of the characters in the film to acquire a pair of valuable antique guns.<br/><br/>The plot is a complicated one, involving several interconnected sub- plots and several gangs of criminals. The main story involves Eddy, a young member of one of these gangs who loses £500,000 in a rigged poker game. Needing money urgently pay off his debts, he and his friends decide to rob another gang, who operate from the flat next door. This other gang, in turn, are planning to rob a gang of drug dealers. ""Hatchet"" Harry, the gangster to whom Eddy owes the money, is also the one with his eye on the antique guns, and engages Gary and Dean, a pair of Liverpudlian criminals, to steal them. (The two prove hopelessly incompetent; the film was obviously made from a London viewpoint and Guy Ritchie was using them to make a few digs at Northerners in general, and the people of Liverpool in particular. Gary and Dean habitually call all Southerners ""southern fairies"", even though those they insult in this way are generally far more ruthlessly efficient than they are). <br/><br/>I have found it difficult to take Ritchie seriously as a director ever since I saw his ""Swept Away"", an appropriately titled vanity project which had the unintended consequence of sweeping away his then wife Madonna's acting career. (She has not dared to make another film since). ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" is certainly not as bad as that steaming pile of trash- very few films in cinematic history ever have been- but on the other hand I find myself unable to acclaim it as the classic which some people regard it as.<br/><br/>There are several problems with the film. The first is that the storyline is over-complicated and difficult to follow- it is hard to keep track of who is in which gang, who is planning to rob whom, and how, when and why. The second is that the film never really decides what it wants to be. At times, particularly during the scenes involving Gary and Dean or the effeminate if murderous drug dealer Rory Breaker, it is so far over the top that it seems more like a black comedy than a serious crime drama. At other times, particularly during those scenes that end with a pile of corpses littering the floor, it seems very serious indeed. The third main problem is that there are no characters with whom the viewer can identify. Apart from a young child and a traffic warden who appears briefly, just about every character we see is either a criminal or an associate of criminals. And that's not ""criminal"" as in ""loveable rogue"". That's ""criminal"" as in ""homicidal thug"". We are invited to identify with Eddy and his friends, largely because they (unlike most of the other characters) never actually kill anybody, but as their activities include drug-dealing and robbery I found such identification difficult to accomplish.<br/><br/>The film was rather better on the acting side; there is a very assured performance from Vinnie Jones, as Harry's debt collector Big Chris. The film marked the start of a new career as an actor for Jones, a former Wales international footballer, who has gone on to act in a number of movies and television programmes since. (It also saw the film debut of another international sportsman turned actor, the one-time diver Jason Statham). I also liked P. H. Moriarty as Harry and the late Lenny McLean as his enforcer Barry the Baptist, whose nickname refers not to his religious affiliation but to his habit of drowning people. Nevertheless, I found this a film which is just too blasé and insouciant about needless criminal violence. It leaves a nasty taste in the mouth. 4/10"

","This movie was not all bad but I just don't think it was as good as lets say Snatch or something. The actors all did a really good job and there was some exciting parts but the story line kind of just lost it for me.<br/><br/>This movie is about 4 British working class stiffs who pool their money together to play a high stakes card game. However something goes wrong and all the sudden they are in debt half a million pounds and they only have one week to come up with the money.<br/><br/>This movie was good it was just nothing special. It was kind of slow at parts and when the action finally did come I was disappointed with it. The later Guy Ritchie movies are definitely better in my opinion."

","At the time this film was hailed as a revolution in homegrown Brit film making. From now on we would be churning out film after flim full of rough voiced cockneys killing one another and saying 'slaaaag a lot'. America would begin to find estuary accents fascinating and unlimited funding would flow from the Land of the Free to independent filmakers based in Soho and Noting Hill. Of course nothing of the sort happened.In reality 'Lock, Stock...' was a dead end that resulted in even worse imitators('Shoreditch' or 'Circus'anyone?).It was compared by Lads Lifestyle Mag editors to 'The Italian Job' though the staff of Loaded overlooked the curse that they were handing out. The earlier film will always be a good way to kill two hours on a Sunday afternoon, but it will never play in Poughkeepsie.To be fair it did get Guy Ritchie a sexy Missus and Vinnie jones will never have to do Gladiators again but who of note has actually been influenced by this film? It was done better before and has been done worse since."
"iaido","5","3","6","18 February 2000"," Over-rated. Too inspired. But, not all the way worthless.
","Surprisingly hyped, mediocre, but relatively entertaining film. Curious as a cult hit and pretty big splash over seas, but i found it to amount to nothing more than another hip gangster film clone. Pulp Fiction mined such territory perfectly, and Lock, Stock... belongs with all those other pale imitators like 3 Days in the Valley and Things to do in Denver... I guess the British gobbled it up because it was something they could call their own, something hip instead of another bland Merchant-Ivory tea cozy film.<br/><br/>The whole hip modern gangster genre lends itself to such cookie cutter plotting. They all become far too obvious. Basically, every character in Lock, Stock... is a thug, and every character has bits of humor laced in. They can all be divided into two camps-the likeable small time criminals like our protagonists, and the menacing underworld figures like Hatchet Harry, Big Chris (though he's on the intimidating AND likeable side because of his son), and Rory Breaker. All in all, most of the characters have very little in terms of development, most are just caricatures, and are defined, more less, just by their cool sounding names. <br/><br/>The chain reaction of events is about the only thing that holds the film together. As disappointing the characters and story may be, you still can't help but want to see how it all comes to a head at the conclusion.<br/><br/>Ritchie didn't strike me as any great wunderkind. The story does have its moments, but it doesn't feel original. (example: the unexpected, ""guy gets hit by a car out of nowhere"" was already used in Pulp Fiction, and, as some might not know,Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia and the novella Perdita Durango)File it under, I've seen all it before, and better. Directing-wise he falls prey to relying on the same devices to the point of becoming tiresome (the slo motion, the tracking shot scenes, ect.), and any personal flair he may have suffers under this reliance. He didnt strike me as very special, like, say, Hard Eight did for P.T Anderson, Bad Taste with Peter Jackson, or other such debuts.  The look of the film- As a photographer, I personally hold much disdain for the whole harsh lighting thing he uses in indoor scenes. Grainy film is great, but the overexposure and sheen that the lighting gives turns my stomach.<br/><br/>Best character- the strong presence of Vinnie Jones as Big Chris. Worst character- Vas Blackwood as Rory Breaker, who in no way intimidated or impressed me as the film so much desired him too."

","I'm not really surprised that this film is popular with the under 45 crowd. I suppose, regrettably, that this is the direction filmmaking is heading.  I call it Action X (typified by Pulp Fiction) because it is a genre unto itself loved by Generation X.  It is a combination of Action/Adventure, Film Noir, and Horror laced with bizarre characters, offbeat themes, sick humor and lots of irony.  Personally, I don't find it very entertaining, but I have to give it credit for creativity and boldness.<br/><br/>If there is one area I have to compliment in this film it is the direction. Excellent, daring photography, scenes well thought out, lots of interesting stuff happening on the screen.  I gave this a 6 only because it was so well directed.  The script was clever, but pointless and if there was any theme to the story it was that stupid people tend to do stupid things and end up dead, except our heroes who do stupid things and are just lucky enough to get away with it.<br/><br/>Though I understand the film's appeal, I guess I just can't appreciate a film that uses excellent filmmaking technique to produce a product so unrefined."

"MartinHafer","9","2","4","30 January 2014"," A lot like ""Snatch"" but with fewer laughs.
","Considering that this film was written and directed by Guy Ritchie, it's certainly not very surprising that it is strongly reminiscent of ""Snatch""--another one of Ritchie's film. Obviously, he did well with ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" and decided to repeat the formula for his next film. Both have very dark and dry senses of humor, a lot of bad guys (nothing but bad guys), bad language and crude material all wrapped up in an incredibly stylish package. You like one film, you'll like the other. You hate one, you'll hate the other.<br/><br/>This film is about several groups of idiot criminals who all converge. There are the incredibly stupid and burn-out drug dealers, the tough guys who plan to rob them AND a third group that plans to rob the second group once they've committed the robbery. In addition, you have some super-scary baddies--super-scary indeed. Who will survive with all these guns, knives and swords being wielded? And, speaking of guns, two of the shotguns used in the robbery MIGHT just be worth more than all the stuff they steal--but the dummies don't even realize it.<br/><br/>This film is, above all else, very stylish and weird. The criminals DEFINITELY have odd and quirky personalities but more importantly, the camera-work and edits are very well done--very innovative and they get your attention. It's all very well worth seeing but it's also NOT a film for everyone. Of course, you shouldn't let your kids, your mother or Father Jenkins watch it. But to enjoy it yourself you need a very high threshold for this sort of thing. It certainly AIN'T rated G! However, despite the very harsh language and very adult subject matter, Richie actually doesn't show that much of the violence. It happens--but mostly off-camera.<br/><br/>By the way, of the two similar films, I slightly prefer ""Snatch"" simply because it tried harder to be overtly funny--though the nihilistic ending in ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" was priceless. Also, as I watched the film and heard a bazillion bullets being discharged, it's interesting that no police EVER responded to any of the locations!"

But for his directorial debut, Guy Ritchie directs Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels in a confidently stylish manner coupled with entertaining dialogue, an amusing sense of humour, a decent plot and a hilarious, yet mildly ambiguous ending."

","Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is a good film by Guy Ritchie. it took me personally a while to understand the plot until it got interesting, I believe one of the flaws is with all the minor characters who don't do much and don't serve the film. I feel kind of a relief that most of them died cause what would have been the point to keep everyone alive. with all that being said the actors were great and did a fine job (i love jason statham and dexter fletcher) and there is a nice little twist at the that makes the movie end perfectly.

"julacislak","10","0","0","5 May 2020"," A classic from Ritchie's golden era
","This is Guy Ritchie's first feature-length movie, and it's a nearly flawless one. The premise seems quite simple, but the execution is top notch, and it's all written perfectly.<br/><br/>In the first scenes we meet our protagonists - Bacon, Eddy, Soap and Tom. While they serve as the movie's heroes, there's an abundance of other characters, which are equally important to the story. It's important to pay attention to everything that happens on screen, because it's all connected.<br/><br/>The movie doesn't have an all-star cast, as we may expect, but we see some very familiar names, like Sting or Jason Statham. All characters are created in a great way, with a unique personality, and there are no unimportant ones who bring nothing to the plot.<br/><br/>Another great thing that Ritchie mastered since the very beginning is knowing exactly where to land a joke. This movie is full of dark comedy, with some characters being mainly a comedic relief, but it doesn't lose its soul. The drama is still here, as well as blood and death.<br/><br/>The cherry on top is the ending. The choice to end it in that exact moment was the best that could be made, and the ambiguity is a fitting way for this story to end.<br/><br/>The only thing that bothered me during the first viewing was the brown-yellowish filter applied during almost every scene. Fortunately, I soon got used to it as it's so well done it creates an illusion of it being the natural light. I think the purpose was to highlight the dirty, urban setting and if I'm correct then it does its job really well."

","At first sight, it feels similar to ""Guess the Train"", but it looks better than ""Guess the Train"". This is the debut film of British director Garage, also translated as ""Two Big Smokers"", which is 107 minutes long. The brand-new British new movie, formerly known as ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"", was found on the Internet and found to be an English saying, which translates to ""eliminate and fight""
The director's shooting style is avant-garde and unique. When you feel good after reading it and feel that there are still some areas that you don't understand, the cool elements always stay in your mind for a long time.
Several highlights of this film:
1. The language is cool.
All actors have a strong London accent, mixed with boring, interesting English proverbs.
2. Visually cool.
The use of lens and character modeling design are quite fashionable and modern. The use of slow-motion, close-up, and reverse shots produces visual effects with unlimited imagination. The editing is clean and easy, and the rhythm is bright and comfortable.
3. Music is cool.
Films are playing very exciting music from the beginning to the end. British rock, heavy metal, punk, and jazz are all included. It is really enjoyable with eyes and ears.
4. Cool structure.
The plot of is complex but not chaotic, and the development of the plot is quirky and not absurd. Several gangs intertwined dramatically, forming an exciting plot.
5. The ending is cool.

"zeekwunlau","8","0","0","5 May 2020"," Turn absurdity into reality
","This movie is undoubtedly brilliant, no matter the plot concept, shooting skills, voiceover settings are inherited works. But after watching this movie, my biggest feeling is that the director not only told a wonderful little character counterattack, but also involved the absurdity of human existence as a social animal.
Human society is built on the group of people, but each individual person has an independent consciousness. This makes it almost impossible for individuals in a complicated social group to master the complete situation, and everyone is analyzing and even taking actions through their own logical judgment, which undoubtedly complicates the relationship again. Absolute authority can be established to combat repression, and on the other hand, mutual benefit can be achieved through cooperation. And once the relationship breaks, the real existence that those people think will be wiped out in vain.
The reason for the existence of dramatic scenes in this movie is that the interests of money establish the connection between these people. The ""big men"" control and squeeze the small people through violent suppression, and the collection of actions of the small people at the same time eventually leads to the reversal of the entire event. The turning point is the decay of human life. Therefore, the key basic point is that the means by which human beings establish relationships, if the relationship is established by ""death to death"", then there will be a ""people not afraid of death"" and take risks, if the relationship is established on the basis of relative relaxation and mutual benefit There may be completely different results, but this is inevitable. So maybe human nature cannot be taken seriously."

","They say this for film making, when you have money the production value increases and when you dont have money it encourages creativity. I dont know if that was precisely the case for Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. However, this movie is a lesson in film making.
This Guy Ritchie classic is experimental in many ways. The way it tells the story, the cuts, the camera angles and the script, it all feels fresh for a 1998 film. In many ways this film has changed the way films got made thereafter. I believe an entire generation is indebted to Guy Ritchie for changing storytelling, camera angles and scripts in cinema forever. The story of a few small time crooks and some gangsters and how their actions cross each others paths. This could be made into a serious drama. But throw in a brilliant script, loads of humour, some impeccable coming timing and an outstanding yet brave direction and what you get is a laugh riot, you wish, never ends.

","Stupidity can be a saving grace, for such an unfortunate state of mind causes the unexpected to happen (wisdom and foolishness are much alike, for both are indifferent to the opinions of the world). In the violent, testosterone laden underworld of London several unhinged, inexperienced and desperate characters tempt fate in this manner. They pool their resources and talents in the hope of winning a high stakes poker game. Of course, it does not go as planned and they find themselves at the mercy of thugs, bounty hunters, loan sharks, mobsters and other assorted wankers. Multiple people converge on a single target, and the smartest - or dumbest - will emerge from the fray.<br/><br/>Guy Ritchie has a pulse on the dark humor, snarky characters and viciousness of the London underworld and it is fascinating and thrilling to behold. This low-budget first film brought him fame and comparisons to Tarantino. Insults fly as much as bullets. The soundtrack, including the Stone Roses, is quite good.

","I can totally see why this film has such a great reputation. It's quick-on-its-feet (well, once the first forty minutes or so have passed), violent and also doesn't take itself too seriously. in fact, I'd say this is as much of a comedy as it is a crime drama. The situations the characters get themselves in are pretty absurd, and the whole thing hinges on coincidence and a kind of wild spiralling-out-of-control-of-circumstance taht, although a bit unbelievable, just works for telling this kind of story. <br/><br/>What's more, the script is witty as hell and absolutely bursting with great one-liners and scathing put-downs. I found the cadence of the dialogue to be almost lulling, and all the actors delivered their lines with convictiona nd clarity that I find lacking in some of the US films of similar type. Nevertheless, I think fans of the Breaking Bad TV series might enjoy this, as I found some of the elements to be similar, and, as in taht series, at times I felt like I was watching an episode of The Three Stooges instead of a serious crime flick. That's not meant to be a slag against BB or this movie, but just a reflection of just how absurd these things can get.<br/><br/>And really, I think the absurdity is rather welcome. Crime movies can be such dreary affairs nowadays; I think the levity is appreciated. Also, no police characters, just a bunch of hoods and old-timer crooks with names like ""Soap"", ""Bacon"", ""Barry the baptist"" and ""Dog"". I can't think of a bad performance here and even Sting, of all people, has a small role and doesn't let the side down (god, I'll never forget him in Dune!).<br/><br/>The music is all extremely well-chosen rock and soul tunes, too, and I dug all of it, especially the james Brown and Stooges. The whole film feels very honest and sincere despite its general silliness, and I enjoyed the hell out of it. I also love the ambiguous ending and am glad taht noone has yet interpreted it as an open interpretation to ""hey, let's make a sequel!"" Good work, fellas."

I never anticipated that would like this film to such an extent. It's a genuine lumpy, wrongdoing satire? It's actually difficult to put this film into a specific kind since it truly does its own thing and advantages from that."

","Ritchie's feature film debut and very similar in themes and outlook to his next film, Snatch. A film about dubious criminals, simple souls, odd happenstances, bloody brutality and tongue-in-cheek crime comedy.<br/><br/>The story goes that a group of four friends end up owing money to the biggest, meanest and baddest crime lord in town. To solve this conundrum they decide to rob their next door neighbours, who just happen to be gangsters planning a big heist against a local bunch of weed cultivators. There's also a pair of antique shotguns floating around. Hence the name.<br/><br/>Ritchie's signature flair shines through even this early on. The film is full of inventive camera angles, nonchalant character reactions and certain attitude that to me resembles an odd mixture of pro wrestling and 40s pulp adventure. Everyone, and I mean everyone, is a Character with a capital C. Everyone is playing a role, everyone is posturing, yet everyone is at least a bit clueless and oddly sincere in their interactions. It's at the same time ridiculous and utterly endearing.<br/><br/>Still, compared to Snatch, this is a lesser film. The plot is nowhere near as snappy, the cinematography doesn't have the reproductive organs to go all the way and for some reason the whole film uses this awful brown filter, which makes the film look like it crawled through the London sewer system.<br/><br/>Is it worth a watch? Absolutely! It's just that Snatch pulls it off even better. Watch both if you can, but if you can only watch one, this is not the one."

"ariwebbkatanos","8","0","0","13 March 2018"," Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels by Guy Ritchie
","I was finally introduced to this film in March of this year by a friend, alongside it's successor film, Snatch. Since then I've viewed the film a total of three times, and I've finally come to point of being able to a compile a critical review. I've taken time to handle it properly, as this is understandably a cult classic and has warranted a lot of good reviews.<br/><br/>I believe that Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is a charming movie that achieves a lot despite it's low budget. It contains standout performances and creative cinematography at times, but holds it's failings in both of those departments as well. The movies' strongest attributes are it's tone, plot and pacing, and doesn't actually contain too many issues aside from sound design and one or two plot holes. Overall, I think Lock, Stock is one of the best British comedies I've seen in a while.<br/><br/>There are numerous other little issues I also took up with the film, but a great deal of them owed largely to the films low budget. On that note, a lot of the effects and visuals that would disappoint on a higher budget actually work impressively considering the films constraints on money. Considering the debatable aspects surrounding criticizing budgeted effects, I'll opt to leave those criticisms out of my review.<br/><br/>Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels was produced in 1998 but largely defies time period in it's cinematography and design. It's rustic color palette and noticeable film grain place it more often in the era of the 1970s. But Cinematography in Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels in general is a hit and miss. The film contains some amazing sequences, especially during action scenes and the infamous card game which sets off the entire plot. This is excellent, as the parts of the movie that seriously matter are almost all given a good level of film quality, but the same cannot be said for the scenes in between. Conversations between characters, especially those with shots that go back and forth are at best unoriginal and at worst so awkward that they can detract from the largely superb writing. And with dialogue being a supreme feature in this film (might I mention since it is especially lacking in visual storytelling), not having the cinematographic quality to go hand it hand with the quips often leaves me wanting.<br/><br/>Speaking of dialogue, the films plot and script are the greatest aspect it has to offer. At no point in the film does the consistent back and forth between the ensemble cast end or lose it's magic. It's no surprise that the film is ranked as one of the most quotable films to come out of Britain's comedy market. The plot, for the most part, is an easy to understand but still complex web of connecting lines bringing the entire set of characters together through a special and sometimes dubious set of circumstances. It's a rather fun joy ride to sit through and track even through multiple viewings, and even by my third viewing, there were small details in both dialogue and occasionally visual cues that I missed out on. The film also doesn't hold the viewers hand too much, despite an admittedly helpful narration, and plot points that can confound first time viewers are always smoothly resolved by the end of the film. The characters themselves are unique and often relatable, despite being brought down by amateur acting skills at times. They're written with a decent degree of complexity and some little details I only noticed, once again, in re-watches.<br/><br/>But on the note of characters and their actors, the acting in this film is much like cinematography as it quite often hits and misses, but on a much more prevalent scale than the former. While the film no doubt contains some all star performances, it is quite often brought down by stale delivery by unemotional actors as well. Jason Statham, Vinnie Jones and Steve Mackintosh all add to the film with great performances, and give the movie a good backbone despite the lacking work from actors with more screen time like Nick Moran and Lenny McLean. Overall the bad performances in the film are largely put in the shade by the aforementioned writing skills of Guy Ritchie. I'm not an expert of music so I haven't take the time to check out the movies soundtrack but nonetheless it is certainly well put together. I found that they were very suitable for the movies subject matter and blended well with the overall finished product. This, however, was brought down by the small issue of sound design in weapons and environments.<br/><br/>Some of the other things I enjoyed before concluding: The pace is great, lighting is great and visual effects are notably decent for what they were. One more thing I didn't enjoy is the occasional plot points scattered about, but none are serious enough to hurt my rating.<br/><br/>In summary, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is an entertaining crime comedy that accomplishes quite a lot despite it's budget. While it is damaged by acting, cinematography, sound design and plot holes, none of these things are significant enough to damage the overall experience too much. Through multiple watches I found that there was things that I only noticed later on, along with the fact that the comedy still holds strong no matter how many times you ingest the quips. Watch out for my review of Snatch, coming soon. I'm happy leaving the movie with an 8/10."

","I heard very little before seeing this movie.  I was just told by my friends that it's the best film to come from England since ""THE FULL MONTY"" and that it's great!  So, I put on my Dr. Martin's boots, put in my collection of English Pop Music from the 80's and early 90's (New Order, OMD, The Farm, Madness, etc.) and got into my English mood.  After seeing this movie, I was pleased, very very pleased!  I think this movie is better and more exciting than the current #1 film at the box office, ""THE MATRIX."" ""LOCK STOCK & TWO SMOKING BARRELS"" has different stories.  They range from losing a huge bet during a poker game, two clumsy thieves stealing two antique shot-guns, a gang of young men figuring out on how to get 500,000 Pounds to a mob boss by Sunday, another gang planing on stealing money from weed dealers, and so on. This has been done many times, PULP FICTION is the most famous version, 2 DAYS IN THE VALLEY was the most underrated, and GO is the most recent.  But what makes this film work?  Simple, the characters, the stories, the rich dark humor, and the directing.  You actually care about these characters, you wonder on what's going to happen to them next.  I was amazed to see YOUNG SHERLOCK HOLMES Nichols Rowe on screen after not seeing him for almost 15 years.  But if anyone stands out with their character or acting, it would be Vinnie Jones playing ""Big Chris"" the hit-man for the Mob Boss Harry ""Hatchet"" Lonsdale. He brings his son who's about ten years old along during his work, ""Big Chris"" even allows his son to watch him beat up on a person, but he won't allow him to swear or to blasphemy. Along with other great U.K. films ""TRAINSPOTTING"" ""THE COMMITMENTS"" ""THE FULL MONTY"" ""WAKING NED DIVINE"" ""MONA LISA"" ""THE KRAYS"" ""THE LONG GOOD FRIDAY"" and all of the Monty Python films.  ""LOCK STOCK & TWO SMOKING BARRELS"" proves that you can always rely on the English for great entertainment. Don't miss it!!  ***** out of ***** (Five stars out of five)"

","This film is one of the best I have seen.  It's a refreshing change from the kind of unoriginal Hollywood action films that are always released.  The plot is so confusing it took loads of people two times to understand it, and the way it portrays Cockney Gangsters is brilliant.  Big Chris (Vinnie Jones) is the best character, followed by the Traffic Warden, and the two useless fat gangsters who initially steal the antique shotguns.  The best scene is the one where the girl (who had been asleep) picks up a 5ft long machine gun and empties the magazine."

","The Tarantino influence is very strong here.  The sub-plots are all connected and the episodes seem to jump about in an unpredictable fashion. There are some funny bits, but the story line is hard to follow, mostly because it doesn't make a whole lot of sense.  Four louts assemble a very large sum of money so they can be cheated out of even more in a super-high-stakes poker game.  They are threatened with all sorts of physical harm if they don't produce the preposterous amount they ""owe."" Other hoodlums are plotting other crimes for other reasons and they all wind up victimizing or killing one another.  The most surprising thing is that any of these cretins could victimize or kill anybody.  Since it is all played for laughs, I suppose no real harm is done by the totally unbelievable plot, but not much good comes of it either."

","`Lock, Stock, And Two Smoking Barrels' Guy Ritchie's debut film is perfect for people who don't see many movies, or are incredibly jaded about the current non-originality of 1999 Hollywood. But I see too many films, and I crave clichés.<br/><br/>You could say that this film was simply not for me.  When people bring up a Quentin Tarantino influence to gangster films, I cringe and feel sick to my stomach.  It's a lazy way to summarize the current crime genre, and it doesn't do many of the films justice. `Lock, Stock' goes one further by actually delivering solid proof that it steals from Tarantino.  The filmmakers might call it a `homage', but this isn't Neptune.  Most of us can see right through that.  I was dismayed at the film's attempt at coolness.  With boring camerawork and a stillborn soundtrack, this film is a good example of what first time filmmakers should not do.  Ritchie plays by all the rules.  His cast is an eclectic group of Londoners, none of which you can remember when the lights go up.  It's story is a rather predictable mix of double-crosses and botched shootouts, and I applaud (sarcastically) on the director's use of what seemed like 32 endings. To consider this original work is insanity.  `Lock, Stock' thrills a lot of people, from what I've read.  I am hard pressed to fully understand why.-------------- 1"

","Not since the likes of ""The Long Good Friday"" or ""Get Carter"" has the UK produced such an innovative, gutsy, compelling gangster flick.  Stellar lead performances, a strong supporting cast, a thumping soundtrack and virtuoso direction make ""Lock, Stock..."" THE definitive British movie of the decade.<br/><br/>Made up of a cast of relative unknowns from extinct British serial shows, i.e Dexter Fletcher (Press gang & Gamesmaster) and soccer hard man Vinnie Jones, this fast-paced, action-packed, darkly humourous contemporary Brit-flick never fails to deliver.  Add a touch of very swish and stylish direction, seen at it's best in the card game set in the Boxing ring, linked in with a very cool set up of rivals intent on the retrieval of £500,000 and what do you get? A Brit-flick that is an absolute must-see time and time again.<br/><br/>The complex and involving plot is some-what immersive. The man Rory Breaker is at times evil, added with DOG who should be locked up for an incredibly long time. Nick the Greek London based mediterranean wide-boy and the group of Soap, Eddy, Tom and Bacon are all a bunch of small-time crooks loooking to make a buck.<br/><br/>The two scousers are quite stupid, spouting such inane drivel as ""These people ain't got no money, they can't even afford new furniture"" and Guy Ritchie's direction is often amazing as the scene already mentioned gives testament to, as does the drinking and singing scene in JD's (Sting) bar. All this adds to an impressive and ground-breaking film that must be seen several times for you to catch every single humorous moment.<br/><br/>The overview must be that this movie is so impressive that it will probably win absolutely no OSCARs, but they will all be given to some hum-drum Tom Hanks flick without a patch of the originality, unpredictability and blatant coolness of the entire cast or outstanding direction."

However, with the utmost skill Mr. Guy Ritchie moves us through and above this quagmire of a movie.  The plot itself is a twisting, turning country river which rarely leads to its natural conclusion...however I did see some holes in this plot (for example why put 500,000 on the line in a poker game when you could barely scrape together 25K?).  But these simple questions are too tedious for this film.  Instead Mr. Ritchie quickly leads the viewer past these (not so big) plot holes and leads us straight into the beauty of film.  It is with his slow motion, 360 degree shots, and unbelievable editing that this movie gets its distinct feel.  I loved just looking at this movie.  Listening to it, on the other hand was a challenge...as with most films from across the pond I understand a lot more upon the second viewing.  Although, there were plenty of laugh out loud parts to this movie, I think I missed a good deal of them because I just can't LISTEN fast enough.<br/><br/>Don't be afraid of this movie, however, and go see it on the big screen where the direction can be appreciated.

Many people will say that a film was ""pure entertainment"", and you should expect no more from an action movie. Well, nope, that's not what Lock Stock is about. What does it have then? It has a cast that give an authentic feel, if not Oscar winning performances. It has a black humour, a little overdone in places, but one that generally works well and seems to fit in with the characters and their location (i.e. you can only take cockney rhyming slang so seriously). It has a tugging, friendly plotline, that wrong foots your emotions once or twice and pokes you in the stomach, without ever *really* being twisty. It has an inconsiderate bass line, but only where your neighbours are concerned (it's great). It has Lenny McLean (RIP Lenny). It has an armoury of lines that you'll quote to your mates for weeks on end, to a point where they'll go out and  buy the film just so they know what the hell you're talking about.

The set-up for the climax(es?) was one of the best I've seen.  I was baffled as to how all the plotlines were going to come together, but once they started mixing, it blew my mind.<br/><br/>I recommend sitting in the front row for full effect on most of the odd shots.  For example, in the wide-angle view of the two apartment buildings early on in the picture, it seems as though the streetlight is almost on top of you.<br/><br/>I saw ls&tsb for a regional sneak preview at a college campus theater.  The people who disliked the movie were severely outnumbered.  This is going to be one of the big movies in America this summer, and I wish it the best of luck.  Forget Pulp Fiction.<br/><br/>Overall rating: hilarious on many levels, well plotted out, and great fun to watch.  Definitely a video to purchase, when it's released.<br/><br/>-Chris"

Some of them seem like they're just there for showing off (see the carrot under water shot). In addition to this, the first and second halves of this movie are almost completely different. The first half had some really bad acting and was extremely boring. I found myself almost dozing off a couple of times. The second half, though, completely rocks. It's funny and just has a great script. I really enjoyed the last 45 minutes-1 hour. Because the writing and acting got so much better, the over-directing wasn't noticed as much. Thanks to this I came out of the theater having a good impression of this film. 6 stars"

Executed beautifully and edited quite nicely, the film's pace was engaging and flawless.<br/><br/>A certain pop singer's cameo appearances actually elicited laughter from the audience, I'm not sure whether that tone was intended or not.<br/><br/>There's a certain playful attitude that will require a suspension of disbelief, a certain element of embellishment in story telling is employed and certain characters are larger than life for comic effect.<br/><br/>It seems inevitable that some people will compare this film to ""Trainspotting"", or even ""Trainspotting"" meets ""Rounders"" with a hard edge of ""Reservoir Dogs"" thrown in for good measure. Now if you've seen those movies and enjoyed them, I'd be surprised if you didn't enjoy this one, but don't be looking for those elements.

","8.4 out of 10? The 'Empire' award for Best British Film of 1998?<br/><br/>It's being made into a TV series? I rate it as about 3 out of 10, give it the 'Me' award for most overrated film of the decade, and would like to see it being used as a textbook example of what can go wrong if you allow surface to take over substance in a movie. The acting (with the surprising exception of Vinnie Jones) was uniformly TERRIBLE. The accents and intonation were, in several cases, laughable public schoolboy cockney parodies; a Michael Caine impression does not a Cockney make. Obviously these boys realise that they just don't have the talent to carry off an original performance, and resorted to character theft from ""Alfie"".<br/><br/>The assumption has to be that Guy Ritchie, the director, used to make a lucrative career in music videos and commercials, and I bet they were pretty good too. He obviously has a visual flair, although, if ""Lock, Stock"" is anything to go by, originality isn't his strong point (the giddy scene taken directly from ""Mean Streets""?).<br/><br/>The story was at best old hat and at worst sketched in after the producers decided to make a good looking film about characters that we've all seen before, in situations that we've all seen before.<br/><br/>None of this would be so bad if the British cinema-going public hadn't sapped it in and mistaken it for Film Art rather than Film Fart.<br/><br/>The British Film Industry has long been accused of making too many 'pretty' period films, but this has to be a far more damning vacuous 'pretty postcard' of a film than any Merchant-Ivory production."

But once it gets going the pace, action, characters and comedy don't stop until the last minute of the film. I was exhausted.<br/><br/>The characters are excellent - even the two slightly over-the-top scousers seem to be realistic in this almost caricature world.

The scene where the over-confident Eddy realizes he's up the proverbial creek for a EXTREMELY large amount of money had me feeling nearly as queasy as Eddy.<br/><br/>All in all - a great film - plenty of pace, plenty of action, plenty of bodies, and plenty of humour.

","People have complained about this for being sub-Tarantino but it's not at all like, say, Reservoir Dogs; it just looks that way because of the blood and the swearing. At heart this is a P G Wodehouse-type farce with antique guns instead of cow-creamers and dodgy back-room clubs instead of Picadilly gentlemens' clubs. Lots of running around and shouting keeps the pace lively and the jokes - and all-important set-ups - are genuinely funny. This film comes as such a relief after the anodyne sentimentality of Sliding Doors and the pseudo-intellectual witticisms of Shakespeare in Love (they were funny in their own way, but their own way can be a bit annoying). It's so great to see the old music-hall farce routines united with the modern gritty shoot-em-up so harmoniously, and that the result is still funny is really something to admire."

I could not have been more wrong, both Vinnie and the film are absolutely superb ( I think Vinnie outshines a lot of professional actors I have seen).<br/><br/> From the Moment Vinnie arrives the humour starts.

If only all 'British Indie Movies' had the backing of Sting, Robbie Williams, French Connection and about Â£5m of UK marketing - then rubbish such as this wouldn't make such a big splash. LS&2SB is basically a rehash of 'Minder' (early 1980s TV show) with a pseudo Tarrentino feel. In films such as Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, and True Romance - the characters were quirky and interesting. Take 'True Romance' as an example - Christian Slater is the idealist in a harsh world, Particia Arquette the hooker with a heart of gold. They have the aim of trying to make a better life for themselves. Dennis Hopper, Christopher Walken, Gary Oldman, Michael Rappaport, Brad Pitt - all these characters are individuals that we care about. LS&2SBs has none of this. There is no love interest (in fact only 1 girl in the whole movie - with no lines), nothing to make us like or dislike the stars of the film - only  the stupidity of of them serves as some kind of reason to want them to do well.

When you consider that the Pale was the region around Dublin where an Englishman could travel in safety, the notion takes on even more meaning.  Why does this film, a portrait of Marginal people who are all screwed up some way, work?  Well, there is a certain innocence to the characters which when coupled with their more malicious side creates chaos.  But, hey, isn't this the usual state of affairs in the human condition?  Aren't we all screwed up just a bit in some bizarre way?  This is a constant theme in the films of Joel and Ethan Coen and here, we find their counterpart in the backstreets of London.  But, it takes more than simply recognizing that we're all a bit goofy somewhere underneath to make a funny film and the likes of Vinny Smith, Jason Statham and the rest of the gang, combine to leave us howling for more.

The main feature of this film that I noticed at first however, is the noticeable lack of presence of women.  The domination of masculinity presents very interesting possibilities for meaning in the film, with the character Hatchet Harry being the epitomal representation for masculinity: A powerful man who sits atop his sex shop in his second-story office.  Yet I believe that while the film begins to glorify masculinity, the ending denounces it.

"JawsOfJosh","Null","0","0","3 April 2001"," An auspicious, electrified debut for Guy Ritchie
","There are few debut films as relentless as this one.  Guy Ritchie submerges his sepia-toned cameras into the bowels of London's notoriously shady East End in ""Lock, Stock..."".  It's his first film, so it's just a baby, but a baby tiger with teeth & claws ready to bite you.  It's a labyrinth plot of drug dealers, thieves & wanna-bes, supposedly paying homage to the British gangster films of the 40's and 50's but still taking a chunk from the book of Tarantino (cross-cutting stories, a thin black guy with a big afro and a sharp suit, lots of funk music, excessive weaponry & profanity).  Hey, that's OK - Quentin made gangsters cool again, so why not try and expand on it?  Ritchie certainly does.  Mostly devoid of ""pop culture"" dialogue, this film instead dives into Cockney slang (making me want to visit England even more) with a sordid cast of characters.  <br/><br/>Tom, Bacon, Soap & Eddie are four amateurish wiseguys who find themselves in deep debt when Eddie loses a fixed card game with the local porn king, Hatchet Harry.  Harry's collector, Big Chris, has been assigned to make sure the boys pay within a week or start sizing up their fingers for amputation. Meanwhile, Harry is in search of two antique shotguns, and has sent his right-hand man, Barry the Baptist (the reason for Barry's nickname is both funny & frightening) to hire two bumbling, arguing thieves to retrieve it. Tom's neighbors, a quartet of loathsome criminals, are looking to rip off a prominent marijuana house.  The pot dealers in danger are in the midst of finalizing a deal with a miniature ""madman"" known as Rory Breaker (played by scene-stealing Vas Blackwood who shines most among the large cast).  Eddie figures if his gang can rip off his hoodlum neighbors they can pay back Harry and sell the pot via Nick the Greek, the local fencer, who is known to most of the previously mentioned characters.<br/><br/>There are more twists, turns & intersections in this story, but it's useless to illustrate them.  It's difficult to absorb this dense film in one viewing, especially for Americans not familiar with deciphering heavy British accents (the sprinkles of Cockney in the dialogue may not help, either).  However, this is still a wildly engaging film.  There are all-around great performances, including the younger characters, who never seem to feel out of their league going up against the sizably older gangsters.  They do look out of place though and most of their fortune in the film is brought about more by luck than resiliency.  Likewise, the older actors (namely P.H. Moriarty, Lenny McLean, Vinnie Jones and a brief role by Sting) bring more meat to their performances than the remainder of the cast. With exception, of course, to Vas Blackwood's attitude-in-an-afro Rory Breaker.  As a director, Ritchie seems floored with the art of making movies, and incorporates a lot of stylish cinematography into his work. Some scenes actually use slow motion, freeze frames, and zooms all in the same shot (the card game is deftly composed and obviously takes place in the center of a boxing ring to allow more camera movement).  Hard to believe he shot this film without the benefit of playback monitors.  A thrilling joy ride, full of testosterone & vinegar, that definitely makes it a guy's movie (no pun intended)."

","From the moment the opening credits began to role I knew that I would enjoy this film. It's fast paced, wittily scripted, brilliantly filmed and non-stop hilarious from beginning to end. It appears to be a send up of the whole gangster mentality but manages to be disturbingly realistic at the same time (I know - I've met characters like many of those depicted). The violence may seem over the top but is more in the ""Tom & Jerry"" mould than a typical big screen gore-fest. What's more, it's never dwelt on but simply adds to the overall effect of extremely dark comedy.<br/><br/>The acting, especially from Nick Moran (Eddie) and PH Moriarty (Hatchett Harry) is top notch and Vinnie Jones is a revelation. Having seen him from just a few rows back on the football terraces, I've known for years that the man has a certain presence that demands your attention - even when he hasn't got another player's vitals in a vice-like grip! It's great to see that this has transferred onto the big screen where, yet again, it's difficult to keep your eyes off him, no matter who else is on the screen. Admittedly the role of Big Chris hardly stretched him but it's a start and it remains to be seen whether he'll ever tackle something more challenging (one of Shakespeare's many clowns would be interesting). Anyway, enough about Vinnie.<br/><br/>The almost surreal humour of the film was brought to the fore in the barman's scene (played by Danny John-Jules of ""Red Dwarf"" fame). It was hard to know what to pay most attention to: the subtitles at the bottom of the screen or the scene being played out behind it. The overall effect was quite literally shockingly funny and for those not well versed in Cockney dialect (yes -it is an actual dialect) it's worth seeing again until you've mastered the language and can enjoy the full effect of the action.<br/><br/>With a body count more akin to a Jacobean tragedy than a Hollywood blockbuster, and the black wit and class acting to match, ""Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" reminds me of Danny Boyle's early days directing for the Royal Shakespeare Company before he went on to bigger and better things (""Shallow Grave"" & ""Trainspotting""). I'm sure he and his regular crew of writers, camera men (sorry, should that be camera persons?) and actors would be proud to have made a film such as this, which I hope those who were involved would take as a compliment.<br/><br/>Well, that's about it, I s'pose. All I can say now is.... ""It's been emotional""."

","First off, I heard no hype about this movie, just got handed the DVD by a friend with a short 'Watch it'. Big thanks to him ! Its probably also why I enjoyed LSTSB immensely, repeatedly and unashamedly. It's basically all the things Tarantino aims for ( and sometimes even hits ), gritty, tough-but-humourous and entertaining from the outset. Less hype, but much better delivery all around !<br/><br/>The cast of protagonists, villains and even the sidekicks is truly memorable while satisfyingly 'fresh', and thanks be to the higher powers, Mr. Travolta does not dance ! Also, avid fans of Sting should not hold their breath in anticipation, his 3 minutes of fame are more than enough. And yes, the plot is slightly complicated, with some flashbacks, humour, at its blackest parallel storylines and unexpected twists, but so is life.... Its actually necessary to listen to the dialogue full-time to get all the good ones and anyone not enjoying it should consider having his brainpan checked out for dryrot, ASAP(or watch 'Mary Poppins').<br/><br/>The plot itself is neither overly brutal( while deadly !), nor clicheed, but a well-constructed, fast-paced treat, and one could only wish that more scriptwriters where as circumspect in plotting for a memorable show-down. The same goes for the soundtrack.<br/><br/>As for those 'critics' claiming that LSTSB ripped off 'Holy Tarantino' who BTW shamelessly ripped off everybody else, and recently failed miserably, even with a decent script to work from - just check out 'Jackie Brown') I should point out that anyone who builds something similar, yet definitely bigger and better, does not 'rip off', he improves ! Sorry that Mr Ritchie is a Brit, and , 'oh terrible woe' the boyfriend of trite Madonna, but, lets face it, this movie is much better value than 'Pulp fiction' or 'Reservoir Dogs'.<br/><br/>There are only two potentially troublesome points to be kept in mind - first off the sometimes videoclip-like aesthetics ( hard on the eyes) , and second, the extremely thick accents ( which in themselves are wickedly funny, just hard to get ), which baffle the even the non-hearing-impaired ( but then again, so does Morgan Freeman, and he even got an Oscar for it...), and I expect, may be challenging for many Americans and non-english speakers alike.<br/><br/>Besides this, a great movie ( and if it had been done by Q.Tarantino, a lot less people would gripe unfairly about it.... ) !<br/><br/>9/10"

","Cool soundtrack, catchy camera tricks, a fair amount of style and imagination, but certainly not the fantastic film many have made it out to be. The sometimes impenetrable Cockney accents, multitude of not always terribly distinctive characters to keep track of, lame sight gags and skimping on vital scene-linking information (not to mention an absurd, almost non-existent police presence) tend to cancel out its strengths. Setting it in London gives it novelty points, but had it been made in America with American actors it would not have been nearly as celebrated. And Sting, the movie's biggest star, has a criminally small part and doesn't exactly bring his A game."

"Steve-176","Null","0","0","15 November 1998"," Slippery Garish Black Comedy
","Lock Stock And Two Smoking Barrels is clever, funny and gory with an English brand of the Tarantino Touch. It's well worth a visit.<br/><br/>Four Eastenders decide to make it big in a high stakes poker game but end up very quickly owing big money to some nasty characters.<br/><br/>The boys decide to indulge in a bit more villainy to try to keep their health, but they're not too good at the bad stuff.  Nethertheless a Shakespearian body count mounts in some of the funniest shootouts since Tarantino's True Romance.<br/><br/>There are about three heists going on at once, depending how you count them, and a father's bar is up for grabs, Lock Stock and Barrels. As for the smoking barrels, well two of the weapons used are antique.<br/><br/>First time writer director Guy Ritchie has popped up with a slippery, garish black comedy with far more than its fair share of entertainment. Employing some non actors, including a rough edged sportsman (hard playing soccer star Vinnie Jones as Big Chris) and real life crooks (including Lenny McLean as Barry The Baptist) has helped to get that authentic edge no doubt, but a deep understanding of the genre was the real key. Ritchie patently knows how comedy gangster blood baths work.<br/><br/>Sting is his usual credible self on screen as JD, Eddie's Dad and Lenny McLean sure knows how real life thugs operate. For a start, it appears that they only say what's necessary. Vinnie Jones as JD is big, quietly spoken, knows the rules of thuggery and is frighteningly ominous.<br/><br/>It seems that sportsmen are basically entertainers at the highest level. Another top line soccer star, Eric Cantona, was equally impressive recently in Elizabeth, another top notch English film. The same sorts of influences can probably be said for crooks, who must learn early to hide what they are really thinking - great training for the film stage.<br/><br/>Lock Stock And Two Smoking Barrels is refreshing and smart and is a fine independent film. There's nothing really new here, the genre is well established, but the game is played very well indeed. Black humour lovers will find plenty to guffaw at here."

Along the way, some of the funniest lines ever uttered in a `Crime Thriller' are fired at the audience in dry-wit fashion - highlighting that the script is one of the stars of this film.

","A film does not need shed loads of sfx and huge name ""movie stars"" to be entertaining, this film has neither sfx or movie stars, it has brilliant camerawork and ACTORS. This film covers a lot of genres, it is a comedy with great lines and visual gags, it is a drama which gets into all the characters (especially directors cut), it is a thriller which really keeps you on the edge of your seat. While checking out the comments posted by imdb users for this film I found that the only negative comments were by Americans which was unsurprising. A few Americans didn't slag it off, they obviously appreciated what the film was. As is typical of America they wouldn't recognise a decent plot if it jumped up and bit them in the a**e! This is the way comedy should work, americans are too reliant on the quick one line gag comedies of Friends, Frasier and all the other less entertaining programmes of that type they tend to label as ""comedy"". I will admit I do like Friends and Frasier but I don't what that type of humour in my films. I was lucky when I saw this film because I saw it in the cinema just as it came out and I knew absolutely nothing about it, someone recommended it to me and I watched it. I don't think I've ever seen a film with such a clever plot. If I was to compare it to a film churned out by hollywood the closest would not be anything Tarrantino has to offer but something much cleverer like the Game with Michael Douglas. It's about time that hollywood realised that good film making is about quailty not quantity. I like a good explosion laden, sfx laden flick as much as the next guy but there are times and there are places for that sort of thing. Come on America, wake up if you put stronger plots and stronger acting in your films you wouldn't feel the need to slag off a decent british film that has everything you don't."

Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is a highly original film, as are Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, but that's where the similarities end.<br/><br/>Please give writer / director Guy Ritchie and Producer Trudie Styler (Mrs Sting to you) the credit they deserve for this entertaining, humourous, violent, parody of East-end London gangster life and boys just trying to make some dosh the easy way.<br/><br/>Because of it's multiple plots and twists, this is a film that you have to pay attention to, or watch twice to get the bits you missed. The photography is fantastic, with the sepia look adding to the atmosphere of the film. The music, being a blend of classic James Brown soul to modern day Ocean Colour Scene and others also compliments the action.<br/><br/>For all the non-British views, you'd better brush up on your Cockney Rhyming Slang too, although one scene does includes sub-titles because even the Brits don't understand it!<br/><br/>Not for the children or people with an aversion to overly violent films, but most people should find it a worth while experience."

This film has got unique camera shots and very dark comedy film feel, tone and look. But there is a extremely cool ending that has to be seen to believe.

The story starts off unraveling the backgrounds of the 4 main charecters, and the sub-charecters of the movie.  Then we begin to learn the amazing plot:  A young brazen Poker player is going to be playing for big money on a table with more big money.  The gig is, he is ""borrowing"" money from his friends as an investment for them, potentially gaining 2 times what they put in.  From there on, the story unfolds in a tragic sort of way, with scenes of a rabid drug dealer, to 3 Potheads armed with a BB gun!  This movie is one of my top 3 of all time, no matter what anyone says."

","I love this film, particularly the dialogue, which I am still translating the 3rd or 4th time around. Not only is it quick, clever and funny, it is almost lyrical.<br/><br/>The script may be one of the film's weaknesses though. For example, ""keep your Adams on"" - did Adam Ant sell records anywhere outside the UK, or to anyone other than 20something Brits? For someone who cannot be bothered to concentrate on the words, or for whom English is a second language, this film may not live up to the 9/10 I give it.<br/><br/>The film is also quite stylish (to my taste, which might not be saying much).  I like the soundtrack and the dateless feel, references to 'a bad day in Bosnia' are 90's, but the cars and the London streets are more reminiscent of films and TV shows from the 60's and 70's. But again, perhaps this only appeals to a narrow audience.<br/><br/>(ps butcher's hook - look)"

He can do his kind of films over there and I just hope that we can see more of them over here.  Looks like if Madonna wants to keep him, she's going to have to change her demanding, spoiled ways.

The affair they got involved in grows and grows with almost every minute. Twists of action almost make it impossible to follow the plot, I have not seen such a ""swift"" movie in ages. Big pros for the director for depicting such a variety of characters from the London criminal underground. My faves are a guy with his son working for a local boss.

I loved the camera tricks which so annoyed others (I particularly liked the sceen introducing Soap with a saucepan shot from below) and the grainy stock.<br/><br/>With no great stars (save perhaps Vinie Jones who for our oversea readers was a very big football [i.e. soccer] star before taking up acting) the cast is spot on. I believe that there is only one female speaking role (the croupier) and only two female roles all told, which must be a record of some sort these days.<br/><br/>Brits and Aussies (the Oz accent being an extension of cockney) won't have problems with the accents but for goodness sake Americans, more English speakers live outside the US than in it and we've struggled for years with heavy New York or Southern US accents without complaint. I've never understood what Blanche in the Golden Girls was on about for instance and the Dukes of Hazzard only became intelligible when we got teletext sub-titles about 20 years ago.<br/><br/>Yes, the are superfical likeness to a number of films and the ending is a bit of a rip off from the Italian Job, but hey, this hung together very well even so.

This must be the most quotable film for a long time, and one where the whole cinema can chant the lines as they happen.<br/><br/>THE FOLLOWING COMMENTS MAY BE A SPOILER TO SOME PEOPLE..<br/><br/>The inventive way that the plot revolves around the three groups without actually knowing what the others are thinking is pure genius.  Harking back to the comedies of Marlowe and Shakespeare, this script plays on the tragi-comedy perfectly, as the characters joke about finding a room full of dead bodies and how it works to their advantage.<br/><br/>A highlight of the film is the bar scene, where Danny John-Jules is explaining how the man caught on fire.  The comedy of the scene, coupled with the rhyming slang that is used makes for a cracking piece of dialogue and action.<br/><br/>This film is full of irony, and we realise that if all the groups worked together from the beginning, then they would have all got what they wanted and would have all been rich, and alive. A great film, well thought out, and a classic for years to come. 10 out of 10.<br/><br/>Neil."

","Lock Stock has much to offer and will go down as a classic of British film. Guy Ritchie's first outing to the world of feature films is one that exudes a talent long lost (hard to find!) in the world of hollywood.<br/><br/>Lock Stock offers an emmersive storyline that will have you on the edge of your seat as you watch the seperate plots twist and turn and climax together in an almost surreal joining that will have you marvel at it's brilliance. (10/10)<br/><br/>Guy's directing is simply demonstrated by his ability to use unknown actors (The Govn'r (real life wide boy), Vinnie (football hardcase)) and intergrate them into the film seamlessly, a true mark of ability for any director.<br/><br/>The switching between plots is perfect, keeping you guessing exactly how each subplot effects the others and drumming your fingers waiting for that inevitable collision that is bound to happen.  The theme track that supplements the film is a lesson to the many directors who are yet to realise how to harness its value adding abilty.<br/><br/>Art direction / cinematography is brilliant but one has to say that Guy owes a lot to Martin Scorcesse, from the card scene to car door scene (you'll understand when you see it),  although this lacks his own imagination he does it very well, and he shows a lot of potential in this area. (9/10 -2 for copying).<br/><br/>In round up this film is a must see, but has been made for a british audience, and may not translate well (the use of language is half its charm).

","I rented Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels the day it arrived. Having been a small release, I hadn't gotten to a theater to check it out. I did rent it with a little bit of reluctance, having rented the hideously overrated Go the evening before. Go was considered to be the greatest of the Tarantino knock offs. However, after watching the film, my reluctance had no place because this is not a Tarantino knock off. Ritchie himself said he has never seen Tarantino's brillant Reservoir Dogs. That's not the purpose here, though. The purpose here is to tell how well crafted this film is. To give you an idea, I have never seen a film that had such a clear sense of style and storytelling. Ritchie has defined his sort of hyperkinetic flashy style, and gives us more of a shot with his control of the camera{which is more like a seasoned pro then a beginner, but Ritchie has worked in commercials} then Tarantino has done in all of his films{Don't get me long, I worship Tarantino}. That being said, just because it has this flashy fast paced way about it does not make it hard to understand. Yes, there are over 22 important character in this film, but I hadn't for a second got any of them confused. I know  who belonged where, and what there purpose was. Plus, all the performances were excellent. Not many directors can tell story with as much style and as coherently as this. Ritchie pulls it off to near perfection. He is a brillant director."

"Buddy-51","8","0","0","13 August 1999"," entertaining, high energy crime comedy
","""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" is a fun, highspirited and ingeniously plotted caper film from the ""good crooks vs. bad crooks"" school of crime drama.  This British comedy plunges us into a dizzying maelstrom of doublecrossing petty thieves, drug dealers, gamblers and assorted other criminal lowlifes whose paths cross in the streets and alleyways of London in clever and often fatal ways.<br/><br/>The complex plot almost defies description.  Suffice it to say the film focuses on a quartet of likable smalltime hoodlums who amass a decent stake from the fencing of stolen property and  decide to risk it all on a high stakes card game with a notorious gangster named Henry, who has rigged the game, unbeknownst to Eddie, the cardsharp of the group.  When Eddie loses the money, the stage is set for a wild series of plots, counterplots, crosses and double crosses, all executed by writer/director Guy Ritchie with a refreshing cinematic flair that includes frenetic pacing and editing, clever use of slow and fast motion photography, and barely perceptible freeze framing, all backed up by a dynamic score humming along on the soundtrack.<br/><br/>As a writer, Ritchie fills the screen with a delighful gallery of eccentric, offbeat and slightly off-kilter characters.  These are all too numerous to mention, but special note should be taken of Henry's chief henchman, Chris, who politely scolds  his young son and partner in crime for his use of unseemly language as he bashes the brains out of one of Henry's delinquent customers or insists on his buckling up for safety as they take off on one of their wild rides through ths crime-infested streets of London.<br/><br/>Despite it's '90's level of graphic violence, the film strikes echoes of classic British crime comedies of the gentler 1950's.  It reminds one, in fact, of ""The Ladykillers"", wherein the bad crooks manage to eliminate each other through a maze of comic misunderstandings, leaving the ""good"" crooks thoughtfully untouched. Not that they don't learn their lesson, though, for, in the high stakes world of doubledealing criminals, our heroes discover that it takes a ruthless old pro to ultimately come out on top.  And that's as it should be in the world of crime drama."

","Orson Welles did it with Citizen Kane in 1939. Martin Scorcese did it in 1973 with mean Streets{and went on to floor us numerous more times}. George Lucas did it with American Graffitti{and need I say more}. Quentin Tarantino did it with Reservoir Dogs in 1991{and made two more films just as good}. And Doug Liman did it with Swingers in 1996. I am talking about what these brillant men did with their first films, and many of them went on to even more acclaim. This men redefined aspects of Cinema with their first films. We can add Guy Ritchie to this list. He has delivered the best heist film since Reservoir Dogs{which is only slightly better then this film}. It's hard to see a director who has done everything so near perfection. His cast rules, their performances{all perfect} amazing, the script tremendously clever, the music perfect, the camera mind boggling. If you watch this film without knowing its Ritchie's first work, you will have the impression he is a seasoned veteran. THis film is beautifully filmed. And it isn't just Tarantino run-off. Ritchie's script works perfectly, and it isn't just Tarantino's work. If Quentin Tarantino is considered the symbol of American cinema, then Ritchie is England's. This film just goes to show what we are missing. Not many films work as well as this one in terms of style and story. If Ritchie doesn't go the way of Tarantino{who needs to resurface, I think all the crap that has been released lately is considered Tarantino run off is not just an attempt to cash in, but a cry for help. Quentin, answer it} and continues on this path, he has quite a future ahead. I can't wait for his next film, called Diamonds. **** out of ****"

"halnexus","Null","0","0","10 August 1999"," *** (Out of four)
","British former commercial auteur Guy Ritchie makes his critically-acclaimed film debut with this intriguing foreigner from the British Isles.  ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" is like a British-themed homage to the many Tarantino-inspired knock-offs done in a style reminiscent of the avant-garde bands PBS used to show on Saturday evenings nearly ten years ago. Bizarrely wrapping its wraparound plot in this theme proves to add to the meticulously construed charm of elated supposed Britannian one-upmanship of the genre. The self-confidence shows in many of the film's more bizarrely shot (and somewhat overexposed) freeze-frames (most definitely the card game sequence in which one of our heroes loses a rigged poker run with a take-no-prisoners P.H. Moriarty).  Terrifically essaying the very diction of Tarantino cloning through this veil of British influence turns out to be director Guy Ritchie's greatest asset.<br/><br/>""Lock"" is set primarily in a criminally arresting and somewhat grungily Nirvanian London, a place which looks almost clockwork in everpresent style. Bright red letters almost advertising the excessive seed in each district with their very simpleness (""Harry's Sex Club""), whirling advertisements of ""Minicabs"" and the almost libertine freedom of motion from Tim Maurice-Jones all help to create a flicker of ""never-seen-that-before!"" amazement pervading this environment.  Inside this desmenes lie four ""mates"", one a cardsharp (Nick Moran), another a future entrepreneur (Tom Flemyng), a third named Bacon (Jason Strathem) and the fourth called ""Soap"" because unlike his three mates, he likes to keep his fingers clean by dabbling into a legitimate occupation, baking (Dexter Fletcher).  Their initial efforts to get into a poker game with the infamous Hatchet Harry (Moriarty) end up in an enormous 500,000 pound debt to be vanquished within seven days--or else. As the Clash once said, ""one thing leads to another"", and soon enough the entire struggle leads to, of all things, the relentless exploits of a pair of ""smoking barrels"".<br/><br/>Of course the ironic twists are one pleasure of the movie, but ironic twists does not equal charm, and this is the one of the things which ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" cannot equate with not only with its great-uncle ""Pulp Fiction"", but also its great-great grandparents which all contributed to Tarantino's film's fascinating pop-culture lore.  One strength of the movie is its ability to juggle its various plotlines skillfully and still have time for a ""30 second rock interlude"" during its 108-minute running time.  Indeed many of the characters elicit sympathy.  One in particular is the moral thug Big Chris (Vinnie Jones) who takes his son on collecting missions and bashes his victims for swearing.  These characters almost have a Dickensian feel to them in their grappling bond and ultimate fate. Hatchet Harry's back-up Barry the Baptist (Lenny McLean) reminds one of a cross between Clemenza and Don Rickles in his dogged, gleeful determination of collecting.  And yet ultimately this film's sly, energetically automated sense of humor ultimately impairs one from sharing the same memories of the film's heroes, who all are so remarkably similar that they're sometimes hard to tell apart.  Truly Ritchie's film is an unusual creation, and it deserves to be seen because of its out-of-left-field approach to the recent hip, Tarantino phase of filmmaking, but by strutting around the course when he should have been golfing for the hole, he prevents his film from breaking the cult masses like ""Pulp Fiction"" did and instead is seen as ""that egocentrically stylistic British entry into film reinvigoration"".  Hey, even Winston Churcill was inspired by someone."

","I saw this movie in the theater and can completely understand how it has done better with Commonwealth audiences than American ones.  This movie is a great indie flick, but its humor is (understandably) squarely aimed at an English audience, and Americans will probably be a little confused at this movie's rave reviews.  You can argue about what this means, but the fact is that this humor is not so universal or just plain off-the-wall as most British comedy that does well in the states.<br/><br/>Comparisons to Pulp Fiction, etc. This is something quite different.  One character was stolen:  If you don't think of Samuel L. Jackson when you see Rory Breaker, I would be very surprised.  The rest of the movie is quite original and well-written comedy.<br/><br/>Personally, I thought the movie was so-so, but there are some great laughs in there for everyone, so it's a sure-fire video rental.  If you're a teenaged American or any-aged from the Commonwealth, you'll probably love this movie.

For me it was a movie of two halfs, with the first half containing some truly appalling acting (I mean Dexter Fletcher is the guy who was the host of Games Master) and tiresome pacing. But the second half is a different story which manages to strike a balance between ludicrous and plausible plot twists. This movie could have been hard to follow but Guy Ritchie manages to pull it off. I just wish he had paid as much attention to detail in the first half of his script. Then again, the first half is all about set-up, it just could have been done better.<br/><br/>When you take this movie for what it is - a gangster farce - then you'll probably enjoy it, but don't be put off by the acting at the beginning which does get better, and although the ending has been done before it still suits this kind of movie extremely well.<br/><br/>6/10.

","For originality and the fact that there were some funny lines, and I like the director, Guy Richie, that's why I'm giving it a five.<br/><br/>The whole time proceeding my seeing this film, I was told by everyone that it was a must see and a fantastic film. A cult classic, some might even be so bold as to say, however I did not find it that enthralling. It was a movie made for guys, and although I will be hypocritical saying this since I love the average chick flick, it's not a film most women will probably like, since there was only one in the whole movie. The story is cleverly written, and definitely one you have to pay attention to, in order to follow what's going on.<br/><br/>Again, the kind of humor that this is, I can totally see a bunch of guys roaring with laughter over, however my moments of smiles and giggles were few and far between. The writing was very good, and I as I said before, I love Guy Richie, so I loved the directing as well. But, I have to say that it's not the funniest, or even best underground Brit comedy I've ever seen. Better than 'The Full Monty', I will give it that much, but it's just not that good.<br/><br/>All in all if you're a guy, you'll more than likely enjoy this movie, but ladies be forewarned, Man Clan film, and there aren't a lot of romantic scenes, actually none...so if you're the kind of person that's looking for a romantic comedy, you've rented the wrong film."

","Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is the most appalling film I have ever had the misfortune to see. It is 105 minutes of macho shaping and people trying to look cool as they headbutt other people. Most of the comments here seem to compare it favourably with Goodfellas, Pulp Fiction and the like. These are great films which Lock Stock... does not deserve a comparison to....the reason films like Reservoir Dogs get away with their amorality is that you are not expected to sympathize with or judge the characters. In Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels you are clearly expected to take the side of some of the cliched yobs which are passed off as characters in this monstrosity. Also the films lacks any of the style, wit, originality, ingenuity or charisma of anything by Tarantino or Scorsese. I had never actually hated a film before I saw this macho, laddish rubbish. Someone should just tell them they're not hard and get it over with...do yourself a favour and watch Pulp Fiction again; it's a million times better than this excuse for a film 0/10"

","There is no way Guy Ritchie could be ripping off Tarantino because he is no where near as good as Quentin. This movie attempted to be like Pulp Fiction in the sense that there are a lot of characters and a lot of stuff going on for the viewer to watch. The difference is Guy Ritchie does a horrible job doing it. You get characters confused, don't know what's going on, no characters developed, and are constantly wondering what is going on. Meanwhile in Pulp Fiction, you know what's going on, you just don't know where it's going. I can't believe this got such high ratings and that people said it was actually funny. Maybe you could point out the funny parts to me, because I didn't see any. Fans of Pulp Fiction will hate this. 5/10"
"The_Movie_Cat","6","2","5","23 July 2000"," ""Planks o'wood! I'm working with f*****' planks o'wood!""
","Just two short years since it's release, time has already made it possible to detest Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.<br/><br/>For a start, this is the film that resurrected a trend for half-baked British gangster films (Circus, Love, Honour and Obey, Rancid Aluminium...), not to mention it's own spin-off television series. Sexist, racist, homophobic and charmless, ""Lock Stock"" (3) was the ultimate extension of the ""new lad"" mindset; only an irresistibly funky theme tune preventing it from being completely irredeemable. In the midst of all this it's very easy to forget that the movie which started it all is actually a halfway decent film.<br/><br/>It's no classic, of course. Direction, themes and execution are all highly derivative. Then there's the acting, or lack thereof. The wooden delivery of many players is such that the stylised, witty/self-conscious and contrived (delete as applicable) dialogue sounds one hundred times worse than it actually is. Nick Moran, while being better than most involved, is possibly the most annoying, his poor man's Michael Caine routine wearing thin very, very quickly.<br/><br/>In this sense it's perhaps fortunate that the movie is also the acting debut of footballer Vinnie Jones. Being surrounded by such underachieving thespian talent makes him seem a whole lot better than he actually is; though he does fine. The same can't be said of Sting, I'm afraid. There's also a nice cameo by Red Dwarf's Cat, Danny John-Jules, as a subtitled, jive-talking Cockney.<br/><br/>Ultimately, despite it's obvious shortcomings, the multiple plot strands and timeframes of this movie are thrown together with such force, pace and comic-book vigour that it does make for passable, average entertainment. Just one question: why do they all call Tom fat? He don't look that porky to me! Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels - 5."

","If you've ever seen Pulp Fiction, you know that it's an intelligent and groundbreaking movie that flipped the Zetigeist of big-Hollywood production in 1994.  Guy Ritchie, in his completely overrated and overdone debut, takes everything that made Pulp Fiction a great film, rubbed poop on it, and rewrapped it with interesting-looking directorial maneuvers that belong not on the silver screen but instead are meant to flop around in the cesspools of MTV.  No wonder Ritchie won MTV's ""Best New Director"" award -- he copied thousands of music video tricks in order to pull off this boring, confusing, and banal heist movie.  It has terrible acting, awful and forgettable writing, and a storyline that meanders and, at best, serves only to cause more disappointment when a new ""character"" is introduced or one of the many goons gives his theories of life.  All in all, I don't see why Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels got all the critical acclaim it did -- perhaps the critics are giving up on art and just looking for a neat use of slo-mo.<br/><br/>Says nothing, goes nowhere."

","I watched this soon after it was released on video and was blown away ( Geddit ? ) by it . Unfortunately after seeing it a few more times since then I notice it`s become a victim of its own success . By that I mean every single British film released between 1999 and 2002 seemed to be about gangsters in one form or another carrying out a scam against a funky soundtrack in an inferior retread of LSATSB . In fact Guy Ritchie isn`t below plagerising himself with SNATCH which was basically the same film stylewise . But this was the original and best of the Brit gangster new wave. Brilliantly written in a sharp bleakly comical style with some mind bending cinematography by Tim Maurice Jones . There is some criticism that the acting is a bit wooden but I guess that`s deliberate on the part of Ritchie so that the dialogue comes to the fore . And what great lines the characters have , especially Rory`s "" Do you understand Nicholas ? Good cos if you don`t I`ll kill ya "" speech .<br/><br/>BTW this film cost less than one million pounds to make . Take note Hollywood that you don`t have to spend tens of millions of dollars to make a great movie"
"ericjg623","5","2","6","6 September 2002"," A Tarantino ripoff
","This is, quite bluntly, a complete ripoff of Quentin Tarantino. The soundtrack, the dialog, the whole way this film is put together is simply a well made imitation of ""Pulp Fiction"", even to the point of having a ""badass black dude with an afro"" in it. The story's not bad, although to my eyes at any rate, there's simply too many characters. It gets to where it's impossible to keep track of them all. In contrast, ""Pulp Fiction"" had just the right amount of characters and plot complexity to engage your brain without making you feel like you had to keep rewinding the movie to figure out who was who and where each character fit into the plot. This movie, judged by it's own merits, would be fairly good, but when compared to PF, it's barely adequate. <br/><br/>5/10<br/><br/>PS Brit criminals may come off as scary and intimidating to, well, Brits, but my guess is most American criminals would take one look at Mr. ""Hatchet"" Harry, then laugh in his face before hosing him down with an AK-47. Brits just aren't very good at portraying really convincing tough guys."

The utter nonsense it seemed while this was on my TV screen, it couldn't even be treated as a background noise while I cooked in the kitchen, because it was pure noise.

"basilisksamuk","8","1","2","24 February 2013"," Then it all went dreadfully wrong
","Some people prefer the Director's cut of Blade Runner to the original studio release and this preference is largely due to the fact that Ridley Scott removed all the naff voice-over and let the viewers fill in the not-very-difficult to figure out extra plot themselves. I therefore look forward to a future revised version of L S & 2 SBs in which the even naffer and more unnecessary voiceovers are removed. As the film opens with the spiel of a street seller, some highly contrived visuals and a setup requiring the aforementioned naff voiceovers I thought I was in for an episode of Eastenders but with lots of swearing. My heart and several other vital organs began to sink. Happily the film improved very rapidly and I came to understand why it has received such rave reviews elsewhere.<br/><br/>The plot revolves around 4 young men who have to raise half a million to pay off a gambling debt. This requires them to rip off a gang who are ripping off a ganja factory being financed by another gang. This is interwoven with a plot concerning the theft to order of two highly valuable antique rifles by a pair of incompetent amateurs. The climactic scenes feature convoluted plot coincidences and an object lesson in Mexican stand-offs. In fact I wouldn't be surprised to learn that the writer and director had been somewhat influenced by Mutt's favourite director, Quentin Tarantino.<br/><br/>OK, OK, I'll stop prevaricating and tell you that it is a damn good film. The visuals are great except for some odd effects which look like they belonged in a Vodka advert, the sets are suitably grimy, the script is very very funny as evidenced by a woman two seats away from me who kept distracting me with her constant cackling. The acting is wonderful. Well I say acting though I suspect that much of it is attitude rather than the result of hard thespianism. Vinnie Jones is excellent as the hard man enforcer as is Sting in his role as bar-owner and Eddy's dad . The four lads are cast to perfection as is virtually everyone else in the film. Several dimwit supports show excellent comic timing. The music is dead good too. (Let's see – constant bad language, witty dialogue, Mexican stand-off, excellent casting, cool soundtrack – are we sure director Guy Ritchie is not related to QT?).<br/><br/>I still have a few carping reservations. I don't believe real villains in real life talk as sharply or with such biting irony as the characters in this film. Essentially this is another disguised form of the American dream despite being set in England. The four leads are all supercool dudes who we are sure are going to walk through the whole thing unscathed whilst nameless sub-villains are shot to death all around. In a sense we are being invited to imagine that this is us – we are immortal and could come through any scrape like this. Yes, I know it's a black comedy but permit me to be just a little uneasy about it. I enjoyed it a lot but I was also uneasy about the manipulation.<br/><br/>Despite my nit-picking reservations this is still an excellent film which I urge you to go and see. If you want to consider it in terms of the fact that it is a British film then it is undoubtedly the best British film in living memory and worth a hundred 4 Weddings and Not the Full Montys.<br/><br/>Then it all went dreadfully wrong...."

To work with all of the characters that he wrote himself and know exactly what to do with them all just shows the leadership, dedication, and skill of a great writer/director. And all in his first major movie! <br/><br/>Since the characters were so well written and placed within an awesome storyline, it's obvious that all of the actors would have to work off of each other to make themselves better, which they did. The characters' problems and their ways of coming about solutions involving, simply guns and a plan really works out for excellent entertainment. And after it is all said and done, the compartments of humor, drama, and action all come together in a magnificent way to create one fine film."

The dialogue has the nice sharp, to-the-point edge that only British films can give the audience. The local language is used to give audiences a sense of realism. This is the way these people would talk about this stuff. This is an important film as well. It can be likened to Reservoir Dogs in its' effect. Filmmakers see this as a relatively cheap way to make films and achieve career boosting success. But the films biggest credit goes to its use of genre.

"extravaluejotter","6","1","2","2 July 2006"," Mr Madonna's Finest Hour
","I haven't exactly followed Guy Ritchie's career since ""Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels"". After going to see ""Snatch"", which treads similar ground to ""Lock Stock"", I decided that Mr Ritchie was a Johnny-One-Note.<br/><br/>That first note, however, was a good'un. <br/><br/>""Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels"" is NOT a great movie. I daresay that in 20 or 30 year's time it will look horribly dated and the dialogue will require subtitling. The pop-video direction and editing will also mark it as the work of another 90's-era hack director making the transition into ""proper"" cinema.<br/><br/>On the plus side, the viewer is treated to a very humorous script and a bizarre view of the hinterland where ordinary folk rub along with the criminal classes. Mr Ritchie succeeds in creating a world where all the characters seem to talk like Del Boy without it getting on yer bleedin' tits after the first half hour. In fact, the movie marks the point where everyone who lived and worked in London began dropping their aitches wholesale. Within weeks of the film's release, all the corporate City types in the coffee shops and pubs around the Lloyds Building had gone from Oxford English to sounding like Big Chris and Nick the Greek. You can't buy a cultural impact like that, although the producers of ""Snatch"" gave it a go.<br/><br/>A fine cast puts meat on the bones of their characters, with the exception of one Jason Statham. Mr Statham plays a slab of beef, a role that he was asked to reprise (and did so willingly, it seems) in ""Snatch"". There is also a leaden cameo from the partner of one of the film's producers, none other than Sting. Bearing in mind this guy's energetic and unhinged turns in films like ""Dune"" and ""Brimstone and Treacle"", Sting's performance here is phoned in.<br/><br/>""Lock Stock"" was such a hit and such an influential and innovative movie that it set off a tidal wave of derivative and mostly inferior Brit gangster flicks that took about 6 years to peter out. That was Guy Ritchie's biggest hurdle, and one that he has yet to overcome. When your first big movie is such a barnstorming success, where do you go after that?"

Another surprising fact was the movie was full of a bunch of relative unknown actors, besides Sting if he counts, and they all pulled of their parts brilliantly with plenty of depth.

","Ignore the few people who say it is ""like"" Pulp Fiction. The only similarities I can see are that both films are about gangsters and both have intricate plots. That is the art of good film making. If you want to watch a formulaic film with a hero who 'doesn't follow the rules', gets involved in a car chase and a shoot out in a factory at the end then there is plenty of rubbish out there to watch. 'Lock, Stock' is in a class of its own.<br/><br/>I won't spoil the movie, but my favourite line comes from Dog: ""Will everyone stop getting shot?"" Those who have seen the movie will know the scene and it was hysterical.<br/><br/>I am impressed that this film became such a hit in the States, since it is about as 'London' as you can get. For example, one character is called Nick the Greek, but sometimes he is known as ""Nick the Bubble."" No explanation is given in the film, but 'Bubble' is cockney rhyming slang for 'Greek'. Bubble-and-squeek = Greek (Bubble and squeek is a kind of British stew, and I don't recommend it.)"

","Very simply, this is one the few movies that I can watch often without tiring of it. The convoluted, circular plot is so entertaining and so whacked. The look of utter disbelief on the boys' faces as the plot unfolds is priceless. Everything ties together in ways that are, at the same time, coincidental and seemingly planned. Guy Ritchie achieves the same effect in ""Snatch."" Please, if you are reading this before seeing the film, try it. You will love it. Pay attention the multitude of characters, as they flow in and out. Oh, you might want to use your Closed Captioning; the accents are a little thick.

This movie, done by Guy Ritchie, the same guy who would go on to do the similar and equally entertaining Snatch a few years later, is bloody brilliant. With touches of such predecessors as Trainspotting and Reservoir Dogs, Guy Ritchie was able to make a movie that was at the same time thrilling and funny, with exciting visual and narrative style. The plot is confusing and simple at the same time, only because of the abundance of colorfully language characters, who are all stupid. If it's one thing about Guy Ritchie's films it's that his characters are obviously very dumb, but the ones with even the slightest hint of good sense and good morals will come out a little bit less bruised than the rest. This is an already classic movie with a lot of quirks and a lot of hilarious, exciting, bad-breathed, colorful, feather dusting sequences. Good Cockney acting.<br/><br/>My grade: 9/10"

","This movie is up there with (Caine's) ""Get Carter"" and ""The Long Good Friday"" as my favourite British gangster movies. However it is vastly different from those two eg. voice-overs, black humour (throughout and very funny), the central characters are not vicious killers. However the gangsters are evil nasty characters (I love the way one practices his golf), the plot has many twists (the ending is a classic!) and various seemingly unrelated groups move inexorably closer as the end nears. There are some violent scenes and there is swearing so it's not a ""G"" rating. Guy ""Mr Madonna"" Ritchie's direction and feel is excellent as is the involved plot with interlinked ""stuff-ups"". In this movie he works the new movie genre: a stylish humorous gangster movie. There are Tarantino similarities but this movie stands up on its own. A classic worth the watch.

"gkd105","10","1","2","24 April 2003"," Innovative, original, one of my favorites.
","When I first saw this movie shorty after it hit the US shores, I was really disappointed. I thought it was boring, uninteresting and hard to follow. About a year later I gave it another try. Lo and behold it became one of my top 5 movies (with the company of Boondock Saints, Taxi Driver, Pulp Fiction, and The Shawshank Redemption). It took awhile for me to piece it all together, but the plot is very clever and probably one of my favorites ever. The acting is great, the one liners are great, the soundtrack is EXCELLENT (the Dusty Springfield and James Brown fit in so well to the style of the film), the characters were memorable (not quite as cartoonish as in SNATCH, which is good). I've seen this movie more times than I've seen any other, and I love it each time. It's one of three movies that I find myself ""preaching"", along with Boondock Saints and Taxi Driver, as many people have not seen them.<br/><br/>I have to strongly disagree with many of the comments I read that Guy Ritchie copied Tarantino in making this film. This film is a completely different animal than Pulp Fiction. This is a crime caper/comedy, while Pulp Fiction is just a ""day in the life"" of a group of characters. Pulp Fiction really doesn't have much of a plot; it relies heavily on its everyday dialogue and out of sequence storytelling, but things just sort of fall into place. Lock Stock is intricate heist, which flows in chronological order, for that matter. People seem to call this movie a Pulp Fiction clone simple because several groups of characters fates are intertwined.

","I'll make this commentary short.  ""So what?"" is my reaction to this movie. The film made absolutely no attempt to make me care about any of the characters except for...Chris?  The independent thug with a son.  Other than that character, I couldn't identify or care about anybody.  They were cardboard.  The humor was droll and not particularly clever.  I laughed approximately five times in this dark comedy.<br/><br/>Which is depressing, because I am likely their target audience.  I love dark comedies and B-films.  I've endured cardboard characters in such films as Robot Monster, Crocodile (the Thailand one), and Troma's War.  I have nothing against foriegn movies--they're usually better than American films. But no, not here.  <br/><br/>Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels just sits there.  You just sit there. You look at it.  It continues to sit there.  This movie doesn't achieve anything.  The denouement is annoying and took too long, with an especially wretched deus ex machina.  This movie just fails to be of any merit.  Top 250...yeah right."

","The Italian job meets Quentin Tarrentino just outside the Queen Vic in Albert square. This has to be the best comedy of the year with out a doubt, but I think you have to have a very British sense of humour. Not as violent as you might expect but the language is a bit strong. The plot is not to complex a load of Eastend villains robbing from each other and beating each other up. One of the best scenes (without giving any of the plot away) is when a barman is describing an event to a customer in very broad Cockney and sub titles pop up explaining what he is saying. Very good cameo roles from Vinny Jones and Sting. If you want a good laugh and forget about everything for a couple of hours I recommend this film."

They both show a strange underworld which probably doesn't exist, but this film is much more amusing (Pulp Fiction doesn't have a guy being beaten to death with a dildo). Some may find the end annoying (I wont spoil it for you) and you Yanks will have trouble understanding it (Trainspotting was a different accent, this is in a different language) but if you do watch it I guarantee you will be laughing out loud.

","Lock Stock has become a National Treasure. As a British film fan I have never been more thankful for a movie. It certainly ranks up there with Get Carter, Trainspotting et al.<br/><br/>Guy Ritchie has hardly any flaws as a director, and almost none as a sharp, witty gritty screenwriter. Ritchie burst onto the feature film scene after helming some noteable TV adverts and music vids, and he manages to achieve a bizzare mixture of frenetic serenity. Some scenes use quick cuts, editing magic and a thumping theme tunes, while others flow by using close-ups, sweeping camera movements and placid funk and soul writhing in the background.<br/><br/>Some sequences really catch the eye; the opening featuring Jason Statham's famous street salesman speech (partly improvised by Statham, an ex-dodgy goods salesman), and rolling into the getaway using Ocean Colour Scene's '100 Mile High City' as a backdrop. The first sight of Vinnie 'Big Chris' Jones to the menacing funk of James Brown's 'Payback'. Never has a song suited a character so perfectly. And the three card brag sequence, both in wit and in the sheer editing masterclass provided by Ritchie and his editor Niven Howie, is a moment so perfectly cut, tableaud and jumbled that you cannot help but marvel at the sheer cheekiness of the pair.<br/><br/>The cast do their bit. Some hip cameos and sterling lead foursome help the whole thing to raise a notch. Were it not for the presence of Lennie McLean, Vinnie Jones, Sting and Danny John Jules, and the four bickering main actors then this film would have been as poor as the series that became of it. But the four leading men do a fantastic job with the comedy provided by the script. Nick Moran should have made a good career out of his role as Ed, the card shark with a sly tongue, and a quick eye. Jason Statham plays Bacon as a sarcastic rogue. Jason Flemyng is cheeky, adventurous, would be entrepeneur Tom. And Dexter Fletcher gives it his all in his role as clean living, yet slightly unnerving performance as Soap.<br/><br/>But the star of this movie, is the script. Ritchie goes in full throttle on the Cockney dialect and sheer flamboyance of the dialogue. The use of accent from the cockney contingent is complemented well by scousers Gary and Barry. Ritchie throws the camera around with glee, adds a catchy, populist soundtrack and lets the dirty and flirty gangsters of London banter away.<br/><br/>One of the most qoutable movies in recent history, and rightly so. Every character has their scene, and Ritchie never leaves the camera standing. Fantastic, graceful, indulgent, emphatic, whatever you want to call 'Lock, Stock', just make sure you appreciate how cool it is."

","All hail Guy Richie for this inventive, comical and original gangster movie that reinvented the British Gangster genre. Lock Stock tells the story of how a group of east end lads overcome the local mobs through a series of astonishing and humorous coincidences. Never before has a mix of witty black comedy, humorous          and intelligent scripting gone so well together in a British Gangster movie. Guy Richie puts all the best elements of a good crime thriller together to create the perfect blend of fast paced witty action comedy.  Clever stylish editing speeds the narrative along at a perfect pace, the east end backdrop provides a gritty aesthetic authenticity and a snappy script with witty one liners provides the perfect comedy appeal together with the at times cartoonish         .  Guy Richie indelibly makes his mark in the British film industry and in the US as a young and very talented director and writer.  The follow up ""Snatch"" proves that he has the talent to pull in the big names like Brad Pitt and Benicio Del Toro but he will do well to prove his versatility as a writer and director with a film that steers away from the gangster genre for a while to avoid type casting."

There are some absolutly fabulous sequences in Lock Stock. I don't recall any Oscar recognition, but there should have been for this. It's like watching a long music video except it's not boring at all. It's the teenager's pulp fiction. I felt like getting up that very instant to write or film with my new inspiration.

","Comparing Guy Ritchie to Quentin Tarantino may have its perks, but I'd prefer not to. The only similarity between them is that they depict the lives and times of low-life criminals in a humorous way, and that they both have a real skill in writing plots with many twists and turns. However alike their writing is, there is nothing similar in their directing. While Tarantino is sometimes painfully slow and contemplative, Ritchie is fast, violent, witty and music video influenced. And there's a time for both. But for sheer fun I'd go with Ritchie.<br/><br/>""Lock, Stock..."" is insane. At some points, the story is almost believable but don't hang on to that - it quickly becomes a twisted, weird, fast-moving and funny, FUNNY mess of a plot where the casual and unintentional interactions between the different gangs and individuals almost become hard to follow. There are some scenes that alone make this movie worth watching - the sequence when the cannabis-harvesting loons shoot at the gangsters trapped in the steel cage with a soft air gun, or when the OD-chick suddenly comes alive with the machine gun. Hilarious, stupid, insane and fast-paced. Humor or the best kind. The cast couldn't be better, even Sting is pretty good the few moments he appears. But Vinnie Jones really tops it - not so much for is acting skills, but more for his character. Brutal and by far the smartest of the lot, he drags his little son around the messes that he makes, careful not to let the boy hear any profanity.<br/><br/>A great film, and one that I certainly will watch again and again."

Well Absolutely nothing really.<br/><br/>Although I will admit that the film was funny at time's in a 'laugh out loud' kindda way. The Dialoge still seems a bit crap, If I may be frank. All the lines are written (& said for that matter) in the style of Michael Caine on a bad day, there seems to me no attempt to ever act as such in this film & how everyone says that Vinny Jones Acts well is beyond me due to the fact he doesn't seem to have to. However maybe this is missing the point, maybe Guy Ritchie wanted the dialogue to sound like a bad Michael Caine film, there lies the joke, however I've got other criticisms.<br/><br/>Lets look at some plot characteristics. A group of young, small time crooks. One of them upsets a big guy & has a contract on him, the action also revolves around a bar. Basically it's Mean Streets with a dope sub-plot & a happy ending.<br/><br/>Also a major problem is the direction & camerawork. At time's the film turned from a film & attempted to experiment with editing & camerawork, this would be fine apart from the fact that nothing was experimental & looked more like a pop promo, this wasn't helped by a largely trendy soundtrack.<br/><br/>So in sum shouldnt really have been in the cinema, MTV would have been a better place for it.

","I watched this movie again recently after many years. It was entertaining enough as an evening's viewing, but afterwards I was left scratching my head, genuinely not understanding the hype - on any level. The best thing is probably the soundtrack.<br/><br/>The acting is abysmal. It makes Vinnie Jones' acting look good. It doesn't help the actors the script is abysmal. (Michael Caine can get away with being a bad actor because at least he has some charisma). The casting was bad because in addition to crap actors, in a plot with way too many characters, none of them developed, you need them to stand out visually from each other. With the exception of the Scousers and Hatchett Harry, they don't. I was grateful one actor, at least, had a high pitched voice and pony tail, because I found myself lost not knowing who the hell everyone was much of the time.<br/><br/>I note the script was written by Guy Ritchie - any other script writer and the film wouldn't have got made or would have had considerably more development first - exactly what it needed - for plot , character and dialogue. That and a bit more rehearsal time for the actors so they didn't sound like they were delivering lines at a read through. I'm a Londoner so didn't have any problems UNDERSTANDING the dialogue, but all the characters sounded the same - none speak in a unique voice. Same flat characters (with absolutely no development or back story) in dull monotone voices delivering what is supposed to be witty dialogue full of one liners.... when EVERYBODY sounds like that it sounds like a pretentious script writer trying to be cool, clever and failing miserably. Far better imo to have one character doing the witty one liners for impact.<br/><br/>The Scousers can be funny at times - I don't care about stereotypes) but they could have been even funnier by toning it down a bit. The British are known for subtlely, and I think that's what this movie needed to make it into the cracker of a film it could have been.<br/><br/>The plot is confusing with way too many characters we can't follow running around, many things happening for the sake of happening. I think there was one woman in the whole film. Not sure they even employed female extras. Much of the plot is thin and cookie cooker, ripped off from other movies. The violence is not funny and it's not shocking either. It's pointless. It fails miserably on all front. As for style, Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dog, Train Spotting etc s it is not. It failed on the styling front for me too - costume wise and cinematically.<br/><br/>Perhaps it did so well at the time due to hype and the lack of cool British gangster films at the time. Watch it for something to watch by all means, but not for a piece of great British cinema, because that's most definitely what it is not."
"matt_dawber","7","1","3","3 January 2012"," A brilliant British film
","A wonderful blend of sharp witty humor, plenty of twists that are sure to leave you trying to keep up (and even pausing the movie for a couple of moments just to make sure you actually are up to speed on the whole plot), and of course Guy Ritchie's undeniable style that will capture and enthrall your attention, which always gives his films such a unique feel to them only adding to the overall enjoyment. Oh and some violence thrown in for good measure (what's a good gangster film without violence?). the actors did a convincing job for not being very well known in fact they did a much better job than most of the actors you see in modern films these days. And the story was absolutely hilarious! Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is a heist film involving four friends owing a grand some of half a million pounds to a local gangster after he rigs a card game. And now they have only one week to come up with the money or else... and so begins the start of many schemes and brilliant twists that make up this film and only add to the dark hilarity proving it very difficult not to laugh. Even though the humor is much more darker than your average flick (but really is that a bad thing) Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is a great Guy Ritchie film and a brilliant debut showcasing his skills in directing a very enjoyable film. Although it might not be quite as good as Snatch (though Brad Pitt was a huge disappointment) but definitely a favorite of mine even if the accents can be hard to understand. Well worth the rent if you've never seen it before I highly recommend it."
"toll-8","7","1","3","30 November 2011"," Very good, but Snatch surpasses it.
","This film must show Americans that not all the English speak with posh accents and act in pretentious ways. Whenever I watch an American sitcom or film portraying someone British I find myself on my high horse as hardly anyone speaks in the way they think we do. If we give all Americans this film to watch they will soon realise that England isn't as pretty in pink as they seem to believe. This film is gritty, dark, humorous and filled with all kinds of cockney rhyming slang that Americans would need subtitles. This is the London they all fail to see. <br/><br/>The film is about four friends, one of whom Eddy (Moran) is a brilliant card player due to his ability to read people's emotions during a game of cards. Being onto what they believe as a winning deal, the group all pitch in twenty five thousand pound for him to use in an underground card game. Little do they know however that Hatchet Harry, the organiser of the game, doesn't believe in a fair game and cheats his way to taking all Eddy's money and incurring him a five hundred thousand pound debt on top of that. The debt also includes his friends who will all start losing their fingers if they don't repay in seven days. The friends have no idea where to start but manage to overhear their drug dealing neighbours discussing their plan to steal a large amount of money from some incompetent drug dealers. Eddy's plan is to rob these guys once they have robbed the other guys. Meanwhile two antique shotguns have just been priced at three hundred thousand pounds and Hatchet Harry sends two scouse lads in to steal them. Miscommunication construes and Eddy and the gang end up with five hundred thousand pounds worth of cash and two antique shotguns. Breathing down their neck are also the neighbours, the incompetent drug dealers and their dangerous boss, Hatchet Harry and his cronies and Big Chris (Vinnie Jones) who 'collects' for Harry. <br/><br/>The film plays out with lots of interweaving plot lines and several twists and turns all filled with irony. Each twist and turn ends up with someone not realising just what they have a hold of. For example the group find themselves in possessions of the guns which would solve all their problems but they have no idea that these guns are actually of some value. Also the two scouse lads tracking down the guns don't realise they are actually hunting down the person they robbed them for in the first place. The plot is completely confusing and will make no sense in writing but to watch it you will see exactly what I mean.<br/><br/>The script is fantastic, all the dialogue is realistic and well thought out and the majority of the acting is spot on, especially from Moran, Flemyng, Fletcher and Statham. The opening five minutes set it all up with an Only Fools and Horses style selling technique. Bacon (Statham) is attempting to flog some dodgy jewellery before being chased by the police. The dialogue and acting in this sequence sets us up for the acts to follow and really creates the world that we will be living in for the next two hours. Bravo Mr Ritchie a compelling script you have bought to our attention. One scene that is brilliant is when the neighbours are locked in a cage during the robbery and are being shot at with an air rifle. The whole sequence is fantastic.<br/><br/>However the film does have its downfalls. At times there are just too many characters and people are introduced and then disappear for long periods before returning and others show up so late you wander why they were bothered with in the first place. In the end it does all come together but throughout the overuse of characters sometimes makes the plot seem a little disjointed.<br/><br/>I personally think this is a very good film but it has to be your cup of tea otherwise you won't enjoy it. It is one of Guy Ritchie's best films but certainly not his best, Snatch gets that award hands down. I believe that if I was reviewing this film in 1998 then I would be more impressed but as I am viewing it after I've seen Snatch particularly, I can't rate it quite as highly. It is a good film but I suggest you watch it before Snatch. That way you will be treated to a very good film followed by a great one."

","I had just about given up on our own industry by the 1990's. Even when substantially British productions came on stream they were invariably funded by Hollywood and stuffed with their actors, accents and cultural mores.<br/><br/>What a refreshing change, then, with 'Lock Stock etc'. Here is a cast of British actors, giving full-tilt to an obviously British script and the whole thing set in seedy London locations (not many, actually). And it's a cracker! There's the sort of who's-who latter-day hard case ensemble not seen for a generation. It's like 'Sweeney' meets 'The Lady Killers'. Comedy is everywhere, but in that subtle, understated, way so typical of our British style. I don't mean to knock American comedy, because when it's good it's top-drawer. But it does tend to be just a little too predictable for our own cultural tastes. Monty Python could never have happened in The States.<br/><br/>It's a great case of crossed-up crime capers. A young gang of chancers find themselves owing money big-time to a ruthless old racketeer. From that point on its a hilarious battle of wits, with a massacre or two that probably owe homage to Tarantino, but not much.<br/><br/>The dialogue is heavily laden with Cockney rhyming slang to an extent I have never heard even though I worked for years with full-blooded, Bow-belled, natives. There's also a good smattering of British 'street' jargon, which is subtly different from anything to come from the Bronx. Foreigners (Yanks) who experience lingual difficulties should use the subtitles.<br/><br/>Production levels are extremely economical. Most of the 'location' work seems to have been taken in Park Street SE1, just where it branches from the Borough Market under the railway bridge. The place has always looked as decrepit as it appears in the movie - and still does. Though it's gradually getting 'yuppiefied' as I write. This absence of cityscape makes it a slightly claustrophobic experience, but the great script and excellent dialogue, plus the rabid bursts of action compensate for this. An American production would almost certainly feature a helicopter overflight with glittering office-blocks. This movie is so painstakingly minimalist that it's almost a poke in the eye at Hollywood excess.<br/><br/>'Lock, Stock etc' is a first-rate comedy crime thriller, as counter-culturally suave as 'Ocean's Eleven', but funnier, grittier, and more ironic. And created for a fraction of the price. Go for the 'Director's Cut' version if you can find it. The 107 minute standard release is a little too chopped in its editing. The longer version provides just enough infil to make presentation seamless without interfering with the excellent camera and cutting work. My 9 stars are for the longer version. <br/><br/>Highly recommended."

The story revolves around four working class blokes who get saddled with a half a million pound debt and have a week to come up with the cash before they start losing appendages.<br/><br/>The story is an inventive one, snaking its way through numerous twists and turns, eventually arriving at a satisfying conclusion. The script contains plenty of humour and the British setting gives American audiences a fairly unique experience. That being said, those who have trouble with accents may find the dialogue a little hard to follow, particularly since there's some Cockney rhyming slang mixed in.<br/><br/>The cast is a well-chosen, authentic bunch. There aren't really any standout performances but there aren't really any sub-standard ones either. That being said, I could have done without Sting but at least his role is only a minor one.<br/><br/>Ritchie's direction is energetic and employs a multitude of cinematic techniques. Occasionally his stylization goes a bit overboard but overall he exercises enough restraint to keep the story moving briskly. The film shows its low-budget roots in the visuals but that doesn't matter much since the grimy look suits the subject matter well. The soundtrack is another key element in that it contains a number of excellent cuts that go a long way in establishing the film's tone.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a quality gangster film, albeit one that mixes in a heavy dose of comedy with its crime. Comparisons to Tarantino are warranted but, in my opinion, it would be a disservice to dismiss Ritchie as a mere copycat. There's real inventiveness here, as demonstrated once again in the stylistically similar (and arguably superior) follow-up, ""Snatch""."
"kurciasbezdalas","10","1","3","18 January 2009"," One of the bests crime movies ever
","Actually a summary was going to be ""A British version of Mean Streets"" because I found this movie having many similarities with Martin Scorsese's Mean Streets and I think that Guy Ritchie was inspired by this film, but actually Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels has overcome Mean Streets (and I think nowadays it is also better know than Mean Streets). You never know what to expect from Guy Ritchie, this movie is half a black comedy and he's making fun of all of his characters, even the toughest ones, so it's a really entertaining movie. I also heard that Guy Ritchie was inspired bay Quentin Tarantino, but in Tarantino's movies the dialogs are more intellectual, in Guy Ritchie's movies the dialogs are more street-like. This movie is Guy Ritchie's feature film debut, but only for this film he deserves to be called one of the bests crime-movie directors ever."

","This is the ultimate gangster comedy. It contains guns, gangs and blood but it also contains a marvelous direction and many funny quotes. First of all this movie can be seen for comedy or an action film. The actors don't play their roles ridiculously and they don't make you say that they were laughing through making of, it is a complete balance of a comedy and an action movie that you just want to see. Excellent soundtrack including rock, jazz and even folk (i am from Greece and i love ""Zorbas"" during a battle). Guy Ritchie makes a fantastic work directing so the cast does. It's not just a movie for laughs, it's a masterpiece of action/comedy and showing us that Guy Ritchie is not just the husband of Maddona. I suggest this to everyone who likes a good balanced English humor and action.<br/><br/>p.s. i loved the use of Cyprian words ""shistos, pesevengi, gamouri""!!!"

","""Lock, Stock and 2 Smoking Barrels"" is an entertaining but ultimately an evanescent work which pales in comparison to anything written and/or directed by the true master of the genre, Quentin Tarantino.<br/><br/>Tarantino is brilliant at melding the old (Hong Kong & Blaxsploitation) with the new and along the way he created a whole new language of film.  As a result, Tarantino created some of the definitive films of the 90's.  Ritchie tries to do the same, except in this instance he tries to repackage Tarantino's work (Pulp Fiction, True Romance, & Reservoir Dogs) into something new.  The effect is not the same.  What was fresh in the Tarantino films seems ultimately derivative and overwhelmed by its own style.<br/><br/>Looking at the backgrounds of Messrs. Ritchie and Tarantino can help give insight into where each artist is coming from.  Tarantino, by all reports, was the child of a working class single mother and he toiled away for years in a video store in the gritty South Bay of LA while eating, sleeping, breathing film.  Mr. Ritchie, whom the media purported to be a ""hoodie"" type, is anything but:  he grew up the child of privilege.  Both had to overcome their backgrounds to succeed in the business, but whose voice resonates stronger and more authentically?"

"Desertman84","10","1","4","22 October 2012"," A Perfect Blend Of Intelligence,Humor And Suspense
","British writer Guy Ritchie made his feature directorial debut with this crime-caper comedy-drama set in London's East End and heavy on the Cockney dialogue in this movie entitled,Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. The story is a heist film involving a self-confident young card sharp who loses £500,000 to a powerful crime lord in a rigged game of three card brag. In order to pay off his debts, he and his friends decide to rob a small-time gang who happen to be operating out of the flat next door. The film brought Guy Ritchie international acclaim and introduced actors Vinnie Jones, a former Welsh international footballer, and Jason Statham, a former street merchant, to worldwide audiences.Jason Flemyng,Dexter Fletcher,Nick Moran,Steven Mackintosh and Sting co-star to play key supporting roles.<br/><br/>A big-bucks scheme goes awry: Cardsharp Eddy and pals Bacon,Tom, and Soap scuffle to pile up enough money to put Eddy at the card table opposite gangland porn lord Hatchet Harry. Unfortunately, the whole plan backfires, leaving Eddy owing Harry a huge sum, payable within the week. In truth, Harry hopes to acquire the bar run by his rival, J.D., who is Eddy's father. To raise the cash, Eddy sets out to steal from a marijuana business run by Winston,but the inevitable gun play doesn't make for an easy heist. <br/><br/>This is one of those movies that was destined to become an instant cult classic.Although some comparisons were drawn between Ritchie and Quentin Tarantino, it would be unfair to discount the brilliant wit of the story and the innovative camera-work that the director brings to his debut feature.Indicative of the social stratosphere in London, Ritchie's movie is a hilarious and at times touching account of friendships and loyalty. The director and his mates clearly are enjoying themselves here. This comes across in some shining performances, in particular from ex- footballer Vinnie Jones (Big Chris) and an over-the-top Vas Blackwood, who very nearly steals the show. Full of quirky vernacular and clever tension-packed action sequences,this movie is a triumph which is a perfect blend of intelligence, humor, and suspense."

"megadoomer","10","1","4","28 October 2009"," An All-Time Great in the Heist/Crime Comedy Genre
","Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels is a stylish, witty, and fast-paced comedy that spans every level of the London criminal underworld. The film is centered on four friends who pool their money so that one of them can enter a high-stakes back-room poker game. Eddie (Nick Moran), a natural at reading the most minute involuntary reactions, is convinced he can't lose. The game has been rigged against him, however, and what looked like a sure thing ends with Eddie and his friends in debt to a local crime boss and purveyor of pornography named Hatchet Harry. Now these three petty criminals (and one aspiring chef named Soap who's always managed to keep his hands clean) have one week to come up with £500,000 or Harry's enforcer will start taking their fingers. <br/><br/>This is writer and director Guy Ritchie's first time at the helm of a feature film, but he expertly guides us through a labyrinth of schemes and characters without the viewer becoming lost in the details. And there is a lot going on in this movie. Multiple interconnected plots dance around each other as thugs, street-corner jewelry hucksters, drug dealers, and crime lords all scheme against one-another. Ritchie makes excellent use of the camera and of music. When Eddie staggers away from the poker game finding himself impossibly deep in debt to a very dangerous man, the scene takes on a surreal yet panicked mood that puts the viewer right in the character's shoes. Looking directly into his face as he makes his way out, you're drawn in and feel his world crashing down around your own shoulders. The slick soundtrack of blues and rock adds to the effect of immersion, setting a rhythm for the action on screen. <br/><br/>The cast members turn in strong performances all around. Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels marks the feature film debuts of Jason Statham and Vinnie Jones, both of whom would go on to become well-known actors in the genre. Sting also turns in a memorable cameo appearance as Eddie's father. <br/><br/>There is a fair bit of violence and quite a lot of foul language. While it doesn't descend into being vulgar simply for shock value, there is more than sensitive viewers are likely to be able to overlook. For fans of this genre, however, this film is one of the very best. It's funny, full of surprises, and engaging right up to the very end."
"carbuff","7","0","1","27 December 2019"," Arguably 10 stars, but I'm getting older
","I saw ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" when it first came out and thought it was one of the best movies I'd ever seen. To this day, if you were going to sit down and compose a list of the all-time best British gangster movies (and, I think, the British indisputably make the best gangster movies), this film would still rank somewhere near the top. The plot is twisty, clever, witty and chock-a-block with strangely compelling eccentric psychopaths. The production values are slick, but obviously intentionally filmed in a grimy-lens sort of manner, which very effectively captures the story's underworld atmosphere. This film also jump-started the career of a few actors in this film, most notably Jason Statham.<br/><br/>You know how people say, ""It's not you, it's me"", well, that's how I feel about this film 20 years later. As for many of us, life can be a bit tough over a 20-year time span, and this film doesn't possess one single sympathetic character. I'm not exaggerating. Not even a single teeny-tiny one (that's kind of an inside joke you'll get after watching this movie). By the time I reached the credits, I had lost complete interest in who was still living. Being a guy, I absolutely hate the phrase ""toxic masculinity"", but I think that the ""bros"" completely populating and dominating this entire film represent those who today's aggravatingly condescending ""woke"" prudes are perpetually hectoring the rest of us about. (This movie had absolutely no female characters of any substance, which doesn't seem unusual to me for a Guy Richie production.)<br/><br/>So it all kind of depends on what you're looking for. If you want to kick back and watch a classic British gangster film, ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" remains somewhere near the top of the list, but just don't be expecting any feelings of emotional involvement, unless, I suppose, you're a psychopath, but then you wouldn't be feeling anything anyway. Still, I'm sure that this movie is just what the doctor ordered for an awful lot of people, and, sadly, I must confess to getting some guilty pleasure out of it. (Not sure why I'm confessing, since I'm not even Catholic.)"

"andrewburgereviews","7","0","1","13 April 2019"," Cheap, shallow and British--what's not to like?
","Apparently, there are a few things not to like about Guy Ritchie's ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"". This is a film whose ugliness and gaucherie make it work, but despite being made by a director who developed a trademark style, the screenwriting gets in the way of what could have potentially been a masterpiece. But without getting off on the wrong foot, let me tell you that this film offers nearly scene after scene of humor, all driven by the incompetence of its characters.<br/><br/>Guy Ritchie feels like a Quentin Tarantino who suddenly decided that he fancies a warm pint of lager in some Ye Olde Pub to an American Dukes of Hazard or a regional Martin Scorsese who, after spending two weeks in the UK, would lower his standards. This is a director who fully encapsulates the cheapness and piss-off-ery of London thugs with indecipherable accents and about as indecipherable of a plot. In the end, it all pays off, though, as the plot complicates so much that even its characters are caught on the wrong foot and the film explodes into a ridiculous and funny climax. All these thugs are pretty much carbon copies of each other (as if the plot isn't hard enough to follow) and their actions and motives feel rather basic to their job. The only ones that stand out are the four main friends: Eddy (Nick Moran), Bacon (Jason Statham), Soap--because he was clean, legit (Dexter Fletcher) and Tom--boring name, by the way (Jason Flemyng).<br/><br/>Even if the characters' shallowness feels like the film lacks a certain meaning and makes it difficult for us to relate with anyone, it is a good thing that Ritchie at least went all the way with it. I mean, imagine how cringy it would have been if Eddy had found out that the local gang-land boss, Hatchet Harry (P.H. Moriarty) was cheating at the poker game and justice would have been served or whatever. No morality here as the inevitable end of most of these gangsters comes simply from stupidity which makes it funny and the fact that you don't really connect with any of them makes it even more effective.<br/><br/>An interesting observation is that the streets are often empty, unlike Scorsesian pictures in which the entire environment is aware, Ritchie takes a deader approach. Every frame is devout of any extras except some rare scenes in the bar or two random people talking to each other in one scene. It almost feels as if Ritchie put this characters into a maze-like world as he examines their interactions but it's not that. These are not that type of characters and this is not that type of film. Unpretentious and simple yet complex, this shouldn't even have such a long review."

","Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels may have been the film to cemented Guy Richie's spot as a cinematic and iconic force to be reckoned with, but after having watched both this movie and Snatch, it's hard to argue in favor of the former being a superior film. Everything this film lacks, Snatch made up for and expanded upon. Now this isn't to say that Lock, Stock isn't a great film, it's quite enjoyable. However, its slightly harder to follow even though it's plot is less complicated and convoluted than Snatch. <br/><br/>The cast is weaker, but the focus on their characters is better. Where the movie failed to grab me as a viewer is how each character could be considered slightly less memorable than those in Snatch as well as the dialog. Snatch sees it's cast embody far more personality as well as polishing the gritty world a bit more; making it an easier and superior watch. I can usually argue against polish in a film if everything else is in check, but as I stated before Lock, Stock feel like the less fully realized film. It doesn't have that punch that Snatch has either. <br/><br/>If you're looking for a great film to watch and haven't seen either, then I recommend watching this one first followed by Snatch, or if you've already seen Snatch then watch this one, but only if you're a fan of Guy Ruchie films or crime comedies more than anything. It's really a film that perhaps could have been best experienced back in the days when it first came around. But given that was the 90s and other similarly themed films such as Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, Trainspotting, etc, where around this one could be considered a weaker entry for some."

Frankly that movie reel should of been swept away. But back on LSATSB.

Then hell comes raining down on them, when they acquire these old antique shotguns. Action, some of it comic style, and some nasty impassse's ensue, among situation after situation, making for a tight scripted film, with kick arse dialogue. The performances of the four are great, where later though, Stratham, really proved that he was only of standard acting ilk. Vinnie Jones was great and funny, as one of the heavies trying to track down those collectables, and be careful when you use bad language around his son. I found Lock, Stock And Two Smoking Barrels, to be immensely enjoyable, and a true blue original, that kind of set the set the standard for a new wave of British gangster flicks. In this one, the comedy, and it's sharp, like in some of the shootout scenes, what have you, and drama, is in perfect amount, an ingredient for success.

","How can I describe this movie in one sentence? A low budget but extremely well acted and directed movie.""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" is a gangster comedy with complex plot, dark humour and memorable characters. Writer-director Guy Ritchie did great on this, it's his first film. He is probably my favorite new director. It is a clear recommendation for everybody who enjoys good gangster films with humorous aspects, and if you liked Tarantino's films, this is a suggestion.<br/><br/>The movie is about a poker player named Eddy .who is bankrupted by Hatchet Harry,a gambling and porn king. Harry cheats, Eddy runs up an enormous debt, Barry the Baptist explains that he will start chopping fingers of his friends if he don't pay up. What to do? So the action beginsbut you get the idea. Or maybe you don't. The plot is complex yet understandable and enjoyable. My first reaction was to compare Ritchie's style with that of Quentin Tarantino. On following reflection, no, director Guy Ritchie with this film has a style of his own. What impresses is the way Ritchie handles all of the story lines in this one story. He also does it in such a high-energy style that you have to stop and catch your breath. Ritchie also gets mostly unknown cast, but every single actor in this film does a great job of acting, each plays a unique character. Dialog, dialog, dialog! Don't get me wrong - there's plenty of action in this movie, but dialog (it happens seldom in a movie) are absorbing. As I said, this movie will not be every one's cup of tea. It contains a lot of violence, guns and shooting, blood, dead bodies, fighting. One may say that language is very strong, with multiple uses of ""f--k"" and various other words, including English slang. The plot involves marijuana growers and stolen drugs, there are no positive characters (it's great, what's to like in them?, positive characters are nearly the same) . But it is done tastefully, funny and fashionable. Finally, the music accompanying this film is excellent. Out of the perhaps several thousand movies I have seen , this was the first soundtrack that I downloaded and it is a very strong collection of old and new tunes that really added a lot to the atmosphere. I rank this movie in my top 10 all time list. If you haven't seen this film yet, you must. It is so funny; you'll want to watch it over and over again."
"schreiber-stephen","7","0","1","23 January 2014"," One of the best low(ish) budget films of all time
","Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is a trend-setting and doesn't get its proper due. Many people point to Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction as the most revolutionary films of the modern era but some might argue that Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels deserves just as much credit as these two. Quentin Tarantino and Guy Ritchie brought everyone into the modern day of what movies could be and what many now are. Guy Ritchie, unfortunately for him, didn't write as many quotable one liners as Tarantino, not to mention the heavy cockney accents found in this film as well as Snatch. In the eyes of the general public, these reasons are why Ritchie is back a couple of notches from the fame of Tarantino. <br/><br/>Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels has what can only be described as a Guy Ritchie stamp on it. It was shot on Super 16 which gives the film a beautiful look and feel throughout. At certain times the film does feel a bit low budget but not as often as one might expect. There are points in this movie where you are in awe of how gorgeous the images are and how well crafted the framing is. There are some innovative ways Ritchie uses true slow motion in this film as well. It is important to point out that he did not shoot the slow motion parts in real time and then slow them down after. These were shot in true slow motion. You can tell the difference and it's one of the many things I love about this movie. Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels had a budget of 1.3 million which does sound like a lot of money but when you look at what Ritchie ultimately ended up producing with that budget it is quite incredible. It is even more incredible when you review the cast and see just how many great actors are in this movie. All of them, from Jason Statham down did a fantastic job. There was only one or two moments where the acting wasn't the best but for the most part this movie felt like an extremely large production because of the quality of acting, the size of the cast and the many shootouts that occurred.<br/><br/>There is one particular shootout in this film that was outrageously gorgeous. This one scene involves a stoned out female, an enormous automatic weapon and a dose of comedy at the end. ""Where the f*** did she come from?"" Priceless. The slow motion in that scene is incredible and has you in awe as the spent rounds hit the floor while the hailstorm ensues. It is one of the best shootout scenes captured in any film. Unfortunately, this style of shooting has been stolen and overdone by many directors as the years have gone by. This has caused this type of filming to go stale and now hardly anyone does it anymore, unfortunately.<br/><br/>The other great thing about this film that is incredible is that Vinnie Jones who plays Big Chris just got out of jail on the first day of shooting this film. He was arrested for attacking a neighbor. To be able to keep Vinnie focused and have him deliver a great performance like he did shows just how good Ritchie is. It is also a great casting job as Vinnie is one of the few people that could pull that role off. He is also well known as a very tough soccer player which I am sure made the casting job a little easier as they might have wanted someone who is relatively well known for that part.<br/><br/>Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels isn't without flaws. There are a few moments where you can tell Ritchie is trying to save on cost and in turn it produces a moment that is just a little bit strange or doesn't quite work. There are also a couple of scenes where the writing could be a bit stronger or some of the plot holes could have been filled better but for the most part it is a great film that can stand up to just about anything out there. Without Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels we would not have the clever movie Snatch which could be considered a high budget version of Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels many actors return to that film and the writing style is almost exactly the same. That shouldn't come as too big of a shock considering that Ritchie did write both but it is worth noting that Snatch is another film that takes this style of directing and expands on it as Ritchie was given much more to work with. Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels should be homework for any film student."

","If you love crime stories that are cleverly contrived to yield ever more jolting twists and turns, you'll love this film. Crude, violent, and complex, this rogue's gallery filled with self-destructive fools and idiots is an endless romp through the seedy world of London criminals.<br/><br/>This film is an excellent reason to stay straight for survival's sake. There are so many ways to wind up either maimed or dead presented in this story that just watching it makes you glad you're an honest stiff who lives far from all this lunacy!<br/><br/>Don't miss the chance to hear Jason Stratham engage in more fast, clever verbal banter than he will probably ever do again in any film.<br/><br/>The most impressive roles, IMHO, are played by Lenny McLean and Vinnie Jones, who both steal every scene they appear in as Hatchet Harry's money collection thugs. McLean and Jones are both scary just to look at with just enough balance between menace and quirkiness to make them curiously endearing.<br/><br/>The four lead characters are actually rather weak and unsympathetic over all. But there is so much non-stop poop hitting the fan that we get caught up in the sheer mayhem of each successively more intensely absurd scene.<br/><br/>A crime classic!"

","Forty years after Mario Monicelli's Big Deal on Madonna Street (1958), Guy Ritchie surprised the world with his freshman feature length effort Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998). Both feature a cast of relative unknowns making eager but unsuccessful attempts at petty crime. But while Big Deal grounds its farcical elements with post-war Italian neo-realism, Lock, Stock is played largely for laughs and told with an infectious sense of film-school-reject style.<br/><br/>The principle foursome in Lock, Stock have a foolproof plan to make a handsome profit. Jason Flemyng, Dexter Fletcher, Jason Statham each pass on scrounged savings to their ringer Eddy (Nick Moran). Eddy then takes part in an illegal poker game featuring some of East London's most notorious gangsters. = Profits. What they don't count on however is the host of the card game Hatchet Harry (P.H. Moriarty) cheating and putting the boys in over their heads. Now it's either come up with £100,000 or end up taking a swim in the Thames.<br/><br/>There are side stories involving drugs, stolen antiques and a psychopath with a ""cute cuddly thing"" going on, all of which converge in flashes of confusion and absolute chaos. It was like watching an extended version of the last twenty minutes of The Lavender Hill Mob (1951) inter-spliced with Tom and Jerry shorts resulting in an ending that would make the cast of Seinfeld (1989-1998) proud. The rich irony of the situations created by Guy Ritchie (who also wrote the script) and the galvanizing moments of fate never lose their luster even after repeated viewings.<br/><br/>While Ritchie was born in Hatfield, Hertfordshire he no doubt wrote what he knew when he ascribed the bungling protagonists and their equally shortsighted foils. They are characters that you might bump into on the mean streets of East End complete with Cockney accents and colorful idioms. In the DVD extra bonus features there is even a Cockney to English dictionary that translates certain phrases like North=Mouth and Geezer=slightly older fellow. But lest you be too busy for the bonus features, at one point in the film subtitles appear for bit to help non-Cockneys understand the comedy. In the words of Professor Henry Higgins in My Fair Lady (1964) ""There even are places where English completely disappears; in America they haven't used it for years."" Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels makes for perfect rental fodder. It's breezy, funny, full of character and style while never slumping into moments of boredom. To Jason Statham fans, this movie is a must since not only did he explode onto the scene with this film, he shows he can actually act. To Guy Ritchie fans who no doubt have already seen Lock, Stock and prefer the more popular Snatch. (2000) I still would recommend giving this one another shot even if its sans a Brad Pitt. You never know what little details (or idioms) you might pick up.<br/><br/>http://theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com"

","Guy Ritchie's feature film debut is a stylishly directed, cleverly scripted & ably performed crime comedy that borrows heavily from Quentin Tarantino's method of filmmaking in both style & substance yet succeeds in carving an identity of its own with its original, inventive & brainy concept teamed with excellent use of British humour.<br/><br/>The story of Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels concerns four friends who find themselves heavily indebted to a powerful crime lord after a rigged game of cards. Given a limited time to arrange the money, they decide to rob a small-time gang operating just next door to pay off the debt but an unexpected turn of events soon throws everyone into confusion.<br/><br/>Written & directed by Guy Ritchie, the film marks his breakthrough in the movie industry and is crafted with excellent wit, flair & imagination from start to finish. The screenplay employs a non-linear storyline but it all comes together near the end to form a satisfying whole. The dialogues are sharp, comic timing is spot-on and the plot brims with memorable one-liners.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels brings many new talents on the screen, including Jason Statham and they all chip in with viable inputs and are fully committed to their given roles. Also working in the film's favour is its dynamic camera-work, tight editing that keeps the plot moving, and smart use of existing songs which wonderfully compliments its narrative.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels is an unabashedly hilarious, highly enjoyable, wildly entertaining & utterly satisfying ride that easily goes down as one of British cinema's finest crime films. A solid start for Guy Ritchie, a smooth blend of crime & comedy and always a fun experience no matter how many times you watch it, Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels comes thoroughly recommended."

The performances are superb especially Vinnie Jones as big Chris and Barry the baptist.. But the protagonists all of them have pulled off a superb show.

Though i loved the way the Guy Ritchie, put all the intro and the characters into perspective, what really impressed me was an equally amazing conclusion and summing up of the movie.. The direction and the execution of the movie was superb and like most of the movies with a great script loose track in the middle of the movie, this kept the pace and fun going through out..

"The-Sarkologist","9","0","2","1 April 2013"," Simply one of the best movies to come out of London.
","I would call this movie the ""British Pulp Fiction"" though it is far better than Pulp Fiction. The plot is quite complex and begins with lots of different strands which are all brought together in a very interesting way: though a quick explanation is that it is about four guys who get one of their lot to play a high-stakes game of poker which he loses. Thus they must get half a million pounds with-in a few days or be slowly cut to pieces.<br/><br/>It is a movie that I can see becoming a cult movie, it has that certain feel to it. The wit in the movie is extremely clever and the directorial techniques quite unique. This movie I would term as experimental, though such movies seem to quite often come out of Britain. America dominates the mainstream market, so other countries need to experiment with their filmmaking to compete. Britain seems to do quite a good job at it.<br/><br/>Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels is what I would term as a grunge movie. The movie has a very dusky tinge to it and it is set entirely in the East-end of London (well, I can't say for sure as I suspect Harry's Sexshop, and maybe the bar, are located in Soho), a very lower class area. Everybody in the movie are criminals and this is made obvious. Even those who are clean are only clean because they distance themselves from what is happening. None of the characters have any really redeeming qualities, nor do they get through the movie due to any amount of skill. The card player, even though he is very good, could not overcome the camera which was scanning his cards, and as such lost.<br/><br/>This movie delves deep into the criminal underworld of London. It is an underworld where there is no love or compassion but rather people trying to outdo each other. It is a world where only the strong, the smart, and the lucky survive. In fact, only six people do survive: the four card players, and the loan-shark and his kid (not counting the father, but he knows how to keep his nose clean): everybody else winds up dead, including all of the crime lords, and through a stroke of luck, the four guys manage to keep their hands clean.<br/><br/>Some British movies do suck, but this is not one of them. From seeing movies like this, it makes me appreciate the British Cinema a lot more. I could not say if Hong Kong Cinema and British Cinema influenced each other, but there is something that sets it apart from their American counterparts. It is also interesting to note that in the 1998 version of the British Oscars, Titanic was not mentioned once."

","Mad bad and highly entertaining, I really enjoyed this film. I particularly liked the fact that when things got particularly violent the camera wasn't pointed directly at the action. We were aware of what was going on but there was no Tarantino-esq splatter-fest. This may well have been for budgetary reasons, but I'd prefer to fill in the blanks myself anyway. The plot does get a little over-complicated in places but is all neatly resolved in the end just about.

You can't help but wonder how you yourself would act in a situation like this - although surely, no viewer could be as stupid as the characters in the film. Well, stupid is probably a bit strong. Naive perhaps. In any case, the story is brilliantly told, you keep rooting for the good guys, and for ... ahem... some less good ones as well.

","It's the rare film that I'm compelled to watch in back to back viewings but this was one of them. The visual style, colorful language and interwoven plot threads keep you on your toes, and even though I always turn on the captions to watch a modern film, here it was completely necessary as I've never taken English as a second language. I think that's where a lot of the picture's humor comes from actually, because British slang and it's colloquialisms are so off-beat and unfamiliar to the American ear. So even though the film is liberally laced with the 'F' word, it's offensiveness almost evaporates because it doesn't come across as done for shock value but as part of Cockney sentence structure.<br/><br/>A word to the wise up front if you haven't seen the picture yet. Take out a pen and a sheet of paper to keep track of the players. There are a half dozen separate sets of characters here that interact with each other that are pretty distinct, but because none of the actors are very well known (at least not to me), you might have trouble keeping track of them from the outset. As things progress it gets a little easier, but having a scorecard around makes it less cumbersome to follow.<br/><br/>No sense going into the mechanics of the film or rehashing what the story's about, there are plenty of those reviews here already. I don't even want to draw comparisons against other films as this one is truly unique in it's style and story telling, though if you enjoy Quentin Tarantino's work you'll probably like this as well. Not for the prissy or squeamish, there's a lot of swearing, boozing, gambling and drugs on hand, but it's a memorable flick and wildly original. Recommended for multiple viewings."

","Guy Ritchie's feature length debut might just be his finest directorial effort of them all. Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels is about a group of four friends who pool their money together to play in a high stakes poker game. However, things don't go according to plan and they end up owing 500,000 pounds to the owner of a porn shop in downtown London. The worst part... they only have a week to get him the money or they'll have their digits cut off one by one until their fingerless, toeless, and maybe noseless. And so the group of clowns come up with a hair brained scheme to come up with this hefty sum of cash, and what they come up with is twisty, wacky, and violently hilarious.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the movie we meet our four protagonists, as well as a cavalcade of other characters who all seem to be totally unrelated. But as the story progresses everyone we meet at the beginning of the film serves a purpose and the way the characters intertwine and the way their stories develop through a series of mix-ups, misunderstandings, and wrong place at the wrong time scenarios is absolutely brilliant. Rarely do you see such refined work in big heist storytelling that manages to be intriguing and enthralling, but also possess a dash of something else. A streak of black humor that makes you cringe and laugh at the same time and a thick layer of wicked action and brutal violence. It's incredibly exciting, and wildly entertaining.<br/><br/>One of the strongest elements of Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels is the script, which is riddled with slang, one liners, and character nuances that make every scenario and every person in the film unique. There's a very specific cadence to the way the characters talk in the film with their thick cockney accents and their love of word play, similes, and all other sorts of figurative language. There's a real clever ingenuity behind all the laughs and all the bloodshed, and it makes this film something like we don't usually see. It's an action comedy that doesn't use cheap gags or easy laughs, but it's also a grandiose heist story that doesn't make things too overly complicated, but brings in enough elements to the story to make your head spin. But it's the good kind of spinning. The one that enthralls you into the story and the one that makes you love every minute of this incredibly excellent film."
"KineticSeoul","7","0","3","4 June 2012"," Guy Ritchie Begins
","This movie is what launched Guy Ritchie's career and for good reason even if it's his debut movie as well. I can tell Ritchie is a fan of Quentin Tarantino or at least inspired by his work cause this movie has certain elements that seem like it was inspired by Tarantino. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing in some cases including this one. What drives this movie is the over the top and snazzy dialogue despite the constant profanity. The plot is simple but goes in a slightly convoluted direction. In fact for some viewers it maybe difficult to understand what is exactly going on when viewing for the first time. Mainly because it has multiple different group of people, each group having their own story but later comes together in one melting pot. The plot includes hustlers, thieves, loan sharks and gangsters but they are all after one thing and that is money. In fact most of the movie revolves around the characters bickering, arguing and fighting each other for money while using some flashy and witty British dialogue. The dialogue sometimes even has some pretty good humor in it, the black comedy aspect of this movie really works and doesn't seem forced at all. Lot of the good humor comes from the awkwardness of certain situations though. The plot isn't all that coherent and seem over the place at times, but the good dialogue is able to back that up. This movie shows that being a fanboy and getting inspiration from other people's work can create something very watchable as long as they don't plagiarize. Since there is a difference between inspiration and just plain copying in a very secretive manner. If you wanna watch a movie about bunch of guys quarreling over money in a entertaining manner in a sort of Tarantino style fashion, this movie might be for you. This is one of those movies where the build up is most definitely worth it when it comes to the finale. This isn't a artistic movie or has any morals but if you want a movie with a good blend of violence and profanity this one just might be for you.<br/><br/>7.8/10"

","The stingy Tom(Flemyng), seemingly clean-cut but deep-down possibly insane Soap(Fletcher), the fence Bacon(Statham) and the card-shark Eddie(Moran) are no strangers to the world of small or big-time crime of London's East End(which is the sole environment this takes place in, and it really brings it to the screen), and they've got 25K each, totalling at 100, which is the entry fee for the big game(that last-mentioned intends to win, bringing home quite a lot for the four) with Hatchet-Harry(Moriarty). It doesn't go as planned, and as his name might suggest to you, the H is not someone you want to owe money(he could send Barry the Baptist(McLean) at you... why call him that? 'cause he likes to drown people), and they have a week to come up with it. Meanwhile, their neighbours are planning to rob a group of pot-growers of their product and the wealth of profit it has brought in so far, and there are two antique rifles(hence the title) in play as well, and the various factions(did I mention there's a Samoan mob in this, too? The leader looks adorable, until he opens his mouth and threatens death and destruction, and you find yourself trusting him on that) are all after one or more of these items, either for what they're worth or because they have to, for someone else. There are a ton of mix-ups(the audience are the only ones to know everything that happens), and in addition to these surprising twists and turns, this is kept going a lot through the golden, quotable dialog(note that most of it is full of slang from the local area, and if you're not familiar with such, you may need subtitles to follow this) and these situations where people are threatened by this or that circumstance or person. This is a gangster-comedy-thriller, with a macho, very *guy* sense of humor to it. A lot of the fun comes from the quirk, as well. Ritchie loves him some dumb hustlers(here and in Snatch), and he plays with the camera and editing with the grace of a virtuoso, leading to a visually stylized film that never bores you. The characters are distinct, and for the sheer amount, that is as impressive a feat as how much screen time and development are actually afforded the lot of them. Everyone is well-cast and the acting is great. The types here are priceless. Vinnie Jones portrays an enforcer, as he should. This keeps to a marvelous pace. The 100 minutes fly by. There is a lot of brutal, bloody violence, strong language, crude references and a little nudity/sexuality in this. The DVD comes with a trailer for this. I recommend this to any fan of Guy, the leads and the British disposition. 8/10"

","Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels is a fast paced, witty, hilarious film in where Guy Ritchie made his first big hit and showed to the world that he knew what he was about. The film starts off introducing these four guys who entrust their friend Tom (Jason Flemyng) with a hundred thousand dollars to go and play a game of cards with the local mob boss, Hatchet Harry. Little does Tom know, Hatchet Harry cheats at the game, and makes a deal with Tom saying he would front him the money to continue the round of poker, and when the cards are turned, Tom loses, and now him and his three other friends are in debt half a million pounds to one of the most fearsome mobsters in town.<br/><br/>This film is packed full of hilarious scenes, and Guy Ritchie's notorious freeze frames voice overs help add to the film greatly. A particular scene comes to mind when right after Tom loses the game and returns to his anxious friends, the camera frame stops and a voice over narrated by Alan Ford in where he says 'If Tommy told his friends that he wished the debt was only upon himself, he'd be lying ""and then the shot begins to roll again and Tom proceeds to say, ""I wish the debt was only on me, but it ain't"" Overall the film in itself was fantastic, with a deep plot line, witty dialogue, quick cuts that Ritchie is famous for, excellent voice overs, and fantastic acting on the parts of all the characters involved. Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels will keep you laughing at the twisted humor while all the while sitting on the edge of your seat, waiting for more."

More than a decade on it remains fresh, smart and entertaining, launching the B careers of both Vinnie Jones and Jason Statham.<br/><br/>Ritchie proves that he has an ear for dialogue and a well chosen musical interlude, and the ability to fashion a labyrinthine multi-layered plot populated by colourful characters all entrenched in the small time underworld. The core plot follows 4 long time friends, Tom, Soap, Eddie and Bacon, all toeing the fine line between a (mostly) legal existence and petty crime. These four are hardly hardened, hardmen at the start of the film. But things change when circumstances demand.<br/><br/>To be more specific, when a high stakes poker game with renowned underworld figure Hatchet harry goes awry and Tom and buds find Harry on his tail and his Dad's (Sting) bar on the line, with seven days to make good on a half million pound debt and no obvious legal way to fund it.<br/><br/>A myriad of colourful characters quickly and often unwittingly become embroiled in an ever-escalating, increasingly intricate, always irreverent series of events. Drug dealers, hired goons, thieves and more than enough hard guys than would usually be required to change a lightbulb all descend upon the four in ways that are circuitous, coincidental and convenient.<br/><br/>The body count grows steadily, though for a long while most of the violence occurs offscreen, but as the stakes are raised and the number of participants grows it is inevitable that so many guys waving guns about will eventually bring casualties, many of which fall in quick succession.<br/><br/>Despite this Lock, Stock is hardly a 'video nasty' akin to Hostel and the Saw films, but a wildly entertaining and creative Cops n Robbers tale sans the Cops that shows good plotting and well crafted dialogue can elevate a film above the pack.<br/><br/>Final Rating – 8 / 10.

","""No money. No weed. It's all been replaced by a pile of corpses""<br/><br/>Tom (Jason Flemyng), Soap (Dexter Fletcher), Eddie (Nick Moran) and Bacon (Jason Statham, not quite yet the action star he'd later become) are four of the luckiest men I know. They are always knee deep in trouble, always up s**t creek without a paddle, yet somehow, someway lady luck whores upon their behalf time and again. They decide to challenge ""Hatchet Harry"" in a cards game, one with enormous stakes, because Eddie ""reads reactions well"", but underestimates the power to cheat.<br/><br/>Yep, Harry has his own ""Hatchet Man"", Barry ""the Baptist"" (nicknamed this because he has a way of dunking heads in water to ""fish for information"" when his boss demands the ""goods"") who keeps a monitor down stairs and secret cameras which are able to read the cards of those participating in the high-stakes cards game. So even if Eddie might've had the skills to upend Harry if the game was legit, he's s**t out of luck, because Harry is sneaky and underhanded. So Eddie winds up owing Harry 250, 000 pounds and must come up with it in a manner of days. Sting has a snazzy supporting role as Eddie's pops who owns a bar that Harry wants; Harry will take the bar in exchange for Eddie's life.<br/><br/>The plot doesn't stop there, no sir, with multiple characters coming into picture, such as a ""Samoan Joe"" pub owner (David Reid with a fro, whose character, funnily enough, is actually Samoan Jo!), crooked neighbors who live next to Eddie and the gang (planning to heist a group of pot smoking dealers), and a hapless bunch of marijuana growers whose idea of security is woefully inept. But how two antique guns play into the entire scheme of things is just hilarious. Those two guns lead to all sorts of mayhem—the way they exchange hands you'd think this film was ""Winchester '73"".<br/><br/>About the guns, Barry The Baptist hires two bumbling blockheads (who normally steal cars and postal items) to take them from the home of an elderly couple fallen on hard times. The thing is, they were actually told to take weapons from a cabinet (but the guns Harry specifically wants aren't in the cabinet, so the two thieves sell them to ""Nick the Greek"", more about him in a moment) and do so. Barry is furious with them and warns the duo to go and get those guns back. Nick the Greek buys and sells contraband, having made deals with Tom over ""merchandise"". Nick sells the guns to Tom. Eddie and the gang plan to rob their neighbors after they rob the dope dealers. Yes, the plot just goes on and on. Keeping up with this movie was quite a feat, I must say, but the characters are fun and in Ritchie's movies they are colorful enough and developed with little quirks and personalities. I can say this: ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" isn't boring! I haven't even mentioned Vinnie Jones, as ""Big Chris"" who is Hatchet Harry's ""muscle"" (and the icing on the cake is how his son accompanies him on ""missions""!), intimidating as ever, but not without principles (and doesn't tolerate profanity or blasphemy in front of, or from, his son, even though violence is common place in their lives!). At least, in this movie's case, he's not just a violent brute, but does seem to operate with a level of control. Those familiar with Ritchie's style can expect a vibrant and energetic camera style, not to mention, clever methods behind setting up the spiraling-out-of-control plot and the litany of characters who populate this criminal world. Harry seems to be the catalyst--or is it the pot--but, things get out of control with and without his help."

","This is one of my favorite films. Guy Ritchie's writing is nearly perfect in this comedy of coincidences, that aren't really coincidences, but are instead the inevitable result of the multiple story lines meshing together perfectly in this dark comedy. The movie is fragmented initially, but this is required in order to establish each of the rich stories and characters that go along with them. Everything fits together so well that I cannot help but smile as the film unfolds. Ritchie's directing is very stylish and amazing to watch, particularly in the various montages that combine inverted camera movements and still images with a remarkable effect.

"jusco15","6","0","1","24 December 2010"," jusco's review: Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels
","It's like Snatch's twin brother, which I guess is understandable considering it's the same director. Guy Ritchie's first film is in typical fashion; bizarre, erratic, whimsical. Once again following several interlinking story arcs, it is a puzzling crime film with a lot of laughs and deaths. Four young men find themselves in debt to a crime lord (£500,000!) and they conspire to steal money from their weed-growing next door neighbours. On top of that, two antique guns and a whole bunch of characters find themselves unknowingly involved and pitted against each other; a perfect setup for a comedic and violent tragedy. Containing smart dialogue and sharp, stylish camera work (different from Snatch's editing, but still unconventional) and relatively solid performances all round, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is a solid debut from the British director. Unfortunately, if you end up watching both Snatch and this, you'll be sick of the similar styles and tones. However, it is still hilarious and of course, shocking, and it's well worth a watch. Though Snatch may have had more laugh-out-loud moments, I personally enjoyed the crafting of this film better; the editing was not as distracting, thus allowing smoother flow, and I also found the ending brilliant. But please, I beg you Mr. Ritchie, don't do it again. We've had enough of heavily-accented British crime comedy films, especially from you."

","""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" is a very fun criminal movie which keeps the audience quite entertained throughout. <br/><br/>It starts out with a plethora of characters, each one more interesting and unique that the first. As neat as all of these characters are, it does get a bit confusing in the beginning to tell who's on whose side. Another problem that I had in the beginning was understanding exactly what was being said at times. Many characters used jargon and slangs that were difficult for me to follow. That added with the accents made it a chore to follow, but once the movie started rolling along, it became much easier to understand exactly what was going on.<br/><br/>This is a very over-the-top film and is definitely meant to be that way. There were so many groups of criminals all fighting over the same thing that it was comedic and interesting at the same time. <br/><br/>The placement of the guns as an object to fight over is nicely done as well. Nobody really knows what the deal is with them throughout all the madness and it is cool to see another object used that way other than just money. <br/><br/>I liked the ending a lot too. The final scene when the audience gets to draw it's own conclusion to whether the heroes saved the guns or not was a nice way to close the film. <br/><br/>This is a really cool movie of this genre and will leave you satisfied at the end.

","Four middle aged men attempt to recover a massive debt by stealing money and drugs with only a week to repay the biggest gangster in the business.<br/><br/>The first film for writer/director Guy Ritchie was, when released, a refreshing slap in the face of hardcore British crime that had been somewhat lost and with a relatively unknown cast this proved indie works and what a wake up call this was to the dimension of British cinema and film making.<br/><br/>After Danny Boyle's refreshingly controversial Trainspotting a few years previously this launched British cinema further onto the world stage through its heavy political gangster world and heavy use of drug and violence.<br/><br/>Since Quentin Tarantino arrived in the early 1990's violence and drugs in cinema have been dealt with in a freer environment. Who could forget Mia Wallace's coke taking sequence? And the Brits have followed that through with an equally effective use.<br/><br/>Opening with a good fast narration of no nonsense attitude, this is how it is, we have the unseen protagonist showing us who the movers and shakers are and what the game is all about. This quick fire introduction scene setting is great as we can steadily move forward without looking back and whilst there is an overhaul in characters to begin we can settle and watch the adventure unfold.<br/><br/>After a cleverly shot card game the main characters find themselves in desperation to recover £500,000 within a week which spells delicious entertainment for all watching as stealing, robbery and gambling are all encoded for ensuing mayhem and just like Snatch and layer Cake this whole situation is exceptionally serious, but has a great balance of being inappropriately humorous. The feet through the table, the attempted unrehearsed robbery even the character one liners will have us chuckling away and this being the catalyst for the future is a great reminder to where it all started. Don't expect any James Bond styling here this is all gung ho action specked dialogue with a rural frustration that spices with dark comedy that makes it unique and is highly appreciated as Guy Ritchie's most thought provoking and equal best.<br/><br/>On a personal level I find Snatch to have the edge owing to the excellent montages and easier to distinguish protagonists, not to mention the whole business of fighting intermixed with other crime concepts fits together perfectly. This 1998 picture has a few holes, just a few. There is an overhaul of characters and it is quite hard on first or second viewing to remember who is who and where. Plus the synchronization of perfect timing can backfire in a few scenes.<br/><br/>Apart from that and the unnecessary swearing this is a brutally hard riveting crime drama that flies high with comedy and perfectly started the hard nut crime segment of excellent British gangster films."

Vinnie Jones was perfect in his first movie role as Big Chris, Harry's messenger of sorts who loves nothing but his son, Little Chris (played by Peter McNicholl). Frank Harper was super as Dog, the angry, hateful neighbor of Eddie and Bacon and leader of his little ""gang"". Steve Sweeney was hilarious as Plank, Dog's little messenger boy. Huggy Leaver and and Tony McMahon were good as Paul and John, Dog's gang members. And Ronnie Fox was funny as Mickey, Dog's Bren-carrying gang member. Steve Mackintosh was excellent as Winston, the leader of the pot-growing gang and only serious thinking member of his group. Nicholas Rowe, Nick Marcq, and Charles Forbes were funny as J, Charles and Willie, the stupid pot-growers. Vas Blackwood was well-fit to play Rory Breaker, the angry, serious gang leader. Stephen Marcus was funny as Nick the Greek, the stupid merchandise seller. Jake Abraham and Victor McGuire were a great pair as Dean and Gary, the two morons hired by Barry the Baptist to steal guns for Hatchet Harry. Suzy Ratner was good as semi-conscious Gloria. Sting was great as JD, bar-owner and Eddie's father. And Alan Ford was excellent as Alan the bartender, JD's friend and the Narrator of the movie. <br/><br/>Well, thats all I got. I miss anything?

"johnnyboyz","9","0","2","25 August 2008"," Taking the British gangster genre to new and scary places.
","I've always liked Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. I've always admired the energy and the manner in which director Guy Ritchie doesn't necessarily tell us a brilliant story but does get across a feeling of urgency; a sense of desperate times calling for desperate measures. Lock, Stock very much falls into that mid-late nineties cannon of British crime films revolving around the youth of the day, getting mixed up in criminal activity rather than being out and out gangsters themselves. With Lock, Stock; you don't get the feeling anyone who's under the age of thirty really wants to do what they're doing, it's either for a laugh or because they're forced to.<br/><br/>Films such as Shopping and Trainspotting could be seen as precursors to Lock, Stock. They were crime orientated films but crime orientated films about youth getting mixed up in irregular criminal activity such as drug taking, dealing and ram-raiding. They were not gangster films about gangsters per-se like The Krays or Mona Lisa  two films from just before said films' time. However Lock, Stock combines the two ideas of youth involved in crime and the gangster genre as a whole and delivers an experience that has you sit back, put your feet up and enjoy a runtime of smart dialogue and faced paced that still worked on me all these years and viewings later. The film delivers a rapid array of scenes and visual styles more akin to music videos or perhaps even blockbusters as transitions and gimmicks fill up the screen and aid in playing out the events.<br/><br/>Along with Snatch. two years later, Ritchie took inspiration from Tarantino's groundbreaking Pulp Fiction and gave British audiences not so much a breath of fresh air like what Tarantino did, but an alternative  an alternative to the stuffy and somewhat clichéd image of the British gangster as a hard bodied man who ran industries and dealt with anyone who crossed him. The best moment that gives us ammunition to read into this is one of the final few scenes in the film in which an unexpected shoot out occurs in a sex shop owner's office. The 'clichéd' image of a gangster character utters the words after a great shock: ""What the (expletive) are you doing here!?"". This question is directed at a character of many years his junior and is a question that rings true from all 'stuffy' imagined gangster characters as Lock, Stock arrives: the 'lads culture' of the gangster genre has arrived and the old guard cannot believe it  best summed up in that one shoot out nearer the end.<br/><br/>But this is just fuel for an oppositional reading and I happen to have enjoyed almost all of the pre-Lock, Stock gangster films that I've seen (Brighton Rock and The Long Good Friday are my favourites). The 'criminals' in this film or at least the protagonists are young, cocky and without too much of a care. They are not criminal kingpins; they do not have an empire to run; they have not served time in jail  they have unspectacular jobs like market salesman or chef and yet they are placed in a situation against forces much higher than them and can only rely on criminal activity that just happens to be on their doorstep to bail them out.<br/><br/>A lot of what Ritchie does to tear apart the gangster ideation (both image and genre) is to do with comedy. A lot of the content in this film would never, ever be seen in any gangster film prior to 1998 and a lot of the humour would not be presented as being so light hearted. In this film, a 'psychotic black man with an afro' will sit behind a desk and a wall of screens displaying motorcars whilst sucking on an iced-lolly, something that both challenges what the image of a gangster might be and simultaneously tempts us to laugh at someone of this stature. Indeed when the film threatens to go 'dark' with this character over the volume of a TV in a pub, an amusing voice-over and use of subtitles distracts us from the uneasy conflict on screen. In fact it happens twice; this time the four lads of the film react with a sarcastic holler after the film's soundtrack has died for said psychotic black gangster's emphasised reply of: 'No'.<br/><br/>Lock, Stock at its core is a guerrilla film but it's a guerrilla film with an ideation of: 'yes, it realises what's transpired in the past and now it's going to blow away the cobwebs and do something outrageous.' But as a film and a filmmaker, Ritchie creates enough ambiguity and tension through the job itself (which is well structured: they must get through the locked gate, deal with someone hidden in the back, negotiate the disguised girl on the couch and then get away but the comic element of the traffic warden keeps everything 'light') but he also pays close attention to his soundtrack. James Brown's 'The Boss' over Big Chris' looming figure works well as does 'Liar, Liar' as Eddie blags his way through the card game with a light Reggae track over some stoners works equally well.<br/><br/>The film evens finds time to dedicate dialogue to the moving away from gangster films gone by. One character buys some guns of another and the seller retorts that ""sawn-offs are out"" further moving Lock, Stock away from that old fashioned image of Brit gangsters and their sawn-off shotguns. People want more 'range' these days is another quip  he is right but the range is in the toying with genre conventions. Apart from bending all the rules, Lock, Stock is a fast and furious ride down slapstick gangster alley that, at least for me, still holds up after so many viewings  it's just good fun among other things and Ritchie knows when to keep the film dramatic amongst everything else that happens."

","It's difficult to list films that have had the same effect on their genre that Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels has. I defy any reader to name me a British gangster film made in the last ten years that does not have some resemblance to director Guy Richie's 1998 Magnum Opus.<br/><br/>But what is it, you may ask, that makes Lock Stock so excellent, so worthy of emulations? Well, let's start with the dialogue. Richie's script cracks with wit, humour and a strong sense of authenticity. The characters are well acted and larger than life, with household names of British cinema such as Jason Statham, Jason Flemyng and Frank Harper making their characters unique.<br/><br/>Plot also contributes greatly to the film's excellence. It revolves around professional gambler Ed (Nick Moran) and his friends, who seek an easy earner in an illegal poker game. Unfortunately, thanks to a spot of unfair play it goes awry, with the four owing money to local gangster, 'Hatchet' Harry Lonsdale. With a week to pay off the debt, the four stumble on a plan involving a large quantity of ganja, Ed's psychotic neighbours, privately educated drug dealers and a football mad psychopath with an afro...<br/><br/>Lock Stock also features a powerful, gritty soundtrack, with songs from Robbie Williams, James Brown and a host of other talents."

It has everything in it; comedy, wit, action, style, a great soundtrack, wonderful acting (the sexy Nick Moran being my favorite), perfect direction and cinematography and an even more perfect script. <br/><br/>Now, the two things about this film that make it as perfect as it is, is the witty and intelligent script and the wonderful characters. Through the script and the great acting, the characters, although many, are able to really be developed, and developed well. We get to know not only the main four; Ed, Bacon, Soap and other characters like Winston, Plank, Rory and Harry so quickly. We really get a sense of who they and what their intentions are from just a short period of time with them. <br/><br/>There are so many wonderful and clever lines in the script and they are quick and easy to miss sometimes. I would recommend watching this film at least twice (Or like me, over one hundred times) in order to gain full understanding of the dialogue. <br/><br/>Now, it's only natural progression that after praising the film I'm to move onto talking about the writer/director, Guy Richie. To be honest I don't care about his string of not-so-good films after Snatch, which I must say, I didn't like as much as Lock Stock. To me this film stands alone as the film he became to writer/director for. I also don't care about his affiliation with Maddonna, that's his personal business and nothing to do with me. None of that stuff matters to me because this film is perfect as far as I'm concerned.<br/><br/>I have seen and enjoyed this movie many many times over."

","This is probably the best crime movie i've seen since Sin City. The way the camera fits in with the mood of the scene, music, and actors is with such perfect coordination, its easy to forget your're watching a TV screen. On a side note, the music was good too. The story is about 4 crooks in London trying to get something more out of life. They try to beat cards with local crime kingpin Harry, but fate turns against them, and they have to get £500,000 in 7 days, or face nasty consequences. This sparks an entire trail of events, flipping over from one person with their goals to the next, all coming together in the end for an explosive ending, which will leave you dumbfounded. Take it from me, when you and your friends are just really bored, get this movie and watch it with them."
"simpsonjames","10","0","1","15 November 2005"," A Dark Comedy mixed with a fresh storyline and a splash of drama
","Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels comprises a beautiful mix of comedy and gritty gangland drama. The plot surrounds four friends who pool their money together for one of them to enter a poker competition, unfortunately they lose, and have only one week to come up with the cash. This surprisingly simple yet dangerously overwhelming problem soon see's the four friends become embroiled in another gangs plot to steal large amounts of weed and money off a supposedly small time outfit run by ex-students trying to make a quick buck.<br/><br/>The plot set against a gritty London background has an intense mix of humour and drama that makes a compelling watch. The film itself has a real sense of quality and yet made on very little money. The script is something that makes this film a bench mark to a new genre, it becomes more complex as the plot thickens, yet when broken down it is simplistic, you feel drawn in by it and not quite sure what might happen next, mainly because of the many other sub plots that run alongside the main story. The best way to some up this film is that each aspect has been carefully compiled letting very few details go unnoticed (maybe the acting on very few occasions)but when spliced together it is a work of art, a perfect balance of humour, drama, tension and intricate story telling leading to a fantastic Crescendo. In conclusion, although this film lacks some of the emotional content a film such as Schidlers List has, its design and general plot make it a superb watch, anyone who hasn't seen this film, please don't wait any longer go to your local entertainment centre and buy a copy because this is a sure bet!!"

","From debuting director Guy Ritchie, the man who married Madonna, this is I think the film that re-established the British gangster movies and put them back on the map. Eddy (Nick Moran) loses £500,000 that was loaned to him by fellow card player, porn and East End crime king P.H. Moriarty as 'Hatchet' Harry Lonsdale, he has a week to get it all back, and Harry has loyal debt collector Big Chris (Vinnie Jones), with son Little Chris (Peter McNicholl), to make sure it is paid. With the help of his mates Tom (Jason Flemyng), Soap (A Bear's Tail's Dexter Fletcher) and Bacon (Jason Statham), they plan a robbery not hatched by them, but by their neighbours. The first thing that happens is that two antique long barrel shotguns are bought for a £700 scam, and the four jack-the-lads have quite a few other things going wrong, and it is really amusing when the gang realise the two guns are worth thousands, at the wrong moment. Also starring Steven Mackintosh as Winston, Nicholas Rowe as J, Nick Marcq as Charles, Charlie Forbes as Willie, Lenny McLean as Barry the Baptist, Frank Harper as Dog, Steve Sweeney as Plank, Stephen Marcus as Nick the Greek, singer Sting as JD, Rob Brydon as Traffic Warden and Alan Ford as Alan (also narrating). I can agree with the critics this has quite a youthful feel to it, with a very reliable and splendid cast, and a funny and fierce witty script to go with it, a great crime comedy. It won the BAFTA Audience Award, and it was nominated for the Alexander Korda Award for Best British Film and Best Editing, and it won the British Comedy Award for Best Comedy Film. Very good!"

","Guy Ritchie has a special talent for these film types as i discovered when i viewed the equally good Snatch. Lock, Stock... is a bit more stylish than Snatch, and the end sequence was filmed on Battersea bridge! ( the exclamation mark is there for people like me who have walked across the bridge many times without even realising) The film is quite offensive in parts, but is still a masterpiece of a film. The plot is a group of 5 friends save up enough money to play cards with ""Mr Big"" Harry Lonsdale, however, the game is rigged and after borrowing money off of Harry he has 1 week to pay him back or he gets his fingers cut off! That night, as the friends squabble amongst themselves, Eddie hears his neighbours planning a robbery of weed and shoeboxes full of money, so they decide, in order to get the money, they simply rob the robbers. Things go fine - or at least thats what they think. The weed they took belonged to a deadly gang lead by a crazy junkie who's lunacy is told in brilliant cockney-rhyming slang flashback that is subtitled. This leads to a right kerfuffle as everyone is killing each other - literally! a great film 10 out of 10."

Eventually when it aired i sat there moodily watching, after 2 minutes my moody face was no more and i had the biggest grin on my face. Laugh after laugh after laugh, Tom (Tom Flemyng) gets the best lines but each character has the ability to make you laugh while still being credible.<br/><br/>The only thing that is stopping me from giving it a ten is that there is a few pointless scenes. The ones that feature Vinnie Jones."
"philip_vanderveken","8","0","1","5 August 2005"," Ladies and gentlemen, we have a winner...
","Guy Ritchie may not be the most productive writer and director, but he certainly is a famous man. That has probably a lot to do with the woman he once married (Madonna if you didn't know it yet), but the amateurs of great comedies and crime movies know him for some other reason too. With the TV series ""Lock Stock and ..."" and movies like ""Snatch"", and this ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"", he has done some excellent work.<br/><br/>While four friends find themselves in deep trouble after a crooked card game (if they don't want to lose some of their fingers, they have an enormous debt to pay in a week time to the local gang-land boss and porn king Harry 'The Hatchet' Lonsdale), they overhear their neighbors in the next flat plotting to hold up a group of pot growers. They decide that they will steal the money from their neighbors after the hold-up. In the meantime the same Harry Lonsdale has found a pair of antique shotguns that he would like to own, but for which he doesn't want to pay of course. He has it arranged that they are stolen from the retired owner, but the two not exactly brilliant thieves make a mess of the job and sell the guns to Nic the Greek, a small-time hustler. Because our four friends will need some weapons, they ask Nic the Greek to sell them something. All he can give them are two old shotguns...<br/><br/>Even though most of the actors aren't exactly very well known, they all did a wonderful job together. But if I have to chose one of the 'unknown' actors as the best, than I would probably say Vinnie Jones. Since his career as a professional soccer player, he not only has the reputation of being a tough guy, he's also excellent in playing this kind of roles in the movies. It doesn't happen very often that someone who has never had a good schooling as an actor is still able to act very well in a role that is larger than the average cameo, but Vinnie Jones proves that it is possible.<br/><br/>But the acting isn't the only good thing about this movie. The story is very nice of course, but it also has been shot and edited in an excellent way (it never clearly shows the most gruesome violence, but only gives a hint of it). It all looks very modern and classic at the same time, making this movie an interesting instant classic. And when you add to this nice concept some fine humor and some excellent music, than you know that you have a winner. I had a great time while watching this movie and was constantly laughing with it. I give this movie an 8.5/10. In my opinion this is one of the best comedies of the nineties."
"LarsKrebs","10","0","1","25 July 2005"," Lock, Stock and 105 Hilarious Minutes...
","""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" was probably the last movie in Blockbuster I had not seen when I rented it several years ago. The summary on the back of the VHS-cassette didn't seem appealing at all. A British gangster comedy? Yeah right. But man was I surprised. <br/><br/>The movie starts of by introducing the very charismatic characters involved. The good guys are the four semi-criminals Tom (Jason Flemyng), Soap (Dexter Fletcher), Eddie (Nick Moran) and Bacon (Jason Statham). Within fifteen minutes of the movie, these guys loose half a million pounds to the local porn king and hardcore cold blooded gangster, ""Hatchet"" Harry Lonsdale, in a game of cards. Our friends are given one week to come up with the cash before Harry passes the case to his inpatient and extremely unpleasant gorilla known as Barry the Baptist. Fortunatley for the boys, Eddie overhears his full time criminal neighbors planning a ""job"" that involves serious amounts of hard currency and a large pile of class A weed. With a few preparations the goods can easily be intercepted and more than cover their dept to ""Hatchet"" Harry. The scene is set. <br/><br/>Long story short, the boys intercept the prey but afterward find themselves in the middle of a complicated plot that involves two very valuable antique shotguns, a big load of cash and humorous and charismatic characters as the back alley businessman Nick the Greek, the black suited afro midget Rory Breaker, the tough employee of Harry Lonsdale, Big Chris, and his beloved son Little Chris.<br/><br/>This is probably the most entertaining movie I ever saw. Every line is a stitch, all characters are balanced and perfectly casted and the way our four main characters pretends to be what they are not, bad ass criminals, is so hilarious that nothing compares. I especially recall a small, but fun, scene where Eddie has trouble opening a locked door with a crowbar. I can watch this movie over and over again and laugh of the same lines, the same scenes and the same pitch black humor of this magnificent British blend of comedy, action and colorful language every time I see it. As if this wasn't enough, the movie also has a fantastic soundtrack. <br/><br/>If ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" doesn't deserve a 10/10, no movie does. I realize that this is no great epic with big stars, fantastic sets and huge budgets, but it is still an excellent movie that does so much more than anyone could expect from it. Nothing less. And what an ending scene. <br/><br/>So, in short, definitely a 10/10. Watch it."

Because, in my opinion, it is the best movie ever created.<br/><br/>The most important thing for a film is story. And most of the good stories are based around the characters. And Lock, Stock has got some of the best characters around. Barry the Baptist, Ed, Soap, Tommy, Bacon, The Ganja Guys, Rory Breaker, Big Chris & Little Chris, Hatchet Harry, the list goes on and on. And each and every one of them get's their moment to shine.<br/><br/>The second most important thing is how you tell the story. In some cases, it is actually more important than the actual story. A person who had actually heard the famous fairy teller H.C. Andersen said that he was popular for his way of telling a his stories. And if anyone can tell a good story it is Guy Ritchie. The way you get the story in Lock, Stock is really, really sweet. <br/><br/>Sure, Guy has obviously been inspired by Quentin Tarantino, but he is not the only one. Lock, Stock contains the essence of good film-making from the last centuary and, for example, the movie has also got a lot of references to the works of Sergio Leone.<br/><br/>So to me this movie is perfect. The actors, script, characters, dialouge etc. Every single piece. There is a reason this is my favorite movie of all time.<br/><br/>Well, I can't talk any more know.

","This movie done by Guy Ritchie (known for marrying Madonna) is a very well put together movie. It is the Pulp Fiction equivalent for the United Kingdom. The movie gains credibility with a simple card game totaling a very large debt for four young lads, who have to pay it off in one week. The movie is awesome filming multiple stories that all culminate and crossover for the climax of the film. LS and 2SB is full of cockney slang you will never comprehend but add to the allure of the British caper gone horribly wrong. The selected actors are fantastic and I understand why Guy Ritchie would hire them again and again. Guy Ritchie is an excellent writer/director and will hopefully continue as time goes on."

","Lock, stock and two smoking barrels... It's a movie i liked, and a movie you should see without being told what it's about. You have to be relaxed about it, don't expect anything, and just watch it for fun. If you have any intentions of watching it, you should do so without reading anymore comments on it, or anymore of this one.<br/><br/>This movie is brilliantly written and even more brilliantly produced. It's one of those reality-like movies, that i usually hate, because they are too plane. But we're dealing with a good movie here, camera effects and especially music are well handled. The best combination is when Ed loses his money and more at the card table. The whole scene is one of the best you'll ever see. A lot of the movie lies in the fact that it's all plausible, and close to reality. If you watch out for the little details, you can rest assured that they're handled. There's also scene after scene, making it a movie you can watch several times. Most movies are just idiotic in laying out long, boring scenes, almost like a fill-up. The plot of course is something everyone will praise, there are 6 plains of action development at one point, which keep naturally colliding. Humour is good, it's the best, it's not embarrassing like it usually is with ""comedies"". It's the kind of humor resulting from real life interactions. For all the people out there sick of movies, this is a movie for you. See it once, and i guarantee, you'll see it again."

","Have no idea how I would summarise this film, but all I can say it is definitely a must see film, for people who want to watch something with a mixture of ""violence"" / comedy / action. Guy Ritchie, produces a film with allot of class, and perfect timing in, and then with his follow up film Snatch he proves that his talents in producing / directing is no fluke. A very talented man, for films for my generation (20 - 24)<br/><br/>The cast for this film were perfect, everyone picked was made for their role respectively, however to me Vinny Jones proved he could make it on the big screen, and showed a versatile performance. Very impressed, (for an ex-Wimbledon player).<br/><br/>It's nice to finally see a British based film doing well, and also make it to the status of being called a ""classic""."

","""Lock, Stock..."" falls into a category of movies that I particularly loathe - the movies that are cool for the sake of being cool. There is no other attraction here: the plot is garbled, the characters clichéd, the dialog barely comprehensible. We must like this movie, though, because it's just so dang *cool.*<br/><br/>Or we could watch something good, right? I mean, honestly, what is the appeal of this story? A bunch of low-level gangster losers get into debt, and totally unrealistic criminal hijinks ensue. The plot twists are too numerous and too silly, as are the characters - I dare you to even keep track of which stupid thugs are in which bozo gang. <br/><br/>That is not to say that I hated the movie - I still have the cheap DVD in my collection - but I certainly wasn't impressed. This kind of movie - violent, foul-mouthed, pointless - really defines the 1990s as a decade in cinema terms, and a very bleak decade it was. Virtually any realistic, well-acted crime movie of the 1970s is really far superior to this kind of...what would you call it, exactly? Teenie-gangster fare?"

I gave it a 10.<br/><br/>I'm an American, but I have visited London and the East End several times, so the accents were a little difficult, but not enough to be a problem.<br/><br/>******** Spoilers below! if you haven't seen this film yet *********<br/><br/>Having already spouted glowing comments about this film, let me say that I have only one minor issue with it... several times I noted things that I thought were mistakes, but were not. Many have mentioned them here before, but I'll repeat a few. (note: these are obviously not an issue imho)<br/><br/>Q1: Right after Eddie loses the Three Card Brag game with Harry, Barry the Baptist grabs Eddie outside and tells him he expects the money in a week from Eddie and his friends. The problem is... it couldn't have been but a few minutes later, and Barry wasn't at the game, so how did he know so fast that Eddie had lost unless he was secretly watching them play?<br/><br/>A1: Well, Eddie must have figured that since they all had cell phones Harry must have called Barry at some time since he lost the game. Probably when we didn't see Harry (he was off camera) for a few minutes immediately after Eddie lost (he zombied around a while with cool camera angles and music).<br/><br/>Q2: How did Barry know Harry's hand was better than Eddie's (Barry said, ""We'll take you to the cleaners."")?<br/><br/>A2: Barry couldn't see Harry's cards (the cheating mechanism only worked one way -- to tell Harry), but it's probably not too hard to believe that Eddie's hand was so bad for 3 Card Brag that Barry instinctively knew that Harry would do better.<br/><br/>Q3: Why did Big Chris take the money from Dog? <br/><br/>A3: As already mentioned here, Big Chris had never seen the guys and had just happened upon Dog as he was coming from the place that was the guys' address. This is also proved because he tells Hatchet Harry, ""One of the boys had'em."" When Harry asked him about the shotguns.<br/><br/>Q4: How did Big Chris know Dog's name when he was slamming the door on Dog's head? (Big Chris was screaming and yelling, ""Never, never, never, has anyone been as rude to me as you, Dog! F@!%king, bastard!"" <br/><br/>A4: Big Chris could have learned Dog's name on the short trip over to Harry's. We just don't know for sure, but it's possible.<br/><br/>Now here's my only issue with film, and it's rather minor and I'd be happy to read any dissenting views or different interpretations and opinions... everything the characters did were very believable and understandable because we'd do the same thing if we were in their shoes except for one...<br/><br/>Q4: Why did they party at the pub after ripping off their neighbors?<br/><br/>This has no answer because when I put myself in their shoes, especially Eddie's, I would not want a second to pass without first settling the debt with Harry. They had no idea if they would be robbed, or if Dog would find them, and so they (or Eddie) should have immediately marched over to Harry's and settled the debt. No partying. No delay. <br/><br/>Now, if someone says that they had to wait until Harry, Barry, or Chris came looking for them, I don't think that holds water because Eddie called Harry shortly after the money went missing.<br/><br/>Another few positive comments then, ""I'm off."" <g> I really liked the Gary and Dean characters (the Liverpool scousers) a lot and wish there could be an entire film with just them on their escapades. Hence the summary title, ""We've got to get those guns.""<br/><br/>Also, SNATCH was good, but I didn't like it as much as LOCK. Also, for years I've felt that QT was waaaay overrated. I saw all of his films and the guy uses violence for shock purposes and little else. When I saw PULP I thought it was no big deal. Contrived and unbelievable. With LOCK, even Vinnie Jones in his DVD interview said, that what was being portrayed could really happen.<br/><br/>Further, the intensity of the scene where Big Chris (presumably) kills Dog is so great that I think someone was asking for other examples of it. One that I can think of is in the movie ERIN BROCKOVICH where the husband of the character (I think the name is Donna Jensen, but not sure) learns of his wife's breast cancer and is extremely upset outside facing the factory. BRAVEHEART had a few too as I recall and the opening of CARLITO'S WAY was quite well done."

"FilmOtaku","8","0","1","24 August 2004"," Great story, Great film
","For `Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels', you can pretty much just refer to my review of Guy Ritchie's `other' great film, `Snatch', because everything that I love about `Snatch' can be supplanted with my feelings for `Lock, Stock'.  Less flashy than `Snatch', but with a brilliant script, `Lock, Stock' is a fantastic film.<br/><br/>In `Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels', we encounter four London guys, three of whom are operating on a plane slightly on the wrong side of the law.  Tom, (Jason Flemyng) operates as a small-time fence, Bacon (Jason Statham) is a small-time street con and Eddie (Nick Moran) is Bacon's some time partner in crime, whose specialty is cards.  The fourth member of their circle, Soap, (Dexter Fletcher) is the one member of their group who, as a chef, tries to keep his nose clean at all times.  When the four of them get bored with barely surviving the lives they have mapped out for themselves, they each take their savings and give it to Eddie so that he can play in a high stakes poker game which he is almost certain to win.  This would all run smoothly if the guy who runs the game didn't cheat and therefore clean them out as well as an additional large sum of money, given to them on loan. The foursome then find themselves needing to come up with the money within a week or their lives are at stake, so they have to come up with a way to get the money fast.<br/><br/>As with `Snatch', `Lock, Stock' has a large cast of colorful characters who intertwine with one another to make up one hell of a wild ride.  If two characters don't actually meet face to face, it is certain that they at least have a couple of people involved that they each know, which turns the plot into a kind of `Six Degrees of Anyone in the Film'.  What `Lock, Stock' doesn't have that `Snatch' has is star power (Brad Pitt, Benicio Del Toro) and presumably, the same budget, but the great thing is that it doesn't need either.  The acting by (at the time) relative unknowns to the general American audience is just great, and while there are some really great action scenes and some fun camera angles, the spectacle that accompanies `Snatch' is not as prevalent in `Lock, Stock.'  Still, the film is just as good  so does that make it a better film?  Definitely not; and choosing which Guy Ritchie film, for me at least, is like a mother choosing which child is her favorite.  (Yes, I'm that much of a film geek)  But `Lock, Stock' is an excellent, character and plot-driven film that deserves all of the accolades it has received, and then some.<br/><br/>--Shelly"

The filming techniques and the music help to round off the multiple story lines. <br/><br/>The actors are great and I would not like to meet any of the bad guys in a dark alley. I was not aware of many of them (Sting, Moriarty and Jones withstanding).Although Vinnie Jones played his part well in the movie I did not think that he was the pick of the bunch. P.H.

","well if you this particular genre of humor then pick up your straws and suck it up.This guy,Guy Ritchie, is a genius he portrayed each and every character in the weirdest and funniest way. Tom,soap,Eddie and Bacon thinks of makin a fortune in a card game and end up owing 500 grands to a local goon leader and porn king ,Harry.they have 1 week to come up with the money so they decide to rob a local gang who in turn were planning to rob some Ganja growers.The story gets more complicated when a pair of double-barrelled shotguns gets missing and then its all with lots of guns fighting axe n more n more but its done in style and fun. While watching the movie you can't help it but you will start comparing Ritchie with tarantino. Ritchie's movies are definitely less violent then that of Tarantino's but they both give masterpieces and they do it in style and that is one thing which is so unique.. Another very big plus point of the movie is its groovy music .It goes perfectly along with the whole feel of the movie. i liked the way charcters were introduced thats what important each n every character was so clearly explained that you become an omnicient viewer and with all the humor the movie becomes a masterpiece overall the movie is amazingly brilliant..."

","The very first film directed by Mr. Guy Ritchie, and it doesn't disappoint. The use of an ensemble cast is very effective as all the characters are distinct and colourful.<br/><br/>The basic plot, involving a rigged card game and a pair of antique muskets is very interesting and it's nice to see how everyone gets mixed up in it. The performances in the picture are very good.  The main group (Moran, Flemyng, Fletcher and Statham) are very good, particularly Fletcher as the creepy Soap.  Frank Harper is very menacing as the aptly-named heavy Dog, Moriarty and McLean are on good form as our two main bad guys, Vas Blackwood is great as the afro-sporting crime boss Rory Breaker (aptly described by everyone as a f***ing lunatic) and Vinnie Jones, in his acting debut is very good as well.<br/><br/>Providing humour are Jake Abraham and Victor McGuire as a pair of inept scouse thieves.  These guys are very funny.  I just wish that more could have been done with them.  There's also a nice cameo from RED DWARF's Danny John-Jules as a rhyming-slang spouting barfly.<br/><br/>All in all, LOCK STOCK is a very fine film, brilliantly shot and edited and with a fine music score.

But strong appreciation must be given towards Two Smoking Barrels since without it, Snatch may have never come along.<br/><br/>The movie had a very unique look to it.  I am not sure what the technique is called, but the film looked bleached and very grainy at times.  It was a nice effect to describe to viewers the underworld setting of London, England.

"alig2003","10","0","1","14 April 2003"," Basic Outline of the film and my opinion
","Guy Ritchie's ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" is one of the most well crafted crime/comedy/action films I have ever seen. The use of the narrator enables all characters within the film to be properly introduced. This includes the main four characters, Tom (Jason Flemyng), Bacon (Jason Statham), Soap (Dexter Fletcher) and Eddie (Nick Moran) to the supporting characters such as Big Chris (Vinnie Jones) and Barry the Baptist (Lenny ""The Guv'nor"" McLean). What makes Lock, Stock such a great film is the way Ritchie weaves his characters and the plot so that they all cross paths in the end. Eddie enters a card game against Hatchet Harry on behalf of himself, Tom, Bacon and Soap and ends up owing half a million pounds. While at the same time Dog, with Plank and crew rob the weed growers Winston, Willy and Charles. As it happens Dog and his crew live next to Eddie and Bacon. Eddie overhears them and decides to rob them in order to pay off his debt to Harry. Also included are Harry's debt collector Big Chris (Vinnie Jones) and Harry's bodyguard Barry the Baptist , Criminal head honcho Rory Breaker (Vas Blackwood), stolen goods dealer Nick the Greek and Eddie's Dad Jd (Sting). Through sheer luck and at times utter stupidity, all those included get their paths well and truly crossed which makes for an excellent final scene."

","For the umpteenth time the catch that I brought home from a trip to the video store made me appreciate just how good 'Pulp Fiction' really is. Granted, this is one of the better copycats but at the end of the day it is only that - a pretender. <br/><br/>The plot of Tarantino's masterpiece flowed seamlessly. It fit perfectly for every character to be there. Here, the reason for half of the cast's presence in the movie is so that such and such can happen at the end without violating the rules of logic. It really looks like Guy Ritchie figured out the ending first and then started filling in different holes. Similar to a cheap joke where it's obvious that punchline came first and then by working backwards - the unnatural setup was arrived at. Every time plot hits a hurdle another witty gangster pops up to take care of it until there's no one left standing but the four original guys.<br/><br/>Additionally and more importantly in the overall context of this film, QT's characters possessed inherent style and charm whereas Guy tries way too hard to give his lads another dimension by having them spew lines that smack of forced wit. Because of that 'Lock, StockÂ….' at times feels like a TV sitcom (okay, a cable TV sitcom) and that can't be good. For a movie that's, before anything else, an exercise in style it finds its main ingredient in surprisingly short supply.<br/><br/>In the end, I don't really know if Mr. Madonna was out-and-out trying to copy 'Pulp Fiction' or not, but what I do know is that he made a similar movie that pales in comparison. Maybe I'm being unfair to poor old Guy but 'Pulp' set the bar really high. Cockney accent can carry a film only up to a certain point."

","Lock Stock is an absolute ripper of a movie (one of my all time favourites), although not one for all tastes, as much of the humour comes from the overplayed cartoon violence and general mayhem. The movie starts with a bang and doesn't let up till the credits, with a number of plots weaving and dodging at a hundred miles an hour and finally resolving in a metaphoric firey collision at the end. The movie has a gritty realism derived from the consistent visuals, and pumping sound track. If you liked Pulp Fiction (and maybe even if you didn't), you'll love this."

","This is cringingly awful. First of all, Ritchie is blatantly aping Scorsese, and he does so to such an extent that this whole mess of a film could actually pass for a parody on Goodfellas or Meanstreets. Every unique feature of those two films Ritchie swipes and clumsily grafts here. From Goodfellas' introductory ""meet the fellas"" pan shots to the unique shot of Harvey Keitel's character getting intoxicated and collapsing on the clubroom floor in Meanstreets. Scorsese is so classic and these things are so uniquely his, one would have thought only a high-school film student would actually attempt to copy them. But to copy ALL of them, and then to attempt to graft them into a film of the same genre, well that's plain criminal.<br/><br/>
As well as Scorsese, Ritchie also apes Tarantino. Littered across this entire film are unmistakably Tarantino traits such as those witty, slick, fast-talking dialogues and subtle black comedy interludes. Again, to take such uniquely Tarantino features and to do so with such candour is nothing short of criminal.<br/><br/>Carbon copying aside, this film was horrendously flawed from the outset. Yes, Italian American gangsters are hilarious, entertaining, and thoroughly interesting, but no, East End small fries are not; these people are only amusing to themselves, but to the rest of us, they are dull, uninteresting, and remarkably un-charismatic. Yes, films such as the Long Good Friday have captured East End gangsters well, but the mistake they never made was to attempt to characterize them as trendy comedians.<br/><br/>In all, no amount of saturated lens filtering and trendy music video cut aways can hide the fact that this is a cringe-inducing atrocity of a film. My advice, if you want Scorsese or Tarantino, watch their own films, otherwise, stay clear of embarrassing attempts at aping the two such as this."

Against seemingly impossible odds, dogged by the ignorant film companies, Ritchie succeed in making a masterpiece. There are simply too many good points to comment on about this film, but the rhythm of it is ingenius in it's own way. The film may have been partialy inspired by that of the late Pulp Fiction, but uses a far more complex storytelling moethod, with more characters, more slapstick, and sarcasim. The main theme in genereal of the film is ""sarcasim"" i.e. it's not funny to laugh at someone being shot, but now after seeing this it is. The film is ideal for all British, and European audiences, but for viewrs in America may be unsuitable, as it's difficult for someone who speaks with a strong American accent to follow regional English accents such as Scouse, Cornish, and Cockeny, which are frequently or partially recurrent throughout the film. The thing I thought most highly of this film was the way in which the sharp editing techniques and special FX blended in nicely with the background music & songs, portraying an almost real depiction of what it's like to be either devastated or horizontally-drunk beyond visualisation. Also teh way in which it's filmed. A highly-expensive rocket-fuel-iggnition lensed camera was used to achieve the glossy golden look that is underground London--go on my son'' Watch this then be spun, then watch it over to see stuff you missed.

","At first glance, one might think that Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels - the debut film from the man later to be known as Mr. Madonna, Guy Ritchie - is little more than another in a long line of late-nineties Tarantino ripoffs.  And again, at first glance, you might be right.  There are the camera tricks, the hip sixties soundtrack filled out with James Brown soul classics, the slew of crimes gone wrong, and a collection of characters with goofy names like Hatchet Harry and Barry the Baptist.<br/><br/>But that's the first glance, and as the old adage goes, first impressions can be deceiving.  What Ritchie has done is craft a film out of familiar subjects (a failed gambling risk, a harried deadline to pay off a debt, and a desperate gambit involving guns, drugs, and cash), and weave together a stylish, entertaining film.<br/><br/>Overloaded with characters of dubious moralities, Lock Stock throws everything but the kitchen sink into the lives of four friends who have spent their lives skirting the edges of the law.  These four gather together $100,000 for Eddie, the card shark, to enter a high-stakes poker game.  Of course, the game is rigged, and he ends up owing half-a-million quid to Hatchet Harry - a man you pay, or face the consequences.  Lo and behold, an opportunity arises - the lads' neighbors are drug fences who knock over a marijuana dealer for cash and weed, and this could well answer all their prayers.  Of course, nothing quite works out the way anyone could expect.<br/><br/>Due to everyone having thick British accents and making full use of the unique styles of Cockney slang (explained in a glossary on the DVD as a special feature), Lock Stock can sometimes be a difficult movie to follow, though once you get used to it, there are some gems of dialogue rolling through all the action.  Think Trainspotting with less drugs and more violence.<br/><br/>The cast (mostly unknowns at the time), does a fine job of settling into the theme of the film - near-cartoonish posturing and constant games of king of the mountain populate almost every scene.  Sting pops up as Eddie's none-too-enchanted father, who redefines tough love, and soccer star Vinnie Jones is an effectively erudite brute as Big Chris, the 'collection agent' for Harry.  His departing line, 'It's been emotional,' is a classic.<br/><br/>It's not original, not by any real stretch, and not terribly groundbreaking other than some of the unusual camera tricks Ritchie pulls off (my personal favorites being the poker scene and the 'get drunk after the big score' scene) - which are very much like music videos in style.  That said, there's nothing that keeps it from being a rollicking good time of a movie, something that's well worth watching again.  If only to figure out what those geezers are saying."

","When I saw this movie, i could see where Guy Ritchie got his inspiration. He must have been watching Pulp Fiction.

In Pulp Fiction, there is only Mia, Fabian and Honey Bunny as the female roles.   <br/><br/>2)Its common use of the swear word f**k. It was used so much, that is could be out of fashion. Just like a typical Tarantino movie.<br/><br/>
3) It is about lowlifes and criminals. It is like his usual films, such as Vincent Vega and Jules Winnefeld<br/><br/>4) The script is full of wit and black humour. Cheeseburger scene from Pulp Fiction is a good example. <br/><br/>5) Finally both stories are complex and hard to explain, but it is easily intertwined to at the end. <br/><br/>The story is about four blokes who are sometimes slighty on the wrong side of the law. They chip in 25,000 pounds each, for an illegal game of poker. Ed, the card shark from the gang, believes that he will easily win the game. However, what he does not realise is that the card game is rigged. Once he loses the card game, he is threatened to get the money for at least a week, or him and his gangs will face dire consequences. This is the start of a very funny and great movie about the British Underworld of gangsters. Jason Statham, Nick Moran, Dexter Fletcher and Jason Flemying is great as the four unlucky rogues. Everyone keeps on going about the hard nut Vinnie Jones, but the limelight should be given to Vaz Blackwood. He plays Rory Breaker, and he was funny and amazing.

I am a big fan of British comedy in the vein of The Full Monty, Trainspotting, Monty Python, etc.  If anyone would like to recommend films they have enjoyed in this genre I would be be very appreciative."

","This film is really entertaing, not really a family film for obvious reasons! but it does make a good night in with your mates its brilliant for a couple of laughs and Guy Ritchie made no mistake in the casting with Vinnie Jones and Nick Moran topping the cast who could argue!"
"chrisow","10","0","1","6 July 2001"," EXCELLENT
","A simple premise(four mates in debt to gangster)spins out hillarious intertwining stories that all eventually come together in a way that reminds you of Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, Go and, the most recent Guy Ritchie film, Snatch.<br/><br/>
Watch this for the influences it has had on The Matrix and other British gangster films"
"joshuai2","7","0","1","1 July 2001"," One movie that shows how creative Directors can be.
","The movie was awesome.  The movie had everything from comedy to drama to action.  LSTSB had so many twists and turns.  Every other scene turned the movies plot around.  lot's of twists and turns in this movie.  For a real movie fan and for a everyday Joe this would be a good movie to see.7/10. Only the best from your movie guy.  What i recommend don't turn off till the very end"
"blot1","7","0","1","7 May 2001"," Funnier and More Likeable Than Tarantino
","For at least the first half hour, it seems like each scene introduces about ten new characters, many of whom are very similar looking and acting. But after that it really did grow on me. The soundtrack helps immensely. And once I figured out all the scams and which character was which, I got into the spirit of it and it had me laughing and shaking my head the rest of the way.<br/><br/>Pulp Fiction may be less raw and have more LA-style glamour and rat-a-tat action, but it takes itself way too seriously. If there is any discernable ""message"" in this wacky ""loveable loser"" style caper it is that criminals are stupid and mean. Tarantino always seems smitten by his criminals, therefore his movies always seem to be trying hard to make us like or understand them. In my opinion, this usually backfires. In the Ritchie movie, there is no reverence for these underworld characters. His mean characters are really nasty bullies so instinctively you do root for and even like the bumbling heroes - at least, you hope they don't get shot down. And the curiously gentle thug with the kid was a very nice touch.<br/><br/>Overall, it's worth wading through the rather clumsy and confusing beginning to get to the fun."

"Lokii","10","0","1","1 March 2001"," Amazing movie
","I saw this movie when it first came out in North America over a year ago, and instantly loved it. After years and years of Hollywood, this movie was so refreshing and creative, not to mention hilarious. Lock, Stock is probably one of my favorites of all time, not because it's one of those ""great movies"", but because it's just so entertaining to watch. Guy Ritchie is a wicked director, he has style and flash without using lots of money or special effects. I've heard some people argue that Lock, Stock is similar to Pulp Fiction, and Ritchie to Tarantino. I don't really agree with this. Pulp Fiction was an interesting and important movie for Hollywood, but not one I would watch more than once or twice. It wasn't even very funny. Lock, Stock on the other hand, is extremely entertaining and hilarious. Ritchie's style is cool and unique, even if he was inspired by Tarantino. Whatever the case, the world could use more great directors like this. I gave Lock, Stock a 10/10. Go see this movie if you haven't done so yet, you'll be glad you did."
"Figgiedan","8","0","1","3 January 2001"," Unrealistic fun
","Go into the movie not expecting much realism and you'll go away happy. Pretty good flick with good young actors and a lot of interesting shots. A large ensemble of characters, some better than others, some more interesting and believable than others (Big Chris was my favorite character). Sting is in it for all of 3 minutes in case you are wondering and he doesn't do a damn thing other than sell pints and whack his son once in the face. All in all, good flick but don't expect gritty realism, it's just a movie. 8 out of 10. B-."
"Andy - Cardiff","7","0","1","2 January 2001"," An entertaining, amusing and forgettable film
","An enjoyable, entertaining and highly stylised romp through London gang violence by Guy Ritchie. The film is brilliantly edited, however the use of third person narration and sequential edits is derivative of 'Trainspotting' (which is a much better film). The lighting is effectively sparse and effectively conveys the drabness and tawdriness of the characters and subject matter.<br/><br/>After watching this film I do not feel particularly bothered about ever seeing it again. It is certainly an overrated film and comes nowhere near classic British crime films like 'Get Carter' and 'The Long Good Friday'. The high ratings given to this film is because of it's current trendiness rather than it's overall cinematic quality. In Britain, the TV spin-off, not directed by Ritchie, 'Lock Stock..' was absolutely atrocious and was quite rightly panned by critics. Some of the other user comments saying that this film is better than American crime movies is palpable rubbish, this cannot compete with 'Goodfellas', 'The Godfather', 'The Sopranos', 'Reservoir Dogs' etc.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this is a good little film but not a great one and time will be the judge of that."

"lardlad","10","0","1","3 December 2000"," funny sharp and one of the best films ever
","Guy Ritchie has crafted a superbly sublime motion picture which leaves any Pulp Fiction clone (or Pulp Fiction for that matter) for dead.  Lock Stock has great performances from the leads and a colorful supporting lot.  But the real star is Ritchie who keeps the viewer interested and pumps up the action and laughs along the way, a great script goes a very long way!"
"Mickey Knox","8","0","1","12 November 2000"," a new great director
","Guy Ritchie's debut in the movie world is a total success. The movie is great and thrilling from the beginning til the end, and the ending is awesome and unexpected. But. There's always a but. All movie long, you have a strong feeling of deja-vu. And that's normal, because Ritchie obviously inspired himself from Tarantino's movies and also from Trainspotting. If this movie would've been released 7-8 years ago, it would have been the first of its kind. Like this it's not, so my vote: 8 out of 10."
"imran-12","10","0","1","3 October 2000"," watch this movie!
","I can quite honestly say that there are few films I've enjoyed more than this one.  Although it is Guy Ritchie's directorial debut, he shames people who have been in the industry for years.  Slick, innovative cinematography complements a taut, well-paced script which is laced with some of the strangest dialogue I've heard. Life must not be complete, cannot be complete wthout having seen this movie at least once. Personally, I'm just sitting down to view it for the 12th time."
"CharltonBoy","10","0","1","8 December 1999"," One of the best films ever made
","This film is a true compliment to British film making. Lock stock is a masterpiece , the British "" Goodfellas"" if you like. The story is superb as well as the characters and the acting and it is filmed magnificently. Take a look at the scene in whick Nick realises that he has lost the Card game, Film making at its best.Not all the people in the film are actors Vinny Jones is a Pro Footballer and Lenny Mclean a real life bare Knuckle boxer ( now sadly dead)but they carry of their part like they have been acting for years. I can't wait to see the Follow up "" Diamonds"" which is being made in London as i write this.  10 out of 10"
"lance-20","7","0","1","20 November 1999"," Once again the Yanks here show their insularity
","I think this film has great moments and is genuinely funny (though not laugh a minute) and entertaining.  As for believability, probably not so convincing but so what?  How convincing is tosh like Independence Day? What I find annoying is the usual US comments here which display incredible ignorance.  Complaints about accent, language, and most telling of all inability to follow the story (speaks volumes about their ability to follow anything but the most simple of Hollywood rubbish).  For God's sake look at the film in its own right and don't judge it by how close it comes to a Tarantino.  It's got nothing to do with Tarantino - it's a London film exploring London themes not a Resevoir Dogs wannabe.<br/><br/>And as for one US comment about Brit directors should watch less MTV - do me a favour mate, Brit directors are class, the whole world knows it (including Hollywood who regularly pay homage to the UK when not jinxed by a bout of jingoism at the Oscars).  They don't need kitsch like MTV for inspiration but they would prefer a more discerning audience - in the US it appears that remains wishful thinking."
"TxMike","Null","0","1","17 September 1999"," If you like off-the-wall British movies, you'll love this one.
","The DVD version is very well done, sharp video transfer and good soundtrack, but you need a system with a subwoofer to get the full benefit from ""mood"" music.<br/><br/>This is *not* a movie for those looking for a nice story and a message.  The characters are all crooks.  They beat and shoot each other. They plot to steal each others' money and guns. They use drugs.  They have no morals. My wife walked out half-way, but she doesn't usually like British movies. <br/><br/>
However, if you can get past all that, there is lots of funny stuff in this movie.  You find out from the extra DVD information that some of the crooks really are crooks with some acting experience, and it comes across that way.<br/><br/>Imagine Trainspotting  meets Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction and you'll have the gist of this flick.  I give it a 6 of 10.  But then, I thought The Waterboy was about the funniest movie ever!"
"NJMoon","7","0","1","6 September 1999"," Thames Reservoir Dogs
","For Americans, screening LS&2SB is like imagining what Fagin's gang would be up to if OLIVER TWIST took place in London's East End today.  Or possibly peaking inside the roughneck neighborhood of Alfred P. Doolittle nearly a hundred years post PYGMALION.  <br/><br/>Billed as a comedy of sorts, LS&2SB never really gets the hearty laughs it needs.  The film's plot has more ironic twists and turns than a ring road from London to Stratford including a funny final freeze frame that is neatly typical of the rest of this ""Kraysie"" flick.<br/><br/>Following four cockney lads who get into serious debt after a rigged card game, the film's antic camera work (worthy of TRAINSPOTTING) and a great soundtrack (almost worthy of THE COMMITMENTS) can't belie the fact that our four heros somehow get lost in the proverbial shuffle.  With heaps of other shady characters to sort through, the viewer is left waiting (not too long) for the next plot point.  <br/><br/>Rock icon Sting turns in a nicely understated performance as JD, bar-owning Dad to the lad unlucky in cards.  As this is tough turf, the butch film features only two ""birds"" to speak of, both more plot device than person. If all the above's your bag of cash, give this one a ""butchers.""<br/><br/>By the way, if you didn't understand that last sentence, better see LS&2SB on DVD, where a cockney rhyming slang dictionary is one of the extras.  If you're like most Yanks, you'll want to keep the subtitles on, too.  Them blokes don't 'alf talk funny, don't they?"
"Freak-10","7","0","1","16 June 1999"," Sure it's a Tarantino ripoff, but who cares?
","People complaining about this movie being a ""Pulp Fiction"" or ""True Romance"" knock-off need to get a life.  Maybe once every ten years a truly original movie is presented to the public and Hollywood spends the next decade serving up copies of it. The most we can hope for in most cases is that a movie, if not completely original, is at least done well, and I thought this movie was done pretty damn well. It cracked me up and I was digging the plot twists for the same reason I dig Tarantino flicks. So what if the style and story remind you of a couple of other movies, or if, in a couple of cases, you can see what's coming in the next scene?  There were plenty of scenes where you didn't see what was coming next, the film had style, and the ending was great. 7 out of 10, and I only dock it a few points because it is a little derivative. See it and enjoy it."
