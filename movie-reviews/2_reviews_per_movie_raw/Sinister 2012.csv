","This is about as scary as I want to movie to be. I genuinely jumped a few times watching this and once or twice muted the sound. Which makes me laugh writing it, but trust me, there are scenes in this film that challenge the old ticker. A cardboard box in the hallway comes to mind. Those who've seen the film will know what I mean. I particularly liked the use of the found footage in this movie. It was very well integrated into the overall film and extremely disturbing. There is definite potential to make a sequel to this, as the story is set up to have a new chapter. I'd watch it during the day next time. Highly recommended for jump-scare horror fans."

","In this day and age, horror is getting more and more creative by demand since the psycho killer in the woods-scenario has pretty much run its course. A consequence of that is the incorporation of contemporary technology and concepts appearing in the genre; ""found footage"" films have replaced Jason and Michael, and while these films do have potential (this year's indie ""V/H/S"" had some neat ideas), even they are beginning to lose steam. Enter ""Sinister"", which is an amalgam of timeless supernatural horror themes and ""found footage"" technique that has proved to be a consistent box office draw.<br/><br/>""Sinister"" follows a true crime author, Ellison (Ethan Hawke) who moves his family (unbeknownst to them) into a house where an entire family was hung to death in a tree in their backyard, save the youngest daughter who vanished without a trace. Upon moving in, Ellison finds a box of 8mm footage and a projector in the attic; contained in these reels of film are various murders dating from the 1960s up to present day— one of them is the filming of the hanging murder that occurred in his backyard. As he furthers investigation into the footage, he finds more than he bargained for when connections are made to an ancient deity who takes the souls of children.<br/><br/>On a surface level, ""Sinister"" appears like every other horror piece on the market, but I was surprised by the substance the film had. Conceptually and thematically speaking, it's not painfully original, but director Scott Derrickson makes up for that with striking visuals and a daunting soundtrack. The opening of the film is particularly disturbing— the movie begins with the family hanging murder, which sets a damned unsettling tone for the rest of the film.<br/><br/>In terms of the supernatural elements at play in the script, they almost seem fairytale-ish (a Pagan deity who feeds on children— c'mon), but it does add a unique element to the film. I have to say though that the most frightening thing in this movie are the actual murder tapes themselves. It could be just me, but the notion of filmed murders unsettles me to the core, even if I know that the footage is faked; as if the act of murder itself isn't awful enough, documenting it is downright... well, sinister. The footage utilized in the film is unsettling, shocking, and above all, it's realistic, so the audience gets the same unpleasant feelings shared by Ethan Hawke's character. Truly macabre stuff.<br/><br/>Another major positive for this film is that the acting is far above par for what most genre fans are dealt. Ethan Hawke is a quality actor and newcomer Juliet Rylance proves her chops here; their scenes together are particularly strong, and much more than any horror fan could dream of asking for. The film's ending can be seen from a certain distance, although it doesn't necessarily make it less shocking in this case. If anything, it adds to the sense of dread pervading the film.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Sinister"" was a pleasant surprise for me. It doesn't offer heaps in terms of originality, but it's a stylistically stunning film and takes steps in the right in direction very gracefully. When it comes down to it, I can't say that I was even really ""scared"" by the film so much as I was unsettled by it. It has its share of orthodox jump scares, but I was more bothered and rattled by the grim nature of the film as a whole, which is a nice feeling to walk away from the theater with as a thick-skinned genre fan who has become increasingly harder to unnerve. 7/10."
"larry-411","9","291","423","10 October 2012"," The movie for jaded horror fans who think nothing can scare them
","Directed and scripted by Scott Derrickson (""The Exorcism of Emily Rose,"" 2008's ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"") from a C. Robert Cargill story, ""Sinister"" is an exquisite realization of an original paranormal theme. The movie debuted in this same town's SXSW Film Festival in March.<br/><br/>Ethan Hawke is Ellison Oswalt, a true crime author and devoted family man with a what-have-you-done-for-us-lately fan base and editor anxiously awaiting his next blockbuster. Wife Tracy (Juliet Rylance) and youngsters Ashley (Clare Foley) and Trevor (Michael Hall D'Addario) are tired of constantly moving from town to town as Oswalt is wont to plant temporary roots close to the subjects of his ripped-from-the-headlines novels. As the film opens, the Oswalts are moving into yet another new house, but Ellison swears this is the last time, and selectively informs his family of his intentions.<br/><br/>In the process of unpacking, Ellison discovers a box of the previous owner's old home movies in the attic. Thus begins the odyssey into the unknown. Let it be said at the outset that this is not ""just another found footage film."" In reversing the role of viewer and protagonist, to some extent, it's Hawke's character who discovers the reels while we see his story played out on screen. We don't spend two hours watching shaky 8MM footage. They are integral to the narrative but aren't the sum of its parts.<br/><br/>In his horror debut, Hawke turns in a striking tour-de-force performance that rivals anything I've seen recently (""Insidious'"" Patrick Wilson comes close). Rylance is delightful as the patient but exasperated wife who's barely willing to stand by her man for one more moment. Foley (Abby in ""Win Win"") and D'Addario (Josh in ""People Like Us"") are frighteningly authentic as the glue that holds this tight-knit family together. Fred Dalton Thompson (""Law & Order's"" D.A. Arthur Branch and former U.S. Senator) does a star turn as the stubborn sheriff who will have nothing to do with outsiders tarnishing his town's already-shaky reputation. Welcome comic relief comes from underrated character actor James Ransone (""Ken Park,"" ""Inside Man,"" HBO's ""The Wire"").<br/><br/>This is Ethan Hawke's first foray into this genre, a simple consequence of his passion for the material. ""He said he'd never do horror,"" paraphrasing the filmmakers in the Q&A following the screening here, but he fell in love with Derrickson's script. The casting of Juliet Rylance as his wife was also done at his suggestion. Their on screen chemistry is undeniable.<br/><br/>The technical team doesn't miss a beat. Top-notch visual effects are always key in a film like this, but the common flaw in this genre lies in overdoing it. CGI and post-production trickery can certainly advance the narrative where appropriate but ""Sinister's"" old school in-camera effects, done while shooting, enhance the believability of the action.<br/><br/>Cinematographer Chris Norr eschews hand-held for stationary tripod shots and Hitchcockian slow pans, with POV tracking shots that allow the audience to sense the protagonist's growing paranoia. The occasional subjective POV angle, where the character looks at the camera, effectively places the viewer into the scene.<br/><br/>Lighting in the Oswalt home, where most of the action takes place, is appropriately subdued and rife with interplays of light and shadow. Hawke is often seen in silhouette, masking dark corners hiding secrets, literally. Terrifying night scenes beg the question, ""Why are you going up into the attic?"" Christopher Young's original score blends perfectly with needle-drop songs from some of the filmmakers' favorite indie bands. In a typical production, where third party songs will be inserted, the actors work to a temp track -- music that plays in the background until the company can obtain licensing for the tunes they want for the finished product, usually unknown (although often hoped for) during filming, that are then added to the soundtrack in post-production. With ""Sinister,"" Derrickson and his team were able to purchase the rights prior to shooting so the cast members performed to a playback of the songs that would actually be used in the final cut. It does make a difference, especially when seasoned professionals like Hawke are ""acting"" in sync with the same music the audience hears in those scenes. It creates a symbiotic ambiance that links viewer to actor.<br/><br/>As a reviewer, I try to keep expectations out of my thoughts and writing. After all, it's only fair to the filmmakers (and me, and my readers) to judge a movie on its merits. Fortunately, it's not too much of a challenge to be as objective as possible when entering the theater, especially if it's a premiere and no other reviews are out there (and you haven't watched a trailer). But Fantastic Fest is a genre festival, after all, and one would not attend, theoretically, without being a fan of same. So expectations are placed on the film simply by virtue of the fact it's even being shown.<br/><br/>That's why I'm happy to report that ""Sinister"" was all I hoped it would be. Yes, this is why I attend Fantastic Fest and movies like this make it worth the trip. This is the flick for jaded horror fans who think nothing can scare them. This one does it. ""Sinister"" will give you nightmares."
"martinrobertson300482","10","67","91","2 November 2012"," Creepy as hell
","I was dying to see ""Sinister."" It looked like one off those great psychological horror films that isn't so much interested in blood and guts as it is freaking you out, and that's just what it is. Well, it is Halloween after all.<br/><br/>The Fact that Ethan Hawke was drawn to the movie was a good sign to begin with, as he is great in most things he is in, and there's no exception here. He plays a struggling writer who moves into the creepy new house off the film too write about the messed up events that happened there. Yes it could off been in danger off being your typical haunted house movie, but it really isn't. Hawke makes for an interesting main character and even the creepy house and creepy killer off the movie are expanded to be something way more.<br/><br/>""Sinister"" is bloody terrifying. So if your looking for one of those sorts off genuinely scary movies (which don't come along that often) look no further. Its creepy, will make you jump a mile high, and is genuinely disturbing (in a good way) with an ending that'll stick with you for days afterwards."
"cookiechip_07","8","226","334","13 September 2012"," Sinister- See It In Cinema
","DON'T WATCH THE TRAILER! or at least try not too. I went into this film only knowing the title and the fact i was waiting for a scary movie to actually be... yep scary. Well i was in luck, as Sinister is exactly that...quite Sinister! I say try to avoid the trailers if u can because quite a lot is shown, although having said that you will probably be so absorbed into the film that you'll forget about what you have seen and still be spooked, BOO! :) <br/><br/>All the actors do a good job, Ethan Hawke is solid, not quite sure about the chemistry between him and his wife but i guess its hardly relevant in this film. The directing and editing of the film is slick with interesting angles and shots. The imagery is great and so are your jumpy moments even if it does contain a few of the horror Clichés.<br/><br/>The plot is simple and follows true-crime writer Ellison (Ethan Hawke) as he discovers a box of home movies ""found footage"" of murders that put his family in danger. Some people may dislike the believability of the films central ethos for the evil protagonist; however i liked the original mythology created here, it adds something new to the table. Also If the film is successful (im guessing it might be) the Evil Character aka Bagoul will no doubt be a new item for Halloween stores! Although not a game changer in the genre, i would easily go and say this will be the scariest film of the year and if not, well thats just win-win for us all!! ((star ratings = 7 good, 8 represents very good. 9 superb 10 epic)"
"asda-man","9","171","254","14 October 2012"," It takes a lot to scare me... This did!
","Ever since the very first trailer came out I thought, ""now this looks good!"" However, some quite poor reviews came in so my dreams were shattered slightly. But then suddenly some rave reviews came out, even from my favourite critic, Chris Tookey who gave it 5 stars! My faith was suddenly re-installed and I was incredibly excited to see it. It didn't disappoint!<br/><br/>With ""The Cabin in the Woods"" and now ""Sinister"", 2012 is restoring my faith in modern horror. It's a truly outstanding film that had me gripped for its entire 115 minutes. The film doesn't dawdle about too much either, it opens with a highly unsettling clip of found footage and then we get a beautiful swooping shot of a man and his family moving in to a new house. It's a standard set-up that we've even seen a few months ago in the surprisingly fun horror, ""The Possession"" but it's a clever one because we're mostly focused on our hero and in a sense that is what the film is about. His obsession with himself and trying to be re-ignite his fame after writing a highly successful debut true crime novel, followed by several duds.<br/><br/>I was quite surprised as to how much exposition was given to the main character and it only makes the film even more compelling than it is. He's also played brilliantly by Ethan Hawke, who makes up for the lack of acting skills his wife possesses. It reminded me a little of ""The Shining"" with the egotistical novelist stumbling upon a certain ghostly history, and it certainly contains the same amount of creepy moments. Ethan stumbles upon the super 8 films quite quickly which I was surprised and pleased about, as all too often there's a belated exposition before anything remotely frightening happens.<br/><br/>These super 8 films are masterpieces in themselves. It's a sort of car crash effect, as you don't really want to see them, but you can't stop watching. They're all incredibly creepy, unsettling and sinister (like what I did there?) They are also set-up perfectly with the horrible grainy picture, silence as well as highly unsettling music that all adds to the creepiness. All of them are engaging and compelling to watch. They're also very chilling and are sure to engrave themselves into your mind for a long time after the film has finished.<br/><br/>From then on it's an intriguing and creepy mystery as more and more disturbing information is uncovered. It's also clever how it's unclear if some of what Ethan's seeing is actually real or not. Is he really hearing noises or is it just the whisky talking? I liked the whole family element as well, showing the protagonist as not just some perfect hero, but also as a flawed character. The whole strained relationship with his wife is a fantastic element on top of the central ghost story. Although the woman who plays her is incredibly wooden!<br/><br/>There's a strong, unsettling atmosphere that underlies through the whole film. The demon man is also quite frightening and not too much is explained about him which certainly adds to scare factor. I've heard people call this a boring film and a bad film, but it's none of these things. It's a genuinely horrifying horror film with fantastic writing and directing. It's the type of film that gets under your skin and leaves its print in your mind for a long time after the credits have rolled. The ending is one of the most disturbing things I've ever seen in a horror film and I've seen many!<br/><br/>""Sinister"" is a ghost story of Japanese proportions. By the end, I was actually terrified and had chills all down my back, which is something that doesn't happen too often. I never get scared watching films, but after this and seeing ""Noroi: The Curse"" which also frightened me, I was starting to think that I was becoming soft! But then I thought no. These are just brilliantly scary films that are high on atmosphere and don't solely rely on jump scares like too many American ghost films. ""Sinister"" is one of the best horror films this year. It has a relentless sense of dread throughout and is also incredibly effective and compelling. I can't wait to see it again, and also can't urge you enough to go and see it for yourself! Although, I'd recommend a night light for when you sleep.<br/><br/>Please read my weird and wonderful horror movie review blog! www.asdaman.wordpress.com"
"BobbyGuerrieri","10","407","645","29 September 2012"," Best Horror Film in the Last Decade
","Ellison, played by Ethan Hawke, is a true crime novelist who is looking to publish a bestseller more than ten years after the release of his hit book, ""Kentucky Blood"". Ellison moves his family (a wife and two young kids) into a house that was the scene of a grisly crime, leaving a mother, father, and two children dead, and a third child missing. Upon moving in, Ellison finds a box of super 8 films in the attic. On the tapes are the murders of the family who previously lived in his house and four other murders dating back to 1966. The only connection between the murders is a symbol found in all the videos. With his marriage deteriorating and his children's behavior becoming increasingly strange, Ellison is determined to connect the dots and possibly even solve the string of gruesome murders.<br/><br/>I'm sure everyone is familiar with the popular 'scary maze game'. Even if you know what is going to happen, you will most likely be scared in the moments leading up to the 'big scare'. You aren't scared of what is on the screen, but you're scared of what is about to be on the screen. That is the difference between surprise and horror. If the moments leading up to a jump scare are suspenseful, the actual scare is considered 'earned'. Too many horror movies nowadays have unearned jump scares. 'Sinister' is not at all one of those movies. It has it's fair share of jump scares, but after the initial shock, you don't feel at all relieved. The scares stick with you and you will go back to being just as tense as you were before the scare.<br/><br/>Another way 'Sinister' differs from most modern horror movies is that it actually focuses on plot. The film's director Scott Derrickson spends just as much time focusing on plot development as he does on scaring us, much like he did with 'The Exorcism of Emily Rose'. Since the characters are more developed and have more depth, we are able to relate to them much easier. 'Sinister' is more of a drama about family than it is a horror movie.<br/><br/>Ethan Hawke gives one of the best performances I've ever seen in a horror movie. He is great through the entire movie, but especially shines in scenes where he is frustrated. Juliet Rylance who plays his equally as frustrated wife is also great. With great performances from the two leads, it almost doesn't matter how well-acted the characters of their children are, but they are great nonetheless. Michael Hall D'Addario who plays Trevor provides one of the most shocking and terrifying scares I've ever seen (I just wish it wasn't in the trailer. However, if it wasn't, I may have peed).<br/><br/>I was lucky enough to see this movie in advance and attend a Q&A session with the director and writer. In the Q&A, they mentioned how this is a new take on the 'found footage' genre. This time however, instead of an ""anonymous source"" finding the footage and ""editing"" it from 36 hours to 80 minutes, the main character is the one who finds the footage. The audience is shown the footage, but not all at once. It is split up perfectly. Every time you hear the projector power up, you will automatically begin looking through the tiny slits between your fingers and you will certainly hold your breath.<br/><br/>'Sinister' is disturbing. 'Sinister' is 'Saw' level disturbing. During some scenes, I was actually trembling. The ending is also extremely messed up and surprising. And messed up. Not to mention messed up. The shocking imagery and twisted murders with certainly stick with you. Luckily you won't have any nightmares about the movie, but that's only because you won't be sleeping at all.<br/><br/>'Sinister' is the scariest horror movie in years and the best overall in the last decade. Horror fans will flock to see this movie and will not be disappointed. It is well-acted, well- written, well-directed, and most importantly, terrifying. If you see only one horror movie the rest of the year, let this be it. It is near-perfect and a step in the right direction for horror movies.<br/><br/>bobbysmoviereviews.blogspot.com"
"shayden2010","10","170","267","14 October 2012"," Sinister. A Excellent Horror Film.
","Sinister is very well made horror film. It is the only scary horror film I've seen for a very long time. It's never too cliché as most horror movies are. It never cheats you. The performances are believable and the story is intriguing and always moving. The director has control over his audience, and the audience is completely okay with that. I knew early into the film what kind of horror film it was and I how it would scare me. And that what was one of things it had going for it. You can anticipate the scares and that makes it much more frightening. Do not confuse anticipation with predictability. The movie wasn't too gruesome, which left more room for actual fear. All in all, it is a very good film, So good, it's almost... Sinister..."
"akaichou-crimsonbutterfl","6","26","36","13 February 2013"," Starts off strong, then to a bland finish
","I wasn't going to review this film, but then I felt like an unsatisfied horror fan customer by the time the credits rolled. <br/><br/>To start things off, the movie was so promising. The soundtrack was ingenious, with a heavy dose of indie ambient music, mixed with voices - many times I questioned whether what I heard was a moan from the scene or the music? <br/><br/>Cinematography was interesting. I liked the opening scene, the found footage really caught my attention, and the introduction of Ethan Hawk and his family's was well done. The long dolly shot with no cuts to open the movie kinda reminded me of a high end DV cam footage too. Real nice. No complaints in this department.<br/><br/>Characters were well played, kids not annoying, good acting all around. The young policeman looked a little like a criminal in his mannerisms, and he turned out to be fine, and the prof whom I thought was going to have a heavier role turned out to be really... small in his role. But I guess such details throw off the audience who like to guess where things are going. I'll give it to the film too for managing to avoid some cliché potholes, for example, with the boy in the box (brilliant).<br/><br/>Here comes my issues with this film (PERSONAL OPINION): PACING. In all of the jump scares, I wasn't scared at all. Not even a little heart jolt. In fact, when all of the jump scares occurred, I was focusing on the wrong thing on the screen. <br/><br/>I'm not a huge fan of jump scares, they are cheap, and really throw off the excellent mood setting that the cinematography and music and acting set. I personally found the other parts and basically anticipation to be more nerve wrecking than the actual scare itself. Some people have watched a similar movie 'Insidious' (same makers) and thought it was brilliant. I am one of the people who thinks Insidious works better as a 'circus freak show' type of horror as opposed to occult/supernatural horror. <br/><br/>As much as I love horror, blatant circus-like horror doesn't appeal to me. I found it blasé and 'too much'. Same issue I had with Insidious, I wished it was closer to authentic, classic, realistic and good supernatural horror. Or even a thriller. I don't mind a good psychological thriller either. But the scary 'kids' and the 'demon' were so .... blatant (i guess) till I was even mentally checking out the special effects, appliances and paint jobs they had for their characters. <br/><br/>I wasn't thrilled about the ending either. The last 10 minutes of the movie felt like it was trying to rush its end, 3 pictures from the prof and he doesn't shed any new light on the situation (I think Ethan Hawks got the message when the box of films refused to be burnt and gone), one very urgent phone-call from the policeman suddenly explained everything and why the family was about to be f***** in 2 seconds (really???), and with this new revelation and sudden info to process, the viewer is just supposed to accept that?? No fighting chance for the man's man Ethan Hawks at all? They seriously had him lay there like a sushi, while fate is being dealt out to him. MEH. Not even a surviving journal to detail his findings? <br/><br/>And what's that blood streaked wall of murals about? A bloody painted unicorn and is that a cartoon dick I see that zooms into a face?? I can't even tell if they are trying to insert humor or something. *Facepalm*<br/><br/>I thought the final footage was gonna be for a NEW family to chance upon but NOPE! We are shown what happens to the girl as she sketches her last picture; it feels like an extra reel, bonus footage, and the time would have been better spent on for example, showing how butchering is done the SAW fashion. <br/><br/>I was so disappointed how they served up a meaty intro and then gave up at the end, resorting to cheap techniques, cuts to speed time up, choosing to dwell on scenes that are not important, and neglect elaborating on what's most important.<br/><br/>If people didn't promise me the heavens when they left their reviews, I wouldn't be THIS disappointed. I would still say watch it, but please, don't expect the world lest you get disappointed like me.<br/><br/>===============SPOILERS HERE============== <br/><br/>I seriously question how little children are able to physically commit tall-order murders. From planning how to execute them, to having the kids acting like they aren't planning like they are going to kill people, to making sure that evidence left behind doesn't point to kid killing family, that's a lot of work! Most psychopaths put years into perfecting murder!! <br/><br/>Pulling dead weight into the pool isn't easy. Pulling dead weight into a car ain't easy. Tying dead weights up a tree ain't easy. It literally requires little kids to know strong knot-tying skills. Did the demon teach them all that? OMG. Demon has a future in education!"

The movie is so unconventional and different than most horror movies in a way that it makes you wonder if its a true story. Best part is that it makes you think and there are so many scenes wherein you just want to pause the movie because you just cant handle the intense suspense. Its a must watch and you will not regret for even a single moment, all the more a true horror movie fan would get peace of mind for a good deal of time before they would want to watch another spin chilling horror movie.

","I like to start with the good first...so I shall..<br/><br/>1.)I loved the way this movie was filmed, it's the film style that gets to me and keeps me on the edge of my seat and covering my eyes. The dark corners, characters shot with a gaping background, just waiting for something to walk past, or be standing in the shadows.<br/><br/>2.)I thought all the family member actors( Ethan was awesome I thought) did very well with what they were given, and how little they were actually in the movie.<br/><br/>3.) Interesting ""bad guy"", not a TOTAL cliché.<br/><br/>4.) Anytime he watched the reels, I found it very intense.<br/><br/>OK...now...THE BAD, or NOT SO GOOD....Real Spoilers below....<br/><br/>1.)I don't know who in the heck green lights previews. Just from the line ""eats children's souls"" and them showing little ""Amanda"" was missing from the first case..I knew instantly within 10 minutes of the movie EXACTLY what the ""catch"" was.So I was hoping they would throw in a wrench and maybe it OBVIOUSLY wouldn't be the ONE little kid that goes ""missing"" in each family that is killing them. How else could Boogs be standing on the side line every time. DUH. Maybe they weren't trying to make it a secret.......<br/><br/>2.) Boogs. Bad guy. Child soul eater. Looked like a cross from the midget puppet doll from Saw and the guy from V for Vendetta, going to an ICP concert. NOT SCARY.<br/><br/>3.)Ghost Children. RUINED the whole movie. No kidding. As soon as I saw the little ghost hands pulling Ethan down when he fell through the attic...I said ""oh god no, anything but little ghost children."" The scene out in the lawn when he find his daughter Trevor ; ), and they show the children behind him in the midst....seriously was the quality and as scary as a Liftime movie, along with the makeup. YAWN. Way to go make up guy.<br/><br/>4.) Obviously little Ashley would be the child to turn. Also knew that within the first 30 min. They just threw in the other little girl (Trevor) to throw people off....speaking of...<br/><br/>5.) CUT THAT LITTLE KIDS HAIR!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br/><br/>6.) I did love the way they filmed this movie, but I hate it when they don't EVER turn on ANY lights when ALL this freaky a$$ $*** is going on. REALLY!??? Also, I hate it in movies where the lead person is figuring, hearing, seeing ALL this stuff go on in their house....and just keep going to bed in the house. YEAH RIGHT.<br/><br/>And last but not least... 7.....THE ENDING. SUCKED. SUCKED, SUCKED, SUCKED, SUCKED, SUCKED. If you have seen it you don't need me to tell you why. If you haven't...non-creepy Ashley..somehow (just like the other children) drugged, dragged and murders her family. Not only does Boogs taint their mind, he also gives them super hero strength!!! AND they added all those STUPID little ghost kids in it AGAIN.<br/><br/>This movie had SUCH potential. Who ever the make up ""artist"" was...banish him from the biz. Who ever decides what information and scenes will be in previews......FIRE HIM. Sad to see a movie that could have been SO good, be a, moving on, what's on next??"

","When the trailer boasted the producers of ""Paranormal Activity"" and ""Insidious"" the idea of what tone this film would be reared it's head. Based around a series of jump scare sequences and slow character sections in order to attempt to make you feel for the characters while easing the tension of the situation. It's a tired formula that is becoming all the more clichéd and repetitive. However Sinister manages to find ways to break free of these leashes that the horror genre is becoming tied down to.<br/><br/>Ethan Hawk stars as a true crime writer known as Ellison who moves into a new home with his wife, Tracy (Juliet Rylance) and his two children, Ashley (Clare Foley) and Trevor (Michael Hall D'Addario) near the site of a local crime in order to get inspiration for his novel. During an exploration of the house Ellison stumbles across a box with an 8mm camera and a selection of films, which upon viewing exploit gruesome murders. This thrusts area hero into a terrifying mystery as he tries to piece together the meaning behind it all.<br/><br/>With horror films these days we come to know what to expect. We're given characters that we can't connect with merely there to service the plot and an un-original story that we've seen time and time again bringing the audience no sense of engagement. But mostly we're never scared beyond the mere technique of a jump scare. With director Scott Derrickson we are shown again how mainstream horror can creep on us with effective imagery and suggestion. The scares here can be portrayed by just using obscure camera angles and bizarre images that unsettle us. Derrickson understands though that using loud bands and noises to jolt the audience can be done effectively. By backing up these moments with his strong imagery he uses it as a tactic to implant these horrific moments in our minds.<br/><br/>The highlight however is the use of the 8mm films. Sinister is in love with the idea of film, from celluloid to digital as not only are we treated to disturbing super 8 films but Ellison boasts are large collection of VHS tapes of his old achievements. It's a nice, simple touch that film fans will appreciate. These 8mm films though boast some truly graphic sequences, one particularly involving a garden tool. Backed with a moody soundtrack by Christopher Young who's worked on other horror gems such as ""Drag Me To Hell"" and ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"". It feels more of an ambiance piece rather than a fully diegetic score merging together a series of dark and effective sounds building the feeling of dread constantly throughout.<br/><br/>Written by Derrickson himself and writer C. Robert Cargill the screenplay manages for the most part to push past the bland formula we've grown to endure with horror films of late. The film brings an intriguing plot that manages to put you in the position of Ellison's character, uncovering the plot and mystery when he does. There are scenes in which are hero re-visits the 8mm films and discovers new elements to them which adds a new depth to the story. The film feels relentless, rarely taking time to slow down and constantly feeling as though it's propelling towards something. However elements of the script are where the weaker parts of the film shine. While managing to bring interesting uses of horror and tension the film often retreads over clichéd ground as though it's trying to keep a warm attitude towards mainstream audiences. These are the times when the film feels as though it may lose focus but always manages to pick up its feet again. Alongside this we have some underused side and poorly written characters such as a police deputy who doesn't feel natural within the whole scale of things.<br/><br/>Sinister may tread over worn ground by it still manages to feel fresh and revitalizing in an age where we've conformed to the degrading standards of horror. It embraces the roots of horror and film in general making it much more than a homage and a feeling of an original yet genuinely terrifying story. Hawk manages to carry the emotional tangent of the narrative while the other characters are merely serviceable. It's not groundbreaking but for a mainstream horror film it takes some inventive and daring steps creating a terrifying, disturbing yet absorbing piece of cinema.<br/><br/>4/5 Stars."
"stefanrawsthorne","5","140","235","8 October 2012"," Average at best
","I went to watch Sinister with high expectations and to be left a shivering mess. I thought it would be one of those films where I was squeezing the arms of my seat, squinting, trying to keep my head pointed at the screen. <br/><br/>As it turned out I ended up laughing at most of the ""fright moments"". The scares were predictable, the plot after 20 minutes was obvious and the only real scare I got came at one point where Ethan Hawke has a baseball bat in his kitchen and the camera pans to show a child standing just over his shoulder.<br/><br/>The film takes every scary, supernatural, horror cliché and crams them into 109 minutes. The only thing missing was an Indian Burial ground - they even managed to get the deranged axe murderer into a movie about a Pagan deity. Why is it always Pagan?<br/><br/>Comedy relief is provided by a local policeman who crosses from genius to idiot in the space of 5 minutes, while completely juxtaposing the supposed serious character of Ethan Hawke as a once successful investigative real-life crime author, trying to rekindle the fame he once had.<br/><br/>The acting isn't bad, but it's not brilliant either. The film relies too heavily on the names of the cast and the marketing strategy of ""From the makers of Insidious and Paranormal Activity"" than any real plot substance. There is nothing new in this film, if you have saw more than a couple of horrors over the last few years – then you will find it hard to leave fulfilled.<br/><br/>The ending is slightly unexpected, but not enough to save the film and ultimately it leaves you disappointed. The final scene sums up the whole movie, if they have to give you ""one final scare"" just before the credits roll – then it probably wasn't worth it.<br/><br/>As it turns out the name of the bad guy demi-god was pretty close to how I felt about the film, Bagul was the name – Bagul-Crap was how I felt."
"maelstrom0370","2","259","448","14 October 2012"," Did I watch the same movie as everyone else?
","I'm not usually one to write reviews, but after the ridiculous amount of ""Best! Horror! Movie! EVAR!!"" reviews, I couldn't help it. <br/><br/>I'll start with something good (Kinda like the ""Oreo"" method). I thought the acting was good. The family had good chemistry and Ethan Hawke did a great job conveying his horror as he delved deeper into the murders. Also, the ""found footage"" murder films were VERY creepy and well done.<br/><br/>That said, I can't really come up with anything else good to say about this movie. In my opinion, a good horror movie has either A.) A sufficiently scary monster/ghost/demon, B.) A premise that effects a majority of people (The Strangers) or C.) A combination of both. 'Sinister' has none of this. If you aren't a family with 2 kids who also happen to live in a house where the previous family was murdered, you're safe! That's a pretty small demographic. Also, there's the completely convoluted pattern. Sooo, he gets mad when you move? It's also a bit of ""the chicken and the egg"". How did the first murder happen? The Pagan Deity this movie centers around was pretty damn creepy in the blurred images we were shown at first. Unfortunately, the director decided ""MOAR IZ BETTURR!!"" and, just like that, we're supposed to accept that a member of Slipknot has turned to a life of eating children's souls. Add that to the endless cheap jump scares (The boy's night terrors served no other purpose than to provide two cheap, easy scares), an erratic sound track and ""BOOM!"" sound effects and this movie was a complete let down. I can only assume that the ""zOMFG!! The kids did it!!!"" was supposed to be what would ""f*ck a lot of people up"" about this movie. I ramble a bit so I hope this was at least slightly cohesive. In short, give 'Sinister' a pass."
"rlaine","8","7","8","14 September 2013"," Great horror, really liked it
","This is old school gore-free horror, just the way I like it. It's got great story, great acting, great style in direction. So many horror movies these days are a let down, but this one delivered big time.<br/><br/>Story is not the most original. It's got elements from a lot of other horror movies, some pretty bad ones, so I was a bit skeptic on how the story would evolve. But it does hold together and actually delivers by the end quite well. I never felt being betrayed by cheap red herrings, it just worked.<br/><br/>Acting is great. It's Ethan Hawke most of the time and I really think he makes a lot of this movie. He's both likable and quite believable. His character is quite humane in all it's fragility. The scene in which he has fallen asleep watching an old interview of his and his wife finds him is actually quite heartfelt. There's only one scene - pretty important one - which I think Hawke slightly overplays, but otherwise everything is spot on.<br/><br/>Scares are delivered quite sparingly, but they're effective. I watched this in the middle of the night and I did jump a few times. Some of the 8mm films are quite disturbing to watch, even tho there is no actual graphic gore involved. I really liked the fact that they spared the graphic images and went for psychological terror instead.<br/><br/>The direction is solid. It's stylish. Music and soundtrack choices were quiet interesting here and there. Makes me feel like I want to watch this again just to concentrate on the soundtrack once more. They even have a Boards of Canada tune playing over a scene - what's not to like?<br/><br/>Great movie, really really good. Old school horror ftw!"

","This film is probably the scariest film I have ever seen. It bring everything that a good horror film should bring to the table. Jump scares, disturbing imagery, haunting music, etc. The use of the recorded murders is especially terrifying. The story never has a dull moment and provides many good twists along the way. The lack of music during the filmed murders is especially chilling. Ethan Hawke stands out as the protagonist and plays the role very well. The film is not perfect though. There are a few scenes that can come off as silly but still add to the progression of the story. I highly recommend this film and hope you enjoy as much as I did.

","Am writing this Review as a fan of Horror flicks.<br/><br/>Most of the horror movie will be emphasized with the Sound effects, blood splitting scenes and with CG and they will be weak in the story line but sinister is an exceptional from other horror movies.<br/><br/>Solid story line which carry's the whole movie without any blur, and appropriate sound effects which scares the hell out the viewers.<br/><br/>The reasons why the movie is good are: i) Ethan's performance adds additional strength to the plot and is acting was perfectly matched. ii) Sound effects was incredible and specially when Ethan sees the home videos it was to the core. iii) Very few number of characters which gives a accurate phase for the movie.<br/><br/>SINISTER goes around the hero a lot who is a crime author trying to pull of the things back and getting his family into the jeopardy. The movie was going around Ethan and less focus on his family members. The surprise character is a boogie man which they must have given some more explanation on him rather than pulling the religious ideas.<br/><br/>Totally Sinister is a must watch movie for horror fans.<br/><br/>Even if you are not a horror fan you can give a try worth watching it.<br/><br/>Hope it will be more scary to the core if Sinister 2 releases...<br/><br/>Lets wait and get scared...!!!"

It's scary and terrifying, but doesn't have a lot of gore. The score, the directing, the acting, the lighting were all done in a way that they fit so perfectly together.

"Remy_Azhary","10","149","253","12 October 2012"," Now here's a horror movie
","This one scared the hell out of me. With the eerie music to accompany the film it sure made the movie creepy as hell. The opening sequence felt so real that it got me hooked to know just what the hell is going on.<br/><br/>I was watching it alone on Friday night after work and sure enough there were about less than 10 people in the theater (all of whom were couples). I could bet with my bottom dollar that with this movie they'd be so engaged in the film that they wouldn't dare to think about making out.<br/><br/>It is THAT SCARY!!!<br/><br/>The film was directed by Scott Derrickson, the same guy who made THE EXORCISM OF EMILY ROSE; and he collaborated with the composer, Christopher Young, on that very film. I am quite familiar with Young's music score from his composition for A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET 2 and it was creepy; also he did the score for Sigourney Weaver's serial killer film, COPYCAT.<br/><br/>I'm telling you if those two managed to bring out the spine-chilling factor in EMILY ROSE, in SINISTER they really sealed the deal in being the potent filmmakers in the exploration into the paranormal and supernatural. It gave me goosebumps just thinking about it.<br/><br/>One thing that I feel about SINISTER was that Derrickson (together with Young) brought us back to that atmospheric terror of the unknown that is truly nostalgic of horror films of the 70s.<br/><br/>The feel of the movie was so scary that this was how THE AMITYVILLE HORROR should have been remade.<br/><br/>In short, I'd highly recommend you (or better still DARE YOU) to see SINISTER. This is one good date movie if you want your date to crawl under your shirt; or just bring some best buddies to scare the crap out of you. I mean it may not be INSIDIOUS, nevertheless, if you love that then you'll love this."
"toqtaqiya2","4","51","81","22 October 2012"," It's a meandering pointless story full of horror clichés.
","While Sinister does offer enough scares I found it to be a lack luster affair. When I was going to see this film I didn't know what to expect. When I was watching it I have to admit that it put my nerves on edge. Unfortunately, it doesn't do this in any innovative way. Sinister relies too much on jump scares, and consists of Ethan Hawke as Ellison Oswalt interacting with things like a laptop and a supernatural projector. There are supporting characters but they're often nothing more than plot devices. At one point Vincent D'Onofrio pops in as Professor Jonas only via iChat to provide more info about the baddie. One has to give Hawke some credit because he does deliver a good performance as a frightened family man, but it's just silly when the demon Bughuul (a.k.a. Mr. Boogie) looks like a member of a heavy metal band. In the end we still get to know almost nothing about this Pagan deity and he has very little screen time. It's clear that Sinister was heavily influenced by the Japanese horror genre and Paranormal Activity (2007). It features a silly conspiracy involving Super 8 footage, several children and the demon baddie. Because the film aims so much to shock you with a minimal plot you have to watch scenes which make no sense. Director Scott Derrickson made it a thing to show doors being closed and the projector being turned on again and again. It seems that some moviegoers consider Sinister a good horror film because it gave them a difficult time. Unfortunately, when you're done watching it and look back on it you can't help but notice the unexplained and the silliness. The film should have been more serious. As a horror flick it's passable but I don't recommend watching it."
"MaximumMadness","8","16","22","7 June 2017"," ""Sinister""- A solid and satisfying creep-show despite a clunky third act.
","Say what you will about the varying quality of their releases- popular horror film production company Blumhouse really has a good thing going these days. With micro-budget features like the ""Insidious"" and ""Paranormal Activity"" series that are reliant on genuine scares over effects, and some very decent and high-quality releases under their name, its a modern day rags-to-riches story like few others. A company that has flourished without having to spend the hundreds of millions that bigger studios throw around. And one of their more fascinating releases of the past few years has most certainly been director Scott Derrickson and co-writer C. Robert Cargill's atmospheric and unsettling freak-show ""Sinister."" It has all the trademarks of an inferior film- plenty of jumps, lots of blood-'n-gore that is questionable, a blaring soundtrack. And yet, I feel it rises above many other films because of one thing- expert building and payoff of atmosphere.<br/><br/>We follow the story of true-crime writer Ellison Oswalt (Ethan Hawke), who moves his family into a new house... though his wife and children are unaware that their new home is also the location of an infamous unsolved murder, which Ellison is hoping to use as the basis for a new book. Soon enough, while doing research, Ellison discovers a mysterious box packed away in the attic that houses a collection of 8mm film strips appearing to depict almost ritualistic murders, all with one thing in common- the death of an entire family. As Ellison tries to solve the mystery of these dark and devious film-strips, his family soon finds itself haunted by strange happenings and unexplainable events... which may very well be tied the spirits of the slain victims and a demonic figure that Ellison begins to recognize as he continually appears again and again during his investigation...<br/><br/>A great deal of why the film works lays in the capable hands of the creative minds behind it. While I have taken issue with some of director Derrickson's films in the past (including the woefully misjudged ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" remake), I've very much admired his work in the field of horror, in addition to his recent return to the mainstream with the delightful ""Doctor Strange."" And despite a limited budget, he shines through with wicked visual direction and a wonderfully disturbing sense of dread in ""Sinister."" This is one eerie, unsettling film, and his keen use of darkness, composition and suggestive camera angles lends a lot of fear to the proceedings. You can feel the tension growing with each and every passing moment, and at any time, you feel like everything is going to fall apart. I also very much admired how he handled the many ""snuff films"" we see peppered throughout the runtime... they are deliciously evil and twisted in all the right ways to give you the best of goosebumps.<br/><br/>The story Derrickson and Cargill craft is just a blast and a half, with extremely likable characters (archetypal though they may be) and a good structure that builds at a gradual but consistent pace. It's a very well-written film for the most part, and it does its job wonderfully in setting up the insanity to follow. Combine that with top-notch performances, and you got the recipe for a great little horror film. Ethan Hawke is absolutely marvelous as always, and it's nice to see him doing just a fun, old-fashioned horror flick. Supporting roles by the likes of Juliet Rylance, James Ransone and Clare Foley are also extremely well-played. And hey... we even get a small, uncredited turn from the fantastic Vincent D'Onofrio as a professor who repeatedly works alongside Oswalt via Skype chat. It's a small role, but it's also a lot of fun.<br/><br/>That being said... Oh, boy is there one glaring issue that does drag the film down quite a bit, and it's where it loses some major points for me. And that is the third act. While I will not spoil anything, be prepared for a bit of a let-down with a final reel that feels hastily patched together and has a fair share of moments that stink of studio interference. The first hour is so well assembled, that it's actually pretty mind-blowing how much of a mess the final thirty or so minutes are. With a rash of mind-numbing moments, repeated sloppy exposition dumps and a final sequence that is more likely to illicit unintentional giggles than genuine shocks... it doesn't go out with a bang so much as a whimper.<br/><br/>Still, it's not enough to ruin the film. Because outside of that messy, clunky finale, the rest of the film is incredibly strong and it is still a tale well-worth checking out. It's absolutely awe- inspiring sense of primal fear, wonderful performances and wicked entertainment value make it a great go-to for Halloween-night viewings or checking out with a big group of friends in the dark. It's not a perfect film. But it's a very solid and scary experience that I completely recommend to all fans of horror.<br/><br/>I give ""Sinister"" a very good 8 out of 10."

It is not at all predictable n it is very terrifying. The title, Sinister aptly suits the movie.

"eytand94","10","10","13","10 November 2012"," Something Truly Sinister
","If you can find new ways to expand on familiar formulas, you just might have a good horror movie. ""Sinister"" isn't a good horror movie. It's a GREAT one. Directed by Scott Derrickson (director of ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose""), this shiver-inducing fright fest is the perfect genre flick for the Halloween season or any time of year.<br/><br/>Ellison Oswalt is a struggling writer, barely living off of money he made from a book that was successful at least 10 years ago. In order to make his comeback and pen down a thrilling new piece of non-fiction, he moves his wife, Tracy, and children, Ashley and Trevor, into a new house. The family isn't exactly fond of this choice, but they're warming up to it. ""I'm going to write the best book anyone's ever read,"" Ellison tells Ashley. They don't know, however, that they have just moved into a crime scene. Several years ago, a family was hung from a tree in this house's backyard, and the daughter is yet to be found. The most disturbing notion, for Ellison, is that while in the writing process, he discovers and watches this and other gruesome acts on Super 8 videotapes he found in the attic. But there is an unsettling string attached to these murders, and it's lurking in the background of the screen.<br/><br/>Sure, ""Sinister"" follows the formula of other horror films, but it doesn't dumb things down for the audience. Once we find out terrible things happened in this setting, a lot of the fear we expect is in the imagination, with creaking floorboards, slamming doors, and eerie whispering. Therefore, it is a brilliantly scary horror film. I haven't been this terrified since ""Insidious."" And surprise, surprise. ""Sinister"" is produced by Jason Blum, producer of ""Paranormal Activity"" and ""Insidious."" <br/><br/>Owing a lot to ""The Shining,"" ""The Amityville Horror,"" and ""The Ring,"" newcomer C. Robert Cargill and director Derrickson have written a smart script with a truly nightmarish villain: not just the film's monster, but film itself. The Super 8 tapes presented to us are some of the most disturbing pieces of footage I have ever seen, and they definitely give a feeling of discomfort to the viewer. If a horror movie can make you feel appropriately uncomfortable, then it's done its job.<br/><br/>The cast is actually small, and it is led by A-list performer Ethan Hawke as Ellison. Hawke has given his best performance in years. At first, Ellison seems like a selfish jerk. He's not exactly the perfect father figure for Ashley and Trevor, and it's a miracle that Tracy has endured this much with him. But after he finds the Super 8s, he's not in this to make a book out of blood money. He's concerned and dying to put together the pieces of the puzzle before anyone else is endangered. Hawke portrays that flawlessly, and it's pretty obvious that he wouldn't have chosen to be a part of this movie if it wasn't good.<br/><br/>Newcomer Juliet Rylance is also very good as Tracy, her best moment being when she finally confronts Ellison about his actions. She is believable and always sympathetic. James Ransone also stars as a town deputy, providing some great humor to help the audience breathe before the big ""BOO!"" And Vincent D'Onofrio goes uncredited as a professor who provides Ellison with a hefty amount of information about the events behind these home movies.<br/><br/>The jump scares of ""Sinister"" are perfectly executed, and there are no cats waiting to falsely freak you out. All of the horror in this film is real and genuine. From the beginning, ""Sinister"" is dark in terms of atmosphere and tone, and the ending, unlike the opinions of the critics, gave me chills. Why ""Paranormal Activity 4"" would make more money than this film is understandable, but that doesn't make that sequel a good movie. This is the rare film that incorporates found footage into a realistic, non-home video setting and it manages to scare you out of your wits. You want something frightening? ""Sinister"" is the best horror movie of 2012. Not for the faint of heart, but it will suit the needs of the more intelligent horror movie buffs."

"harrygoodwin1996","9","8","10","23 October 2013"," Overall-Scariest Film I've Seen For A Long, Long time.
","Sinister has a unique and different narrative, much different than the over-used cabin in the woods or fuelled on sexually active teens and pure gore, it consists of a writer, played by Ethan Hawke, he moved his family into a house in which the latest murder took place. He found a box of 'super 8' films and discovered the murders of what happened were all caught on these tapes. As the movie unfolds with somewhat of an enigma to whom or what it could be it grasps the audience in a way to keep them intrigued but to also keep them on the 'edge of their seat'. However it uses traditional key conventions to the horror genre and uses a much more 'calmer' approach and focuses much on the narrative of the film rather than how to scare the audience. It has gone back to the old originals, focusing on music and the build up of tension rather than gore, violence and deaths every 5 minutes.This film would be a key success in my opinion and has the a much better ability to make you jump rather than just make you stare and say 'eww'. This film was a disturbing, but not to the point in which you may wish to stop watching and death, though a key part, was not shown every two scenes. A definite recommendation for me."

","This horror movie is one of the best I've ever seen. From the fantastic acting to the scary scenes that will genuinely creep you out, none of those cheap jump scares crap, I mean like actually being frightened. Baghoul is an evil spirit/presence in the movie, but he's not like a monster made of CGI effects that you see throughout the movie, you see his handiwork more than you actually see him, but in my opinion, his handiwork is much scarier than them actually showing you his face. Because to me what you make up in your own mind and your own imagination is scarier than them just showing you the thing you're supposed to be afraid of. They do use that method and it works wonderfully in this movie. The cast is very good and I loved all the performances. Ethan Hawke is a very talented actor, I've known that since Dead Poets Society when he was just starting out. He gives a very good performance as the writer father who begins to research this thing that has haunted and killed other innocents in the past. As he digs deeper and deeper the movie gets even more entertaining (and scarier). I suggest this movie to anyone who likes a very well-made horror movie. It is directed very well and it's evident that the writers knew exactly what they were doing. 8/10 for Sinister."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","6","7","2 February 2017"," ""Sinister"" successfully reaches out to fans of classic and modern horror
","A true crime writer picks the wrong murder mystery for his next book in ""Sinister,"" a horror movie that balances the contemporary horror movie formula with mystery thriller elements and a solid leading performance.<br/><br/>Ethan Hawke plays Ellison Oswalt, a successful writer who has just moved his family to a town in Pennsylvania where a family was found hung from a tree in the backyard except for the third child, who was reported missing. Unbeknownst to the rest of his family, Ellison has moved them into the exact house where the family was killed. In the attic, he finds a box with an 8mm film projector and a handful of film reels, all of which show families being murdered, including the case he's investigating. Ellison realizes he's on to something big, but eventually things take a supernatural turn.<br/><br/>If the film weren't titled ""Sinister"" (a title that seems to have been subjectively chosen for marketing purposes) and you went in without knowing anything, you might actually convince yourself you were watching an eerie true crime thriller and be a bit surprised to watch the film take a contemporary horror flick turn equipped with creepy ghost children, freaky old movies and a pagan deity. <br/><br/>""Sinister"" straddles these two genres without disappointing fans that wanted one over the other, but might disappoint fans that enjoy one but don't like the other at all. Director Scott Derrickson (""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"") uses classic suspense techniques and the creepy Super8 videos for that slow-building dread effect reminiscent of a more classic horror-thriller, while also employing the slow- walking-through-a-house-at-night-that-ends-in-a-jump-scare techniques of today's horror movies. The film predictably begins with more of the former and ends distinctly as the latter, and Derrickson oversees the passing of that baton and ensures it happens cohesively with strong, evocative visuals and an unusually creepy soundtrack. <br/><br/>C. Robert Cargill's story also allows these genres to function effectively together. Good horror movies show more interest and concern in the characters and how they deal with horrifying events than the horrifying events themselves. Cargill's script definitely focuses on Ellison, and the simple conceit of him being a writer who investigates murders puts him in a unique position among horror movie protagonists. Cargill adds the twist that Ellison has not had a best-seller in 10 years, so there's pressure on him to pursue this case in spite of the warning signs. <br/><br/>A strong lead character also appeals to a better caliber of actor, and Hawke lends so much legitimacy to this movie. Ellison is more accustomed to seeing disturbing things, so to watch Hawke's performance as this case gets more and more under his character's skin is a real added benefit. Hawke allows us to empathize with his character despite knowing full well that we would not have handled things the same way he does at various points in the film.<br/><br/>The ending has some issues along those lines and some information that seems obvious to the audience is not obvious to the characters, and that can be frustrating, but on the whole, ""Sinister"" leaves you with a jaw-dropper of an ending, a perfectly freaky culmination of all the classic suspense and minutes upon minutes of wondering when it's all going to blow up.<br/><br/>""Sinister"" will more likely win over viewers who don't always like scary movies than it will avid scary movie watchers who love the genre precisely for its conventions and clichés, but it successfully reaches out to both. <br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

","Before watching this film I had heard very little about it, all I had been told was that it would make you very wary of younger children. So when I watched Sinster I was expecting something along the lines of insidious but this is far from it. One thing I like about it is that at first we are led to believe that there is definitely something wrong with the eldest child played by Michael Hall D'Addario as there is that very strange scene where he bursts out of a moving box. However, the finding of the projector and the home movies really sets this film apart from others. Ethan Hawke, who plays a author trying to break through the one hit wonder problem, lies to his family and tells them they are moving in to the house a few doors down to where a murder took place. This creates a sense of panic when he does discover the true horrors of the house and the supernatural being that haunts it because he can't tell his family, he has to try and deal with it by himself. This film has a very good story line and there are many places when you really jump out of your seat, but for me the best bit of the film has to be the finding and watching of the tapes because to watch something so gruesome and horrible and see that it is a child that is performing/carrying these deeds out really is sinister."
"lorcan-61881","10","6","7","5 October 2016"," One of the scariest horror films in years.
","Sinister stars Ethan Hawke,Juliet Rylance and Fred Thompson. It tells the story about a crime writer who moves into a house with his wife and two children and one day when he goes up to attic he finds a box full of videos when he watches them,the movies are of family's dying. Soon then,strange things start to happen around his house and with his family when soon it's all leading up to one thing..a man from the snuff videos called the Boogeyman. Sinister honestly so god damn scary,I was terrified going to sleep when I saw this I just couldn't get it out of my head then it passed but I was still scared and I made a pact never to watch it again. The acting was good but the jump scares was terrifying as hell. I actually screamed when the boogeyman jumped out when Ethan Hawke walked up the attic and saw all the children watching the tapes. Sinister is a very very very scary horror mystery movie than definitely horror fans will like."
"nitzanhavoc","8","6","7","7 May 2013"," Lots of ""boo!"" moments, but very well done. Scared me silly!
","EDITED: Feb. 27, after 2nd watch.<br/><br/>I've just finished watching Sinister, and I must confess that my heart is still pounding. I hate to say it, but it made me jump in my seat a few times. Why do I hate to say it? Because as a devout and pretty experienced Horror fan, I really find it hard to respect films that use ""cheats"" (i.e slow shooting with very dark lighting, suddenly a frightening shot with a blast of loud bass music) that appeal more to a viewer's physiology than their logic and fear. Still, if you're gonna use that ""cheat"", then this is definitely the way to do so! Sometimes it's real fun being scared like that.<br/><br/>I didn't find the screenplay and story to be all that original, as we've seen many films using very similar backgrounds, but I did like it. Gruesome murders, missing children, found footage as part of the plot (rather than the entire film being a ""mockumentary""), and one Ethan Hawk trying to get to the bottom of all while fighting to save his career and keep his family and marriage from paying the price. Pretty decent, yet pretty generic.<br/><br/>Sinister uses elements from different sub-genres and adds them up together to give the viewer a very healthy scare. I especially liked the fact that the audience can't really know what type of Horror film this is (Ghosts? Slasher/Murderer? Occult/Supernatural? All of the above?) until around the middle, and that unlike in other films - in this case the plot synopsis here doesn't spoil it. The acting was also good, though mainly by the rest of the cast (for instance Michael Hall D'Addario and Clare Foley as the two children, or Fred Dalton Thompson and James Ransone as the Sheriff and Deputy), I don't really appreciate Ethan Hawk's obvious overacting in this one (though I guess his acting is like pineapple as a pizza topping, you either like it or you don't).<br/><br/>As for the ending, I always enjoy Horror more when a clever plot twist is applied, enhancing the feeling of suspense and the using the element of surprise to increase the overall sensation of fear (very much like psycho-thriller films). In Sinister, the ending doesn't involve such a twist per se, but it definitely binds together many pieces of information and succeeds in being unpredictable and horrifying (even when watching for the 2nd time!)<br/><br/>One of the best features of this film is the original soundtrack, which is dark and eerie and definitely takes the overall feeling of discomfort to a new level. This is especially noticed when the protagonist watches the old silent films.<br/><br/>Like I've said, if you're going to appeal to the audience's physiology and jump from behind the closet shouting ""boo!"", do it right, and Sinister definitely does it right! Very very few Horror films in this day and age don't use any ""cheats"" at all, and when done well enough - the ""boo!"" thing isn't really that much of a cheat. I've really enjoyed watching this film, and would recommend it to anyone who fancies themselves a tough viewer. Sit at home alone, turn off the lights, and watch this. It was 8:30 a.m when I first watched it, and it still scared me silly."
"thefilmdiscussion","9","32","52","12 October 2012"," ""Sinister"" boldly lives up to its name
","In today's depressing world of the Hollywood sequel machine it's so refreshing to see a film that can still shock, scare and surprise. The director of such a film is Scott Derrickson, who refused to let a big studio dictate how his film would play out, and especially how it would end. He searched until he found a company that let him have complete control, a minor miracle. The result is ""Sinister"", a film so full of unmentionables and studio ""no no's"" that it feels almost foreign. What's certain is that the film feels uncomfortable, disturbing, and entirely horrifying.<br/><br/>""Sinister"" is about a true-crime novelist named Ellison Oswalt (Ethan Hawke), who, in search of his next great story, movies his wife (Juliet Rylance) and two kids to a new town so he can be closer to the crime scene of his planned story. His wife wants to know if they've moved next door to a murder scene ""again"". He promises ""No"", and he tells the truth. They've haven't moved next door to the scene of the crime, they've moved into it. Four members of a family were found hanging in a tree out back, and their little girl is still missing.<br/><br/>While unpacking, Ellison uncovers a box of Super-8 films in the attic. Seemingly family home movies, he plays the first one and is shocked at what he finds halfway through. After a few shots of whiskey he returns to watch the rest, witnessing recorded murders before his very eyes. The names on the labels of the home movies take on a sickening double meaning: ""Family Hanging Out"", ""BBQ"", ""Pool Party"", among others. I won't mention the worst one, a segment that is so shocking it left the theatre in a dead quiet, and I'm still trying to shake it.<br/><br/>Unbeknownst to Ellison, something evil lurks within the videos, a demon of ancient days known for doing insidious things, and watching the films releases its evil upon him and his family. It's only a matter of time before it seems he may be next.<br/><br/>There are so many little layers to this film that one wonders how they'll all tie together or if they will even matter by the film's end credits. Surprisingly they do matter, and to Derrickson's credit he brings the house down with a riveting climax that zips everything up tight like a body-bag, without ever stooping into Hollywood Ending territory.<br/><br/>Filmed with a sure eye for framing and with the patience to not burden the film with lots of quick cuts and jump-scares, the director creates a film of suspense that mounts and mounts. When the shocks come, and boy do they ever, they aren't cheap. They're scary as hell.<br/><br/>The script allows for some excellent moments between all of the actors, moments of levity and brief laughter that are more than comic relief (and thank God for any relief this film offers), they're touching and revealing of the characters. Ellison's motivations are strong to stay in the house, but so are his wife's to get outta there. When they finally do reach a decision, it may be too late. At nearly two hours, it's also thirty minutes longer than most horror films and just when you think it's reached a hair-raising climax, you ain't seen nothing' yet! Brace yourselves.<br/><br/>-Thomas Bond"

","Either all of those years of ""screamers"" made me immune to this type of horror movie, or it was just plain HORRIBLE! I am positive it is the latter, considering the scares in this movie were horribly predictable and cliché. There is a scene where he has a picture in his hand with the boogie, and the photoshop is disgustingly visible. I predicted about 80% of this movie while I was watching it, and there was only one time when I didn't know he was going to pop out. However, because he is in a nether-realm, even when he shows up it isn't scary.<br/><br/>The plot was boring, it was only rated R because it showed kids doing obscene things, that you cannot even see. Bottom line is, you are better off trying to get scared off of a youtube screamer, instead of wasting money on a complete disgrace to the Horror genre.

"regienaldg-283-237153","8","12","17","1 January 2013"," The only one of two movies that scared the hell out of me.
","The last time a horror movie scared me to death was when I was a kid, when I watched the original Exorcist movie starring Linda Blair. Since then, I watched a lot of horror movies and eventually became a horror movie fan of both supernatural and slasher horror movies. Though there were several scary ones, there was none that is as scary and creepy as the Exorcist until I watched Sinister.<br/><br/>Sinister is a movie that combined elements of eeriness, creepiness, and classical theme that turned it into a horror masterpiece. The killing process for example where the family is hanged to a tree is a very classic murderous encounter, and as the man watches that video in the dark, that itself is very eerie as much as it is creepy and scary. You, as an audience can feel the atmosphere that the man is in. So not only are you moved by the vibe of the movie, you also feel the events that are happening. Another aspect that made this movie an excellent horror film is the involvement of the children in the horror events. You will definitely wonder how and why, why the children. And that leads you to investigate as a viewer, to dig deeper into the aspect of this movie. That is what makes this movie really scary. One's curiosity in trying to dig deeper into the events of the movie, just like the main character, leads you into an unknown evil dimension where you don't know what lies ahead. Just the pure thought of it scares you as an audience because you also experience what the character is experiencing. <br/><br/>The cinematography is perfect. The acting is great. Ethan Hawke delivered a memorable performance as the curious writer who was lured into an evil dimension he wasn't even aware of. Overall, Sinister is an excellent horror movie experience."
"Simon_Says_Movies","8","12","17","13 October 2012"," Primed To Rob You of Sleep
","It's a rarity when it comes to the marketing of horror films that the tidbits they toss to the masses can be both potent in their ability to allure crowds all while not spoiling the film's biggest scares. Sinister unleashed a truly terrifying promotional campaign that highlighted some of its more impactful frights, but kept enough under wraps to deliver 110 minutes of continuous tension and terror. <br/><br/>In a number of ways, Sinister could be viewed as a companion piece to 2011's Insidious and not just in name. Both take an uncommonly smart and restrained approach to horror, derive their thrills from the presence of a chilling demonic presence and feature a father fighting for the protection of his children. However, in spite of the parallels that can be drawn, Sinister is its own beast and is easily stands as one of the best fright flicks of the year.<br/><br/>What Sinister does best is maintain tension for extended sequences. Even when it's building its characters or unravelling the mystery, we're biting our nails because we know the tenseness is bound to return soon. The pagan deity known as Bagul, who serve's as this film's boogeyman, is only shown in fleeting instances, usually from afar on a blurry Super-8 film reel zoomed in upon, and rarely shown in crisp entirety. This makes the quiet moments – the before the storm scenes – all the more potent. <br/><br/>To quickly shed a bit of light on the story, Sinister follows a true crime novelist with the unfortunate name of Ellison Oswalt (Ethan Hawke) who a decade prior had a massive hit on his hands, but has hit some bad luck since with his foray into fiction. Looking for his next big story, he moves his wife (Juliet Rylance) and his daughter and son to a home that happens to be the scene of a grisly murder of four and the disappearance of a fifth. Finding a box of film reels and a projector in the attic, Ellison sifts through the footage and begins to uncover a shocking history of gruesome violence.<br/><br/>Ellison is an interesting character due to his flawed nature and instances of unlikeability, which then ultimately blend well with the scenes depicting him as a good man at heart and a caring father. Ellison becomes so obsessed with regaining his mantle, ""creating a legacy"" as he puts it, that he often forgets his legacy is his children. It's a somewhat chancy decision in a horror film when you already have to deal with obstacles such as characters behaving idiotically. Ellison's dual nature also gives the typical ""nagging wife"" archetype a justifiable reason to bitch and Rylance's Tracey does so in a way that makes us root for her, for him, both or them and them as a collective family.<br/><br/>When it comes to idiocy in horror films, Sinister as does an admirable job of avoiding, if not masking, the tendency. As more and more is revealed about Bagul and his motives (and as troubling as it all may be), there is no apparent threat. Simply the odd bump in the night and the conclusions of a drunken author submersing himself so thoroughly into his disturbing work that he begins to doubt the conclusions he's drawing. It is in this area, Sinister sidesteps the ""door paradox."" There is really no overpowering reason they should immediately leave. <br/><br/>One thing that did stick in my craw, however, was Ellison's propensity to wander around the home without thinking to switch on a light (and he stalks around the house far too much – it becomes a tad repetitive despite the tense execution). In one such instance there was a power outage but in the other cases it's rather maddening and an obvious attempt to retain the gloomy aesthetic of the scene. <br/><br/>Additionally, I would strongly suggest to Tracey that she visit a sleep doctor because her patterns are wild at best. At one instance she awakes at the sound of her husband opening the door to investigate a noise and at another he tumbles from the attic hatch and we don't see a glimpse of her. It wouldn't have taken much to have her appear at the other occasions, especially considering her arrival wouldn't have impacted any scares or tension.<br/><br/>That being said, Sinister is uniformly: a) well directed by Scott Derrickson b) acted (by Hawke in particular though the child actors are underused) and c) deeply unsettling as a whole. Upon leaving the theater there was a decidedly large lump in my stomach. The creature design of Bagul is outstanding and when we linger on the demon's face (such as a scene where Ellison walks up to the projector screen and inquisitively strokes the image) it's terrifying even when all real world logic says it shouldn't be. <br/><br/>Capping everything off is the score by Christopher Young, which has become my favorite of the year. Young, who unsurprisingly upon further investigation also worked on Drag Me to Hell, offers up a collection of cacophonous clangs, crashes and off-key instrumental strokes that compliments the material perfectly. <br/><br/>Concluding everything with a perfect ending that doesn't betray the fictional logic and lore the film creates and utilizing found footage as, well, actual found footage, Sinister is primed to rob you of sleep and stands to this day the only horror film to make me involuntarily shut my eyes. That is worth kudos in of itself."

","Saw Sinister today and loved it. I am a horror fan and it was a great scary movie and disturbing, good disturbing if you know what I mean. Jumped a couple of times and the length of the movie was perfect. have no complaints. I thought Ethan Hawke was perfect for the picture and his wife in the movie (ive never seen) was very great also. From all the way back from the 60s there were murders of the entire family, but one of the kids always came up missing. and each family murdered it was like a 10 year span from each other and they all previously lived in the same house the previous family was murdered in.

The opening scene is probably one of the most disturbing I've seen and it doesn't stop there; Ethan Hawke who plays true crime author Ellison Oswalt finds several super 8 films entitled 'Home Movies' and in these home movies, families (excluding one child) are killed in gruesome ways, this makes you grit your teeth anyway but it has a high jump factor as there are numerous scenes which pop up unannounced. Although the jumpy scenes are predictable, they still pack a punch, especially in the cinemas. This film isn't for the faint-hearted, it will scar you mentally and will put you off having children forever. The best horror film in years and a good story behind it!"

"insidmal","3","55","102","12 October 2012"," Failure to suspend disbelief.
","I was not able to get in to this movie. I'm a sucker for scary movies, and although this one did make me jump a few times the fear factor in this film is fully from the sense of surprise, not actual 'fear' itself. Every time I found myself starting to get involved in the movie, it would pull me back out by a lack of continuity and complete predictability. The story is overplayed, most of the elements in this film we have seen over and over and over again. You can tell within the first 10 minutes what is going to happen, and then you just sit there and wait for it to unfold. An hour and a half later when it does unfold, the movie comes to a sudden end, and you are left disappointed - all that waiting and then nothing really happens. Such an overplayed premise - the film opens with the family moving into a house where someone had been killed in the past - there's a shocker. Of course one of the kids has some weird oddity that picks up on the vibes instantly. The husband is a writer (why do writers in films always have such a shitty sense of style?) the wife is.. who knows.. she's just there to add more tension to the situation. Husband finds some film that documents the crime he is writing about, that occurred in the house.. ooh gee how did it get there? who knows.. what a mystery - sooo scary, we've never seen anything like that happen before. He watches the video and it documents the crime, as well as others - he watches it and finally notices a character and a symbol that repeats in each video. He talks to some college professor (wow something else we've never seen before - though the 'professor' was probably the most interesting character in the entire movie) who lets him know it's some old ancient god that of course doesn't exist, and how it is some initiation.. meanwhile in every video one person from each family isn't present - an overly-obvious foreshadowing of who committed the actual crimes (the children themselves) ..now of course when he watched the video it released the spirit of this demon god whatever, the movie then just shows an hour straight of them having random situations where the spirit of this ghost or of the kids interfere - randomly popping up giving us a little startle but after the first 2 minutes of this it becomes obvious what is going to happen next in just about every scene.. When they finally let the story play out of course it gets to be too much and they all run back to their old home town - and conveniently as soon as they get there they discover that every family who has been killed, lived at the house of a previous murder - this part is I guess a ""unique twist"" but now what you knew was going to happen is confirmed, the youngest daughter kills the family then gets sucked into the movie reel which gets left in a box for the next family to find..<br/><br/>One of the things that really 'scare me' about scary movies is when it is something that could happen to any one in any situation - I left this movie knowing no one had ever been murdered in my house, and with no fear of ever running across this random demon in my real life, I didn't take the movie with me, which is usually when the scariness factor of a movie really kicks in. Although the story itself was semi-unique in the overall premise, the elements within it were recycled and way too common, making it very predictable. Between this and the errors in continuity I could never really get drawn into it for more than a few minutes, and any sense of fear that existed from the film, stayed in the theater with it."

"StevePulaski","8","5","6","20 February 2013"," It's all in the details for both us and Ellison
","Research and questioning are two of the most powerful activities a human being can partake in. Absorbing yourself in a story or a crime case is something that is just as powerful, as well. During the time of the tragic Aurora, Colorado theater shooting and the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting that absolutely tore the United States apart as a whole, you couldn't pry my fingers away from the keyboard or my face from the monitor. I never saw myself so in-tuned , captivated, disgusted, and riveted by a news story in all my life.<br/><br/>Thankfully, I never experience an obsession with a case or past events like the one our lead character Ellison Oswalt (Ethan Hawke) in Sinister immerses himself into. He is a consumed crime author, who wrote a successful book some years ago, and decides to leave his old home behind and take his wife Tracy (Juliet Rylance) and their two children Ashley (Clare Foley) and Trevor (Michael Hall D'Addario) to live in an old, spacious home that was once the site of an unexplainable crime scene. The only one who knows this is Ellison, who is warned upon his arrival by the town deputy (James Ransone) that living here isn't smart, but he is so involved with his career as an author he doesn't listen.<br/><br/>Ellison begins to find old Super 8 films in the attic of the home, discovering that they're snuff films depicting various grisly murders and usually titled by an ambiguous event and date (""Sleep Time '98"" is the name of one). His minor fascination turns wholly consuming, as he locks himself in his study, playing the films on a rickety old projector, desperately trying to uncover the mystery of the house. During this time, his children begin exhibiting the strangest of behaviors and his wife's tolerance and silence to his reclusive nature becomes unrelenting and maddening on her part.<br/><br/>Sinister opens on the precise foot, creepy, unnerving, and yes, terrifying. It shows Super 8 footage of four people, all standing below a tree, with nooses around their neck and hoods covering their faces before something cuts off one of the tree's limbs, which acts as a counterweight, successfully hanging all four of the characters. This is a wrenching scene that perfectly sets the tone for the film we're about to see.<br/><br/>There's a surprising sophistication to the material in Sinister, which makes it the most surprising horror effort of last year. For a mainstream release, it's stunningly atmospheric and almost poetry stemming from Gothic roots. I can only compare it, recently, to The Woman in Black, a film attempting to replicate the style and potency that is found in Hammer Horror films. At the center of that film was Harry Potter's Daniel Radcliffe, doing one of his first solo, grown-up roles after years of being the subject of a lucrative franchise. Sinister throws Ethan Hawke in a wonderfully subtle performance, providing depth and massive conflict to his character as a whole.<br/><br/>The thing about Sinister is, by horror film standards, it does much more than we expect it to, and for that matter, does it all to a certain level of efficiency and craft. It abandons much of the ""jump-scare"" cliché, and uses it cautiously and with great effect, it focuses on characters, disciplined and rational, it shows Ellison's descent into obsession effectively and realistically, relies on setting, sound, and tone to invoke fear in its audience, and pulls out an engaging story to tie everything back together.<br/><br/>The film's best scene comes shortly after the hour mark and involves Ellison and Tracy angrily spitting words with venom and hate back and forth, Ellison saying how his book, while potentially sacrificing his family's safety, will buoy them financially, and Tracy saying how he has become such an unrecognizable man being buried and eaten alive by his work. This gives a good ethics debate for the average audience member, who is usually sitting frozen or bored, yet likewise, waiting for something to happen; is it okay to sacrifice personal welfare for potential financial security or live a cautious life with no security? Finally, one detail I forgot to mention was the use of sound in Sinister, not just from the abrupt scares or the sudden ""pangs"" in the night, but the click of the Super 8 film, the whirring of the projector, the snapping of the film, and the crackling static of the sound quality. This is a more stylistically alive film, in terms of classic detail, than the latter Paranormal Activity series.<br/><br/>Starring: Ethan Hawke, Juliet Rylance, Fred Thompson, James Ransone, Clare Foley, and Michael Hall D'Addario. Directed by: Scott Derrickson."

","Sinister is a 2012 horror film directed and co-written by Scott Derikson.

A lot of people didn't like this film because of the ending but i felt that the ending was perfect,I love a horror film that is not afraid to end on an unexpected note of terror.If you like slow-burn horror films that are interesting and scary see this flick.

","I'm a horror movie junkie. I stopped be scared of them when the ridiculousness of them was blatantly on screen. However, this movie actually terrified me, something which hasn't happened since ""The Ring."" <br/><br/>What's funny is that, while I was watching it, the movie didn't scare me. In fact, my friend and I were laughing about it in the parking lot afterwords. But it slowly started set in around midnight. It's a disturbing film, which you don't even realize until the credits have rolled and you're at home. <br/><br/>Plus, I *love* the music in it. It sounds very inspired by Akira Yamaoka's work (who did the music for the Silent Hill games). It's that dark, disturbing and sinister-type music that are really more sounds than actual music, but enough to make your heart jump. Horror movie fans, you'll love this film."

The story eerily unfolds and before you know it, you're reeled into a world you can't escape from. What ensues is a plunge into the deepest, darkest depths of hell.

","I saw this last night at the theatre. It's the scariest, most tense horror film I have seen on the big screen since I saw Candyman 20 years ago and it's probably the scariest film I have seen since I saw The Ring, on DVD, about 10 years ago.<br/><br/>Sinister's clever use of sound and its creepy music score, a-la Candyman, is its biggest asset. I say an Oscar is deserved for Christopher Young who has outdone himself with sublime arrangements which bring depth and real terror alongside the visuals.<br/><br/>By instilling fear from the outset and implying a dreadful fate to the protagonist (which the viewer is hoping can be avoided but ultimately knows is lurking at the end), Sinister takes its influence from The Ring and keeps the tension building throughout the movie. It becomes almost unbearable in places! Whilst it doesn't really avoid the standard horror clichés of the last decade, Sinister manages to retain just enough credibility to keep the fear simmering in the audience. <br/><br/>The film is not without its flaws though. You might find yourself shaking your head on the odd occasion and the story, whilst decent and played out with good tempo, treads the fine line between supernatural and reality and, in my opinion, gets it slightly wrong but it's not really enough to spoil the result.<br/><br/>My adrenaline levels, after watching this, kept me from sleeping for another 3 hours, so be warned.

","This movie exceeded my expectations on all levels. It seemed as if the way the movie was engineered was with the sole purpose of messing with the human mind. From the unnerving soundtracks to the disturbing graphical effects, this movie is fully equipped to shock you on every level. My brother and I have both seen our fair share of horror flicks, but never before have either one of us been so disturbed by a scary movie in our lives. Only a couple of components took away from the overall reality of the movie. Having previous experience in the forestry business, I know from experience that a branch the size of the one depicted in the hanging scene would not be capable of pulling a single full grown man off of the ground, no less an entire family of victims. Also he appeared to be unaware of the presence and the ability to turn on lights in his household. Overall, however, the best horror movie I have ever seen."

","***SPOILERS***<br/><br/>I'm mortified that this movie has the overall rating it does. I'll try to keep it clean and simple:<br/><br/>Blair Witch effect: the majority of this movie is in darkness or dimly lit rooms, to the point where it surpasses suspense and atmosphere and simply leaves you watching what is essentially a black screen for the entire duration.<br/><br/>Accents: The mother, Tracey, plays the token, somewhat well-spoken London accent character and in real life this is actually the case however for some bizarre reason her accent in this movie comes across as though it's been tainted with American. The result is oddly pronounced English that you can't get comfortable with. Ultimately it's difficult to take any line she gives without simply focusing on figuring out her accent and over- pronunciation of words as commonly seen in American movies where a British character is used. Very distracting and awkward.<br/><br/>Noises: numerous scenes in the movie contain a strange clicking sound supposedly made by the same equipment being used for showing the home movies in the film. This noise bears no relevance to the scenes and doesn't at all fit with the atmosphere of it and so is annoying to listen to, why on earth was it used?<br/><br/>Repetition: the core hanging scene shown in the film is showed quite literally again and again and again throughout the movie with no real reason for doing so. Not necessary, and quite frankly appeared to be a way to waste more film time.<br/><br/>Cheap tactics: because the film itself lacked anything to actually be scared of, it relied heavily on cheap scare tactics (think as basic as you like, faces jumping out at the screen, falling silent before a big shock) to actually be called a ""horror"". The ending- extremely predictable. This film reminds me of a ghost ride at a funfair.<br/><br/>Repetition: as well as the continuous darkness throughout the film, I'd say a good 90% of it (no exaggeration, you have my word) is Ethan Hawke walking around the house with a torch, pulling the same face. There is no content and interesting devices to move the story along.<br/><br/>The ghost children: it looked like kids do when they're in a school play and have faint paint on and white sheets. Pulling the dull emotionless face that filmmakers seem to think is scary the entire time. <br/><br/>Rating: 1 star. The one star comes from the filmmakers successfully managing to leave out one of the ghost children saying ""wanna play?"". For this I applaud them. One thing this film did right. A genuinely awful, awful film and one I do not for one second recommend to anyone. Spend your time more wisely, there are better-made films out there that you could be giving your time and effort to."

","This review contains spoilers. <br/><br/>Sinister is one of the best modern horror films I have come across. And like Paranormal Activity and Insidious before it, Sinister is an extremely creepy and spooky horror film. I have seen hundreds of horror films and I very rarely get unnerved by them, (mainly because they are clichéd or remakes), but Sinister was something different. <br/><br/>The story follows Ellison Oswalt (Ethan Hawke), a true crime novelist, who has just moved homes with his family, to begin work on his new book about a missing child and her murdered family. He soon finds super 8 film stored in his attic and upon playing the found footage he reveals several gruesome murders. After watching the footage, Ellison starts to experience strange things happening in his new home. But unknown to the rest of Ellison's family, his new home is where one gruesome murders occurred.<br/><br/>This is not your typical clichéd horror film, from the very start of the film, there is an eerie atmosphere and and uneasy feeling, which only grows as the film plays out. The scare scenes are incredibly tense and unpredictable. The acting is amazing especially from Ethan Hawke, and the characters are portrayed brilliantly. It has a nice steady pace to it, as the story and characters are set up, until the scares begin. <br/><br/>Sinister is definitely my horror film of the year, it has a great script, an amazing cast, unique and unpredictable scares, and a gruesome ending. For horror fans this is a must see."

","After seeing this I felt I had to review this as it was not what I was expecting at all.<br/><br/>Firstly the films lighting. There is a time and place for darkness but in the case of this film even at breakfast the lighting was poor, maybe the budget went elsewhere. Now in a time when directors and producers use their wit and imagination to draw you in throw a few twists and then surprise you at the end as in many horrors these days, this one didn't. It relied on poor old techniques to make people jump for a brief second before spending the next five minutes boring you with predictable behaviours of the characters only to do the same poor old technique to make someone jump again. As I sat in a packed cinema one thing became apparent the need for many to begin their own conversations as obviously they were finding this as predictable as myself. This under the right direction could have been good maybe even very good, but it simply wasn't and I think 3/10 is being quite generous."

","I have to admit being a little skeptical about a new Hollywood horror that was yet again supposed to be the best horror movie in a long time.<br/><br/>Well a family moves into a house where something horrible had taken place in the past. The first thing that came to my mind was that how unoriginal that whole idea was. It's been reused several times before, and not even several, plenty of times to be exact. It's like re-inventing Amityville horror of the 70's with ideas from newer films, such as The Ring and The Grudge and yes there's super 8 film this time, not VHS, that's just the obvious difference. It seems like that it's exact same tired film made again with slightly different setting.<br/><br/>Jump scares. Yes, plenty. Frightening sounds. Yes, i'd have been jumping on my seat if i had seen this in a cinema. Visually the film isn't that scary.<br/><br/>So what's new this time. Absolutely nothing, even the ending is easily guessed because there we have some expert telling the whole mystery out loud in the middle of the film, 45 minutes in advance. Yes everything is chewed and ready so that the audience wouldn't need to think too much.<br/><br/>I'd never liked supernatural elements in a movie and this movie made no difference. In overall it's a very boring film that just seems pointless with plain characters that aren't likable. I didn't care much what'd happen to them. That's a kind of a problem.<br/><br/>Technically the film is perfect but is that enough to make a good and enjoyable film if its story is so tired already? I can recommend this film to those who aren't familiar with horror genre in general and its clichés and story lines. For anyone else it's just tiring experience."

","One of the scariest horror movies I have seen in a long time. I put off watching this one for a quite a while because when I first started it I noticed it had dim lighting which is a pet peeve of mine. Once I decided to watch it at a later date however, I realized that the cinematographer actually made very effective use of light/dark contrasts, highlighting what we need to see and using the dark spaces to create a cloistering atmosphere of dread and claustrophobia. The performances are also very good, especially the lead, although I feel as though they could have given us more background on the rest of the family. Also the ending isn't what I expected at all and I feel there could have been more action but it did fit in with the rest of this movie which can be quite slow at times, but you hardly notice because of the way this film draws you into it's world. The super 8 sequences were terrifying, they had me on the edge of my seat. In my opinion Sinister is probably one of the best horror films of this decade."

","This was a stupid movie and not worth watching. It had two spooky moments. One with his son in the box and one with the kids ""following"" him around. Other than that all he did throughout this movie was drink alcohol and watch these mysterious home movies (which he should have given to the police as evidence, after making copies, of course-and then try to find out where they came from and who was doing the filming), He also walked around his dark house with a baseball bat--the first time, okay electricity was out, but the next few times they weren't. When I hear a noise in another room, I generally turn on the lights so I can see what might have made the sound.<br/><br/>He didn't do any hands on research he had a deputy and a professor do the work and frankly, it seemed like what they found was only mentioned in passing--and to me it should have been more of a revelation--perhaps if he had done the research himself it would have been.<br/><br/>It was also strange that his laptop images showed him being filmed and hands all around him but he just showed fear when seeing it--which is okay--but wouldn't puzzlement have been there too? Shouldn't he have questioned it as well as some of the other things going on. I know I would want to dig into what I saw and have someone else to show this stuff to. At least they could have made the show a bit more logical.<br/><br/>Finally the ending was rushed. He had burned the movies and they show up in his home again with more film--the endings. A normal person would have freaked out but he calmly put the pieces together so he could watch them. It should have showed a possession of some kind taking place. There also could have been a mad dash to prevent the outcome--something to put the audience on the edge of their seats--but unfortunately it didn't.<br/><br/>Again this was a dumb movie.

","I was fortunate enough to see the prescreening of this movie and I have to underline the intensity of the pure horror in it.I actually was skeptical to see this movie due to the overrated trailer. Honestly the trailer is giving just a tad bit of what the movie is all about. I will do my best not to spoil this movie in my review. I trembled throughout the movie with the plot and cinematography used to pull of this movie. The character and the plot development have been elaborately handled and nothing has been blown out of the proportion. Aside from the scene where the kid is getting outside the box everything was scary in it. The idea that crime novelist dad find boxes of murder tapes and his trying to see what those murders are all about and his connecting those scenes to each other in the cinematographic aspect is well done and well maintained. Ethan Hawke's plausibility is a great contribution along with the other cast. I did not see any character who did not fit to the cast at all. Everyone in the movie was very close to the reality which made this movie quite outstanding. The characters are nothing but perfect. Ethan Hawke features a crime novelist who moves in a new house with his family. His finding a box of 8 mm tapes on which gruesome murders took place drags the audience to the depth of the real horror. The camera-work and the quality of the shooting technique build up to the intensity to make this movie scary enough. The gruesome murders on the tapes are split into two parts so nothing is shown at once which makes the audience wait for the second batch of the murders which are quite disturbing. The taped murder scenes are quite disturbing and I totally understand the reason why the rating is quite comprehensive with warnings/ The imagery used in the movie is also very scary and it adds up. The audience understands what is really going on with logical sequence order. I can clearly state that Sinister is the scariest movie among all the movies i have byfar laid eyes on. I would have hard time deciding which one tops when compared to Exorcist of Blattey's. I was pretty pessimistic with the scary movies lately but Sinister has been upto par. If you want to watch a real scary movie and feel the intensity of a real horror movie go see this movie!! There were also some incompetencies throughout. The entire movie cast is around 5 people excluding the killer missing kids with terrible make up. His not letting the Police department know what happened there at the house was off. The deputy's hesitant behavior was very odd and made me feel like he was involved with the murders but he wasn't. The biggest failure of the director was during the interview of the novelist's interview regarding one of his books named Kentucky Blood on TV he said he would prefer not writing any novels if he could find the justice for the murdered ones but a couple sequence later he makes a debate with his wife and tries to convince her that he has to write the book to make more money like making a movie project out of the story he was about to pen. That was a great inconsistency"

","The trailer for this movie was more scary than the movie itself, hich was disappointing. Maybe I saw way too many horror movies to the point I am unfazed by them...Which would be sad. But this movie just wasn't all that scary, in fact the scare factor is pretty low. It does have creepy and eerie vibe going for it with some clever dialogue at times. But this movie just seemed way to repetitive and too long. Yes, there was some gasps from the audience but some of them was whispering when this movie was going to end. So the plot is about a one hit wonder author that tries to get back into the limelight by dragging him and his family to a house where some brutal murders happened. And soon he finds some super 8 films that has titles on them. And each one has gristly murders, but there really isn't a coherent way it connects to the whole story. It's like watching a couple of snuff films but it doesn't seem to connect with the main story all that well. Thus it becomes less interesting and less clever. It has a decent idea going for it but it was just poorly executed without any real scares. The ending is also disappointing as well and doesn't bring anything new to the table for horror fans. Not a bad film but could have been better.<br/><br/>5.5/10"
"GTeixeira","7","5","7","12 June 2013"," Surprisingly good horror
","I went into this film knowing very little. The little description I had was that it was about a true-crime writer who, while investigating a family murder for his new book, finds a bunch of old homemade movies pointing at a bigger, serial-killer like plot. I expected another of the infamous 'lost footage' films, with the whole movie being just the homemade films (ie.: something akin to 'Cannibal Holocaust').<br/><br/>I was wrong. Pleasantly wrong.<br/><br/>'Sinister' is quite tense and moody, sometimes a bit too dark (I'm talking about the light here too, not just the mood), and with enough scary moments to make it work well. The plot is good and even intelligent, with the story tying up nicely any loose ends and transitioning from a seemingly 'serial-killer plot' to a supernatural horror very well; it's also without much nonsense, creating the horror feeling well without having to drag on. The cast (Ethan Hawke being the only one I recognize) is okay, but the movie doesn't really require much of them.<br/><br/>The movie is not without its faults, though. There is something akin to a 'plot twist', but one that introduces an element that has been used too much in recent horror (see: Ringu, Kairo, their American remakes and rip-offs) to be considered original; very predictable, even. There is a fair share of clichés, from the characters downgraded intellect in key or even common situations (when the police officer comes to the house for the first time, for example), to cheap scare scenes that serve no other purpose (the many times Hawke walks through his house in the dark of the night). <br/><br/>All in all, a good horror movie. Not going to be a classic, but stands out among the horde of crappy/idiotic horrors from the past few years, and should give anyone watching a good time."
"ibrankovic80","6","5","7","26 February 2013"," Starts off superbly - loses its momentum half way
","Let me just make it immediately clear that I am not recommending horror aficionados to give the movie a pass. There are some pretty good elements here. The first half of the movie gave me quite a formidable scare. As you delve into the riddle that Ethan Hawke's character is trying to figure out, the story-line appears remarkably promising in my opinion. I was so nerve-wrecked by what I was seeing and hearing that I started doubting whether I would have enough pluck to go down to the basement later that evening to get my laundry out of the washer. I think the most important components that make this part of the movie work so well are great 'camera', surprisingly original (and at moments truly terrifying) sound production, and a great approach in presenting the negative character - very cryptic, shrouded in mystery, with only a few (bone chilling) glimpses being revealed.<br/><br/>What then follows is your realisation that you can already sort-of infer which way the story is going to go for this family. What remains hard to predict is whether they are all going to be saved or all die a terrible death. By the movie's middle part, the main character divulges a piece of information which made the rest of the movie simply too predictable. Intelligent horror movies preserve this type of mystery for the very end. That detail on the murder pattern will, to the movie's further detriment, turn out to be even more ill-conceived due to the fact that it simply has no rationale from a killer's perspective. So the family moves away, SO WHAT? There is no explanation why that aggravates the pagan creature. Plus, the main character basically has this same realisation half through the movie, so why on earth is he shocked at the end when the policeman calls him up to tell him that? Another detail that irked me so profoundly: the stereotype-academic expert character, with his spot-on, yet unconvincing, information about the creature.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, I had a good shake (initially), and I enjoyed the ""snuff"" home videos."

After moving into his new home, he discovers a box of old home movies that depict previous families who lived in the house, as well as their murders. As Ellison looks further into the mystery behind the tapes, he discovers that the murders all have ties to a supernatural entity known only as ""Bagul"". Bagul exists in images of himself and runs the risk of making Ellison's family the latest casualty of the house.<br/><br/>Director Scott Derrickson cleverly used a variety of different camera angles on several key occasions in the film to express the fear and shock of the victims, and the use of sound to depict this was done in a horrifying way. As in many films, actors were used to portray the characters. Ethan Hawke, Juliet Rylance and Clare Foley acted out the most prominent characters in the film. The camera was operated by George Bianchini, in his usual unpredictable manner. Overall I thought the film will pretty much do what it wants to do: make plenty of money. And if people get entertained in the mean time, all the power to them. I thought it was one of the scariest films I had seen this year, and I like being scared so for me this was good."
"ironhorse_iv","6","7","11","25 August 2014"," Once you see this movie, nothing can save you from asking yourself. What the hell did I watch?
","Sinister is one of those horror movies that some people think is bringing something new to the table of horror movie, but for me, it's just another modern horror movie that looks exactly the same like the others. I have the same feeling to this, as I did with 2010's Insidious or 2013's the Conjuring. I wouldn't hate you, if you really like the movie, but for me, this movie was just another movie, full of the same old tired clichés of red herrings and jump scares. I've waded through enough, truly terrible movies, to know, that this movie is far from the worst, but it's nothing new. I was really looking forward to a horror movie with some depth to it, like 1973's Exorcist & 1990's Jacob Ladder. Sadly, I didn't feel, I got it here. For a haunted house movie, it's no 1980's Shining. The movie really use a lot of old cheap desperate tricks for scares such as creaky floorboards, sudden loud sound effects, and old snuff like footage. Directed by Scott Derrickson, and co-written by ex-film critic, C. Robert Cargill, of spill dot com fame. The movie is about Ellison Oswalt (Ethan Hawke) whom, is true-crime writer that can't get a break. Desperate for inspiration and his next big hit, he decides to move his family into a house once own by the victims of a recent murder. Wanting to write about it, he digs clues in the house, only to find out that a strange being is still around, and haunting his family and himself. The antagonist is pretty freaky-looking and the back story is cool enough. Still, it's hard to believe that an ancient pagan Babylonian deity named Bughuul AKA Mr. Boogie (Nick King), would be in rural Pennsylvania wearing a suit and tie. It's like having Hades in Iowa wearing a white tuxedo. It doesn't make sense. The villain kinda made me laugh, cause how similar, he looks like, to heavy metal band Slipknot member Mick Thomson in his mask. In no way, can I see this guy, passing as an evil Babylonian deity. Also, why on earth, would Mr. Boogie have the kicks to allow children to make snuff films with Super-8 film, anyways? Does he keep a projector in the spiritual realm? I can understand, the way he makes them label the ""Home Videos"" with ironic titles, due to the variety and creativity of the murders. Hinting at least a touch of sheer sadism and possibly to goad potential victims to watch the movies and unknowingly summon him. Still, he lives in pictures. Wouldn't he use more modern technology to get his message out, more, you know like a DVD or internet or something more modern? Honestly, how many homes, still have projector? He probably be starving himself, by now, if it was the real world. The movie does try to go the uneasy voyeur feel of watching realistic looking 8MM snuff film movie, but for this film, it doesn't look right. The murders shown on tape are not explicitly graphic enough to be taken as a Rated R film. For a low-resolution, shaky Super-8 home videos from decades ago, these film are too edited. It is way too edited, even for the plot to say so. I know the film wants you to think, it's edited, by showing Ellison editing film footage by hand, and for a later plot-twist, but the Super 8 film is just way too clean. It's not like today, film. There are things; you can't do with Super 8 with burning it up, or becoming too chopped. The movie tries really hard to get that 2002's Ring, feel, but it doesn't nail it right. Its stupid gimmicks like these, that make the movie feel unrealistic, and lose its scary tone. The cast are nothing special. I'm not exactly rooting for any of them. The kids are alright, acting wise, but have way too much screen time. The whole hide and go seek series of scenes were just cheesy and go way too long. The death make up was horrible. The pacing is bit long for my taste. There are a lot of music-montages, although I quite enjoyed them, but could be cut a bit. After about half an hour, the film has a great sense of foreboding dread. It continues to carry the doom unto the credits. The film is mostly shot in the dark. I can understand that's a great use for a horror movie, but come on– there are no reason for the majority of the movie, to look that way. If you can't make daylight look scary, than you can't make horror films, very well. Another problem is the exposition. Yes, it's a horror movie, and you don't need to explain everything. Still, the son night terrors are one of the ambiguities - is he having night terrors because of Bughuul, or is it just a coincidence? It felt like lazy writing, not to explain it. He just randomly show up when they need a red herring. I wouldn't recommended watching the trailer for this film. Pretty much, every scary part of the movie is shown in the trailer. Even, the DVD cover even spoils the movie. The movie has a sequel in the works as of this writing, but I don't know, how they will follow it up with something new or flesh. Overall: The movie was alright, but it wasn't what I can call amazing. Demonstration wise, it's still one of the better horror film in recent memory."

","I rented this movie after being recommended. Unfortunately I did not enjoy this movie in the slightest. <br/><br/>The movie lacked suspense and was very predictable. Character development was overlooked, the characters relationships were unrealistic and after 15 minutes I was left not caring about their well being. The child actors were terrible and the wife's accent was distracting and not explained.<br/><br/>The attempted horror elements were cheap and boring. The shocks and pop ups of the villain/villains, accompanied by a bland score, were obvious and unsatisfactory. Plot points introduced through were not finalized. <br/><br/>Overall the structure and delivery of ""Sinister"" is horrific and not the way intended by producers. This movie isn't even worth watching for laugh factor."
"jt_jacobi","1","21","43","7 March 2013"," Nu-Metal garbage
","Love horror films? Been disenchanted with every horror movie that has been released in the last fifteen years or so (with the exception of REC, The Descent, Haute Tension, Martyrs, etc)? Don't bother with this tripe. It's awful, beyond the point of being laughable. You would have a better time watching 3 hours of Slipknot videos. <br/><br/>Aside from containing every possible modern horror movie cliché, the main problem with the film (aside from some pretty gaping plot holes) is that it's astoundingly boring. At two hours long, this barf parade absolutely overstays its welcome. It's decently shot, decently acted, whatever -- but the film gives us absolutely no reason to care about drunk Ethan Hawke or his family. He watches some people die on Super 8 film, drinks scotch, and that's about it. Every thirty minutes we see Baghull the Demon who is Real Bad News (or something). <br/><br/>Nothing you see in this movie matters. There's not even a single jump scare in here. This is coming from a guy who gets spooked real easily. Really, this movie plays out like a 2 hour long Disturbed video. It even features ""creepy kids"" -- wow, that really hasn't been done in a horror movie in the last two decades! Children are so scary because they are like totally innocent otherwise, or something. <br/><br/>Other scary bits includes Ethan Hawke's children drawing on the walls and a dude in corpse paint showing up in the bushes in some photographs or whatever. God, what a stupid movie. <br/><br/>This movie is utter trash. I could go into detail but it's not even worth it. Don't waste your time. It's almost impossible to imagine how this film could be any worse. And I thought Insidious was bad. Boy howdy."

","I have never felt the need to share my views on IMDb before today but I have just come out of a screening of Sinister and am so angry that I have had to write this to calm down... What utter dross this movie was. From start to finish it was the most unimaginative, badly directed, uninspired trash have seen in a long time.<br/><br/>It's like someone has taken pieces from a 'make your own horror movie' kit and pasted them together until they all seemed to fit together and then presented the finished result as an original piece of work. Truly lazy and untalented movie making.<br/><br/>As far as the acting goes, Ethan Hawke coasts his way through his performance but the other actors are just not good.. <br/><br/>If this film had been cheesy or had any flair or originality of style applied to it, I think it would have not been so bad, but the prosaic style of direction left it feeling like a soulless, cut and paste money making exercise. <br/><br/>Don't waste your time... Maybe Sinister II will be better..."
"robleetham","8","7","12","6 October 2012"," If you found footage on Super 8 in your attic would you play it?...
","Exposition, it's important and Sinister gets to it right from the off. I mention this because if Saw or Hostel are your bag then maybe this one won't suit, but if you like a good thriller with added chills then you're at the right movie.<br/><br/>Established but hasn't had a hit for a while author Ellison Oswalt (Ethan Hawke) is moving his family to a new home to research a true crime case that he hopes will get him back on the best sellers list. A disturbing series of murders linked to the house provide the backdrop for the research but things take a supernatural turn when a mysterious box of Super 8 found footage is discovered in the loft<br/><br/>Appearing in the images is a figure which with further investigation with the help of a University professor is identified as Bughuul and things here take a turn for the occult. Curiosity drives Ellison further into this angle of the investigation to the point of obsession as he tries to find out what happened to the previous occupants of the house but the deeper he delves it becomes all too apparent that some things should be left well alone and the proverbial cat is in mortal danger.<br/><br/>The mood of the film is incredibly tense with more than one nod to Kubrick's Shining. It's a slow burner with the viewer being taken along for the ride with the knowledge that the brakes are shot here and the ledge is fast approaching but, like Ellison you really want to know the answers even though all logic suggests leave it alone now.<br/><br/>It's a credit to the Scott Derrickson that the characters are fleshed out and we can empathise with them even in the circumstances that prevail. So often in horrors this is not the case and it can be hard to care about people you know nothing about when they are in peril merely for effect.<br/><br/>Ethan Hawke does a great job of conveying the author desperate for all the trappings of success for a second time around and (you can't help but think if he could just settle for a teaching gig somewhere his life would be less hazardous) but he is driven and ambitious and downright stubborn, ambition and integrity now giving way to greed and recognition. His wife Tracy (Juliet Rylance) has pretty much had enough of chasing the dream too but is ever supportive and a bloody heavy sleeper considering the things that go bang in the night in the house. A dark and warped soundtrack by Christopher Young adds to the horror as it unfolds and the performances solidify the tension, especially from the younger members of the cast. There are a few jump out of your seat moments and also more subtle, uncomfortable viewings of the super 8 footage that put a horrendous spin on the found footage narrative where you can't help but watch for clues with Ellison as they sear off the screen.<br/><br/>In a perfect world the build up to the film could have been a little more secretive ideally, as trailer footage can unfortunately give the audience major deja vu when a couple of scenes are building to a big scare you'll have seen it already but there are plenty more where they came from.<br/><br/>All in all an effective and tense thriller that will have some of you sleeping with the lights on for a couple of nights and a new found fear of attic space!<br/><br/>More reviews at wherewolftherewolf.com"
"fogplaya","4","12","24","13 October 2012"," Not really that good to be honest.
","I went to see this in a limb, for some Saturday entertainment, true- I didn't have high expectations but I didn't have low ones either as I am an avid horror fan. The film itself was stereotypical unintelligent haphazard film making. To simplify I'll list some things I liked about it and the things I didn't:<br/><br/>LIKED: -The murder clips, albeit a redundant plot device, were stylistically malevolent and interesting. <br/><br/>-Funny relief moments were entertaining. <br/><br/>-Basically entertaining. <br/><br/>DISLIKED: -Acting was generally awful. Ethan Hawke is in no way talented. <br/><br/>-Overplayed horror devices; Pseudo-religious demon, possession, creepy children, demonic antagonist, and JUMP SCARES!!!<br/><br/>-Unimaginative and predictable, (I read some peoples reviews claiming it's original or intelligent; it's so unoriginal and lacklustre I'm frightened for for those reviewer's mental health) <br/><br/>-I know I'm reiterating previous points, but this was very unoriginal; A family moves into a house of a former murder and are plagued by ghosts etc.etc. etc., almost crackpot overly creative father whose nagging wife (-Another point: the wife; WTF was up with her?!?!) retards protagonists/male partners curiosity, the children are menacing/ at risk and are meant to have personality or ""sass"" to evoke sympathy but come across wrought and one dimensional, exterior knowledgeable characters who are also comic reliefs, (SPOILER) everyone dies/disappears at the end- allowing the antagonist to continue and molest another family ($$$ SEQUEL $$$), extensive investigation allowing audience to ""discover the story"" along with protagonist (Side note- its seems contrary that the horror industry ~and this movie's~ terror devices stem from dramatic irony- the audience knows that the boogeyman's behind the hero, but the hero doesn't- though their plots all revolve around an ersatz mystery where the protagonists discover the ominous along with the audience, which directly paradoxes the tension and terror created by the plot, this is probably the result of the late 1990s mystery and ""intelligent"" horror movies that tried to appear smart by having an intricate back story, and although I'm just a modest cinema goer and not a big shot Hollywood directer it would seem more resilient if the characters were in a n almost familiar situation amplified not by supernatural means but my logical reasons to a dramatic degree)and the stupid final scare before the credits. The film was also extremely reminiscent of David Fincher's Girl with the Dragon Tattoo- male discredited writer seeking former glory (ETHAN HAWKE'S OUTFIT AND MANNERISMS WERE ALMOST EXACTLY LIKE DANIAL CRAIG'S) and even the cinematography and THE SCORE was like GwtDT's but cheaply bastardised for the lowest common denomination (seriously, watch that film I'm not even being paranoid).<br/><br/>-Awful lighting. Even for a horror movie. <br/><br/>-The English wife. Why .... what... I don't even know ... The children were clearly American so if she were to take them home to her sister's it had to be in America so was her sister English and if so why were they both in America? And if so why did she still have that clunky English accent (that sounded appalling with the Americanized dialogue) you'd think that the producers would at least ask her to fake an American accent but no, they thought it would be fine that she sounds English or some kind of Australian. (That point actually annoys me more than it should) <br/><br/>-Final plot twist was lazy, stupid, and really abrupt. Almost like the (and I loosely use the term) writers couldn't be bothered to finish the story. <br/><br/>-Passable dialogue. <br/><br/>-Unscary. <br/><br/>-Uneven pace with poor payoff. <br/><br/>-A man who let's his daughter draw all over the walls like a crude caveman is doomed anyway. Maybe if he'd been more strict with her she'd never have been possessed or persuaded or what ever the hell made that b*tch hack her family up. <br/><br/>To conclude: it was poor. But it's not implausible to me that people should like it; as a casual movie goer its easy to like and perhaps it's just because a deeply cynical human being that I dislike it and can see so numerous and blatant flaws. So, if other recent mainstream horrors like Insidious and Paranormal Activity entertain you, this film will terrify, excite, amuse and provoke you, or, if you're a world-wearied long time horror fan whose become so desensitised to modern cinematic conventions like me, you'll be rolling your eyes, muttering under your breath and massaging your forehead at the state of modern cinema."

","Sinister is a horror movie with a great concept as an author is writing a book about a murder that happened in the house he now lives in. The movie isn't as scary as people make it seem. yes there is a scary so called serial killer named Mr. boogie, also the music to go along with this film is kind of freaky. but if your looking for a movie that makes you have nightmare and jump out of your seat this movie is not for you. the end of the movie is not what you expect as his daughter becomes part of this serial killer and kills everyone in this film just like the other missing children killed there family do to this cult killer names Mr. boogie. the whole movie you think he will finish the book well think again your about to lose your interest in this movie. so if your not a scary movie fan and you want to see a scary movie this movie is for you because i jumped once out of the whole 1 hour and 50 mins. also the movie has a good plot and good chemistry between the actors and the plot is amazing but the execution of this film needs a lot of improvement will not being seeing a sequel if its made because it's not for me but could be for you."

","When it comes to scary movies, the themes are usually divided into categories of kidnapping, serial-murders by obnoxious and cruel antagonist,and a series of accidental scenes. Surprisingly, ""Sinister"" has all of those and guides us into the epitome of the original horror film. <br/><br/>What I love about this movie is it is easy to grasp the story as it consists of a few characters and less intricate mystery to be solved. I often find myself not understanding the concept due to complexity of the origin of the cause in which a large number of people get involved in incoherent flashback that go back and forth.<br/><br/>The story starts with a reckless and fearless writer who is known for writing a suspense novel that cliché the title of New York times best-sellers move to the hunted house with his family in order to get references and ideas for his new novel. <br/><br/>Impressively, every character execute their roles, especially Ethan Hawke and Juliet Rylance, a married couple with two children, show natural and vivacious emotion with a clear tone. <br/><br/>The editing is neither overly done nor cluttered as I don't recall any disturbing moments. The intriguing part is how the director, Scott Derrickson tries to engage us using 8 mm film projector by showing how it can be used in both real and imaginative world. You will understand what I mean by watching the movie. <br/><br/>There are a lot of positive aspects that I want to mention, but I would rather not write them and let you experience the same feeling that arouses chunks of curiosity about the freaky and mysterious creature. You will not regret your decision for choosing to watch ""Sinister"" and be prepare to be petrified."
"sambio08","8","6","10","6 October 2012"," A well made creepy horror movie
","WARNING CONTAINS SPOILERS: Only read if you have seen the movie or if you don't really care about the film.<br/><br/>From the spooky makers of Paranormal Activity and Insidious comes Sinister. <br/><br/>This is the story of novelist Ellison Osborne and his family moving into a new home. While sorting and searching the house, Ellison discovers a box in the attic containing super 8 films which hold disturbing content which puts him and his family in danger of a paranormal entity. So yeah the plot is simple and easy and follow. As the movie goes on you'll soon be hooked into the story.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie I must say was well done. Ethan Hawke playing as the gritty novelist and parent was a good performance for a horror film, he's just a normal guy hoping to start again with the new book he will be writing and to keep his family happy. As he finds the films and watches them he becomes more disturbed, afraid and makes him frustrated. Once some of the weird events happen, you know why he continues the investigation of the murdered families because he isn't the stupid characters you get in horror movies who can just get the hell out of there as soon as possible. The rest of the family were good too. You get the worried, frustrated mother and wife, the two little kids who eventually start acting weird. There is also the paranormal expert who informs Ellison of the strange symbol in the super 8 films when the murders happened, the fanboy police officer who helps Ellison find out more about the murdered family cases. So the characters are well done in this movie and all have a purpose in the movie.<br/><br/>The music. Something about the music in this move disturbs me. It's dark, gritty, suspenseful and makes the film even better. <br/><br/>Not only the music disturbed me but some of the scenes in this movie creeped me out. The scene where Ellison is walking through the hall to see a cardboard box in a room, at the end of the hall. Once he is close the box opens and his son is in it, in this abnormal position and screams horrifically, I knew it was coming but it was so loud and disturbing it's something I will never forget. Also some of the super 8 film footage in the movie disturbed me. It had a sense of realism as if it really happened. The family getting hanged, the family drowning, the family getting throat sliced and the worst of all, the lawnmower. The lawnmower made me jump big time, only because of the scream as the family is shredded by it. It was so loud it hurt my ears a bit. There are a few more scenes which will scare you but I've said enough.<br/><br/>I found the jump scares in the movie to be a little predictable but that's a minor nitpick.<br/><br/>Also the demon in this movie, Bagul looks like Death from Darksider's 2 and Mick Thompson, the guitarist from the band Slipknot. So I found it a little hard to take him seriously but he is still a creepy entity.<br/><br/>So yeah I thought the movie was pretty good. If you are into movies with great suspense, jump scares, scary demons and interesting characters you might just enjoy this flick. Originally I give it a 4/5"

I love this genre, and I can even look past a movies flaws if the majority of it was good. The theater wasn't very packed at all, but even then I could hear some of the other people moaning and groaning after one of the ""scary"" scenes.

The only thing that was done well were the creepy 8mm films that Hawke watches to research the murders. Seems all of the budget went toward a plot device, but not the film's actual plot or filming of the movie itself. I've never really cared for Ethan Hawke, so if you are not a fan either, definitely do not waste your time with this one.

","If, for the first hour, you suspend your disbelief, Sinister will be a very scary (if poorly written) horror movie. It has a passable story that's a little all over but all in all easy to ignore.<br/><br/>The only real thing one could commend Sinister on is the excellent focus on buildup and character development for the first hour of the film. The 'Found Footage' films are truly horrifying and a high-point of the movie.<br/><br/>However, when things start kicking off, the scares feel cheap and stupid and sometimes downright nonsensical. The bizarre explanation to the events of the film and of prior murders is poorly thought out and oddly specific.<br/><br/>SPOILER: For instance, the final murder we see ('House Painting'), we expect to follow the same path as the rest, where the suspect is never identified and the (youngest?) child is never seen again. However, if the suspect is never to be identified, how about she doesn't PAINT THE WALL IN BLOOD USING HER FINGER, LEAVING BLOODY FINGERPRINTS ALL OVER THE HOUSE?<br/><br/>The film ends with a cheap and predictable jump scare that involves Mr. Boogie's face jumping into shot. We must ask ourselves why he would get on both knees and lean into the shot (which was at ground level) just to scare us.

"K_Ripley","6","4","6","19 June 2013"," Great atmosphere, too much bad cgi...
","My mother taught me that looking great is important, but to seduce one should leave a little to the imagination. Scott Derrickson could learn a little something from my mother.<br/><br/>I will admit, the film is really, really creepy! What makes the movie horrifically entertaining is its atmosphere and sound effects/ambient score. The 8mm scenes are brilliant and are what give the movie style. The director is on the top of his game when he uses shadows and out-of-focus images of horrors I won't mention at the risk of spoiling the film . The story is also interesting, albeit reminiscent of Paranormal activity 3 and about a dozen other films I've seen. However, all of those strengths are deflated the moment the movie crew starts using second-rate CGI for extended periods of time, in clear focus. His creatures are only scary when we can't see them clearly.. when they're popping in and out of the shadows, hidden in the blurry images of photos, or when we see their reflection in a bit of something here or there. Casting monstrous villains in a bright spotlight strips them of their mystery, their creepiness, and their horror. Also, the longer we have to look at the creatures, the more obvious the film's budget. <br/><br/>The characters and dialogues were mostly stale, with few exceptions. I was rather bored with the stamp-like story completely revolving around a white guy and his pride, who is the master of the house and who makes all of the decisions for the family despite his wife's intuitive pleas and half- hearted ultimatums. Like that story hasn't been told before. How about some new family dynamics that aren't a throwback to the 50's and 60's? Also, some of the main character's reactions to different scenarios weren't entirely believable. <br/><br/>So: good job overall, but needs work on excessive, unnecessary use of bad cgi, and, well, a better writing/editing team, particularly with regards to character development."

","I wanted to like Sinister more than I did. It definitely works better as murder mystery / thriller. It wasn't scary and the trailer spoiled most of the jump scares. The ending was anti-climatic and left me unsatisfied. My biggest gripe though, the lights. Ellison starts off with lights in his office. He tosses the Home Movies box On a table and slaps pictures up on a board. A handful of lights illuminating his office. From then on, as the film progresses and the creepiness too, he makes a conscious Choice never to turn a light on. I understand the purpose from an atmospheric stance, but it felt unrealistic and too purposeful. Throw a light on here or there. It would be more realistic and still provide pockets of blackness in the background for something creepy to pop out. Even though nothing ever does."

","I usually don't write reviews but stick to reading all of them before watching a movie. I did the same for Sinister, and a 7.3 for me is good stuff. So I went to watch it yesterday and I realized it was my biggest mistake. I am usually not scared of horror movies but enjoy this stuff. There was not one scene that actually made me uncomfortable. Yes, if you would consider random outbursts of screen popping with a monster and heavy sounds as scary, you are a baby. The story wasn't special and Ethan Hawke's performance was amateur to say the least. The entire audience was laughing at his exaggerated scared face. Who would use a base ball bat to fight a paranormal being? I tried hard to sit through it, hoping something nice would pop up, but it was all in vain. I actually thought this would be better than Paranormal Activity 4 who's got just 4.4 and is not even released yet. But I'll honestly say I enjoyed the Paranormal series much more. At least they had instances that made me excited. Sinister is a waste of time and money and more of a comedy than a HORROR. It was easily the worst movie decision of my life. Go watch UP!"

Hawke desperately overplays his part with embarrassing outbursts of poorly timed, needless, intensity that detract away from his role.

And when the ghosts appear it looked a bit laughable too. Although that it had a few nice killings, sadly on 8mm. A true-crime writer Ellison Oswalt (Ethan Hawke) comes across some snuff 8mm. Je wants to know the truth behind it but it isn't what it looks, is it a serial killer or a ghost at work. <br/><br/>It never scared me or gave me any jump moments. Even when the films over and things are over you could guess what will happen next, never okay if you have that feeling.

"Tubular_Bell","3","10","22","22 October 2012"," This brings ""run of the mill"" to a new level.
","This movie is so by-the-numbers, it's painful to watch. And you know, I actually understand clichés, and I believe a good artists must primarily know how (and why) to follow rules, but this film is basically a checklist of rules and clichés followed by the letter. List all the horror film clichés you can remember off the top of your head, and they'll all be here.<br/><br/>I still can forgive that, though. It's okay to follow conventions when you actually have good material to deliver, and when the material is delivered skillfully. But this movie wastes every bit of potential it has. There are some fine ideas here; for some reason, I always found there was something creepy and unsettling about Super 8 films, and this movie has a tendency (a tendency!) to explore that -- both the imaginary possibilities, as well as the physical aspects (the grainy image, the sound of the projector, etc.). But at every opportunity, the interesting things are merrily exchanged for some of the most gratuitous and pointless jump scares, and some of the most obnoxiously loud scare chords. I honestly think it's time for movie directors to get a severe beating and learn to STOP USING SCARE CHORDS! Every scare chord you hear in your life is the director admitting he is TOO INCOMPETENT TO USE THE IMAGERY TO SCARE YOU. I mean, isn't cinema a visual art? Aren't the images supposed to creep you out? So why are the scare chords even there? Instead of sucking the audience into the movie, it kicks them out, it detracts from the feeling, it ruins the immersion; and the effect is gone just a few seconds later.<br/><br/>And this is a shame, because there is some good imagery here. The ""found footage"" films are well made, but they're spoiled by some bizarrely stupid and exploitative soundtrack music (was that REALLY necessary?). But there are some ""le artistique"" scenes here that are borderline hilarious -- definitely a director trying too hard there. Also, we have to deal with Ethan Hawke's obnoxious twitching and overacting, the unnecessary ""comic relief"" character (I could see the actor was being earnest in his delivery, but that character was stupid), and other ""checklist"" moments. And why, WHY, did they have to throw Boards of Canada in this? (okay, so as a fan of Boards of Canada, it was certainly thrilling to hear Gyroscope in a movie theatre, but come on! That was a very shallow choice)<br/><br/>I definitely can picture a GOOD version of this movie. And I get irritated with the reviews that say that ""despite the clichés, the film is good"". It's exactly that attitude that makes horror films so ridiculous: the rotten core of the horror industry is taken as a given, as an unavoidable fact. This is a shame. Instead of spending money in making those ""artistique"" effects, the director should have tried to thwart those clichés for a REAL shock."
"ghostsarescared","5","5","9","1 November 2012"," Insultingly Bad
","Judging by the trailer, I expected this movie to be right up my alley. What a disappointment. It wasn't intelligent, edgy, or disturbing. In fact, Sinister was so dumbed-down that I was pretty insulted by the time it was over. It became a very predictable rotation-Main character watches a film reel, hears a noise, walks around his pitch-black house, sees something creepy. We could predict the jumps like clockwork. My boyfriend called the entire plot about twenty minutes into the movie. The costumes and makeup were laughably bad, the 'possessed' children cliché, and the villain 'Mr. Boogie' (really?) looked like an emaciated member of KISS. The movie had many unnecessarily stylized sequences with no meaning, and it drove its point home to the point of torment. The. children. are. murdering. everyone. WE GET IT. The ONLY reason I am giving this movie any stars is because the music was fantastic, especially the use of Boards of Canada's 'Gyroscope' in the sequence where the moronic main character burns the film reels.<br/><br/>I really am baffled at the great reviews this movie got. I mean, yeah, if you are mentally incapacitated, I could see you being scared by this movie. I even saw a review that used the phrase 'deepy frightening'. DEEPLY FRIGHTENING?! If Sinister is deeply frightening then so is Casper the Friendly Ghost. Start thinking, people.<br/><br/>Also disappointed because the director was also behind Exorcism of Emily Rose and I loved that movie.<br/><br/>A complete waste of $20 and an evening."

Really added to the eeriness of the film. Secondly, the visuals were great.

It takes too long to get interesting and is obvious what is going to happen in the end. May I also say this has got one of the worst endings I have ever seen in a movie its just stupid. I like Ethan Hawke I think he is a good actor but that wont stop me from rating it a 1 out of 10 it might have got a 4 if it was not for that bad ending.

Ethan Hawke is very good in this role, better than usual. The whole thing is slick, even if it does hit some of the standard horror clichés from time to time. The story is interesting. It follows a true-crime writer, played by Ethan Hawke, as he finds found footage of murders and gets deep into the sinister world, pulling in his family.

"tetsuo7","4","4","7","24 November 2012"," Sinister not 'sinister' enough
","Let me start by saying I went into this film with high hopes. Hearing that it was from the producers of Paranormal Activity and Insidious I'm ashamed to say had me duped – but this is no Insidious. After watching it I looked up the Directors history and was shocked to see that this guy was behind the remake of The day the Earth stood still and The Exorcism of Emily Rose, how can you go from those films to this? <br/><br/>I also found out that Scott Derrickson only co-wrote Exorcism and did not write The Day the Earth stood still remake, which kind of shows. I don't want to be too harsh on the director and I will get to some positives. There's a certain rule of thumb with films like this- Its what you don't see that makes films like this scary. This film completely ignores that rule.<br/><br/>It all went wrong for me when the kid came out of the box. It was not scary and did not add anything to the plot. This followed by lots of build-ups to nothing (by the way there's nothing scary about a snake, or a dog for that matter and why was the dog even there) and then children wearing scary make-up and that God-awful shushing they kept doing – what the hell was that for by the way. The whole thing became quite tedious. <br/><br/>I later found out that the director was influenced by films like The Shining, 8mm, The Conversation and Manhunter. He should really go back and watch those films again because this was dreadful in comparison.<br/><br/>To his merit, it did have some scary moments but only as the story was building. I think it had potential, the concept was good and could have been really scary if handled right but to be honest it was ruined by all the usual clichés, an anti climactic ending and well, just too many poor decisions by the filmmakers.<br/><br/>There was no back story or explanation as to where this entity had come from or why he was there. I kept waiting to hear about how he had been conjured up by some cult or serial killer or something, but no. The Possession had more of an origin story than this and that film truly did stink.<br/><br/>The acting was good, I think Ethan Hawk was wasted in this movie. The cop's character development was all over the place. One minute he was a gormless bumbling idiot and the next some deep, profound thinker and the protagonist's right-hand man. <br/><br/>The soundtrack was good and set the tone throughout the first stages. It did create a false sense that I was in for something truly Sinister though, especially combined with the horrific murders on super 8 film, which increased my disappointment when all I got was a film that lacked any real depth or plot development.<br/><br/>So to round up - great potential, glad I didn't pay to watch it, felt annoyed when it finished, some scary moments ruined by not so scary ones and stupid ones. Found it more annoying towards the end - children in make-up shushing – not scary. The creature itself – at the end – ridiculous.<br/><br/>If the story and screenplay would have been more developed, could of been another Saw, Halloween, The Shining, Insidious, instead became another The Possession, The woman in black, in the same category as some of those other major let downs this year."

Do they not go shopping or talk to the neighbors in America? Or to the teachers, when she registered the kids at their new school? Or to the other parents, who would be curious to see a new face?<br/><br/>And let's face it, when you hear spooky things in the night, you don't creep around in the dark, you turn the lights on! When you hear sinister sounds from the attic, you don't grab a kitchen knife and investigate by the light of your i-phone!<br/><br/>When you think you may be hot on the heels of a serial killer and you see something in the garden, you don't wander off into the bushes in your PJs with a one-candlepower torch and a baseball bat!<br/><br/>When things start to turn demonic, you don't just tuck your daughter up in bed and leave the poor kid to sleep alone in pitch darkness!<br/><br/>And when you fall through the ceiling in the middle of the night (the result of wandering about in the attic by the light of your mobile phone) is it likely that everyone sleeps through it? In my house, we all wake up if the cat jumps off the kitchen cupboard!<br/><br/>In conclusion, although the film is quite creepy and has some shock moments, the wholly unrealistic way in which the characters behave failed to engage me.

It looked promising but then again they always do. Late in October I decided to view the film with a group of friends, my hopes not so high but it was something to keep me from ending the evening early.

"simon-harris20","8","4","7","8 November 2012"," Lawn Work With Mr. Boogie
","To appreciate a good horror film, you must watch a lot of bad ones. While the same is true of movies as a medium, it is particularly true of horror movies which can quickly become, at best unfrightening and predictable, and at worst parody or even comedy. I have watched a lot of horror films, and Sinister is as solid, frightening, disturbing and unsettling as the best the genre has to offer. Crime writer Ellison Oswalt (Hawke) scored a major hit a decade ago with his real life crime novel ""Kentucky Blood"". Unfortunately since that one best seller, more recent novels have not sold as well, and he has become a driven man searching for another best seller. He relocates his family, (wife Tracey and son and daughter Trevor and Ashley) to a small town in Pennsylvania to research and write his new novel, which he naturally hopes will revive his reputation and bank balance. He neglects to tell his family that he has actually moved them into the very property where the grisly murders he is researching took place. No sooner has Ellison and his family moved into the house, than the tension starts to build. We learn that Ellison is researching a murder where all of the family were murdered, and the youngest child abducted. Ellison finds a portable movie projector and some rolls of super 8 film in the attic, and the footage shows not only the murder he is currently researching in graphic detail, but a series of other grisly murders that stretch through a number of different states on both the west and east coasts dating back to the 1960's. He is both horrified and exhilarated by what he has found, as it suggests the pattern of a single minded and hitherto unnoticed serial killer, whose has been active since the 60's and who is clearly still active. His book could explode onto the best seller lists with this material, and he knows it. The pattern is always the same with the murder of all family members in truly horrific ways, with the exception the youngest child who is taken and never found. What Ellison establishes to ratchet up the tension very early on in the movie is that the killer must have returned to the house he and his family now occupy after the murders but before their arrival, and placed the box in the attic for the next incumbent to find. We know this because when the Police combed the house after the murders, the attic was photographed, and it was totally empty. As if the thought of a successful and elusive serial killer having the mindset to return to the scene of a crime and leave live footage of his murderous exploits is not enough unsettle even the most hardened of horror film goers, the film then takes a clever, but not totally unexpected turn into the possibility of something else, an entity or presence at the house, which unsettles both Ellison and the audience, as he reacts to unexplained noises,an infestation of scorpions and snakes, and a haunted film projector which insists on switching itself on, to replay the murder footage over and over again, and always at night. Aside from the ""things that go bump in the night"" approach, the tension steps up a notch again when Ellison downloads the Super 8 film from the original movie reels onto his laptop computer. Repeated viewings of these graphic and unsettling home movies, clearly shot by the killer in grainy and wobbly hand held images, start to reveal two things to Ellison, a drawn symbol that repeats itself at all of the murder scenes and even more disturbingly, a hidden and masked character that appears to be looking on as the murders take place. To say any more about the plot development would spoil what is a genuinely frightening movie. There are some jump out of your seat moments, and the movie works so well because the further Ellison's investigations and research take him, the more he realises he is into something that may in fact consume both him and his family, and if it were possible, is undoubtedly far worse. I think this one will spawn a Sinister II, as when the eventual puppet master is revealed, it is clear that apprehension by any law enforcement agency is unlikely. The brilliant Vincent D'Onofrio has a supporting role, and even though we only see him on a computer screen, he is always a pleasure to watch and adds some gravitas to the film. Hawke is also good as the determined author looking for a last shot. Suspenseful, eerie and disturbing, this one will be scaring people for some time to come. So infrequently does a good horror film come along, if you like scares, you must watch this one; it won't leave you wanting and just might make you think what's looking out at you from your laptop screen."

","Finally a horror film that packs some quality and delivers on the hype.<br/><br/>Sinister is a very unsettling, disturbing and scary film.<br/><br/>This film successfully mixes the POV ""Found Footage"" style horror with the traditional narrative. Fans of the found footage genre will enjoy this but more importantly those who aren't fans of the genre might find this style works better for them as it blends both styles effectively.<br/><br/>From the very opening shot you know this film is going to be a ride. I found certain sequences in the movie extremely disturbing (in a good way) and some images were burned onto my subconscious memory long after the film had finished. This is a true horror film in the sense that there are a few jump scares but it does not rely on them which is refreshing and it is not a total gore-fest. It balances the two very well and delivers a very tense atmosphere with some harrowing images.<br/><br/>Ethan Hawke is great and carries the film confidently as he delivers a very convincing performance.

There was little to no character development with dialogue that was childishly simple and intended to crowbar the points of the film across.

","The trailer for ""Sinister"" promised a lot... and, like many films of the genre in recent years, subsequently delivered nothing more than a poorly realised ""stab in the dark"". Speaking of darkness- could a filmmaker be any more literal? Perhaps if the characters had managed to survive beyond a severe lack of cohesion and groundedness- apparent early in the film- by ever having a brilliantly constructed life-raft of ideas and execution to cling to, then I may not have been alerted to the gaping technical failings that ultimately dragged the whole thing under. The resulting power savings could very well earn ""Sinister"" the very first ""carbon neutral"" rating in film production- but unfortunately the intolerable lack of lighting does not a dark thriller make. Nor does it hide the fact that the makeup effects team obviously thought that black eyeshadow and a tub of clown white would suit the HD format perfectly! It does, however, provide a peaceful sleeping environment for the film's family for a majority of the film- regardless of various crashes, desperate yells, thuds from and around the ""tortured"" Ethan Hawke that would otherwise wake a coma patient. I like some of the ""events"" that unravel before the Writer's (Hawke's) eyes as he tries to piece together the truth of his predicament- but again special effects marr any hope for shock value from the get-go. I would like to offer Director Scott Derrickson, along with co-writer C. Robert Cargill, these tips upon embarking on another similarly charged journey;<br/><br/>1. Hire one or more lighting technicians<br/><br/>2. Hire special effects/ makeup people that understand horror beyond a halloween party<br/><br/>3. If they don't get it at first, tell the actors who they are and how they are related to each other and the situation (i.e- direct them)<br/><br/>4. Actually put Vincent D'Onofrio in your film (I've heard of ""faxing in"" a performance...but Skypeing??)<br/><br/>5. Understand that without direction, or given enough rope, actors will resort to unrestrained externalism to get through<br/><br/>6. Understand that grainy, super 8 filmstock and filters are not a remedy for the unforgiving microscope of HD<br/><br/>7. Hire one or more lighting technicians<br/><br/>8. Perhaps watch ""Poltergeist"" again to remember how masterful films are made."

The fact that the film runs nearly two hours long is definitely not to its advantage, as it overstays its welcome and keeps escalating the ridiculousness until any viewer who had seen even a few horror films would surely recognise what a cliché-ridden bore it becomes.<br/><br/>The supernatural elements of the script would have been better downplayed, if not cut out entirely. They made for an 'easy out' for the story, rather than tightening it and making it seem truly chilling; even The Ring, something of an inspiration for Sinister, did it far better by making the supernatural elements seem concrete and believable, a ubiquitous and inescapable threat. This is even worse since the supernatural pieces of Sinister are often comically or plainly not scary, unless the viewer happens to have a phobia of children in face paint mugging for the camera. A more interesting and tragic story is told in the breakdown of the author's relationship with his wife, as insufferable as she was and as asinine as he was. It's why The Shining worked better than Sinister, because the threat was very real as well as being touched by supernatural factors. And I don't even care for The Shining, but it did a better job of telling essentially the same story!<br/><br/>Amazing how a 'nearly broke' author can afford a massive château, multiple times moving house -- with movers! -- within a couple of weeks, and still not actually seem to be cutting corners at all. Oh wait, no, they only had Chinese takeaway once; they must be *really* roughing it. Also, is everyone else in the house completely deaf? Someone not only shouting or at times screaming at the top of his lungs, falling down ladders, tossing heavy boxes around, and not a single person seems to notice? No-one sleeps that deeply, least of all children. Funny, too, how a police officer who was concerned about the author he was unable to reach on the phone all day about the danger to his life wasn't able to, you know, get any other police to go check on him. Especially as only the most look would easily turn up where he was. Unfortunately, this is just a drop in the bucket of all the holes and various other problems in Sinister.<br/><br/>Its cast are serviceable at best, but they can do nothing with a script that makes no character likable, interesting, or remotely reasonable. The deputy -- whom I can only recall as 'Deputy So-and-So', which should tell you plenty -- is the only interesting character and is barely on- screen, but he seems not to fit the film at all and would be more suited in the universe of Twin Peaks.<br/><br/>Ultimately one doesn't care so much about the characters or their welfare, but instead the investment of time in the film itself, and so when the inevitable, predictable outcome occurs, it's nothing but infuriating. It's not scary, the effects are not special (and in fact are more reminiscent of a very pedestrian attempt), and nothing really makes much sense. You'll find yourself angry at poor writing and a massive waste of time, mildly unsettled by the first half-hour and bored by the last 3/4 of the film. Really, overstaying its welcome is something Sinister revels in, and it's especially annoying in that it makes the viewer sit through every smug moment of self-assured brilliance that the audience doesn't share, which anyone with half a brain anticipated from the first 30 minutes.<br/><br/>It's amazing how some people were apparently really scared by this. The scariest part of it was that the script must have made it to screen without any editorial oversight or revisions. Save yourself the trouble and just look at the poster, it basically tells you the entire plot anyway and you save two hours of wasted time that will just make you angry."

","After moving himself and his family into a new house that was the scene of a horrendous crime, true-crime writer Ellison Oswalt (Ethan Hawke) finds a box of 8mm ""snuff"" films that suggest the murder he is currently researching is the work of a serial killer whose career dates some way back still further...<br/><br/>It is becoming the un-reviewable genre, horror that is, there are just too many splinters of horror to choose from and so many people to cater for. There are many who stand up and proudly proclaim that they will watch any horror film and view it on its own terms, yet in this new millennium age that doesn't appear to be the case. I know I'm at fault, I hate torture porn and excessive grue type films, they just bore me, so can I review Hostel 9, Saw 27 and Wrong Turn 12 fairly? No, I don't think I can. I mean the human body can only be sliced up in so many different ways right? Right? Vice Versa, can someone who loves Argento, Roth and the like, review fairly a boo-jump ghost story that caters for those who want to wet themselves when something jumps out of a cupboard? I really don't think so, but I digress...<br/><br/>Sinister is a wonderfully creepy movie that deals firmly in the realm of demons who come into the real world to cause unmitigating terror and heartbreak. It has no ""axe"" to grind with the blood thirsty who want to see arteries sliced and diced, it just wants to put a protagonist front and centre as he gets in way above his head, have his family come under serious threat; especially the child (oh my, the children...), and throw in the odd ""boo-jump"" moment to keep the pant wetters happy. The video footage used to show us the previous crimes unnerves greatly and there's a strong mystery element to keep the intrigue level high, whilst the ending doesn't cop out in the slightest. Hawke is excellent, perfectly portraying a man horrified yet submerged by the need to unravel the story, but his turn is sadly balanced by Juliet Rylance as the wife who seems unable to generate believable emotion.<br/><br/>This film really isn't for any horror fan who isn't into the ""demon in the real world"" type horror; like Insidious for example. While those who like this splinter of horror and still decry it brings nothing new to the table, I'll ask again, well what would you like to see brought to the table then? I love this sub-genre of horror, and I feel Sinister is one of the best films of its type in recent years. Its reputation amongst like minded adults is well founded...just don't watch the trailer first, mind! 8/10"

","Well just got back from seeing this and not sure what film the people giving it more than 6 were watching. One person says the twist at the end was genius? The ending was clichéd and extremely predictable for a film of this genre of late. Yes it had a few scary moments in it but they were all of the loud noise/something jumping out at you type. There is no real tension and you can guess the so called twist by about a quarter of the way in.<br/><br/>The acting I felt was good enough even from the children. <br/><br/>Personally I'd say wait for it to come out on DVD instead of wasting your money at the cinema."

","I went into this movie hoping that it would be different than the dozens of other horror movies I had recently seen. To say that I was disappointed is a bit of an understatement. I was sitting in somewhat of a full theater when I watched this movie. The director would create this great build up, with amazing music, and then there would be a huge let down. Honestly, myself and most of the other people in the theater spent the majority of the time laughing. I was tempted to ask for my money back at the end of the movie, or at least warn those in line to not waste their time on such a horrendous movie. For those who have said that it was the 'best horror movie they've seen"", either we saw two completely different movies or they were high on crack while they were watching it."

","I am going to lose some man-points here but I found this absolutely terrifying.<br/><br/>I am a big Ethan Hawk fan and he played the rather unlikeable main character very well.<br/><br/>Ghost stories tend to have two flaws in my opinion.<br/><br/>One: The characters have to put up with the ghosts and not run away. Here Hawke forces his family to endure the supernatural for reasons of money and ego. I bought this, I was yelling at the TV for his wife to leave him but every time she was ready to go he managed to stop being enough of a douche so she wouldn't.<br/><br/>Two: Ghosts aren't scary in the flesh. OK they may kill you but then so can a peanut. Here the director teases you with the supernatural element bringing it out in short sharp horrifying doses.<br/><br/>The film is a little slow (almost to Japanese levels), but this helps store larger amounts of suspense.<br/><br/>Loved the cast, loved the story, watched most of it between my fingers, don't judge me."
"samlynn12","9","3","5","27 September 2013"," Well executed, not so well written.
","This was an interesting, and at some moments very creepy film, that fell short of the mark with some poor writing.<br/><br/>The film started very well, and the plot got off to an excellent start, the beginning scene was creepy straight away. I loved the idea of the film, with the crime writer discovering more grizzly crimes than he could have imagined. In the early parts of the film, the more that was uncovered the scarier the story became, suspense being built throughout, as we realise who the next victims will be.<br/><br/>This was all done with no supernatural apparitions, or any hints of some sort of ghostly presence. I was beginning to think that maybe the film had nothing to do with ghosts or demons, which would have been a fantastic idea, and really scary. This was not the case. The more ""spooky"" scenes that appeared the less believable the film seemed to become. Although a lot of these scenes were very jumpy, some of them were just downright weird.<br/><br/>I can't help but feel that this film would have been amazing, if the ghosts had just stayed away, and the crimes were committed by a person, or group of people. The idea that those horrific crimes could have been done by normal human beings is much more scary than a demon doing it.<br/><br/>I'm not sure if there was supposed to be a twist at the end or not, but if there was it was very predictable.<br/><br/>Having said this, the film was still scary, and was good for the most part. The lead actor was great, and the various uses of the filming techniques and music really built tension in the night time scenes. It just went downhill after the first half, and could have been a great film had the story been slightly more well written."
"jimbo-53-186511","5","3","5","26 August 2013"," Fairly well acted and at times it's pretty creepy, but it's nothing we haven't seen before
","I remember a friend of mine going to see this at the cinema when it came out last year and I remember him saying that it was a 'great film' and was really scary. I noticed the DVD whilst out and about, and saw at the top of box that it said it was from the producers behind 'Paranormal Activity' and 'Insidious' - 2 films which I did enjoy. I decided to give it a try on this basis and felt rather disappointed when the film ended.<br/><br/>Ellison (Hawke) is a struggling True Crime Writer who hasn't been able to produce a decent book since 'Kentucky Blood' which he released about 10 years ago. Upon hearing about a house that is for sale which carries a dark secret - a family were murdered there and which is really cheap due to its 'dark secret', Ellison decides to buy the house and move his family there as he believes this will be the perfect setting for his next bestseller. Of course, he keeps the 'dark secret' from his wife Tracy (Juliet Rylance) as he had already promised her that he wouldn't move them anywhere that has a 'questionable past'. Once the family move into the house, Ellison discovers a box with various 'movie reels' and each reel contains murders of different families in different years and each of the families are killed in different ways - the only apparent links between the killings is that one family member is always left alive and a strange symbol is left at each crime scene - is Ellison really onto something big or is it something that is too big for him that he is best off leaving well alone? Part of the problem with Sinister is that the pacing is ridiculously slow - for about the first 45 minutes to an hour nothing really happens. You will occasionally just hear floor boards creaking or the occasional loud noise, but in my mind there was never any kind of 'threat' and I never really felt scared for the family. The other problem is that when the film tried to be scary it failed in that respect as well - a lot of the time what was about to happen you could see it coming a mile off because it's the sort of thing you've seen time and time again. It's fairly obvious without reading the cover of the DVD that this is by the same people behind Paranormal Activity & Insidious as Sinister seems to try to combine elements of both films, but for me it just didn't have the same 'psychologically scary feel' that PA and Insidious had - they were scary because of the fear of the 'unknown presence' that terrorised their victims and I just didn't get that feeling here which meant that Sinister lacked the edge of your seat suspense.<br/><br/>Another aspect of film enjoyment is being prepared to 'suspend your disbelief' but unfortunately there were a couple of things that didn't make sense. Firstly, why did the police give up on the murder investigation in the first place? They just assume that the little girl is dead without finding a body - not likely. Secondly - the home movie reels, in the real world surely the police would have seized everything from the house as 'evidence' when they discovered that the family had been murdered which would have meant that the reels wouldn't have been there in the first place.<br/><br/>Sinister did have some good points; I quite liked the atmosphere and the general 'feel' of the film - the cinematography was great and there were odd moments of creepiness here and there. The acting was also great and I felt that Ethan Hawke gave a convincing performance as a down on his luck crime writer trying to get his next big break.<br/><br/>In all honesty, I wouldn't recommend watching Sinister. The pacing was appalling and a lot of the time I didn't find the characters actions believable. Whilst it tried to create tension and suspense, a lot of the time it was predictable so I never really felt scared whilst watching Sinister. The ending of the film suggests that there might be a sequel to Sinister, but if it's anything like this film I'll probably give it a miss."
"Samiam3","6","3","5","16 August 2013"," Another ghost story that rises before it falls
","People going to see Sinister are most likely doing so because they are fans of the genre, and have likely seen dozens of such films. Sinister's greatest trick is that for a while, it convinces you that you have NOT seen this kind of movie before. It will have you hooked from the first shot, and for about an hour, Sinister is just as suspenseful as it is intriguing. Unfortunately, like so many movies do, the final act falls short.<br/><br/>Sinister runs out of steam in the last half hour. The ending is a problem, for not only does it come with a sense of anti-climax, but it is almost absurd enough to pass for genre parody. It leaves behind an abundance of red herrings, and you come away feeling a little bit cheated.<br/><br/>Another problem with Sinister is that it sweeps two or three potentially interesting sub-plots under the rug; something that would have given the movie more interesting characters. There is a sense that too much story material was left behind in order to make this a more direct and unfaltering ghost story.<br/><br/>Perhaps more than any other genre, horror movies demand very manipulative interior cinematography, and Sinister doesn't seem like it was lit properly. Even for a horror movie, the shadows are surprising heavy and overwhelming, and there are moments when it is too dark to see anything. This is not a complaint I make frequently about movies. More impressive in Sinister, is the sound design. which is full of subtle contributions. I cannot remember the last time I was spooked by the sound of a film projector's motor and claw.<br/><br/>I wish I could recommend Sinister, but I cannot. Even if it is a scary movie, it is one that initially appears to be smarter and more original than it actually is."

","After watching the movie, I was so disappointed that I had to actually look up if I saw the same movie as everyone else did or not. I came across this movie while surfing for some good horror movies, and as a matter of fact, this one was rated the best by a couple of lists. The first half has some decently horrifying scenes, which end up pretty futile in their attempt to scare their audience. But like most of the horror movies, people tend to think that the movie is building up for the actual horror, which most probably will be shown in the second half. Now as the movie progresses, your disappointment gradually increases, as you begin to realize that it isn't scaring you even a little bit. The least they could have done was improvise on the clichéd scenes, like sudden popping up of ghostly faces and young demonic girls asking you to shush.Ethan hawk acted more like a teenager, rather than a guy who is in his mid 30s and a father of two teenagers. The direction wasn't good either, as Ethan Hawke was the only one who was feeling the presence of a supernatural thing in their house, and his wife was completely unaware of what all is going on. The story line was good, but the screenplay pathetic, could have done so much more."

","A washed-up crime writer moved into a small town along with his wife and two kids, harboring the forlorn hope that he could forge another bestseller. He was next to desperate so that he bought the house whose former owner had been massacred in the yard save for a little girl who went missing. Much stressed yet his hope arose when he found in the attic a box of super 8 homemade movies portraying several mystic unconnected crime scenes, including the one had happened in his yard. He suppressed the temptation to report the video to the local police and begun to study the tape with a bottle of whiskey at hand. <br/><br/>Up to this point, I thought our ill-fated hero would be a screen cliché who unwillingly casts his investigation aside, then tries his best to save his family and ultimately defeats the monster (or whatever that might be). Such kind of platitude is indubitably acceptable for a low-budget horror movie by default. What is really unexpected, if not unacceptable is that the movie chooses to advance itself in a way that makes little sense. <br/><br/>The family eventually found out the house was heavily cursed, and they decided to stay no more. However, after having left the town in the rear-view mirror, a novice policeman discovered that the writer had just fulfilled the pattern that an ancient evil bogle used to choose his victims. Getting the heads-up call too late, the family was slaughtered at the hands of their little daughter, who was possessed by the sinister spirit. The hero failed both his family and his audience because he did even have the chance to figure out how to break the pattern, nor did the screenwriter care to give one. Is it the morale of the story that there exists certain unbreakable evil? If so, what is the meaning for our hero's uneventful struggle throughout the movie? Or the whole point is to tell us that they just made up a new imaginary monster called ""Bughul?""<br/><br/>The movie is a cumbersome shoddy medley of the Ring in the east and the bogeyman in the west, which give the unimaginative name ""Bughul."""

","Let me begin by saying I have never seen the P.A. movies that are clearly popular to many (but then again, i've never watched any of the Twilights or 5 minutes of a Harry Potter either.) Suffice to say, I like my movies twisted, escapist, and definitely on the dark side of the moon, a little/lot of gore never hurt anyone. One of the things that almost turned me off to this movie was what looked like another reductive Japanese ghost cgi stop motion with excessive Reverb and cymbal crashes during sudden creepy imagery. This movie does resort to that, but to a much more minimal extent than a lot of movies in the past decade.<br/><br/>Thankfully, the movie is rated ""R"" and while it relies on having few to little sexual proclivities; and actually keeps much of the gore that's shown to be relatively tame. (Come on, there's episodes i've seen of medical dramas that totally surpass half the solid ""R' and 'Pg-13' watered down stuff that we pay primo dineros at the movie theater for. At least you guys do, so lazy people like me can summon it in a perfectly legal 'torrent' of magic.<br/><br/>Main character is relatively likable, and despite some questionable initial actions, for the most part makes what seem to be pretty logical decisions despite irrefutably strange and creepy plot folds. Normally found/discovered footage totally turns me of (am i the only person that wishes this years 'VHS' spectacular was a little more like 'Creepshow' from the 80's. Eh, probably. I'm probably the only person that feels that way. *Smacks head*<br/><br/>So give sinister a chance, it's more creative than it is reductive although i'm sure many critics are comparing it to the Amityville Horror. If you're interested in checking out a good after-companion to this film that is still in the same realm but a bit more vintage and certainly interesting: Lucio Fulci's House By the Cemetery. Pretty much the same concept of this but with much more creative gore combined with extremely demented ideas."

","This film is actually a really nice, low budget horror film. More of a thriller / ghost story / boogeyman type movie with lots of ""jump out at you"" scares, without all the guts and gore than you have come to expect from an ""R"" rated horror film!!!!! Ethan Hawke is brilliant as Ellison Oswalt, a struggling ""true-crimes"" writer who is desperately seeking his next great novel. Ellison's claim to fame was his debut best-selling novel, Kentucky Blood; however, his books that followed over the next ten years have failed to generate the same buzz as his initial release.<br/><br/>Ellison (Hawke) has decided to investigate the hanging mass murder and child abduction of a middle class family in a small mid-western town. He has relocated his wife and kids to this small town as well, as he further investigates the crime scene and delves into the details of the horrific homicide. Ellison has a history of selecting living accommodations close to the crime scene; however, for this particular case he has opted to live in the crime scene household but neglects to inform his wife or family.<br/><br/>Ethan Hawke does a terrific job portraying the down-on-his-luck author willing to do whatever it takes to regain the popularity, fame, and notoriety of his former self. When he stumbles across a box of 8mm home films that connects another four (4) family murders with child abductions dating back 50 years, instead of turning over this additional information over to the local authorities to further investigate; he decides to use this information to his advantage to write his upcoming book. It's this decision, which ultimately puts the gears in motion and subsequently leads Ellison's demise.<br/><br/>Made on a shoestring budget for only $3 Million dollars; however, this film does not possess that low budget feel. Written, directed, and executive produced by Scott Derrickson, Derrickson developed a top-notched script with interesting subtext, while maintaining a high level of intensity, intrigue, and just a hint a terror to keep the audience interested, on edge, and jumpy. I definitely recommend this film, there is nothing over-the-top graphic or gory here. This is just one of those old fashion, whodunit / who's-gonna-get-it next horror films, and is done exceptionally well!!! See more of my reviews on FB @ ""The Faris Reel"""

","Oh dear God, this movie was such a horrible disappointment. The trailer looked interesting and the story sounded alright, but the movie itself was just far from scary and actually turned out to be somewhat of a joke.<br/><br/>Sure it was better than the recent crap that has flooded the horror genre, such as the ""Paranormal Activity"" series, but then again, it doesn't take much from a movie to do that.<br/><br/>What made ""Sinister"" bearable to watch was the acting performances. Normally I am not much of a fan of Ethan Hawke, but he actually did a good job in this movie. And the movie does have some great moments where it builds up some suspense, just a shame that it never really climaxed into anything particularly worthwhile. And also the cinematography in the movie made the movie bearable to suffer through. A lot of good camera work and great angles, but ultimately it was all struggling to best a horrible storyline and a lack of scares.<br/><br/>The story does start out nice and does have a certain appeal, but it all takes a turn for the worse when you are let in on what is actually going on, and when you see the dead children in the house for the first time it all goes downhill fast.<br/><br/>I had expected ""Sinister"" to be a lot more than it turned out to be. I wasn't particularly spooked or thrilled at any given moment throughout the entire feature. There were some good moments, but they never really culminated into anything grand. And the story took a severe turn for the worse and ridiculous along the way.<br/><br/>If you enjoy a good scary movie, there are far better movies available out there."
"Michael-Hallows-Eve","8","3","5","21 November 2012"," Very good ""scary"" movie. Worth seeing.
","This movie had me in to it right from the start. The opening scene draws you straight in with its shock value. The story is well presented and moves along nicely, as I found myself intrigued in what was behind the killings. And as for the killings they were quite nasty at stages (I saw the uncut version). Some of the scenes had the scare factor, I admit I did jump a couple of times. The tension builds nicely and you find yourself getting pulled right in to the movie, almost like you're there with the characters. I did kind of see the ending coming (although not completely), but I did like how the film ends. So overall I give this film a solid 8 out of 10."
"Tcarts76","10","3","5","19 November 2012"," Finally, the correct use of found footage. Truly great movie.
","""Sinister,"" is a great old school, supernatural horror movie, and is a great example of how, if you are going to do it, to correctly make a movie involving the overused fad of ""Found Footage."" It's the story of a true crime writer,Ellison Oswalt (Ethan Hawke) that moves his family into a house formerly owned by a murdered family whose daughter is still missing. Investigating the murders for his new book he starts finding reels of 8mm footage, not only of the murdered family, but other murders as well, and a sort of boogeyman figure. Some sort of sinister plot is unfolding around him, and his sanity, and sense of dread may soon cause his family's demise as well.<br/><br/>The Good: This is a great horror movie. It's a sort of murder mystery/ supernatural thriller/ just plain creepy film that is reminiscent of the horror movies of the past that still creep us out today. In many ways it is much in the style of the old classic, ""The Shining,"" mixed with the more new school of films such as ""The Ring."" There is no corny element to it which too many movies put in today, and it makes it a delight, at least for me, to watch.<br/><br/>Ethan Hawke was excellent as the crime writer and father who is seeking that next big book, yet feeling himself slip away from his idealistic views of why he chose that genre in the first place are fading. That is saying a lot coming from me because I am not a big Ethan Hawke fan outside of ""Training Day."" He plays the part well, and really does a great job as the story takes hold and he begins to descend into a terrified, drinking man both continuing to investigate, and feeling a sense of dread at what he might find.<br/><br/>The found footage in this one was great. Yes, I said it, great! Found footage is the new fad and I hate it! But this time it was perfect. The 8mm film, much of it from the 70's and early 80's had a sort of Manson-esque look that made for quite the stirring factor. I loved it.<br/><br/>The Bad: I really don't have a lot of bad comments to make about this movie. I could probably say that Juliet Rylance, who plays the wife and mother, Tracy, wasn't great or memorable, but then again this was more of a closed off to one man type of story. So, it didn't hurt it any. Other than that Fred Thompson probably should have had a more prominent role in the story as the town police chief.<br/><br/>I give this one a 10. Some may disagree, but for someone that grew up with movies like ,""The Shining,"" ""Carrie,"" and ""The Exorist,"" I appreciated the overall feel of this one and all the elements were there. It was creepy and chilling. The found footage aspect was done in a way that added to the story and the feel of them worked. Great movie for any horror fan that is getting tired of the same cliché recent movies and longs for a real good creepy movie.

","Over the years we've certainly been desensitised to horror movies. Torture and mutilation has become par for the course and the likes of the Saw franchise compounded this with wash and repeat. The found footage genre emerged and we've have many, many movies of varying success on this format. As a horror fan I'm always happy to find something good and Sinister is that. While no masterpiece it hearkens back to classic movies. The cast, production, sound and cinematography are all top notch and attentive. I'm not a particular Ethan Hawke fan however he delivered a solid lead performance being on screen for nearly the entire movie and providing a character that although not entirely a likable character I was sympathetic with him. Aside from my girlfriend jumping all over the place I really enjoyed the movie. Nothing's overdone and although it was somewhat predictable it was executed in an expert manner allowing me to let myself get caught up in the movie. Lets face it few movies can surprise me but I can enjoy things and appreciate when they're done well."
"3xHCCH","9","3","5","14 November 2012"," It Is As It Is Entitled.
","I am usually disappointed when I see a film which came with very high expectations. However, I must make an exception to ""Sinister."" I had heard very good things about this film making it a must-see for a horror movie fan like me. However, I had to be out of the country during the days it was shown in the theaters locally last month, so I only got to watch it now. And these high expectations were fulfilled. ""Sinister"" is indeed a very good horror film. In fact, I will go on to say that it was one of the best American horror films ever made.<br/><br/>Ellison (Ethan Hawke in his first appearance in a horror film) is an author of true crime novels who is seeking to follow up his one hit book. He moves his family into the very home where a gruesome family massacre had previously taken place. When he discovers a box of film reels which turned out to be video footage documenting the deaths of several families, his research turns into a real life horror for him and his family.<br/><br/>The eerie and tense atmosphere is set up from the very first scene where we see four people hanging from a tree. It never let up from there up to the bloody end. OK, there are horror clichés here like the house in seemingly perpetual darkness, or the sudden scares that lead nowhere, creepy children drawing on walls, and so on, but in this movie, these things actually work well to work up the audience's heart rates and goosebumps. The music is pulsating as it is unsettling, very effective to work you up some more with every step that Ellison takes in the house. <br/><br/>I liked the way that the gore was suggested instead of blatant. I liked the subtlety of many of its scare moments. I liked the way that Ethan Hawke realistically portrayed the tormented but desperate Ellison. A male protagonist is not always as easy to play in a horror film than a female one. I like the ending, how it may seem that you can figure out what is going to happen in the end, but the way it played out was pretty out-of-the-box disturbing and ultimately, shocking. I highly recommend horror film fans to watch ""Sinister."" It is as it is entitled."

While stowing away his belongings in the attic one night, he stumbles onto old home movies of the killing, as well as others, some dating back to the 1960s. Hawke then obsessively watches the footage, analyzing each frame, hoping to catch a glimpse of the killer, which he does- but when he sees the killer standing in the shrubbery in his backyard . . . . .<br/><br/>Supremely creepy, it also moves along at a good pace, despite a nearly two-hours long run time; the home movies of the killings are effectively horrifying, several great jump-scares (especially the bit with the lawn mower) and a genuinely frightening villain in the barely glimpsed Bughuul (Boogeyman) ; this is a great movie to watch in a cinema on Halloween night.<br/><br/>Minor quibble: we cannot decide whether or not we like its anticlimactic, non-ending.

Some people claim they always knew when something scary was gonna happen and that it was predictable and blah blah blah but I think more that 90% of people know when something scary will happen (the music in the movies always hint to it), the point is that every scene was a build up to the ultimate climax and every time the movie hinted that something scary was gonna happen i wanted to look away but couldn't, i had to feel the chills in the back of my head and then feel them there for a good ten seconds after a scary scene was over, honestly it is a scary experience, especially if you sit down and enjoy the movie instead of sitting down and analyzing the movie and then comparing it to other movies you've seen before and doing all those things that unhappy people do to think they're staying a step ahead of the movie.........in other words just enjoy a great movie with great acting by everyone and a lot of chills throughout, it's not just a scary movie but it has a mystery factor to it so you're brain is always trying to figure out what's gonna happen next and why, enjoy!"

The overall story is intriguing and scary in itself but believe me when I tell you there are many moments in this movie that will make you jump right out of your seat! It's refreshing to know that movies are still being produce that can get this desensitized 34 years old's heart racing. I don't remember the last movie I saw where I squinted my eyes and tensed my body to prepare for what was to come. Spend the money and see this one, you wont be let down!"
"flamegamehunter","8","3","5","15 October 2012"," Sinister is very unsettling and definitely left with me.
","For someone who has watched many horror films, slasher movies etc, I have found that I go into these types of movies with the same expectancy: It's going to suck, but I'm gonna enjoy the few jump-scares, creepy audio, obvious natures of oncoming deaths, and terrible acting. I will enjoy this movie no matter how bad it is, and I will love to hate it.<br/><br/>I walked into Sinister with no knowledge of it whatsoever. I didn't watch a preview, read any articles on it, nothing. I had no idea what it was about aside from what was on the poster. If you haven't seen the poster, it's basically a girl spreading a lot of blood on the wall behind her with a creepy, demonic face made from the blood. The tag-line is ""Once you see him, nothing can save you."" I thought it was going to be about some murderer/demon type antagonist who follows this poor girl and tries to kill her the whole movie and kills her friends, family, loved ones and so forth until she triumphs and rids the planet of the bad guy. Then the camera would pan down and you'd see the guy wink or twitch and cut to credits.<br/><br/>Never have I been more wrong. Skip to the next paragraph due to possible spoilers. The movie opens up with what looks like a home made movie of four people getting hanged in a tree in slow motion. This lasts the entire opening credits and immediately raises my heart rate a bit. The movie uses this and other home movies to drive the plot and it's honestly very well done. After each movie I felt unsettled and disturbed. The way that it seemed so much like documentary and that it was a personal camera was just eerie. Almost as if it would be put on youtube. The movie follows Ellison (Ethan Hawke) as a true-crime novelist who has moved to the house that that hanging had occurred, and He doesn't reveal this information to his wife Tracy (newcomer Juliet Rylance) or his family. Strange events happen as Ellison finds a box full of those home movies showing different murders. As he watches each murder scenario, he tries to link them together and possibly benefit off of it, but it soon changes as Ellison tries to save his family from being murdered as well.<br/><br/>The acting was great. Hawke and Rylance worked well together in the tense and serene moments of the movie. Dialogue didn't seem forced or cliché in comparison to other tense moments in horror films, and it flows well. I didn't find myself lost or wondering what was just said. Their children also did well and everyone meshed well together in this movie.<br/><br/>I could see some jump scares coming from a mile away, but they were still done well. The idea of finding-footage horror is a bit overdone, but it was portrayed well in this movie. I found that the use of ""old"" technology such as a film projector was done well whilst being enveloped in iMacs and iPhones. The film felt modern and the setting was defined well.<br/><br/>Audio. Audio is key to a horror film. Sinister has great audio in all of the right scenes to keep a low-grade set of tension simmering at almost all times. Even in the nice well-lit scenes, you are always expecting something bad or scary to happen. The music for the home movies was done quite well and had a good creepy vibe to each scenario, and every time the house was dark, the ambiance was great.<br/><br/>I was annoyed at the fact that he never turned on any of his lights to any room in his house at any point whatsoever. This didn't take from the movie too much, but some scenes he could have just flipped a light switch up for reassurance. I guess this was a way to increase tension, and it worked. I also didn't like how little was explained about their son Trevor (Michael Hall D'Addario)'s Night Terrors. I had no idea what that even was, and it was just assumed that it was normal for him to be doing what he was doing. But that is just my lack of knowledge.<br/><br/>Those home movies definitely stuck with me after leaving the theater. I have an over-active imagination, and driving home was tense and nerve-racking. The film did its job. It didn't scare me as much as it disturbed me, but it did leave me looking over my shoulder even while typing this review. I know it's just a movie, but this was a refreshing horror flick. It's good to get some fright out of me, whether it was the movie or my imagination, this helped.<br/><br/>I absolutely recommend it."

","this film had a lot of hype and I'm a huge horror fan. i thought the paranormal activity movies were okay but now they keep dragging the franchise on and on and i bet number 4 will be dreadful. Insidious i thought was a lot scarier then the paranormal activities and a much better film but it was still the same e thing, jump scares! this i think is cheap horror. so going onto sinister yes this film does have some paranormal activity characteristics and jump scares but this film is also mentally disturbing and unnerving. the film raised the bar for horror films and i don't remember a film being this disturbing. yes it has jump scares but they are a hell of a lot scarier than the jump scares you get in any 21st century horror film. what i most liked about the film is it had elements of old horror where you don't get to actually see the killings and it is left to your imagination. its not quite unique but it is disturbing and very clever. if you are a horror movie fan go and see it please. it should not have been a 15 it should have been an 18 to be honest. the acting is also good in this film especially Hawk's performance. don't expect this to be another paranormal activity because it isn't. its much scarier and gets into your mind much more.i will rate this film 8/10 because the story builds(although quite slow) and it was more disturbing than jumpy which i very much liked. it scared me a lot this film."
"jaguiar313","6","3","5","12 October 2012"," Well made but, a strong sense of ""been there, done that.""
","""Sinister"" is yet another horror flick that is well made but, is just too familiar to really be effective. The story opens as a true crime author (Ethan Hawke) moves his family into a house where a multiple homicide was committed (always a bad move) that is the subject of his new novel. But, a box of old home movies mysteriously shows up containing footage of numerous murders and before you can say ""The Ring"" a pagan boogie man know as Buhguul is haunting the footage and his life. Scott Derrickson does create some nice atmosphere and there are some genuinely spooky scenes and well executed jump scares but, he and C. Robert Cargill's script is far too reminiscent of films like ""The Ring"" and ""The Grudge"" to establish it's own identity and really scare us. You pretty much know what is coming and it's no shock when the film finally gets there. As usual, Hawke's Ellison makes all the right stupid decisions to set the story in motion and continues to do so to keep it headed toward it's predicable conclusion. And I can forgive stupidity in a horror flick if at least it delivers the goods and ""Sinister"" only does really gives us some good chills in the last third but, then arrives at a routine conclusion for this kind of flick that we see coming a mile away. It also doesn't help that so little is known about this Buhguul entity that we never really get a good grasp of it's character and therefor don't really get a good sense of menace. He's just another generic boogie man hiding in pictures and movie footage like the long haired girl ghosts of Asian horror, but, without the personality. The cast all perform well. Hawke is good despite the familiarity of the material and Juliet Rylance does her job as the wife concerned over her husbands behavior, although James Ransone's deputy is one stop away from Deputy Dewey from ""Scream"" . The film does have a slow burn and ultimately could have used a few minutes taken out to move things a long better as there is some repetition with some of the scenes' events (the projector starting on it's own). And the film might have been a bit more effective had the spooky scenes come closer together. All in all SInister is worth a rental, it's not bad, just far too much of what we have seen far too many times before to make it anything more then a forgettable diversion."
"blundellisgod","8","3","5","12 October 2012"," A horror time capsule for 2012
","Last film watched: Sinister - 6/10. This movie is basically a time capsule for what is popular in horror films in 2012. So we have a family moving into a new house (every horror of the last five years), creepy children (the ring, insidious) some kind of ancient demon, (PA, Insidious) nothing happening during the day but at night the atmosphere builds from one jump to the next (PA again) and of course (slight spoiler) a twist ending (sixth sense). Ethan Hawke is pretty good in the main role, nothing else to note about the rest of the acting though. All the other characters are horror clichés too: the world weary sheriff, the lovable, helpful deputy (scream), the uptight wife (Amityville horror, loads of others), rebellious kids. It all just feels copied and pasted from everything else. The thing that almost saves it is the ending. Coming out of nowhere the nightmarish conclusion feels like something more out of a Japanese horror which is obviously a great thing. If they could have made the rest of the movie as mental, ballsy and original as the ending they would have been onto something."
"gardoma","8","3","5","11 October 2012"," Scary, disturbing, and well-written: A horror movie for the decade
","I have been waiting to see Sinister since the first buzz about it at the SXSW festival. I finally saw it and it fulfilled most of my expectations.<br/><br/>Horror movies are made of different traditions and styles. You have those with creepy atmosphere, those with disturbing imagery, or those with scares-that-go-bump-in-the- night. Sinister is one of the few that reaches a consistent mix of all the elements. In the movie, a true-crime writer moves into a house where a family was killed, and founds a box of super8 reels that depict that murder, as well as others. The super8 movies provide the ""disturbing imagery"" part of Sinister, and they are truly chilling and unsettling. Hidden in the footage, the writer finds glimpses of a mysterious figure, and his investigation suddenly turns into a nightmare for him and his own family. That's where the ""creepy atmosphere"" sets in. And, as his investigation progresses, you have plenty of sudden scares and jumps. <br/><br/>Thanks to an amazing camera work, a skillful direction, and an a perfect (and slightly atypical for horror flicks) soundtrack, Sinister manages to be extremely effective in delivering all of these different shades of horror. Sinister also has a quality that most horror movies lack: It is actually well written. Some reviewers have gone at great lengths in pointing out supposed inconsistencies, but, as far as I can tell, they have all misunderstood several plot points. For instance, a few reviewers ridiculed the fact that the main character wonders in his house without turning the lights on---but, in the movie, it is explained that the electric circuits are off. If you pay attention, every action is explained. In fact, it is refreshing to see an horror movie that doesn't feel half-backed, and where characters act consequentially. <br/><br/>One of Sinister's writers was a former movie critic (at Ain't It Cool News), and his love for the genre (strong as it needs to be in a fan, but sophisticated as it needs to be in critic) comes through. The quality of its writing is apparent in the smoothness of the final product. Most horror movies tend to be discontinuous and uneven. For instance, before getting to the interesting part of ""Paranormal Activity"", you need to get through a lengthy and cumbersome introduction. And ""Insidious"", after a fantastic first half, ends with a predictable and awkward second act. Sinister, instead, proceeds evenly, pacing its scares, revealing important clues at the proper time, and giving equal attention to the buildup of the situations as well as their resolution. <br/><br/>Part of this strength comes from the fact that the movie's concept, while not entirely original, is well thought out. The metaphor of the ""evil force"" that lives inside the world of images is better developed here than in (for instance) ""The ring"", and does not fill shoe-horned as a metaphor for horror movies themselves. <br/><br/>The last strength of the movie that I want to mention is Ethan Hawke's exceptional performance. Hawke is truly believable as the writer obsessed with finding one last great story to tell---and eventually getting more than what he asked for. He succeeds in making his character complex and credible, and in making the viewers care for and identify with him. I am hard press to find a similarly convincing performance in a horror movie, besides George C. Scott in ""The Changeling""."

The filming locations are not attractive and everything about this film does not gel.<br/><br/>As for the other actors I knew nothing about them , the children were not particularly good and the make up for the spook children was like something out of a pantomime.

It was so clear to me that they obviously perceived the viewer as being just a stupid, gullible fool.<br/><br/>It sure didn't help matters at all that every single member of the Oswalt family in Sinister's story came across as being nothing but an annoyingly dysfunctional misfit (especially Trevor).

","Over the years horror films have gotten to be a dime a dozen. More often than not they just fail to deliver. With the found footage craze, it added a new depth, but sadly ran its course almost as fast as it became popular. The latest to try it's hand in delivering something new to the genre is Sinister, that while it's not a found footage film, does use some of the technique to tell what looks to be a somewhat unique tale.<br/><br/>Sinister follows a crime novelist and his family as they move into a new home for him to work on his latest true-crime novel. The closer he comes to the truth, the more he realizes he might have put his family in the path of pure evil. This film definitely delivers on not only the story it wants to tell, but in the creepy nature it sets out to achieve. The use of the old school films to tell the story adds a new dimension that really stepped this film up. Ethan Hawke did an awesome job with his character and delivering the obsessive nature needed to bring this part to life. The film takes its time to build up the strange disturbed story that is needed, but is also where the film has a minor issue. There are some aspects to the story that are just not needed and really seep in from time to time and end up slowing things down causing it to lose some of the momentum its building. Thankfully that is the only issue with this movie. It really delivers a unique addition to the horror genre with a new creature/character that could easily be brought back from time to time if done correctly. There isn't a lot of blood here, but there is a lot of moments that showcase the fills to come, while really sticking images in your brain that affect you without ever seeing them.<br/><br/>This is a great addition to the genre, but one that will no doubt be met with mixed feelings due to its sometime slow nature. Despite the sometimes slow pace this is a cleverly creepy horror film that is sure to be a refreshing taste for those fans of the genre."

An although it wasn't the latter it was barely the first.<br/><br/>Dragged out in places and incredibly predictable its a typical movie of the present day horror genre where its more 'lets mess with your head' than 'lets build atmosphere and give you a good story line'.<br/><br/>There are the usual popping up from behind doors, loud noises and mediocre 'scares' that most will find satisfying but are tiresome for horror fanatics like me.<br/><br/>It had potential and i must admit the ending is enjoyable and slightly warped when you realise who the 'killer' is, but by this point the film is beyond saving and you'll be glad its ended.<br/><br/>At home it will have little effect and should be viewed (if at all) in a cinema setting.<br/><br/>Whilst leaving the cinema many said how terrifying it was and it was the best horror they had seen in years. I and many other horror fans will probably beg to differ.<br/><br/>Good for some 'jumpy' moments but not for people who are expecting a decent horror"

","If you didn't get scared, you are either one of these three things...<br/><br/>1. An advocate for gallows humor, also known as trying to make things funny so that you don't end up getting scared. If you do this, it is also likely you have convinced yourself you are some horror guru, listen to the plot, believe the plot, the whole point is that it's supposed to be real, and it ISN'T hard to get sucked in. <br/><br/>2. Tried to find plot holes, which there aren't any. (If you found some then you didn't bother trying to get entertained and spent the whole movie trying to find one)<br/><br/>3. Went with a bunch of friends and talked after every scary scene to make it OK. <br/><br/>This movie is SCARY. Plain and simple. The progression of the plot is brilliant. The intensity it brings you to, is just a point where you don't want to be, it's uncomfortable, and parts of this movie is straight up f*cked up, and you will jump. It's a great movie, give it a chance before you discredit it. Period... <br/><br/>One word... Lawnmower."
"Med-Jasta","10","2","3","13 May 2020"," I'm not a horror fan
","I like good movies and sometimes those happen to be horror. But I'm not a fanboy for the genre or anything that restricts itself to the rules of the genre.<br/><br/>This movie was really good. A few jump scares but not overdone like a lot of scary movies. The fear comes from the story and not the anticipation of the jump.<br/><br/>I saw this preview years ago and thought that it had a good premise. But given that it's scary and produced by summit and Blum that didn't bode well. Ethan Hawk helped to legitimize it though. He's of course a really good actor but I feel like he can be talked into doing anything so he's done some crap. But I like that he's not above anything.<br/><br/>I was glad that the movie delivered on the good idea and made a good movie out of it. I normally don't like it when a good idea turns out to be supernatural because it feels lazy but for this story it works.<br/><br/>There's something scary about footage through a low quality camera. Again, done very well here.<br/><br/>It was very engaging and I had my eyes glued to the screen. It actually prevented me from drinking my hot beverage because I didn't want to jump and spill it.<br/><br/>The only annoying part was the wife. It felt like if you married a true crime author that you wouldn't be mad when he did things that a true crime author had to do."

","You may think that Sinister is just another serial killer movie? Well it's not. I thought that it was just the same old catch the killer horror film that already we have seen a thousand times before but Sinister turns the table around in a way that I have never seen in a horror movie before. I won't spoil anything but the ending is very disturbing that I almost turned off my TV I have never done that before while watching a horror movie.

","It's easy to see why ""Sinister"" (2012) came so highly recommended; this is a startlingly scary horror movie to which I'd give an 8 out of 10. I was tempted to give it a 9, but some subjective personal tastes prevent me from giving this unusually disturbing film a higher rating.<br/><br/>It's frightening. The design of the supernatural Big Bad is quite good, despite its simplicity. This film succeeds in giving us an intimidating bogeyman. Far worse is his choice of victims and his modus operandi. I won't say much here this is a movie where we learn about the story's antagonist because the protagonist is an investigator — true-crime writer ""Ellison Oswalt,"" wonderfully played by Ethan Hawke. I also won't go into precisely how the baddie operates, because it's just a little too dark to contemplate here.<br/><br/>It's shot and scripted quite well there are a number of nice touches, and the basic story is unsettling even by horror movie standards. A late twist about how the violence is perpetrated is telegraphed in advance, but it still gets under your skin. The directing by Scott Derrickson is spot on — the ""jump moments"" are cheap, but they still work. Derrickson's and C. Robert Cargill's script is smartly unnerving — especially with respect to how these crimes are perpetrated. (Yeesh.) And the use of unusual and disturbing music is quite effective. This film was the result of a lot of thought and effort.<br/><br/>Still, a few things suggested to me that this falls short of being a perfect horror movie:<br/><br/>1) Common tropes abound. The most tired, to me, was the use of a horror writer as an ironic protagonist. That's an overused device. The master himself, Stephen King, for example, has used this in no fewer than four novels and their subsequent film treatments, by my count. (Yes, Hawke here is a nonfiction writer instead of a novelist, but the principle is the same.) <br/><br/>2) Hawke's protagonist, as scripted, is pretty damned unlikable. ""Deputy So-and-So"" is his most important source, not to mention someone who shows him compassion when things get really tough. Yet he sticks with that insulting appellation, and even screens his calls, throughout the entire movie. <br/><br/>3) The bestselling nonfiction writer here has no idea how to cultivate a source. (See above.) I've been a writer, in some capacity, for my entire adult life, and I started out as a paper jockey. You treat every source as important, even the crazy ones. It's both good manners and proper professional conduct. And when you deal with any police officer, you're especially conscientious if you're smart — people in law enforcement are often (understandably) very sensitive about how they are portrayed in writing. <br/><br/>4) Ellison the need to move into a home where a multiple homicide was committed, in order to write about the crime? That's just nuts, even by eccentric writer standards. <br/><br/>5) He chooses not to tell his wife? I have never been married, but I know from both my personal and professional life that women get really, really ticked off when you neglect to tell them things that they think are important. <br/><br/>6) Is Oswalt's wife a Luddite who never googles anything? I moved to Virginia a year ago, and I STILL google my address because I keep forgetting my zip code. <br/><br/>7) Oswalt expects no neighbors to share such information with his wife? (This is lampshaded a bit, as a child brings home the information from his school.) <br/><br/>Finally, there is one subjective matter that kept me from loving this movie — and it is admittedly a matter of taste. Even as a devoted lover of dark stories, my enjoyment is sometimes affected by films in which children are victimized. (I am referring here to the children depicted in the 8 MM (""Super 8″) film strips that are discovered by the main character.)<br/><br/>Yes, these are horror movies, and they are intended for adults, and we ourselves should be adult enough to recognize fiction as such. (Otherwise we can buy a different ticket or click elsewhere among Netflix' options.) And plenty of great horror films feature imperiled children. ""28 Weeks Later"" (2007) immediately springs to mind for me, probably because it is a favorite. I think most other genre devotees would point to the universally recognized ""The Exorcist"" (1973). But in those films and most others, things were depicted differently. (I'm being vague here for fear of spoilers all around.)<br/><br/>I'm a veteran horror-hound; I've routinely enjoyed films in which zombies or vampires wipe out humanity. But what I saw in ""Sinister"" was too dark even for my taste. This sort of reaction is rare on my part, but not unprecedented. ""The Devil's Rejects"" (2005) and ""Wolf Creek"" (2005) both took violence against the innocent too far for me to really enjoy or recommend them. (Strangely, 1980's legendary ""Cannibal Holocaust"" affected me little.) Yes, zombie apocalypses tend to be gory affairs, but they are almost always faced by grownups, who are unbound, and armed, and generally able to fight back.<br/><br/>I would really think twice recommending this to the casual film-goer without a spoilerish hint about its content. Your mileage may vary.<br/><br/>Hey if you really want a scary story, check out The Internet Movie Database's trivia section for ""Sinister"" after you see the movie. Read how the ""Pool Party"" scene was filmed. That's that's nuts. Nobody wants a director that committed. Somebody should have called OSHA. Seriously.<br/><br/>And here's a joke for you. Given the ""Super 8″ films we see in this movie, wouldn't it be blackly funny if this film were sequel to Steven Spielberg's heartwarming ""Super 8″ (2011)? It's all about the kids, right?"
"areadingwoman","10","2","3","24 May 2015"," One of the best movies I've seen in years!
","I don't tend to give unqualified praise often, but this movie was amazing. It was wildly atmospheric right from the start and while the images/ideas were very disturbing, it was never too gross to watch (which is a big hang up for me - I shouldn't want to close my eyes while watching a movie). But do be warned that the ideas are truly disturbing. This is particularly true if the idea of family violence is bothersome to you (my husband, for example, won't watch anything where people have to see/hear loved ones die). If you can get past that, you will be well rewarded. Ethan Hawke is amazing in this film as he vacillates between washed up, downtrodden middle aged writer and hot on the trail of something big alcoholic. He is so captivating that at a certain point you actually forget/don't care about the possible danger he puts his family in. And that makes the climax all the more enjoyable. Furthermore, this is not a film that is full of those ridiculous moments that horror movies are typically known for. Characters in this movie make exactly the same choices that I would reasonably make in such a messed up situation. It was quite refreshing to not have to spend most of the movie thinking that the characters are going to get exactly what they deserve for being so dang stupid. In fact, the only real issue I saw in the film (and it did bug me a lot), is that the whole premise is that in their new home Hawke finds an old school (50s-60s) reel projector with home videos. Even as a 40 year old man, the odds of knowing how to so skillfully work the old projector (not to mention hand splice the film) is a bit out there. Particularly since he sows no penchant for film in his every day life as a character. But perhaps that's just a back story that was never written in. I was certainly willing to overlook it given how truly terrifying the rest of the film was. It was worth every minute."

","You can read the other reviews for more of a synopsis, I'll leave that out, other than to say it's kind of a mix of a supernatural thriller and one of those ""found footage"" movies.<br/><br/>The jump scares didn't scare me much. The story was flat, and they didn't make me care about the characters. Like most supernatural horror movies, the supernatural premise was just dumb. Well, for example, I liked Occulus, whose premise was that this mirror was haunted by a spirit. OK, it was dumb, but other parts of the movie made it fun to watch. But with Sinister, the supernatural premise was also dumb, but there was nothing else cool about it to make it fun to watch.<br/><br/>So, this movie has a dumb premise AND it was no fun to watch. If you want to be horrified by awful ""found footage"" murder scenes you might like it.<br/><br/>I was just waiting and waiting for something interesting to happen, and it never did. Near the end I figured out the supernatural basis of everything, and it was a real letdown.<br/><br/>A lot of scenes make no sense, I'm sure someone else will lay them out, I can't do it since I didn't check the ""spoilers"" check box.<br/><br/>Overall I got to the end and felt like I just wasted my time..."
"guillermobosque","5","2","3","4 October 2014"," Despite Hawke's superb performance and a few scary moments, most of Sinister relies on cheap jump-scares.
","Summary: Despite Hawke's superb performance and a few scary moments, most of Sinister relies on cheap jump-scares. 50/100 (C)<br/><br/>True-crime writer Ellison Oswalt moves himself and his family into a house where a horrific crime took place earlier, but his family doesn't know. He is trying to find out more about the crime so he can write a new book about it to help his flailing career. He uses some ""snuff"" film footage he finds in the house to help in his research, but he soon finds more than he bargained for. There is a figure in each of the films, but who or what is it? As a result, his family start to suffer (as does he), and things take a turn for the worse. Will they survive? Sinister is a horror film written and directed by Scott Derrickson, and well... I'm not a huge fan of his previous work.<br/><br/>The opening scene is awesome and looks realistic, but this little scene becomes quite tedious because is being constantly repeated throughout the film again and again, making it less effective. But the movie boasts an interesting story, also Ethan Hawke's performance was awesome and you can feel identified with his character. It has enough originality in some of the scares and it definitely stands out from other films of the genre. The special effects were generally good, except in a few scenes where lots of CGI were used on some crappy ghost-kids. The CGI scenes disgusted me so much, because the film doesn't need them at all.<br/><br/>What I really found interesting and clever, is the content of the Super 8 tapes, it's undoubtedly scary. Some scenes made me jump and they looked very realistic. It's pretty decent and the performances were very enjoyable, in spite of some awful child actors. It's also very sad to see Hawke's character, for some strange reason I felt sorry for him, he just wanted to write his book and be famous again. For me, the stars of the film are Hawke and Juliet Rylance, these two actors were very professional in the movie, they seem serious all time and I really enjoyed every conversation they had, all their fights, discussions, etc.<br/><br/>It has too much suspense at times and becomes boring. It's filled with a bunch of generic loud noises, cheap jump-scares and constant darkness. I've seen Sinister more than three times already: the first time I saw it by myself, the second time I saw it with my sister, and the last time I saw it alone... again. I really wanted to like it. Anyway, it's just not my type of horror film. I do not recommend Sinister for horror fans, it's very boring, the editing is horrible and its plot is cliché. On the upside, the script is solid at times, it has quality performances and some suspense. With all that, it creates a mildly frightening atmosphere.<br/><br/>I think that it has enough jump-scares and good performances to satisfy a big part of the clueless audience. Moving on, the last fifteen minutes are quite messy, while at times it kept the tension, nobody can rescue the film of being a total boredom. It became very explicit in its final act. Also, the last scare of the movie was silly and predictable. Sinister fails to convince and entertain. I'm a huge fan of Hawke but the movie doesn't deserve a positive review because it has lots of flaws, especially in its final act. I would like to see less of the villain (Mr. Boogie) in the film, unfortunately they showed way too much of him and became less scary.<br/><br/>As I said, the acting was great, Ethan Hawke and the charismatic British actress Juliet Rylance were excellent. The script is mostly solid, the content of the Super 8 tapes is very disturbing, and there were a few scary moments in the movie. I recommend it if you expect great performances or if you get scared easily. On the downside: all the suspense built up throughout the film falls flat at the end, the performances of some ""ghost"" children were awful and some of the actions of the characters were somewhat stupid. So, if you want an entertaining, memorable and well-executed horror movie, Sinister is not your best choice. (C)"

","I've always been a fan of the horror genre, but it seems like these days horror films are too contrived. So I'm always on the lookout for something with a little more character. I had heard promising things about this movie so I was very eager to sit down and watch it. I'm not gonna bother giving a synopsis or a plot summary since that's already available on IMDb but I will say that I really liked the storyline. Sure, it's not the most incredible plot ever written, but it's engaging enough. For those of you who are wondering why I gave this movie a 9, allow me to explain. I typically rate movies according to their genres, and intended reactions. In this case, the purpose of a horror film is to scare the crap out of people. I personally felt this film did a great job in the scare department. This movie not only feels solid because of its plot, but also because of Ethan Hawke's acting. Seriously, this dude brought so much personality to the role. This movie wouldn't be half of what it is without him. Overall: if you're a horror fan this movie is worth seeing."

","Moving into a new house to get in a proper head-space for his next book, a writer and his family find themselves under attack by a strange serial killer that struck previous families in the house and that in fighting him may be more difficult than imagined when he finds out it may not be human.<br/><br/>This here turned out to be quite decent for the most part and really above-average at times. The main thing that really hurts this one is the fact that there's just so much time going by of fiddling with the cameras and not doing much of anything here. The build-up takes far too long to get going that there's an air of boredom at times when it's just him by himself viewing the tapes, and while it does focus on the creepy images at the appropriate times the fact that there's no other true scare-inspiring device in the film beyond the home movies tends to make the whole thing go into repeat especially with the spousal arguments that continually creep up and knock this one down a bit for the feeling of extending the length because it has to. That said, there's a lot to like elsewhere in here as the tapes do get progressively creepier and creepier with their rather haunting and hypnotic images, managing to make them feel like true voyeur pieces despite the heinous actions being committed and there's a real sense of enjoyment it gets from this feeling that's quite contagious at times. The spill-over into real life with the assaults on the family make for quite a creepy telling, and the final half is just insanely good with a lot to really like there with the revelation of the murders, the crime spree in the house and the final twist which is quite good. Coupled with one of the more inventive and genuinely creepy monsters that's actually helped by his back-story and there's a lot of good stuff here to overcome the few flaws.<br/><br/>Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language and extreme amounts of screen-time with children-in-jeopardy."

Also the music played during some of the murders is really creepy and haunting - some may find it disturbing. <br/><br/>The plot has a really good twist and not what I was expecting.

There wasn't much fanfare when it was released. It was a real sleeper that packed a nasty punch. Like a Stephen King story on steroids. Refreshing that it's not as gory as some of it's contemporaries. It tells us a simple story that seems almost too familiar.

","I've been interested in the work of Director / Writer Scott Derrickson since hearing he was a Christian many years back. I was fascinated to find someone else who shared not only my basic religious beliefs but also had a passion for the horror and science fiction genres I love so much. It's not often you hear of Christians who are successful in Hollywood.<br/><br/>Derrickson has an impressive resume of films and actors he's worked with over the years. His early endeavors consist of writing ""Urban Legends: Final Cut"" and directing and penning ""Hellraiser: Inferno."" He moved on to take the helm of ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" and ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose."" Both of these films starred well-respected actors like Keanu Reeves, Laura Linney, and Tom Wilikinson. His latest film ""Sinister"" ranks at the top of his filmmaking career.<br/><br/>True crime writer Ellison Oswald (Ethan Hawke) gained notoriety ten years ago with a book about a grisly murder. After a couple unsuccessful novels, Oswald is looking to repeat his success and return to the top of the bestseller list. He takes up residence in the home where the victims he's investigating actually lived and were killed.<br/><br/>While moving in, he discovers a box of Super 8 movies which hold footage of several brutal murders that he believes somehow tie together. As Oswald digs deeper into each crime, his world begins to crumble around him. Is he losing his sanity or is there a supernatural force out to get him and his family?<br/><br/>""Sinister"" is the culmination of everything good about several horror sub-genres. You have the ""Paranormal Activity"" found footage concept covered through the use of the Super 8 films. People who enjoy movies with supernatural entities like the ones in ""The Grudge,"" ""Boogeyman,"" and others of that nature will enjoy it. Those who crave modern day ghost stories like ""The Pact,"" ""The Apparition,"" and ""Insidious"" will love it as well. There really is something for every type of horror enthusiast in ""Sinister.""<br/><br/>The movie isn't a sloppy hodge-podge of those movies, either. Derrickson ties everything together with a script that makes sense and a story that is well-paced and intriguing. It has slow-burning suspense and jump- scares combined together to keep you on the edge of your seat and nervously awaiting the next disturbing scene.<br/><br/>""Sinister"" is a satisfying horror film which will appeal to many types of fright fans. It's a successful combination of old and new tricks. When it comes to what we see on screen, it has more in common with Hitchcock than it does gorier fare like ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and the likes.

"Nixonbrian42","10","2","3","26 February 2013"," All the hype steered me towards Sinister and YES it lived up to all of it!!!
","On average most of the horror films that emerge, for me, seem to be redundant, cheaply made profit baggers constructed with little or no respect for either the horror film fans or the genre itself. I find myself hoping, with any horror film I come across, that the movie will be really good, legitimately creepy and unsettling with a crew of actors and a director that you can just feel did everything in their power to achieve something of style and substance. This is a very rare find and I have to admit, constantly looking for such a classy show wears me out and repeatedly lets me down. In an ironic way the constant let downs makes a masterpiece like Sinister all the more rewarding.<br/><br/>The director, Scott Derrickson, impressed me once before with The Exorcism Of Emily Rose. This is a director that seems to have a heart for the horror films he crafts, he knows that quality is what's important; mood, atmosphere, genuine non-stop suspense and tension. His direction is careful and precise which is what sets Sinister apart from other similar forgettable films. In short, this is how it's done.<br/><br/>As for Ethan Hawke, in my opinion, this is his finest work. Pay close attention, he dominates the entire movie with a performance that is flawless. Every emotion is displayed to perfection. The rest of the cast gives it their all as well. <br/><br/>I really don't want to spoil anything by saying any more. I'm sure you already know the main plot: A true crime writer moves his family into a new home with a vicious past to juice up his writing career. The discovery of a collection of 8 mm film rolls unravels some monstrous details. <br/><br/>The ending is chilling.<br/><br/>A must see for horror fans."

I like my horror's American and foreign, I also like the more clever horror's without the age old heroin making silly decisions which would not happen in real life. Warning this review may contain spoilers!! Firstly the acting from the main character is good, admittedly the wife and police officer are lousy in places but I don't think it matters really. After all the story isn't about them and they don't really appear much. The story centres around a struggling writer who is trying to write a new best seller about a family who were murdered, he moves into their old house with his family. He finds a box of old super 8 films in the attic and a projector, he of course views them and sees that they are all about family murders which date back to the 1960's. The films themselves were suitably creepy and very well done. The lawnmower one in particular was a jumper! The plot was nice, not too complicated but interesting enough, the end twist was nicely done. I was pleasantly surprised that the film made me jump a few times and that doesn't often happen. In fact the only other which did was Insidious. This is one of what seems to be a new genre of film which get back to good old creeps and jumps. Not a moment too soon for me! Slasher films have been done to death and the creepy paranormal films in my view are the one's which stay with you the longest and make you not want to go upstairs into the dark.<br/><br/>All in all a very good film, could not have been more impressed."

","So, I was seriously disappointed by REC 3: GENESIS. And by Sinister, the much-hyped love for horror genre has increased or should I say compensated.<br/><br/>Sinister starts out slow but eventually takes pace and indulges you into the nightmare, along. Superb background score, fantastic direction and the casting is also good. Fresh writing. Even thought the story might prove hackneyed to some, the sequences will scare you. If these don't, then grab a ball, you!<br/><br/>From the producers of Paranormal Activity, this one is a charmer. A must watch for every horror-genre lover.<br/><br/>WATCH OUT FOR: the indigenous horror scenes throughout the movie.<br/><br/>Can be watched with a atypical Indian family?

"danneman_857","9","2","3","8 December 2012"," High expectations - still satisfied!
","The last time I went to see a horror movie in the cinemas was when I saw ""Insidious"". While Insidious didn't deliver, this one did, oh yeah it really did!<br/><br/>Its about a couple who moves to a new house because the father in the family wants to write another successful book. He is a famous writer who tells stories about crimes that hasn't been solved. In the new house he finds evidence on crimes that are too horrible even for a ""Crime-author"" like him. He struggles with his feelings about either calling the police or unravel one of the biggest crime mysteries ever.<br/><br/>Actually I don't know why I had such a good feeling about this one before i stepped in to the theater. But my gut feeling was right!<br/><br/>The best horror movie since paranormal activity! I think the main reason I liked it so much was because of the ending. Just as Paranormal Activity you sit with chills and pumping heart in the end, waiting for what will happen!<br/><br/>Great movie! 9/10"
"JodieGreenEyes","8","2","3","28 November 2012"," Not perfect but close.......Definitely well worth a look.
","This is a really good film, good plot, good choice of 'murderer' and good idea for the Evil What/Who that possesses the 'killer'. I actually hadn't figured out who it was....which is a hard thing for a film maker to pull of...so, that's a huge bonus. There's lots of tension and creepy atmoshpere in the film, the brilliant soundtrack aiding that, so if that's what you're looking for you'll get lots here. I didn't give the film a 10 because the director/writer got the 'murderer' to act way too clichéd..?!! The over-acting is so hard to ignore it takes away from the impact. I'm also taking a point off for the scene where a thick branch of a tree is sawn off - from a distance - by someone using a little saw at the end of a long long handle! An impossibility. Also, though the characters bickered like any family, I didn't feel that these 4 individuals were family. There are a few more bad bits that I could point out but...let's get back to a major good point...the film left me wanting more. What's the story behind the evil Who/What....why did the killings begin...etc. So yeah I do want to see ''Sinister II'...even though sequels are never as good, but,...well, you never know...let's give it a chance. Altogether one of the better horrors I've seen in a long time. I'd give it an 8.5. Enjoy!"

","Scott Derrickson. Get used to the name. As we speak he's got five horror projects on the go, including a 'Poltergeist' remake. His 'Sinister' deftly sidesteps most clichés of the genre and manages to be genuinely frightening. Filmed using only the barest light, Derrickson ratchets up tension and knows exactly when to press the 'scare' button. He doesn't waste time with false alarms. If he means to scare, he does so at the first attempt. And boy does he succeed. <br/><br/>Ethan Hawke plays Ellison Oswalt, a struggling true-crime writer desperate to equal the success of his magnum opus, 'Kentucky Blood'. He persuades his English wife (RADA-trained Juliet Rylance) and two kids to move into a house with a macabre history which, of all people, the local Sheriff urges them to leave. <br/><br/>Oswalt discovers a box of old 8mm films in the attic. Curiosity gets the better of him and he plays them. Each starts innocently enough, showing a family playing or swimming, but end with them being horrifically murdered by a faceless killer. Although what he sees is enough to turn him into an alcoholic and destroy his family, he sits through all the films, believing that the (unsolved) murders provide the material to write 'the best book anyone has ever read' (I noticed he doesn't say 'ever written'). <br/><br/>Technology, that bane of every modern filmmaker is manipulated superbly here. Oswalt resourcefully learns how to edit a film reel after one catches fire, and, with a hacker's dexterity, uses his laptop to piece together information about the murders. While editing images from the scenes, he notices a chilling figure, resembling a much scarier version of 'The Crow'. My heart stopped when the figure turns its head towards us. <br/><br/>The inclusion of Ethan Hawke, a solid but underused actor, is a reason why this film eclipses most horrors of the past decade. He conveys fear so well, and acts brilliantly when confronting supernaturalism. Vincent D'Onofrio has an excellent cameo as the occult expert, who provides Oswalt with information on paganism via Skype. <br/><br/>Not since 2004's 'Saw' have I been this impressed with a horror film. It's perhaps the most difficult genre to get right because, as Scott Derrickson knows only too well, we just aren't scared of anything anymore. Apart from 'Sinister', that is."
"The_creator2010","7","2","3","17 October 2012"," Nothing too original, but succeeds in fulfilling the premise of a clever ""Horror"" movie
","Sinister is written and directed by Scott Derrickson, who judging by his resume, this guy loves his horror movies; that I don't have a problem with! I was really looking forward to this flick for two reasons; Insidious was one of my favourite horror movies of the last ten years, so my anticipation grew with the production of Sinister carrying the same producer. And B, prior to seeing Sinister, I watched ""House at the End of the street"" which left me desperate for something fresh.<br/><br/>Ellison (Ethan Hawke) is an accomplished writer who brews his career through the premise of true-crime stories. His obsession is based around the majority of murders and mysteries surrounding them, with a weight of controversy surrounding his Journalistic morals.<br/><br/>Ellison is hell bent on reaching a peak he is yet to discover in his career while trying to convince himself of the stories he covers are for the people, and not for fame. It is no convenience when he moves his family into their new home, a suburban crime scene; a freakish killing spree that resulted in the hanging of an entire family. Desperate for his big break, Ellison has to manage the Ora surrounding the town and its unspoken crime, and his wife Tracy (Juliet Rylance) who is convinced of a refreshing start to a troubled past.<br/><br/>Although the Sheriff (Fred Dalton Thompson) voiced his own opinion about Ellison's reputation, it doesn't stop the willingness behind Ellison's personality as he stumbles across a box of horrific surprises that hold a motive behind his current investigation.<br/><br/>Without hesitation, Ellison puts the mysterious reel of tapes together as he is disturbed but yet satisfied to witness a plethora of found-footage images that take him on a journey through a nightmare worse than he could have imagined.<br/><br/>Desperate to fulfil is unwanted duties, Ellison discovers a dark figure within the murders, a supernatural spirit that haunts those who discover the tapes.<br/><br/>Ellison's insight into the murders reveal an origin of secrets that is sure to shock the town as he believes, in cliché journalistic fashion, ""the people must to know"". Although Ellison is not prepared for the danger he could place on his wife and kids as a demon lurks behind his projector of evidence.<br/><br/>Judging a book by its cover is not my thing, but by its introduction, that is how I roll!. On the off, Sinister invites you down a dark and twisted path, most likely a journey that you will have never witnessed before. The first scene reveals a taste of refreshing initiative. Originality is not the main key to Sinister because to be blunt, it ain't original, but it is really scary.<br/><br/>The main premise is the constant suspense that is revealed within the tapes. It is not graphically gory, just down right disturbing with each video backed up with a frightening tune. Just like Paranormal Activity, the majority of scares are within the backing of found-footage. But apart from the mundane routine events in 21st century horror movies, Sinister succeeds in disturbing the mind of the viewer without actual ""Jump-Scares"" scenes.<br/><br/>The plot is fascinating in it's own sick way, following a puzzle that I had no idea how it would come together, but it did, and it did so in original fashion.<br/><br/>Looking at the majority of Horrors this year, it is obvious to label Sinister as the best, and certainly the scariest movie of 2012 thus far. I adore my horror movies so I was quite satisfied with a concept that is not entirely fresh, but revealed scenes with simple ideas and found a way of visually implanting an image into the viewers head. It is not always about the full on graphic that disturbs the mind, it is the motive behind it that really gets the viewers asking questions, and better yet, remembering something that almost feels a supernatural reality.<br/><br/>Overall/rating; Not entirely original with the folks behind the scenes nit-picking at Insidious and Paranormal Activity. However, the overall creation of horror is really frightening, with scenes that some viewers may find disturbing. Sinister is a successful result of a genre that has unfortunately been the subject of poor and effortless movies lately.

I'm a big fan of Ethan Hawk and usually like what he does but I felt his character was vapid and didn't really give a performance I'm accustomed to seeing.<br/><br/>The older cop did a good job but the younger cop didn't seem like a cop, rather an actor playing a cop but forgot to act cop-like of that makes any sense.<br/><br/>My biggest problem with this film was it was very dark as in no one in the movie ever thought to turn on the lights, even when most people would.<br/><br/>The demon could have been used in a better way rather than give him a typical background story and make these kids do all the dirty work which all of them looking from all the other typical scary kids from so many other Hollywood horror films- nothing unique here."
"cwells-575-680347","3","1","1","21 May 2020"," The film that almost was
","I wanted to like this movie and really tried but unfortunately I saw a lot of problems that the filmmakers could have avoided.<br/><br/>First off the film is super dark and for some strange reason none of the characters ever turn on the lights. I thought it was because they move into this new house but as they get settled and clearly have electricity, once it's nighttime their light switches are never in the on position. Even when they need to see they would much rather grab a flashlight than turn on the lights.<br/><br/>Cheep thrills. This film did things that were just cheap, like the demons face on the computer turning when Ethan Hawks character is distracted. Why? Less is more. Once you have the demon turning his head I felt cheated because now the mystery is gone.<br/><br/>Something to laugh about was once they decide to move out of this house, where a murder took place, Hawk's character throughout the film says their family is luring for money and yet they move into this huge, I mean super huge mansion at the end of the film. I thought they were having money problems- apparently not, And you'd think this house would have lights but again, no one ever turns them on, even when they hear a bump in the night.<br/><br/>Overall I can't recommend this film. It could have been better if they did one more rewrite, tweak a few things. Don't have creepy dead children shushing the screen because we've seen this before, maybe be more original than that.<br/><br/>The one good thing I did like was the 8MM footage they used, that seemed out of place because once you find out who's behind it you'd wish they took that footage and put it in something more Sinister."
"lexva5","5","1","1","20 April 2020"," So so horror
","A fairly good atmospheric horror movie that could have been 30 mins shorter. It has too long drawn out sequences that ultimately I began to lose interest at certain points. The story is too much based on the father s point of view and he is barely a likable character, very one dimensional actually. He is obstinate as well.
This leaves the ending without a punch almost. This film is competent enough but not special. The characters do not remain with you after the credits roll"
"lizxypopcornkid","6","1","1","10 April 2020"," Good until the end.... trust me the ending sucks!
","Ok.... so the first half of this movie so well done with fantastic performances from everyone! This strange mystery enfolding in front of family man drives everybody to the edge of their seats, not only is the strange deity Bagul extremely creepy and causes tour spine to tingle but he is never seen from a full point. That's what makes him so scary ,illusive and dangerous the watcher is more scared when we do not see him as we don't know what he really looks like but we know he is there. That's why I think when he is shown too much he becomes less scary and with every continues jump scare of his not truly terrifying blue face springing out Lila smurf is just overdone and not scary (but I don't know I don't scare easy.)
The last 30 minutes or so of the film are entirely predictable and in no way make up for the brilliant first half of the film.
I do plan on watching the second one and hope the ending is less tedious- sorry to all the fans of this."

","Watched this film on Netflix as I'd heard half decent things about it and nothing else good was one. Surprised us all how terrifying it was. The videos shown throughout the film make it feel more genuine and keep the atmosphere genuinely chilling throughout, and The minimalism of the Antagonist's prescience in the film helped bring tensions to boiling point, helped by the fact the Antagonist was one of the creepiest characters in recent horror, with the obscured images of him in the background making you feel paranoid of being watched. Ethan Hawke puts up a brilliant performance and I would recommend this as the scariest film of Netflix as of me writing this."
"rpr-46-242049","9","1","1","8 September 2019"," Genuine scary movie
","The first movie since I was a child that actually scared me. This movie produces constant dread with a few shout out loud surprise scares. (I did not scream. A lawyer in his 70's does not scream. Those were high pitched shouts.) Ethan Hawk, who does a good job with any part he takes, plays the washed up author who had one best seller too long ago. Desperate to repeat success, he moves his family into a house to write a book about the prior residents who would up handing around the tree in the back yard (literally).

","Sinister is an average horror film for the most part that isn't very scary. The jump scares are pretty poorly done, and at times it feels a bit silly and cliche. But, I am a fan of how dark the actual story is, and how a decent bit of the murders is actually shown in the rolls of film that are found by Ethan Hawke's character. Take out the silly jump scares and the demon children running around the house in the second half of the runtime, and it's a pretty solid horror movie.

Sinister, is the total opposite of all the above. It is based, initially, on something I have read to have happened in real life. The events shown in the videos that the protagonist is watching, can happen and have happened.<br/><br/>This is what makes it so Sinister. Really. Including the music that plays during the videos. It was petrifying and to this day, I feel like I want to watch it again, but I can't because I know it left a big impression on me the first time.<br/><br/>Worth watching for anyone looking for a more than Decent horror movie.

","Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadger<br/><br/>First off, this film surprised me greatly. After watching amazing horror films like The Babadook, The Conjuring 1 and 2, and The Descent, I went into this film with low expectations and was thoroughly entertained. The story is dark, disturbing, and gruesome. The imagery used throughout the film is very scary and the tapes add to the horror. The plot twist was very good and the ending was frightening.<br/><br/>The acting is mostly good. Ethan Hawke always performs well in every o=movie I have seen him in. Hawke is accompanied by Juliet Rylance, Fred Dalton Thompson, Michael Hall D'Addario, and Clare Foley who all perform well. James Ransone performs the worst because his character is dry and he can't act very well.<br/><br/>The pacing is slow in some parts but it is mostly consistent. The runtime is a little overlong.<br/><br/>Pros: Dark and disturbing story, the tapes, good plot twist, a scary ending, good acting, and Ethan Hawke's performance<br/><br/>Cons: Some slow pacing, James Ransone's dry performance, and an overlong runtime<br/><br/>Overall rating: 7.0"

","Its rare for a horror movie to impress me, and this one simply shines with the perfect blend of horror, mystery, thriller and really invests one into the life of a true crime writer's life. Amazing performance by Ethan Hawk he always impresses and much credit goes to Scott Derrickson for the writing, definitely top notch for a horror movie. It consists of genuine scares throughout and executed perfectly. And what works about all this is that its all kept as grounded as possible. The end however wasn't that grounded which makes one think that it could have been better but its acceptable considering the plot was eventually gonna go that path.

","I probably shouldn't have watched this the evening after seeing The Conjuring as there are similarities and that film is a much more confident and fundamentally scary movie. I understand Ethan Hawke was not only very keen to play this role but also recommended Juliet Rylance as his wife. I don't think Hawke is really up to this role which is a difficult one as he has to play by himself for much of the time. Neither do I feel there is any rapport between the two. I did like the unusual score, I loved the opening and closing credits (which really are creepy) and felt that the children were effective. Being an old 8mm buff myself, I much enjoyed the playing with these found films and the whole exciting business of editing. I was also most impressed with the 'Skype' sequences when Hawke gets to hear the views of an eccentric university professor. I thought these scenes were amazingly well done and that the film caught fire during these sequences. If only the whole film could have been run at this same tempo and level of weirdness, because it did have the potential to be as scary as The Conjuring."
"sjstaps","7","1","1","7 September 2017"," Turn on some lights?
","During the whole movie, Ethan always forgets to turn on a little bit of light. It is quite difficult to notice some scary figure when it's so damn dark. He also does not listen to his kids at all, hello?! - number one rule of being a father. Why see those film shots anyway? And call the cops or this university guy? The movie was reasonable good, but did not keep me thinking. I find the story disappointing, and plot could not have been worse. He did not even write the book. C'mon!"
"areatw","7","1","1","1 December 2016"," Compelling and creepy
","I much prefer horror films with a naturally scary and compelling story behind them than those that simply adopt jump scares with little regard for any sort of plot, and while 'Sinister' is guilty of cheap scares and the odd ridiculous aspect, it is built upon a solid and extremely creepy mystery.<br/><br/>Sure, it is riddled with clichés and lacks originality in the way it frightens, but ultimately you watch a horror movie to be scared, and 'Sinister' is successfully scary. The suspense builds nicely and the mystery will keep you guessing and guessing until the end.<br/><br/>'Sinister' is a compelling and creepy horror movie that will satisfy most fans of this genre, even those that aren't easily scared."
"filipemanuelneto","7","1","1","21 November 2016"," Clever and chilling
","When I watched this movie I had few expectations about it, but I ended up being satisfied with what I saw. The story revolves around a true-crime writer who, inadvertently, stumbles on a bunch of old movies with macabre scenes of murder. But if you're expecting gore and litres of blood, forget it. What is more frightening in the film is precisely what the cameras don't show but know how to suggest. The crime scenes are truly remarkable, and they were done cleverly in a long-disused (Super 8) video film that was cleverly honoured. The film is getting more and more intense, as events occur that reveal the true nature of the killer. The ending is at least unexpected. The soundtrack accompanies every moment with great discretion, managing to avoid imposing itself on the action of the film. Scott Derrickson, the director / writer, deserves the laurels, as does Ethan Hawke, who brings the lead actor to life."
"goccukgurbaa","7","1","1","5 November 2016"," it really scares
","I like horror movies. They don't scare me much but I love the chilly feeling. Sinister is one of the most scary movies I've ever watched. I got so scared that I had to pause the movie and convinced myself that the scenes are not real several times. I had no idea if the movie is about a real world killer or a paranormal thing and you can't tell it in the first 30 minutes. I believe this part of the movie is the scariest one. In the rest of the movie, the story unfolds and you can predict the ending. So the scare level degrades. Nevertheless Sinister scares you until the ending. It's a good movie with good directing and acting and a mediocre story. I highly recommend it."
"DVR_Brale","7","1","1","27 August 2016"," Sinister has a context in which it's horror elements can add to each other and thus accelerate you into terror
","I still remember seeing Sinister four years later after it hit the cinema. And I don't think I'm ever going to forget that day I went to see it. This is the first and only movie I almost quit watching half-way through (if you ignore Sinister 2 which is second worse horror movie I've ever seen, right behind Deliver Us From Evil).<br/><br/>Let me immediately emphasize what exactly made Sinister such a frightening experience for me. It is soundtrack. Sinister has the scariest soundtrack I've ever heard. It blends so well and so naturally with the movie in a way that it makes all the scary moments even more scary and horrible. Take a look at, for example, Sleepy Time '98. Don't tell me this music alone doesn't make you nervous.<br/><br/>If you combine really creepy soundtrack with disturbing and mysterious snuff videotapes, which permeate the entire movie and go one by one not even allowing you to recover from the previous, then you have a movie which accelerates you into horror. I remember thus reaching a tipping point where I wanted to exit the cinema because tension seemed to grow exponentially. It does and it doesn't stop until the very end. If you've seen the original Paranormal Activity (2007) then you sort of know what awaits you.<br/><br/>So, I've asked myself how come Sinister utilizes this simple concept so well and it's sequel, while using the same strategy, fails miserably? Yes, original Sinister has far better soundtrack and a little better snuff movies, but that's not enough to make such a big difference. The explanation lies in utilizing different sub-genre: original Sinister is a mystery horror; sequel doesn't have a strong mystery side but replaces it with a romantic side story. Sinister is so scary because it has a certain framework in which his horror elements make sense and can fully develop. Sinister 2 just tosses snuff videotapes into us as if they alone are enough to make you uncomfortable.<br/><br/>Chemistry between family members is far, far more convincing in original sinister then the sequel. Ethan Hawk has been nominated for two more Oscars after playing Ellison Oswalt in Sinister. James Ransone played deputy in the original, but became the main star in the sequel! Some critics blabbered about Ethan Hawk's performance not being convincing. He was solid; nothing more and nothing else.<br/><br/>To conclude: There is nothing original about Sinister horror fans hadn't seen before. There are some clichés as well. But Sinister manages to create an ambient in which it's horror elements can add to each other and so accelerate you into terror. So don't buy it from critics: Sinister is not about story or actor's performance. It's about making you more nervous and agitated with each one of it's flicks. That is if you don't find the main premise repulsive. If you can bare it to the end, not quitting like I almost did, you'll be in for an interesting ending."
"jacklmauro","8","1","1","12 October 2015"," Nicely Creepy
","Why all the disparagement here? Why the fierce objections to found footage once again used as a plot device? Virtually every device in all genres has been endlessly employed - what matters is if the film works, and this film works. Ethan Hawke is believable as the tortured author, and he thankfully does not overplay the angst card. The wife is a thankless role, but such wives in such movies usually are. The point is, the story unfolds at a nice pace, and the use of the footage is just downright chilling. I take 2 points off for the hero's failure to connect some fairly obvious dots, regarding his own children and the kids of the murdered families; seriously, the daughter's knowledge and painting of the missing Stephanie was a massive alert. Nonetheless, and while no work of art, 'Sinister' is an engaging and well-crafted horror flick. PS No happy ending here."
"NateWatchesCoolMovies","8","1","1","7 October 2015"," Sinister indeed. Freezes your blood to inky black.
","It isn't easy to come across a horror movie that genuinely scary these days. So when a flick like the effectively creepy, gripping Sinister comes along, one must take note. It contains many of the tropes and tricks we see employed in countless cannon fodder horror duds churned out by folks that wouldn't know an effective scare from a hole in he ground. And yet, the makers of this one, especially the composer who I'll touch on in a moment too, craft their story in such a way that all of that feels fresh, organic and most of the time downright terrifying. There's such a thickening blanket of dread over the movie that I had to watch an episode of Wet Hot American Summer right after, just to undiminish the creeping fear that it set on me and ensure I could get to sleep OK. The plot is familiar within the genre: an edgy true crime writer (Ethan Hawke) arrives at a new house, where murders took place (which he doesn't tell his wife, the prick) with his family to document the horrors of the past for his new book. He discovers an old box of super 8 film stock in the attic, containing blood freezing, candid accounts of various different murders, each more panic inducing than the last. These tapes hold the core of what makes the film so scary: They're jagged, nightmarish POV visions of atrocities too unsettling in nature to mention here. Composer Christopher Young should be truly proud of his work here; the sounds he makes to go along with the films are beyond anything I've heard on film before, and resemble actual passages of otherworldy music floating through a rift from another dimension. As soon as he watches the tapes weird things start happening, of course. His kids get hellish night terrors, he sees things, and a malevolent forces encircles him and his family. The human drama and writing, an element which is tragically often left by the wayside in the horror genre, is excellent here, a particular standout being a third act fight between Hawke and his wife that feels realistically desperate, handled wonderfully by the duo. There's nice work form actor turned politician turned actor Fred Dalton Thompson as a cranky local Sheriff, and a cameo via Skype from Wilson Fisk himself, Vincent D'Onofrio. Seldom these days do we find a horror that really sends the creepin willies up your spine and hurries your walk from the dark kitchen to tour room at night by double time. To any movie that manages this for me: mission accomplished."
"toddg-473-289818","9","1","1","3 October 2015"," understated and scary
","This movie could have easily gone off the slippery slope of too much blood and gore, seeing that the subject matter involves the mass murder of families over several decades. Fortunately, it uses several moments of shock value that are shared with the audience as the main character Ellison gradually discovers what is haunting him and his family.<br/><br/>The script and direction give broad license for the enormous talents of Ethan Hawke to be put on display, especially in his nonverbal expressions of fear and uncertainty. My only complaint is that the end of the movie (which requires the spoiler alert), too easily spoon feeds the audience in explaining the evil deeds of the ghostly children. Giving the viewer the ""aha"" moment could have been explained in one scene instead of several. But that is a minor point in an otherwise well executed, chilling movie."

","Almost an excellent example of what horror films should be. A plot with actual reason behind the spooky/scary happenings and which actually gives some context to the characters' motives - not usual in the horror genre which commonly puts sod all effort into character & plot development and everything into 'ooo how can we get the audience to jump next?'.<br/><br/>I don't feel the supernatural element was needed in all fairness. I think it would have worked better as a simple serial-killer story. That being said at least in the main the supernatural stuff was done properly.<br/><br/>My main gripe (once again) is the protagonist's sheer stubbornness to leave the property where they're having all the problems. OK, I get he's an ambitious writer who thinks he's on to something big and about to finally catch his big story, but after maybe the third incident any sane person would either leave or bring in the police. But like virtually all horror films Ethan Hawke persists long after any normal person would and time after time I find myself saying 'oh come on, by now you'd definitely leave'! 'surely he's gonna leave now'?.<br/><br/>Oh, and the other issue (although not quite as bad in this) is the characters' reluctance to turn lights on! You hear a noise in the living room, you'd turn the bloody light on! Just because it's a horror film doesn't mean every scene has to be pitch black - and if it is going to be, at least give it a reason to be, rather than turning the characters into idiots!"
"jethrotroll-30807","8","1","1","29 May 2015"," Disturbing and Creepy as Hell
","You can nitpick the horror movie genre to death, since basically everything that could be done has been done. So, I don't know why some bother. Yet, with every horror release we see hundreds of so-called horror fans that do just that. It makes you wonder if they're really fans of the genre at all. To me, it's simple. It has to be scary. If it does that, it did it's job. And with 'Sinister', you get that. It delivers big time.<br/><br/>There's a few things that made Sinister so disturbing to me. First of all, the musical score is brilliant. It may be the creepiest background music I've ever heard. The entire movie has this sense of dread and doom permeating through it. Secondly, the home movies/snuff films are brilliantly done as well, and are some of the most disturbing footage I've ever seen in a film. They are integral to the plot of the movie as they reveal hidden and subtle clues as to what is going on. Yet, they harbor a much more sinister agenda as well. Then there is Bughuul. You don't see much of him, nor do you know much about him, and that just adds to the creepiness when you do see him. And if you've bought into the movie like I did, I guarantee you'll love the ending. It's chilling and macabre. And without giving too much away, the good guys don't always win in the end. Which is unusual in films.<br/><br/>Now, I'm not saying the movie is perfect, because it's not. I didn't think there was much chemistry between the husband and wife. Also, there were some campy scenes centered around their son sleepwalking and having night tremors. You also have the town sheriff that doesn't want the family there. And then there's the young, bumbling deputy that's eager to help. You get the picture.<br/><br/>In the end though, despite it's flaws, this movie does what it's supposed to do. I recommend watching this movie at night with the lights out. And afterwards, don't be surprised if you leave an extra light or two on when you go to bed. Sweet dreams."

","I suppose how much you enjoy Sinister will depend on how well you know your horror movies. Enough time has elapsed since The Ring for Hollywood to think that most audiences will have forgotten about 'that sort of horror.' Ethan Hawke plays a real-crime writer, who deliberately moves his family into the home of another family who were all murdered, so that he can study tapes of the crime for his upcoming book. Once there, he naturally starts finding himself in the middle of all sorts of spooky goings on.<br/><br/>The Ring had a 'killer video tape,' whereas Sinister has... well, it's not completely different. And instead of a female lead investigating it, you have Ethan Hawke. And so on. Okay, so Sinister isn't a complete rip-off of The Ring, but it just felt like it was definitely in the same area of dark, brooding, supernatural, creepy horror.<br/><br/>And it's not bad. With the seemingly endless flow of monster/ghost movies out there, it takes something a little different to stand out. And Sinister just about manages to raise its head above the pile. If you read the marketing, you'll see people raving about just how scary it was. I didn't find it that scary, but that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it.<br/><br/>It is quite dark - by that I mean literally (not just the subject matter, which, obviously, is also quite dark). The film is mainly shot inside one house which you could be forgiven for thinking that they don't have a single light bulb in any room. Some may say that adds to the atmosphere, others may find it too hard to tell what's going on. Perhaps my only gripe would be that I found the whole family a little annoying. Ethan Hawke's character is obsessed with being famous. His 'loving' wife never seems to bother looking after the kids, leaving all disciplining to him (it even took me a while to work out whether the mother was actually the biological mother or a stepmother, as she repeatedly refers to the children - when speaking to her husband - as ""your children""). Plus the kids themselves are hardly endearing - the girl's okay, but the boy (don't be fooled by his haircut - he IS a boy) is surly and generally unlikeable.<br/><br/>It's no classic, but it does offer enough different to make it worth a watch.<br/><br/>Special mention to the local sheriff's deputy - just a minor, if quite cool character.<br/><br/>http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/"
"lists-9","8","1","1","18 May 2014"," Very creepy
","An extremely creepy film that manages to explore the darker side of human (and, possibly, inhuman) nature without wallowing in blood and overt violence. There is certainly plenty of violence and cruelty in the film, but these are largely implied rather than shown, and this is the film's strength.<br/><br/>The opening scene hits the viewer right between the eyes with a horrific event captured by the cold eye of an old-fashioned 8mm camera. The viewer immediately wants to know why this is being filmed (a question later asked by the central character), and this becomes the movie's theme.<br/><br/>As Ellison Oswalt, a once successful true crime writer desperate to repeat his one success - now years in the past - Ethan Hawke makes an excellent Everyman and is convincing throughout. The rest of the cast are competent, but this is almost (not quite) a solo show. The film builds to a powerful climax, the only wrong note being that the spectres (when they appear) are too solid and prosaic, like children in face paint, marring the earlier mood of barely-glimpsed evil. Overall, though, well worth viewing."

","I love horror movies. But they have to be good horror movies. I don't like slashfests. I don't like writers who treat the viewer like a moron. I don't like plot holes you can drive a big rig through. I don't like to be left hanging at the end of the movie, wondering what the heck it was that just happened. Probably the last horror movie I liked was ""The Others."" I liked ""The Strangers,"" but it got too gory. I've been searching for something worthwhile to watch and had a lot of hope for ""The Conjuring."" (But honestly, as in ""The Conjuring,"" when you're dealing with a family that isn't even smart enough to own a flashlight, it was hard to have any empathy for them.) The night I watched ""Sinister,"" I had just finished watching ""The New Daughter"" and I can't recommend that, either.<br/><br/>Yes, ""Sinister"" requires you to have suspension of disbelief. But it does not require you to leave your brain at home. It is truly creepy in horrifically original ways. It doesn't throw out a lot of stupid red herrings that get you worked up over nothing or just leave you confused. I was gasping with shock up until the last frame. Ethan Hawke was awesome as the true crime writer whose subject matter for his current book leaves him coming slowly unglued, and with good reason.<br/><br/>This is a stark, sparse horror movie that doesn't waste your time with a lot of filler.

One of the most outstanding features of this movie are the sound effects, that will make you jump from your chair more than once throughout the whole movie. But that is not it, the story itself also holds a really creepy logic, and interesting too. The acting also is quite better than most of the horror movies we are used to seeing.

"farthngdr","9","1","1","5 January 2014"," ""Sinister"" is a masterful study of dread.
","Don't be fooled by comments from random viewers who say this movie isn't scary. It works its way into your head and, aided by Ethan Hawke's intense and convincing performance, it will follow you into your nightmares. It's not surprising in fact that the screenwriter based the story on a nightmare he had after watching ""The Ring,"" itself one of the most disturbing horror films ever made. The central conceit of ""Sinister""--that physical images, whether drawn, painted, photographed, or filmed, can have a life of their own--is ripe material for our media-saturated society. The idea that merely seeing an image will cause the viewer to be possessed by it is the stuff from which every child's nightmares is born. Hawke's character is obsessed by the horrifying images he sees on the 8mm films, but like us, he cannot look away from them. Like the girl who climbs out of the well and into your living room in ""The Ring,"" ""Sinister"" insists on the power of the photographed or filmed image to come to life in the mind of the observer; because we are watching along with Hawke, we are ""infected,"" as is he. ""What has been seen cannot be unseen,"" as the wise saying goes; images live on in the memory, at the very least. And one of the film's most brilliant features is the masterful score, which at times brings to mind the repetitive industrial clacking of machines in motion--relentless and unstoppable--whether it be the sound of typewriter keys, the rotation of reels in a projector, or the maddening rhythmic thrumming of your beating heart on a sleepless night."

"Guywhelon","9","1","1","3 January 2014"," A truly 'Sinister' film.
","I found 'Sinister' to be impacting on the viewer, dark and it also required the viewer to do some thinking. To start off, the film doesn't go straight into pop up scares as others do. But it does what all good horrors do: it built suspense, it made the viewer be on the edge of their seat for the whole duration but and it made them wonder. It's a hard thing to do to make someone scared by a film but still want to watch more, to want to know what's going to happen; this is a powerful attribute Sinister obtains. I found the plot of the film very gripping and original in its own way. I think the acting is excellent in this film, as the main character is almost perfectly portrayed the fear and emotions someone would feel in that situation. If there was one particular seen I thought was most effective it would have to be the scene in the hallway with the box; I found this seen made the blood really flow. Also after the so called 'pop-up' had happened the audience were still gripped with what was going to happen next. As for the 'ghoul' of the film, 'Baghuul' I found that the scene with the photograph of the bush really shocked the audience. However, I must say that the desirable trait about him is not seeing him close up; this is what makes him intimidating, fearsome and terrifying. My one criticism of the film is that it's scarier to see him in the bush than in the attic. The attic scene gives the audience a cheap scare, whereas the bush scene gives the audience a feel of bloodcurdling dread. Other than this, the scene was one of the best horrors I've ever seen. It was well-acted with a good plot, spooky lighting and an excellent villain!"

","I have seen quite a few horror movies over the past decade. Very few to none of them actually presented me with any true horror. Horror movies are fun and enjoyable, but for me it does not really go beyond that. Sinister was different though. I can remember a distinct feeling of fear after finishing the movie for the first time.<br/><br/>The murder films in Sinister were dark to say the least. This was due to the combination of the music and the style in which they were presented. I thought it was pretty brilliant the way the films started out with a happy family and then suddenly shifted to a gruesome murder scene. <br/><br/>The films brought me a sense of feat in themselves, but this was definitely added upon by Hawke's reaction to the films. As a crime writer he is both horrified, yet taken by the films. As Hawke gains an obsession with these films, he progressively slips into a deep and dark place. Witnessing Hawke slip into this evilness brings a sense of emotional darkness to the audience. <br/><br/>Ill admit that there were quite a few plot holes in the movie and the ending was very predictable. I was able to overlook most of these aspects though due to what the film was able to accomplish. I also believe that not answering osme of the open ended questions was a plus for the movie. It leaves a great deal up to the imagination of the viewer. The imagination can evoke a much greater sense of fear than anything shown on a screen.<br/><br/>Sinister was a truly horrifying and unique movie. Definitely one of the best horror films of the last few years."

It's when Oswalt found a box of developed 8mm. film canisters together with a 1960's Bell & Howell projector to play them with that his troubles were soon to begin. And they didn't end until he and his family members ended up dead together with him!<br/><br/>The film canisters reviled a series of horrific murders that spanned some 40 years and killed some dozen victims. What shocked Oswalt more then anything else's about these films was who in fact filmed these events! And was the person who filmed them the one who committed them as well? By the time that Oswalt found out the truth he and his family were to become the killers next victims! <br/><br/>****SPOILERS*** The unknown killer left a calling card to every one of his crimes and even used one of the family members to do the ghastly work for him. It wasn't until Oswalt contacted Prof. Jonas, Vincent D'Onofrio, that he realized just what he was up against. An ancient Babylonian devil who was somehow conjured up by one of the person he ended up killing.

","Plot: A family has just moved into the home of a recent crime scene. The husband, who is an author, plans on getting an idea for his new novel. What he does get are actually five Super 8 mm film reels showing families being murdered. In each case, there was the involvement of an unknown entity called Bughuul, or as called by the children ""Mr. Boogie"". The whole idea is that Bughuul is a Pagan Devil who lives in drawings, images, video, etc. He can only be brought out through those images. And that's the point of the these film negatives: to keep him alive... but why? Bughuul apparently feeds off of children. Children are especially vulnerable. That's why in every murder case in the movie, one of the children was missing.<br/><br/>I am getting ahead of myself, but the plot was set-up perfectly, it doesn't go too fast, and it doesn't go too slow. It's at just the right pace, introducing character traits and motivations. As the writer keeps going on delving into these murder mysteries, you can slowly see his personality change. It's not a major aspect of the film, but it is noticeable.<br/><br/>I should note that the Film reel footage is treated like those Find the Hidden Object images; you know, there ones where you have to go back and look at them closely to notice the thing in the picture that makes it stand out. That's what happens in these recordings... Characters:<br/><br/>Ethan Hawke plays an author who is on the verge of getting an idea for his new novel. He moves into the home of a recent crime scene to get more insight on the case. He's a very purpose-driven character; he wants to do all that he can to do it right. He spend hours getting as much information as he can about these 8mm Film reels he finds. His wife is the standard house wife and mother figure, but she does have her moments of being open and seeming caring about her husband's work. The children or more or less throw-aways, except for... wait, what am I saying? They're BOTH important to the plot. One of them is the false-prediction trigger and the other is... eh, I won't give it away.<br/><br/>Visuals:<br/><br/>Again, very disturbing imagery in this movie. The deaths these families encounter is stuff you would never want to have to face. The creature featured in the movie is also very disturbing. Bughuul, or Mr. Boogie, is one of the freakiest designs for any horror character I've ever seen. He is literally the stuff of nightmares. The point is, they did an amazing job with the make-up. Some of the best I've ever seen in any movie.<br/><br/>Sound:<br/><br/>The music is very eerie and sets the tone for the scenes well. When the 8mm Camera is panning around a sickening scene, the music has a very disturbing or even haunted feeling. This is also enhanced by good use of sound effects. I won't spoil anything for you, but I'll just say... half the movie is the audio.<br/><br/>Rewatchability:<br/><br/>This is the best horror movie I've ever seen. I luckily got to see it at midnight in the theater... and man-o-man was it scary. I couldn't walk outside my house for a couple days without being very cautious and look about everywhere. I'd say buy it on Blu-ray or DVD. This is a must-see for any movie or horror movie fanatic."
"Leofwine_draca","6","1","1","15 September 2013"," Some of the creepiest moments recently seen in a film
","It's a shame that SINISTER suffers from the same problems as INSIDIOUS, namely a Hollywood fixation with making the subtle explicit and making the barely-seen over-obvious and in your face. For the first half of the production, this is a highly effective and old-fashioned horror opus, filled with a growing sense of unease and punctuated by some of the creepiest moments I've recently witnessed in a movie, from Hollywood or elsewhere. Then, as if the scriptwriters realise they've written themselves into a corner, it all falls apart and becomes hackneyed, predictable and rather silly.<br/><br/>It starts off great, though. Ethan Hawke, not the type of actor you usually see in this sort of movie, gives a decent portrayal of a writer drawn into some sinister events of the past, in the type of story much beloved by Stephen King. Hawke discovers some old home movies in the attic and in playing them discovers some genuinely frightening footage which had my hair standing on end. Accompanied by some ultra-frightening chanting on the soundtrack, these glimpses of what is essentially snuff movies are the horror highlights of the movie, and they certainly live up to the title.<br/><br/>Sad, then, that as Hawke digs for explanations, the truth that dawns on him is as unbelievable as it is silly. By the time we get to the presence of actual ghosts (who look like kids dressed up in Halloween makeup), the realism that SINISTER once had has long dissipated and the ending, when it finally comes, is equally out of it. It's not as ridiculous as INSIDIOUS became, but it's still a disappointment given the excellent scenes in the first half. I would have much preferred for this to develop into a serial killer story, because it would have been much more frightening come the end. Oh, and Juliet Rylance's acting is terrible, too."
"Ric-7","6","1","1","19 October 2012"," Creepy little film
","This is a good example of the ""Boo!"" horror film, which uses sudden loud noises to scare the audience. Once or twice is fine with me, but this film depended on it.<br/><br/>I thought the film was decent, but not terrific. The set up was both interesting and creepy. But a film in which the main character is a writer of unsolved crime nonfiction, it should not have taken the length of this film for even a partially intuitive person to figure out what was going on. Especially since most of the audience knew what was going to happen by no more than half way through.<br/><br/>I would have been more interested to see how the protagonist deals with an inescapable fate: does he provoke the end by leaving the haunted house, or is he trapped there forever? Of course, in most horror films you can't ask why the main character did not take the action that any sane person would take. For example, turning over the films to the police. He didn't take that action because that would have ended the film about ten minutes after it began.<br/><br/>This will be a good film to watch on TV at home late at night. It will probably scare you, but if it doesn't and you doze off, it will wake you up before long. Boo!"

","Home movies will never be the same for me after watching the advanced screening of the new horror film ""Sinister"". It all starts when a true-crime writer (Ethan Hawke) moves his family into the house where the former tenants were murdered. Talk about inspiration.<br/><br/>The story unfolds into a twisted tale that is sure to please most any fan of the horror genre. Ethan Hawke's performance is top-notch and the humor offsets the horror just enough, that as soon as you relax, you're flinching in your seat again.<br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed the suspense, humor, and creepy visuals that this film delivered and would recommend it to any guy looking to get his arm held tightly by his date."

This is a crime location, so why is the main character walking around the house in the dark?? If you see something sinister, put on the fcuking flood lights and scare the devil outta there.

From where are the children getting their blank tapes for their crimes?<br/><br/>4. How many more projectors do the children have at their disposal?<br/><br/>5. How did all the crime tapes, taken by different children from different years, appear together?<br/><br/>6. What was the purpose of the dog in the movie? It wasn't at all scary!!!<br/><br/>7. When and how did the main character's daughter get involved in the killing?<br/><br/>8. The drawing on the cover of the cardboard box....... who cannot guess that the writing is that of a child's?<br/><br/>9. And the most troubling part I've had, is, coming to terms with the name of the ghost............ Mr. Boogie????? How on earth did they decide on THAT name? As for the ghost's appearance....... I could have sworn it was KISS. If watching KISS perform makes you scared, then seriously you need THERAPY!!!!<br/><br/>All in all, this movie is for the mentally challenged people ONLY. It was NEVER scary. The children looked like they've just returned from McDonalds after a paint-your-face session. If you really find this, by any chance, scary or disturbing, then you have no business visiting McDonalds. They are just kids with painted faces..... how scary can THAT freaking be??<br/><br/>AVOID!!!!"
"Michael_Elliott","Null","5","12","15 October 2012"," One of the Strongest Horror Films In Years
","Sinister (2012) <br/><br/>*** 1/2 (out of 4) <br/><br/>True-crime writer Ellison Oswalt (Ethan Hawke) moves his wife and two young children into a home where four people were murdered years earlier. A young girl also went missing so the writer digs in to try and solve the case but before long he finds some 8mm footage that shows other horrendous death scenes. SINISTER certainly lives up to its title as this here is one of the most disturbing horror films to come across in a very long time. I think what makes the film work so well is that it doesn't fall into many horror trappings, which is either a bunch of loud noises to try and scare you or going for a gory, exploitation style filmmaking. SINSITER does the opposite as it really tells a wonderful mystery story and just slowly builds up all the evil and this leads to an incredibly chilling finale. The mystery of the 8mm footage is something that is so perfectly written that you can't help get caught up in everything going on and you're completely glued to the film trying to find the next clue so that the killings can be solved. The screenplay also makes a right decision in letting us really get to know the writing, his personal problems and the issues that he's having with the family. The more you can connect with this writer and his family the more you begin to care for them and want to see them survive this entire ordeal. Director Scott Derrickson really does a remarkable job at slowly building up the tension but he also manages to make for a very dark and sinister atmosphere. The 8mm footage is beautifully shot and it's quit haunting as is the sound of the projector each time it comes on. I'm not going to ruin the ending but kudos to him for having the guts to end it the way he did. Hawke turns in an incredibly strong performance as you believe every aspect of what his character is going through. It helps to have such a strong actor and especially as the film moves along and the tension starts to wear on the character. Juliet Rylance is good as the wife and we get strong support from James Ransone and Fred Dalton Thompson. The film doesn't resort to gory violence or cheap scares but instead it really builds up a feeling of true evilness and by the end of the picture you're really going to be wrap up in the terror going on and everything that's about to happen to conclude the picture."
"doorsscorpywag","2","4","9","18 November 2012"," Over hyped
","Not a bad little mystery movie but when you add the fact it was supposed to be the scariest movie of the year it falls down flat. Ethan Hawke is a good actor and always watchable but this was more like an episode of the X Files than anything else.<br/><br/>When The Joker started to appear it began to go downhill fast. Pretty much every plot twist and turn is obvious well before it happens and the acting was not that great. Some plot devices such as the kid having bad dreams and wandering around the house ended up pretty dull. Some of the scare attempts were so obvious to be rendered pointless.<br/><br/>The twist at the end was decent but by then the film was too far gone to be redeemed. Not as lamentable as Insidious but pretty dire. The hype surrounding it was not enough to save it in the end."

"nlytnd_1","2","3","6","5 August 2014"," One of the silliest horror movies I've ever seen and I grew up on B rate horror movies!
","This was one of the silliest horror movies I've ever seen, which says a lot, because I grew up watching nearly every B rate horror movie ever made. Even if I wanted to be extra lenient and look past such insane silliness and just take it for its entertainment value this movie is about as fun as AIDS. Sinister moves painfully slow, which I can handle in deeper build up type of horror movies, but this movie is the shallowest one dimensional horror movie ever made. The script is dreadful and so is this movie.<br/><br/>A horror movie will typically create a façade that it's jumping out to scare/attack its characters, in the midst of jumping out and scaring the audience. Sinister doesn't even want to create this façade; the boogie people in this are putting on a show for the audience, rather than the characters (Ethan Hawk). This caused me to laugh out loud on several occasions as a knee jerk reaction. The boogie children's sole purpose is to be creepy for the audience; they do things in the realm of, making rabbit ears behind Ethan Hawk, then darting out of the way before he notices then for whatever reason they move in slow motion, while motion remains constant for everything elsethey also will stand in the background and look creepy solely for the audience. This movie has no shame unlike anything I've ever seen before. The movie has little motive, little twist, little plot, no rationale, etc. Basically the boogie dude lives on the souls of children and makes them filmographies so they can film the murders, so Ethan Hawk can watch it for the sole purpose of showing the audience, because it's completely unnecessary to show each victim family the prior family murders before they are murdered. Imagine 100 years from now, just how much video the victim will have to watch, or maybe he'll have a best of version by then. The only so called twist or tie in is, the entity will follow you, so there is no escape. Is that really much of a twist when 75% of all ghost/demon/possession movies use the same ghost will follow you rules? It would be like a werewolf movie ending on the twist of a silver bullet doing it in. <br/><br/>Anyways, I'm shocked that this movie received mediocre reviews, because the script is a dreadful piece of crap, which made for a dreadful piece of crap movie."

It wasn't. The found footage was creepy enough. It seems that they meant to create a tense creepy atmosphere, but failed. It relies entirely of cheap predictable jump scares. The boy in the box was the scariest for me, but alone in a dark house with close to max volume on the TV will do that, when they use volume like that. The other jump scares were pretty predictable.<br/><br/>All in all, I have to say that I was disappointed. I rated it 5/10, but maybe it's really a 4/10, but I'm in a lenient mood tonight."

Sinister is one of those rare scary tales where the story is just as compelling as its shock value. It's the perfect combination of modern filmmaking and age-old traditions. It doesn't rush into the scares. No, it lingers on open spaces. It anticipates your expectations. And, oh yes, there is often a payoff. Sometimes when you expect it. Sometimes when you least expect it. No doubt about it, Sinister –deserving of its name– will make your skin crawl... 4 real !!!<br/><br/>And, yes, Sinister wont be Sinister if it didn't had great spine-chilling soundtrack !!!"

","Sinister. Well I was looking forward to this film since I seen the trailer. Which drew shivers just watching. However this is where it stops. I saw this in an advanced showing and am so glad that I never paid for it. Its not the worst film that I've ever seen but more of a film that should have gone straight to DVD and not lure anyone into the cinema to spend there hard earned money to see. (or is that maybe the Scottish coming out in me). There are plenty of jumpy parts in the film. Mainly due to the volume being very quiet and then booming in really loud, rather than jumpy content. So I really doubt this film will have much of an impact at all if you were at home watching this on your telly. Now I am a bit of a hardened horror film buff. And really enjoy fast moving scary, creepy, blood filled, gruesome films which this does not fall into any of these brackets. Maybe to the more novice horror fan or easily frightened it might appeal but in my opinion give this a miss. I'm giving this 3 stars as it is watchable, just not very good.<br/><br/>Tony Panciroli"

I found it hard to take Ethan Hawke seriously in this type of film, all I could picture was Training Day throughout (and the fact that he looks like a live action version of Gordon Freeman). When I saw the trailer I thought this had some potential, I don't find many movies scary these days but the Paranormal Activity films I found to be pretty creepy, so I was really hoping this might be one to do it for me, alas it was not.

If a movie needs to use this as a way to ""scare"" the audience, it's crap.<br/><br/>Bagoul was pretty creepy in the photos and video stills.

","SINISTER (2012) ***1/2 Ethan Hawke, Juliet Rylance, Fred Dalton Thompson, James Ransone, Michael Hall D'Addario, Clare Foley, Vicent D'Onofrio, Nicholas King. Eerie chiller about a has- been hot shot crime novelist (effective Hawke) whose infatuation with his latest subject - an apparent serial killer of families - comes too-close-to-the-truth for comfort and discovers thru a mysterious cache collection of home movies the supernatural connection therein. With some moments of nerve-shredding tension and the occasional jolt the thriller moves on all cylinders largely thanks to its lead anti-hero and a truly disturbing soundtrack thanks largely to sound designers Marc Aramian and Dane A. Davis and score by Christopher Young. Director Scott Derrickson - who collaborated on the twisty-turny screenplay with C. Robert Cargill - pulls out all the stops and his ingenious use of video stocks make it very timeless and its creature, ""Mr. Boogie"" is downright scary; the stuff of nightmares indeed!"

","I am so sick of scary kids in movies. They are just not scary f one came at me I'd kick them in the throat. Despite a truckload of positive buzz I never jumped on the Sinister train completely the trailers and TV spots just didn't look very good. So I went into this with not low but mid level expectations and came out a little disappointed to be honest. Not to say there weren't things I liked about this film. There were a few decent scares and the home movies usually feeling forced come across quite genuine, amateur and disturbing. That aside honestly there's just not very much to recommend here. There is a good idea here and Bagul could have been a frightening character but that last twist just throws off the movie completely in my opinion and the worst thing is that you see it coming and your still hoping for something more. And thats basically the film a waiting game that rarely pays off and when it does it's decent enough if a little generic. The film stars Ethan Hawke slumming it as an author of true crime novels who moves into the house of a murdered family he's basing his next book off of. He discovers some old home movies in the attic featuring some of the old murders and creepy things start to happen. As the movie plods along unenthusiastically we learn about a Deity named Bagul who ""eats"" small children. I don't wanna spoil anything for those of you who are going to see it. You should relish every small twist because there's not many and don't look at any of the trailers, TV spots or poster because they show everything. When it finally culminates it's not very exciting and moves into even more forced generic territory coming off like a mediocre rip off of the Amityville Horror remake without Ryan Reynolds abs sadly. All in all it's a mixed bag and although it has some decent qualities it's nothing special. And it's all really just kind of stupid."

It could have been so much more, but bravo and well done to Ethan Hawke for his commendable performance, I've never really seen him as a main character actor but was pleasantly surprised. The main threat in the story is not the demon itself but Ellison's daughter, you begin to see that she is increasingly more strange as the film goes on. I would recommend going to see this film with people who are likely to jump at anything as that will probably make it much more atmospheric. I would also say to try not to watch any interviews, trailers or clips form the film a lot is given away and will certainly spoil your experience."

","Simply awful. I waited for this movie expecting it to be good and scary, but it was just stupid. In the first 80 minutes, yes, I guess I'll say first 80 freaking minutes, because 80 minutes fly away like 20 minutes in this crap. So, first 80 minutes the guy is exploring and investigating the tapes to write his book, but I didn't even see him write anything so, it was just waste of time I guess. The murders that he is writing his book about are just stupid and unrealistic as crap. It's just stupid. The movie is like one hour and 40 minutes long and more than half of it feels like an intro! nothing happens. They could have done the the 80 minutes in 20-30 minutes and made the rest of the movie longer and more entertaining, but guess not. <br/><br/>So, in the end something ''weird'' happens like the dude gets scared a bit and decides to get away from the house and then guess what? we expect something cool to happen, but no. In the end the writer drinks something and gets knocked out and when he wakes up he sees his little daughter with an axe, possessed...........it was just funny to see that little girl in pajamas was supposed to be ''scary'' this is what's happening to horror movies now days. No more John Carpenters and Hitchcocks. Only dumb people who think that little girls are scary......well, guess what? they're not. It could have been a puppy holding an axe and it would be the same. Even Uwe Boll could have made a better movie. Seriously, it had potential, but this is what directors do now days. they give promises and then throw them into trash.<br/><br/>DON'T watch this movie. You think Paranormal activity is bad and stupid? well, it is, but this one is no different. What's with the dumb cliché of trying to make females look scary or badass which they are not. they could have gotten some dude with a knife and mask in the end and turned the movie into average slasher and even that would have been 10 times better than what this crappy movie is. Even the title is kinda stupid. Sinister? it's Sinister how dumb this movie is. Watch Grave Encounters 2 ! it's at least waaaay better than this fail.<br/><br/>So, do yourself a favor and skip this. It's just a boring fail. Not scary, not interesting or entertaining. Just a boring, average fail with few jump scares and weird scene with naked ghost kids running around. <br/><br/>Also, the characters talk about how people in the town are mean to them, but we don't even see that, because they are in the house the entire movie!!! not only the story line of this movie is a waste of time,but so is this movie.<br/><br/>3/10"

Horrible music, way too loud, took me out of the story and kept me wishing I could watch the movie on mute. <br/><br/>If you're easily frightened, it's good for a cheap thrill.

"Chris_Docker","7","3","7","8 October 2012"," above-average horror film
","The autumn chill hits, and it's a good time for horror movies...<br/><br/>Sinister comes from the people who gave us Paranormal Activity and also The Exorcism Of Emily Rose. Only it's a little more... sinister. Found footage of snuff movies heralds its adult credentials before you've had time to choke on the nachos or splutter salsa over the person in front. Copy picture A family is murdered. Months later, comeback writer Ellison Osborne moves into the house with his family. In the attic, he discovers a box of tapes that includes footage of many murders. Unbeknown to his family, he has chosen the house in order to research a true-crime novel. Having only had one bestseller, he sees this as his lucky break, his chance to write his In Cold Blood. The children start to act strangely and his good wife freaks out on him when she discovers the real reason they are living there.<br/><br/>Ethan Hawke, as Ellison, and lovely Shakespearean actress Juliet Rylance playing his wife, Tracy, immediately strike us as realistic characters worthy of belief and empathy. Their convincing personas have more depth than the average shock- flick, and we are sorely tempted to consider whether this at heart might be a psychological thriller of Hitchcockian nastiness. Yet if the trailer hasn't given everything away, we are transported into a dark world of malignant forces the minute Ellison discovers a strange symbol repeated on the death tapes. Strong supporting acts appear in the form of a local police deputy – who changes from doting fanboy to calm, collected criminologist; and a little later Professor Jonas – the expert on bizarre cults. The professor makes this Babylonian demon 'Bagul' sound so realistic that you could be forgiven for wondering if Sinister is based on a true story, with Mansonesque worshippers helping Bagul to find souls of children to feast on.<br/><br/>More lost footage. More creaks and bumps in the Osborne family's almost endless night. Ellison is losing the plot, but we are barely a knife-edge ahead of him. Cue cute kids, cue creepy kids, cue dead kids. Sinister will shortly become shriek-out-loud horror. As well as creeping inside your head on the way home, insidious horror. Polished production values handle clichéd camera jerks with admirable restraint. What we can see and know on-screen is nasty; what we don't know is even more unsettling. Perhaps pausing only to admire the exquisite backing tracks and diligently applied sound effects, we soon realise we are hooked on trying to solve the mystery: who was the killer? Sinister's dark humour is equally discreet. Rather than being played for quick laughs, it emphasises the fear experienced by our protagonists. When Ellison is threatened by a Cujo-sized dog, he speaks soothingly, gently, while muttering a desire for the baseball bat to smash its skull in. And during a row with his wife, he says he hasn't 'really' brought them to house where murder was committed, since our crime occurred 'in the garden' (""As if that makes any difference!"" Tracy explodes.) Horror films sometimes work by challenging us to confront the things we abhor, and all from the safety of a cinema seat. Whether physical (mass murderers), mental (psychological threats) or psychical (supernatural happenings), horrors on a movie-screen do not have to be real – just real enough to remind us of something that could be. Our inner demons. The things we fear most. It could be said the 'ghost' haunting Ellison Osborne, his creeping, sweating, drink-sozzled paranoia, is evoked by his frankly unsavoury and obsessive career, his life's dream, that is in reality destroying the family that he loves and frightening his children. As with Frankenstein before him, Ellison's monstrosities might be partly of his own making. It might be tempting to see the monster as a reflection of him. Yet the very visible on-screen ghosts are nevertheless small works of art that capture our senses. That, and the gut- churningly self-assured, unexpected and irresistibly compelling ending swiftly sweep aside mundane interpretations.<br/><br/>Given the effort put into getting it right, a part of me would still have loved to see a police psychiatrist in the coda explaining how everything really happened. An ultimate reliance on the supernatural is fine for horror fans, but inevitably weakens mainstream impact. (Imagine Norman Bates had summoned his mother back from the dead instead of just putting a wig on.) Sinister is far too derivative to be accorded a big place in cinema history; but this souped-up, low-budget compendium of dread is still more satisfying than most horror films that graced our screens this summer."

The movie was very predictable so it made the movie boring. The spirit that is tormenting the family is creepy and all but still not scary enough. It was a good story and all but I felt as though the producers just through it together with out even double checking it. I regret paying to see this movie in theaters, should have waited for Redbox. Unless you scare easily I wouldn't waste your money."

I've been thinking about it for the past couple days, it finally got out of my head. This movie doesn't start slow. It starts out creepy, disturbing, and scary. I'm not gonna tell you what happens in the movie because that would be a spoiler. I've watched many horror movies in my life. This one was one of the scariest I've seen. It even beat The Shining and The Conjuring on my scariest movies list. It's number one. So, if you are looking for a horror movie but you have a weak stomach for blood and guts in movies.

Also one thing I noticed is that the musical score played was especially creepy and added to terror and suspense of the movie.<br/><br/>I don't want to give away too much but just beware this movie will stick in your mind for a long time to come, now I just have to prepare myself for the sequel."

","When I first saw the movie cover, I wasn't really expecting much from this movie. But one of my friend kept on begging me to watch this movie so I decided to give it a try. Thankfully, I watched this movie and it was worth it!<br/><br/>From the producers of Paranormal Activity and Insidious comes a well-made horror movie! A dedicated true-crime writer Ellison Oswalt is trying to write a new crime story and decides to move into a new house in order to write a new successful novel. However, he finds a box of videos and things start to become dark and sinister...<br/><br/>Sinister has lots of jump scares that make you jump out of your seat and there is also a little bit of a twist at the end. One thing I really regret is that I watched this movie by myself, which I shouldn't have done!<br/><br/>Finally, I would like to say that I really enjoyed the storyline as well.<br/><br/>88/100"
"TheBlueHairedLawyer","8","2","4","6 November 2014"," Surprisingly one of the most disturbing and creepy films I've ever seen!
","Ellison Oswalt has a loving wife, two wonderful kids... so why is he not even telling them that their new home is a crime scene where in 2011 a family was hanged!? Well, he's a true crime writer, not really a bad guy but willing to put his career (and not a very popular one at that), before his own family. While moving in, he sees that his daughter truly hates the new place and he tries convincing her to enjoy it, to no avail. He also gets told off by a cop for exploiting tragedy for fame and cash. Ellison's real troubles begin when he finds a box of 8mm film reels, seemingly of fun family moments, dating as far back as 1966. But when he puts them on, he has no idea what the hell he's found. Each home video is exactly like those grainy, nostalgic family films, but instead of birthday parties, camping trips and school presentations, they're all murders of different families, ranging from typical horror murders (stabbing), to downright sadistic (the pool party one was disturbing beyond belief). Ellison has hindsight about moving but won't admit it, even when both his children begin acting crazy and his wife starts constantly arguing with him. As he goes further and further through decades of murder, he discovers a family from 1979 that was burned alive in a car while sappy seventies music played in the background. He finds a child mowed over with a lawnmower. When he spots a strange-looking man standing at the bottom of the pool watching happily as a family is slowly drowned, he realizes that something sinister is at work, and it isn't just a human serial killer.<br/><br/>I really liked Sinister, more for the atmosphere it evoked than anything else. My problem with it is that despite its originality, the only thing that made it stand out over other movies in its genre was the found footage method. Super 8 has a grainy, nostalgic look that's difficult to mimic with just a webcam or camcorder and it can either be seen as just home movie material or an artistic medium. Sinister's snuff films are hat really disturbed me, not the rest of the movie. I mean, anyone can throw a few rotten, ghostly kids and a child-stealing demon together in a horror movie, and this film has numerous horror clichés, from Ellison's kids seeming to have a sixth sense to the presence of something in the house to a boy with night terrors to a group of rotten corpse children drifting around. All of these things can and have been done already in one way or another throughout the horror genre. But the way not only Sinister presents the super-8 films with eerie music and horrific material, but also shows a great amount of respect for super 8 film, is what makes this movie better than The Ring, Paranormal Activity or The Conjuring. The acting was pretty good, especially the roles of Ellison himself, ""Mr. Boogie"" and the Deputy. It was great to see that Dakota Fanning or Elle Fanning weren't picked for the role of Stephanie, finally they picked a child actor who isn't an overused bratty celebrity! The soundtrack was really eerie (the ""Sleepy Time"" film scene had some of the best). And the plot? Well, child-stealing demons have been done before but never as creepy as this. It's not really a scary film to me, more disturbing than scary. Deputy So&So was awesome, I hope he has a much bigger role in the second Sinister movie. After all, he and the nerdy occult professor were the only survivors who knew about Buguul. <br/><br/>(If I had written the screenplay for Sinister, I would've called one of the 8mm films ""Spring Cleaning"" and had a child mixing household chemicals like ammonia and bleach together to fill their house with their family in it, now THAT would be creepy! The possibilities for a movie like Sinister are endless)."
"juddfetters","9","2","4","22 March 2014"," One of the best horror/suspense movies in the last 10 years.
","First, like a good mystery, all the clues are there and remain consistent. It was great that every time we found ourselves asking questions, the characters on screen would be asking the same questions, so you never feel like your watching a bunch of idiots stumbling toward their own demise.<br/><br/>Second, the characters never do or say anything that I couldn't see myself doing or saying were I in the same situation. This made the characters extremely relatable, and I found myself really caring whether or not they were going to survive. This serves to really jack up the tension and suspense in scenes where, otherwise, not a lot is going on. More importantly, none of the characters do anything that is just flat out stupid. There's no going unarmed into a place where the killer is obviously waiting. No needlessly tripping over flat ground while fleeing whatever's after them. The movie goes to great pains to portray realistic people caught in a stressful situation. Ethan Hawke's performance is not just believable, but compelling, as is the performances of the rest of the cast. Even the side characters aren't simply 2 dimensional cookie cutter archetypes, even though they may appear to be at first. <br/><br/>Third, if you're looking for a gore filled blood-fest, this is not the movie for you. Most of the jump scares are in the trailer. Still, when you get to those moments in the movie, the combination of being invested in the characters, the subtle atmospheric cinematography, and superior storytelling still get you despite you knowing what's coming. The movie doesn't rely on false scares or other gimmicks to raise you're heart rate. Nor does it rely on a primal reaction to gore. The worst of the murders are never shown in graphic detail. Instead, Scott Derrickson chooses to focus on the Ellison Oswalt's, the main character's, reaction to what he's seeing. The violence is implied by Ethan Hawke's excellent performance, and frankly much more visceral than watching gushers of fake blood on screen.<br/><br/>All in all, I highly recommend this movie, both for horror buffs and casual horror fans. If you like atmospheric suspenseful movies, this one will leave you felling satisfied."

","true crime author moves his family into a home where an unsolved horrific multiple murder took place and finds a stash of 8mm home movies in the attic, he believes he's found evidence of a serial killer going all the way back to the 1960s. Ethan Hawke plays Ellison Oswalt, a famous (though his fame is fading) true crime writer who has moved his family into the home where a grisly multiple murder happened. The movie actually opens with what appears to be grainy, home movie video (or film) of the crime that happened in this very home. Now, he hasn't told his wife or young family that a murder happened here You see, he's trying to write his next big (and hopefully biggest yet), book and perhaps living in the house of the crime he wants to write about may provide that inspiration. Late one night, while investigating some nocturnal noises, Ellison finds himself in the attic where he finds a stash of 8mm home movies, and a projector. Over the next few weeks/months he reviews these movies only to be led to believe he has stumbled upon the proof of a previously unknown serial killer with crimes that go back to the 1960s. Trying to get information about the crime that happened from the local chief of police isn't going to be easy as he isn't a fan of Ellison's work, as it often makes the police looked like buffoons. Luckily he is able to get an inside to the police by befriending one of the newer Deputies, who happens to be a big fan of Ellison's. Uncovering proof of other unsolved murders which seem to tie in with the scenes found on the movies he discovered in his attic. He also enlists the help of a Professor Jonas (Vincent D'Onofrio), as there are similar symbols left at the scenes of each crime scene. The more Ellison investigates, the weirder and deeper the weirdness grows. Now his own kids are seeing and doing the unexplained<br/><br/>Damn this is a good, creepy horror movie. Hell, it even includes what I would consider a half-decent twist! I find that the movie managed to create and sustain a level of suspense (and aforementioned creepiness) that is rare lately. Also, it's nice o see Ethan Hawke in a movie, as I always enjoyed his acting.<br/><br/>So, check out Sinister if you are looking for a better than your run of the mill suspenseful horror flick."

If your younger i don't recommend it but I would certainly brave it out if you start!! The movie was awesome because it had a really good build up. The super 8 tapes made make you a little depressed especially if your only 11 but me and my friend stuck it out till the end and I am so glad I did because the ending was perfect. Best film I have ever seen, it had really good directing and really good acting. No matter how old this will scare you!! I don't know if it will scar you, maybe didn't scar me but who cares still the best scary movie! This movie is way scarier than the conjuring and others so this would be the movie to go with if you are looking for a scare. This movie is scream worthy and has a lot of jump scares towards the end but a couple at the start (I screamed lots😝) I really recommend this if you can handle scary but if you can't, stick with paranormal activity 1,2,3,4. Please watch this because it won't let you down!!!"

","Desperate for another bestseller, struggling true-crime author Ellison Oswalt (Ethan Hawke) moves his family into a new home, conveniently forgetting to mention that it was the site of a gruesome multiple murder. A search of the supposedly empty attic turns up a box of home movies; as Ellison views the old reels of film, he learns of other murders that are connected to the case he is investigating, and following some strange supernatural occurrences, realises that, by taking up residence in this house, he has not only endangered his own life but those of his family as well.<br/><br/>Sinister drags all manner of tried and tested horror movie tricks out of the bag in an attempt at seriously scaring its audience, but all to no avail, the shadowy house, creepy children, loud noises and freaky faces rarely having the desired effect thanks to their sheer predictability. Stick with it, though, and the film eventually gets under the skin, director Scott Derrickson very gradually building a sense of dread with an intriguing story that is clearly heading somewhere nasty; the real fun of Sinister is not in its cheap scare tactics, but in the carefully crafted foreboding atmosphere, and in trying to figure out the exact nature of the film's bizarre occurrences.<br/><br/>Sadly, the revelation of a child-eating demon named Bughool being responsible for the mysterious murders comes as a bit of a let down, and the final pay-off is nowhere near shocking as it should have been. After all that has gone before, the previous murders seen in detail, the film wimps out on showing us what should have been the most brutal of them all. Sinister would have been infinitely more disturbing had the ultimate killings been depicted in nauseatingly graphic detail (be honest, who doesn't enjoy a really gory axe murder or four?).<br/><br/>Oh well, that's mainstream horror for you, I suppose."
"Jonathon_Natsis","6","2","4","27 May 2013"," Hawke goes horrorshow.
","Horror veteran Scott Derrickson (Hellraiser: Inferno, The Exorcism of Emily Rose) returns to his favourite genre with Sinister, a peculiar, prodding and probing film that, like most horrors, has its quality dictated by the type of audience watching it. <br/><br/>Ethan Hawke plays Ellison, a true crime writer who takes his work a little too seriously. Not content to simply research his cases, Ellison insists on a more hands-on experience in his quest for justice. When he moves his unwitting family to a new home, recently placed on the market courtesy of the last owners being hanged in their backyard, Ellison learns that the grisly details of the case extend far beyond this gruesome incident. Whoever is behind the crime has tallied victims all over the US since the mid-60s, while the only thread linking one crime to the next is the killer's sparing of the youngest child. <br/><br/>Sinister spends most of its first half as a police procedural infused with horror, rather than the other way around, and works quite well in that regard. Despite a mostly derivative supporting cast, Hawke is engaging as a determined man tortured by his insatiable curiosity, and watching him piece together the clues- with virtually no help from the police force he has so viciously antagonised in his books- makes for magnetic viewing. <br/><br/>Inevitably, though, there comes that unmistakable moment that confirms Sinister will be moving in a more supernatural direction, bringing with it a bloodbath of modern horror clichés, including creepy kids, men in masks and occult imagery. Lone viewers are likely to see through the cheesy final act, but this is exactly the kind of film that would be eaten up by a big crowd keen for some cheap scares. <br/><br/>Sinister does (only just) enough to keep itself out of 'B-grade schlock' territory, and is entertaining enough to keep most viewers from counting down the minutes to its admittedly brave climax, but its lack of atmosphere and abundance of familiarity make this less of a gamer changer, and more of a fun night in. <br/><br/>*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review. If you're looking for a writer for your movie website or other publication, I'd also love to hear from you.*"
"starcraftbw88","4","2","4","13 May 2013"," Dumb and not scary
","It started out so strong for me only to be so letdown by the ending and silly plot. I'm okay with clichés, as long as it's done well, but the movie can never seem to decide whether it wants to go mainly the paranormal/monster or possession route and what came of felt like a complete mess. What incites this possession? Watching a bunch of the old reels? I saw Ethan Hawke's motives but what about every family before? Why are there so many obscure plot devices like the professor whose only role is to chime in every now and again to talk about the stupid pagan deity crap. Why is it that the family has to move before they get killed? Is it the boogieman dude or the kids what we're afraid of? It certainly wasn't the kids running around in the bad make-up who we're to believe each carry out the massacre of their entire family. A girl about 8 or 9 supposedly hoists and hangs her entire family onto a tree to kill them, lol; okay.<br/><br/>I honestly ended up chuckling at a lot of the ""scary"" moments as I think many hardcore horror fans will. I don't know what the rave reviews are going on about how scary this movie is, the only scares that exist are cheap pop-outs that are mostly predictable - there is no fear factor, I mean, at one point there is a snake-under-the-box scene; the director has no shame. There is no comparison to Saw or Insidious as they were both so, so much, better.<br/><br/>Sure... I screamed a few times during the movie, but not because I was scared."
"JDZander","6","2","4","18 April 2013"," Decent horror that could have been a great thriller
","Some minor spoilers here.<br/><br/>I didn't know much about this movie before I saw it, which was a good thing since it gives the movie more mystique.<br/><br/>If you've seen the trailer, it takes away all the mystery and most of the suspense.<br/><br/>I like the first part of the film, where Ellison (Ethan Hawke) finds and starts investigating the 8 mm homemade films. They are well made and really creepy. It seemed like we were dealing with a very skillful serial killer. Then the supernatural element comes in and everything gets turned around. I think this movie would be better if it only used some supernatural things. It should have been a thriller with some horror elements.<br/><br/>When we are about half way in the movie, the same things happens all over again. Ellison runs around the house with a knife, a baseball bat and nothing new happens.<br/><br/>The ending was pretty disappointing, and I don't mean the way it ended. All the suspense that was built up towards the end was lost and there was no final showdown or drama. Just a minor surprise.<br/><br/>I found this more scary than the horror movies I've seen in recent years, but it wasn't that scary (more creepy than scary) unless you're easily frightened. Most of the jump scares were predictable and only one or two made me twitch.<br/><br/>Too bad this movie (like all modern horror films) relies to much on jump scares. Yes they are cool and scary as long as you don't overuse them.<br/><br/>Overall I enjoyed the movie to some extent, the performances were good and some parts were really creepy and thrilling. It had potential to go all the way but it stumbles in the middle, and doesn't quite get back on it's feet.<br/><br/>6/10"
"cityofdelusion93","8","2","4","7 April 2013"," Wow - Sequel please?!
","It's extremely hard to find respectable scary movies today. Most are low-budget, straight-to-DVD excuses for suspense movies. Not this one. I first watched this in the cinema with a friend. Being two of five in the entire cinema, the isolation and eerie emptiness just added to the superbly created atmosphere emanated by the movie. From the start, I was excited for the climax of this film as you can see its originality and thoughtful plot portrayed in a blockbuster by a clever director. Unlike most movies, you can empathise with the characters (nearer the end, you feel sorry for them as can't escape their inevitable doom) and feel attached to the story line and plot which is complex yet gripping all the way through. I have absolutely no complaints regarding the scary moments in the film (which literally have you on the edge of your seat, even after watching it multiple times- it's really that good!)as they were plotted carefully but not overdone and repetitive. However, sometimes the camera shots were a little bit repetitive (i.e. a frequently occurring shot of Ellison walking through the house at night) but they definitely do not get boring or overrated so do not let that stop you watching it! All in all, I loved this movie and would recommend it to any horror movie buff to escape the usual rubbish being passed off as scary today or even just someone wanting a good scare late at night. Another thing, I recommend you make your viewing experience as authentic as possible- watch this late at night in the dark and you're in for a real treat!<br/><br/>Finally, I would absolutely love a sequel to this movie. I feel this - one of a few worthy of good reviews- really has the potential to construct a following movie. The ending (don't worry, not a spoiler!) does not see the dire situation resolved, merely continued. This said, an epic sequel featuring a dramatic showdown with Mr. Boogie would be inexplicably awesome!"

It had a few great scenes (mainly the found footage scenes), and the acting was very good, but it just ended up being a movie we have seen repeatedly as far as formula goes! And it all seemed to be building up and building up, only to be left with nothing unpredictable. I was entertained by it, and it did have a few good jumps, but the scariest scene (boy coming out of a box then screaming) was shown in the trailer! There were also many plot-holes in this film (the boy's night-terrors could have had something to do with the plot, but they didn't and it seems like they just placed that there to use him as part of 2 big scare scenes). This isn't even as good as the Amityville Horror remake. At least that one was scary even when we knew what was going to happen..."

Come on. It is cheap to rely on darkness for half your scares, and even cheaper when it accounts for almost all of them. To me, a movie is far scarier when the frights come with the lights on. At a minimum, at least have the lights actually on under normal circumstances when normal people would have lights on. Ugh. Beyond distracting.

Its very easy to figure out early on what is going on and the scare tactics that are used are about as scary as an episode of Sponge Bob. I found nothing wrong with the acting, I thought that was the strongest part of the movie. The problem is that the story line is so weak that is overshadows the acting. I don't think any actor could carry this movie. I haven't looked at who directed the movie, but I'd be surprised if any of their past movies were successful, at least in this genre. This movie is much like The Ring, but MUCH MUCH WORSE. Watch it at your own risk, just realize its 2hrs of your life you won't get back."

","I thought this was a great horror movie. The way I judge horror movies is by how much they frighten me. I personally don't understand why people get hung up on the fact that characters sometimes don't act as a normal, rational person would. I suppose, for some people, the fact that a character might not take steps that we would - for example, alert the authorities about the strange occurrences going on - means that the film is frustrating or unrealistic and consequently given to jocular remarks and reviews. For me, the so-called ""realistic-ness"" (not realism) of any kind of movie, not just horror movies, is completely irrelevant to anything.<br/><br/>In an era where genuinely scary movies are few and far between, Sinister was surprisingly unique. If not original, then effective. I came into the movie not knowing what to expect and the subtle, well thought-out transition from crime/thriller to horror/supernatural was quite distinctive. It is true that a few horror movie clichés were included - but genuine originality is a myth. I think Sinister did enough to effectively differentiate itself from other films, and it certainly scared me, which is the only criterion that I will judge it against.<br/><br/>On a side note, I notice that many people seem to watch these sorts of movies in groups or social settings. Though I enjoy this too, I usually make a point when watching a horror movie to watch it late at night, in complete darkness - which I highly recommend doing if you want to get the most out of a movie like Sinister."

","By horror...<br/><br/>But this is a different movie. Just finished watching it and this movie did really get into my head.<br/><br/>Many titles shoot themselves in the foot by being to hokey, not staying true to their plot line, or just becoming totally unbelievable. While this film came pretty close to being unbelievable, it still got my heart pounding because it's a very real setting.<br/><br/>I remember some of the shots from older titles like Stir of Echoes or What Lies Beneath (bathroom mirror scene scared the bejeezus out of me). This film really had me reminiscing about what I think good horror should look like. Fake enough to be interesting, but real enough to be deeply frightening.<br/><br/>I still get chilled when I think about him looking out his window, removing the image and seeing behind it what was in the video. Ring-esque concept.<br/><br/>One thing though... I had pretty much called the concept of the movie 1 hour in, and was telling my old lady that all these families had probably moved, and he shouldn't.

For example, the unexplained mishaps of their son Trevor their son. What exactly did he ""used"" to suffer from and why the heck was he in a box or running outside in the middle of the night?

All the actors do a great job and the plot is actually pretty good.<br/><br/>This movie is a about a writer who writes about terrible murders that happen.

I skipped it, expecting the movie to be a complete dud as PARANORMAL was for me (there is no way you can justify video camera footage as horror) but I was gravely mistaken. What I got instead was a horror movie that actually worked because it was done right.<br/><br/>The story is relatively simple; a father on his way to writing a new book finds some home movies stashed up in the attic of his family's new house and said home movies have a lot of dark secrets contained in them which unleash an indescribable horror. Minus the whole part where the evil is unleashed through some old film reels, the plot is something that's been repeated in horror movies ever since something like EVIL DEAD. Even the scares are old fashioned, relying on genre staples (creepy kids, shock value, etc.) and a couple of high pitched chords played at the right moment to deliver the impact.<br/><br/>But these are not flaws at all; in fact, these are what made SINISTER a good horror movie. The thing with SINISTER is that it forgoes all of the new genre tropes that pretty much murdered the genre and opts to go back to old school horror tactics to deliver one of the best horror movies I've seen in recent memory. Even if some parts were predictable, the film never let up on the tension it managed to build up right from the start guaranteeing any scare (predicted or otherwise) to be a shocker.<br/><br/>For anyone who wants a good scare, check out SINISTER. It's a great addition to any horror movie collection as it goes back to genre roots, picks every single good bit that made horror movies the way they were in the day and delivers a good horror movie experience reminiscent of older horror movies while keeping things fresh for the new generation. If you've grown sick of the new ""horror"" meant for children that's produced en masse these days, look no further and pick up SINISTER.<br/><br/>I don't know how and why it took this long for the horror movie genre to recover but I am grateful to the crew behind SINISTER for reminding me why I fell in love with the genre. By the looks of things, the horror movie genre is going back to what made it great with some pretty interesting entries coming out next year (the EVIL DEAD remake looks promising; watch the trailer) and I guess it's thanks to an old school movie like SINISTER doing well at the box office. I'm thankful to SINISTER for reviving my love for the horror genre just when things were getting murky. I'll definitely be waiting for what these guys will be coming out with next."
"AMar_rom","Null","2","4","16 November 2012"," The basic premise is flawed but the movie has its moments
","Sinister is a horror movie whereby a best-selling author (Ellison Oswalt) is set to write a book about the unexplained murder of a whole family and the possible abduction of one of the children in a rural Pennsylvanian neighborhood. Ellison (played by Ethan Hawke) decides (for some totally unexplained reason) to move with his wife and two young children at the same house where that family used to live (no wonder why the rent was so low).<br/><br/>Elisson finds accidentally in the attic some unregistered 8mm videotapes depicting a series of similar murders that were also not resolved. He witnesses a number of phenomena (viewing the 8mm tapes and at his house) and starts to believe that a malevolent 'entity' (a spirit that takes a human-like form) is responsible for all the murders and tries now to possess and harm his family.<br/><br/>The movie reminded me a lot of 'Insidious' (2010) a similar (but better) movie with the same pattern: namely, again an 'entity' tries to possess a child. In 'Sinister' it was difficult for me to come to terms with the movie's ending and the basic premise of the movie. Also a key element in the film (the 8mm films) is left 'hanging' and their presence is not given a rational (or even a metaphysical) justification. I thought it was a convenient plot device of the script that did not resonate well with what the film tried to convey. Even the decision of Ellison to rent the house where the murders took place is also a convenient plot device and nothing more. I also very much preferred the way 'Insidious' presented the 'entity'. Here it becomes simply a caricature, albeit a scary one at times.<br/><br/>'Sinister' nonetheless has its good moments and it may satisfy some fans of horror movies. Just be aware of some very gratuitously violent scenes that honestly I do not think they were necessary and add nothing to the plot. Ethan Hawke is a very good actor and carries the movie and I could recommend the movie only for Hawke's performance here. The scenes with his wife were especially well done and very believable. A 5/10 from me."

","NO SPOILERS – SheBlogger hates spoilers :) Okayso here's another horror movie review from the girl who is yet to be scared with scenes shot in the dark, gory murders and startling sound effects.<br/><br/>HeBlogger and I went to the mall last Sunday to watch a different movie. We thought Tiktik, which is a Filipino horror movie, was already showing. Apparently, it is not scheduled until next week. Then we saw Sinister's poster, which said, ""from the producer of Paranormal and Insidious"". We have seen both movies and we both didn't like Paranormal but both enjoyed Insidious. So we said, okaylet's watch this instead.<br/><br/>Didn't know anything about this movie Sinister so as we walked inside the empty movie house, I wondered which one is it going to be like. Is it going to be a homemade movie about paranormal activities with three different endings? Oh pleaseI fervently hope not! I crossed my fingers because I noticed there were rolls of super 8 films on the poster. Or is it going to be about demons capturing souls and possessing the physical body with a non-happy ending? Or is it going to be a totally different story? I hoped it would be.<br/><br/>We were the first two of the five people who came to watch this movie. The others were a group of three teenage girls, who surprisingly didn't scream or shout at all, throughout the screening. What a joy to be watching in silence and absolute peace! Okay, on to the movie review The movie opens with a scene shot like a home video, so I go like, uh-oh But don't be disheartened. It's nothing like Paranormal and deeper into the story, you'd see that it is more like Insidious. That much I would tell you.<br/><br/>The story is about a real crime stories writer, played by Ethan Hawke (the only actor I know in the movie), who moved his entire family to a house where a family was hung to death in the backyard tree and their little girl still missing. In the course of his research and with the help of rolls of seemingly innocent and happy family home videos that mysteriously appeared in the attic, he discovers more brutal murders of different families in different houses. So there's the question Are these murders in any way related, considering there's always a little child missing? I must say that I find the premise of the story original. Well, at least for me. So I give it 4.5 gems for Story and Originality...<br/><br/>Continue reading on: http://heblogs-sheblogs.com/2012/10/sinister-movie-review/"
"EmmaDinkins","7","2","4","16 October 2012"," Chix Chat on Film Review: A creepy thrill.
","This film is definitely a new look for Ethan Hawke (Ellison Oswalt), and it was a whole lot of him. Most of the scenes consisted of Ellison drinking and freaking out. I don't recall ever having seen Mr. Hawke in a horror flick before. Actually, I would say that this tale about the mass murder of entire families was more of a creepy thriller than a horror flick. There were indeed some horrific occurrences, but I have to say that I appreciated the fact that it wasn't simply a gorefest, and that there was an actual story to be told. Ellison is a writer and in an attempt to reclaim the glory from once having had a top selling crime story, he moves his family into the home of a family that has recently been murdered. I found the fact that his wife Tracy (Juliet Rylance) preferred to know as little as possible about the what, when and how of Ellison's preparation for acquiring the reference material for his new book. Not so surprising in this case ignorance is not bliss. The trailer did a good job of conveying just how creepy this film is, with the scene of Ellison's son Trevor (Michael Hall D'Addario) bending over backwards out of a moving box. That little exercise in flexibility turned out to be a red herring, but it was still pretty creepy. Fortunately, there was some comic relief that came in the form of Deputy So and So (James Ransome), who was so much more helpful than one would think upon the initial meeting. It was too funny when he rattles off to Ellison exactly how he felt about moving his family into that house. The explanation of who the culprit is in this case was delivered in a plausible manner, so I had no real issues with the story telling. I knew fairly early in the story how the murders were being executed, pun intended, so there was that level of predictability. I'm so not a horror genre fan, my idea of an acceptable horror flick is Happily N'Ever After, but this film wasn't too bad to experience. A lesson learned is if you knowingly move your family into a house where the entire family was murdered and there are no leads for an arrest, then don't expect that you will have a different outcome. But hey if people could take a hint, there would be no horror stories. I give it an amber light."
"Stealth_Ninja_Kitty","9","2","4","16 October 2012"," Best horror film I've seen!
","Story: Found footage helps a true-crime novelist realize how and why a family was murdered in his new home, though his discoveries put his entire family in the path of a supernatural entity. (IMDb) Sound: The music adds to the tension of the film. Without the music the film would be less scary.<br/><br/>Acting: The acting was pretty well done, except for Juliet Rylance. She had her moments, but her overall performance felt forced. The star (Ethan Hawke) was spectacular. He was very believable. I enjoyed his performance because it added to the film's atmosphere.<br/><br/>Film itself: The film was great and it was also disturbing. The story was intriguing and the way the story unfolds was fantastic. The atmosphere was intense and scary. The movie provided many scares. Even when I expected to be startled, I was still startled. One complaint I have is the trailers. The deity was shown way too much in the trailers, which took away some of the fear from said deity. My only real big complaint is the ending. While it was very disturbing (and I do mean very disturbing), I found it a bit weak. Nonetheless the film was great fun.<br/><br/>Overall: I highly recommend this film for Halloween. While it didn't give me any trouble sleeping (like Insidious did), it holds well against other horror films."
"Fields201","7","2","4","16 October 2012"," Better than Insidious
","Saw this with my mother. We both enjoyed it. I thought the performances were really good in the movie. Take the scene where Ethan and his wife are yelling at each other. Great deliveries! There's also a scene where Ethan is talking to the deputy and he keeps fidgeting while he's talking. Most performers would overact and it wouldn't come off as natural, but Ethan pulled it off like a pro!<br/><br/>I never felt like the movie was scary, just having a creepy atmosphere. The film stock he watches are pretty messed up. Even the titles given to each of the film like BBQ and Pool Party only to see how that is depicted on how these people die is really messed up. Then it leads into this ghost which I honestly felt the movie would be more creepy without it. It's a scary looking thing, don't get me wrong. I would be creeped out by it too. It just wasn't needed. However, once you find out that it manipulates children, you will see where the film is going.<br/><br/>There are two things that did bother me about this movie. I thought the creepy demon children were almost laughable. They just looked like make up on Halloween to me. I'm sure the kids enjoyed their transformation but it looked silly to me, especially the scene where they are dancing around Ethan during one part. The second thing was the ending. I predicted it but didn't think it would be so abrupt. It was just there and it was like the filmmakers had to get this film done quickly because they were running out of money. That's what I got.<br/><br/>Sinister was good. I enjoyed it better than Insidious. Looking forward to what these guys bring out next year."
"Rebeccaarspriggs","9","2","4","14 October 2012"," Very very disturbing but brilliant!
","I was not expecting this film to be as disturbing as I thought! The opening sets the atmosphere but at the same time you have no idea where the plot is going, but that's what I love about it! Unlike all the other horrors I've seen, the beginning doesn't drag on and you're not 45 minutes in until something major happens. You get to know the characters well and twenty minutes you will be shaking in your seat. The music got to me the most, sitting in the cinema with dark scary music being so loud the film is intense, I must admit I wanted to leave half way through the film. You don't know where the plot is going or how the characters are going to end up, the ending fits in perfectly but unexpectedly too! <br/><br/>I will be buying this on DVD and keeping it for Halloween only, it's one of those films you watch for the thrill."
"sundancegarden","8","2","4","13 October 2012"," Best I've seen in a while
","Saw Sinister on it's release day, after some reviews that indicated it might be worthy of a theater visit instead of DVD, and I'm glad I did. It is one of the better horror movies I've seen in sometime. It has a very effective storyline, with some incredibly creepy and disturbing scenes. It has those moments where you squint your eyes and pull back a little, and some where you flat out jump. Ethan Hawke is great, and so is James Ransome as Deputy So and So. There are some predictable moments (as there are with most all horror movies) but this one has a good story and excellent direction that keeps it from falling into the ""OK,yawn"" or let's jerk the camera around our shoot so dark that no one knows whats going on category that seems to have permeated the genre of late. You can follow the story, see where it's going, and know how it's going to end, but it doesn't lessen the impact of the movie. This one is worth a visit to your local cinema."
"bigmystery23","7","2","4","13 October 2012"," Finally, a horror worth seeing
","The past few years have not shown anything worth being scared by. The found footage genres, though as clever as they can be, are running dry. Sinister, though, does something different with the found footage genre, as well as horror. This film is a straight forward ride into a disturbing and sadistic story of evil, with some clichÃ©d and creative scares. Ethan Hawke is committed to his role 100 percent as the protagonist trying to find a story that will bring him fame once again. It is his lust for fame that proves to be his and his family's downfall. I truly believe this film will either scare you or indent it's gloomy/frightening imagery into your mind. Spectacular on visuals, creative on scares, and well acted by the leads, Sinister is a great way to start out the Halloween season."
"movieman89-2","8","2","4","13 October 2012"," Wow! This actually scared me!
","I first of all did see trailers and they looked very convincing. So I went to see it with a couple of friends last night. Let me just say, you're in for something awesome. I came out really excited and actually terrified.<br/><br/>The story is original and very clever. Yes, we have the stereotype family move into a new home and things go wrong, but hey that's not really a bad thing. As the story goes on, you get more and more hooked to it. You find out something new each time. The tension is built beautifully. It has a very slow and uncomfortable pace. People may think it could be boring, but trust me, it isn't at all. Its not full of in your face jumps all the time, like many horror films today. The jumps happen and they stay with you to make your flesh crawl. As the twists come up, its even better. All questions are answered in a great way. The story also focuses on how obsessive the main character gets. You get a feeling that he is changing each time, which is another great thing. <br/><br/>The acting was very good. Everybody did a great job. Ethan Hawke especially.<br/><br/>There isn't much CGI in this film (yippee!) but when it is used, its used appropriately and subtly. <br/><br/>What also really worked was the soundtrack. Its not stereotypically high pitched or, you know, you're usual music you use. The composer uses tunes and base notes to make it very uncomfortable in a strange way. I even shuffled in my seat a couple of times and it generally scared me. This really works for the film. Well done Christopher Young, you did great. <br/><br/>I'm a huge horror fan and it can take a lot to actually scare me. But this one actually scared me, which I was not expecting for these days standards.<br/><br/>Horror fans, I really recommend this for you. Please go and see it. You're money will be well spent."

","Ethan Hawk's performance was good and so was the score. Other than that... a long journey of watching him pull super 8 reels and playing repeatedly. Sometimes it was played by someone/thing else in the middle of the night. It didn't really go anywhere for a long time. At a certain point, we paused the movie with full expectations there would be 10 minutes or less remaining but instead it was 37 minutes still left to go. Arghh. And the ending was not worth hanging in for (okay, cheeky reference)."

"aidanratesmovies","10","0","0","22 June 2020"," Endlessly creepy, well done
","Deeply compelling, twisted, and interesting- Sinister may not hit every mark just right, but it is still one of the creepiest and most human horror films to grace the screens in the last decade or more. Scott Derrickson writes and directs the original horror flick, and does a pretty good job if I do say so myself. His other credited works before this film were not too much to be proud of, but I would like to see him continue to do this type of work in film in the future. The script of which he wrote with frequent writing collaborator C. Robert Cargill, is very well toned and very realistic. There are certainly many disturbing parts of the film, making it definitely not for the faint of heart. The film does struggle a bit towards the beginning, and a little throughout to get its concept on the screen in a perfect fashion, but what the film does so effortlessly is truly invoke the fear it is set out to make. It's a truly horrifying tale, with some great atmospheric work, and cinematography, and every little bit of the film feels like it means something, which I haven't seen in a horror film in quite a while. It may not harness its full potential, but Sinister has more than enough to keep it going rather strong throughout its nearly 2 hour run. It's never boring, or tiresome, and it's often very clever and unique. Derickson provides an excellent look and feel to the film, and I hope this will later be recognized for the often brilliance of horror it encompasses throughout.
My Rating: 9.5/10"

","*Minor spoilers*<br/><br/>
Usually i don't get scared or freaked out by horror films and I don't know if it's the fact that I'm hungover/rundown but this really got to me.
There was a few jump scares thanks in part to the freaky soundtrack and when it's little kids being weird and stuff that always freaks me out (The first time i saw 'The Ring' i found that out, although i was much younger then).
But the fact the supernatural elements don't quite expose themselves till a fair way into the film make it 2 types of horror. There's the whole snuff film element on super8 (I'm sure a lot of us remember (hopefully fake) videos going round the internet in the days before YouTube) and then the mythical bogeyman bloke.<br/><br/>Either way I'd say i was freaked out and a bit scared, definitely worth the watch.<br/><br/>Also the trivia fact on IMDB about the stunt hanging (if true) makes it all the more eerie for some reason..."

","I don't understand why people call this movie scary. The way of killing is very human like....hanging, drowning, burning in a car, knife...I guess this is so this is believably a snuff film and not paranormal but it's not scary. It isn't even done scarily like most horror films. I mean yes the (spoiler) kids killed the families as a twist ending but still. And child killers aren't scary. There is also no explanation of why the kids willingly do this.<br/><br/>Yeah the makeup and effects of the demon are legit scary but then there aren't a lot of uses of it. A couple jump scares are hysterical not scary.<br/><br/>There are plenty of slow parts that add to tension if you feel that but are dull and boring if you don't.<br/><br/>And this mom keeps going in and out of British accent, was that on purpose? That was pretty scary.<br/><br/>I think it's over hyped as a horror movie. Especially since there was too much focus on the main guy and none of the little girl becoming possessed. We never see her watch the film or have a slow loss from reality (except for the painting on the wall) which then turns out to be her video. Just a ""twist"" that you can see coming and doesn't feel satisfying. Kinda cheesy ending considering it was ""inspired"" by rings.<br/><br/>But the cop who helps him is so adorable"

","This film starts out strong (creepy, interesting), begins to struggle-and-flail in the middle, and totally tanks in the end. we have two seemingly intelligent people who are so disconnected from their lives, each other and their jobs as parents that they are completely unaware of the degree of danger to their family by staying in that home (despite seeing evidence all around and in their children's behavior), and fail to protect them.<br/><br/>i mean they can't even properly light their home despite the menace that surrounds them lol. they were literally in the dark. (i took the poor lighting as the film maker's lazy attempt at ""forcing the mood"" of a chilling horror movie but in fact it was just frustratingly odd and distractingly annoying.)<br/><br/>the sloppy ending is a complete (and nonsensical) betrayal of the film's earlier promise and the strong rating on imdb is less a reflection of the film's ""strength"" and more an indication of how intellectually and cinematically deprived horror fans have become as a result of the dearth of truly scary horror films.<br/><br/>the acting is okay but for me the highlight of this movie are the non-diegetic needle-on-record and other muffled sound effects. those definitely added to the scary mood.<br/><br/>5/10"

","For all the trash talking I do on modern horror, I tend to enjoy the films of Scott Derrickson. From The Exorcism of Emily Rose to Dr. Strange and Deliver Us From Evil, his films have come from a unique place and have had surprises packed within them. The two Sinister films - he only co-wrote the sequel - are darker and stranger than mainstream 2000's horror films have any right to be.<br/><br/>Ellison Oswalt (named for Harlan Ellison and Patton Oswalt; played by Ethan Hawke) writes true crime and to get the material he needs for his next book, he's moved his family into the home where a family was lynched in their own backyard. He hopes that by living there, he'll discover the fate of the one family member who survived.<br/><br/>Inside the house, there's a box that contains a Super 8 projector and several home movies. They're actually snuff films of various families being wiped out as an unseen camerman records the death, always concentrating on a mysterious symbol. These movies are the true heart of this film, shot on real Super 8 and appearing to come from another universe thanks to stark lighting and ambient music from black metal bands Ulver and Aghast, as well as Boards of Canada.<br/><br/>In fact, the creature behind all of this throat slashing, drowing and burning is named Bughuul, a strange masked demon that also looks like he walked out of Helvete. He's a Babylonian demon that coerces children to kill their families and then give their souls to him.<br/><br/>Ethan Hawke had never seen the films prior to filming the movie, so all of his reactions are 100% genuine.<br/><br/>Thanks to the Sheriff (Fred Thompson) and Deputy So & So (James Ransome, who would return for the second movie), Ellison soon learns that these ritualistic murders have been going on since at least the 1960's.<br/><br/>After leaving the projector on one night leads to all of the missing children entering his house and Bughuul physically attacking him, Ellison decides to leave the house behind. He connects with occult expert Professor Jonas (Vincent D'Onofrio), who tells him that the image of the demon is how it can possess children and enter our world.<br/><br/>The real insight is that every murdered family had previously lived in the house where the last murder took place, and each new murder occurred shortly after the family moved from the crime scene into their new residence. By moving, Ellison has doomed his family, as the projector and the films appear in his new house.<br/><br/>Now, the missing children appear along with each murder on film, as Ellison's daughter Ashley methodically murders each of her family members with an axe before the demon lifts her into his arms and disappears, leaving behind a new film labelled ""House Painting '12"" so that the cycle of death can continue all over again.<br/><br/>This is but one film franchise where Ethan Hawke was killed in the first installment and I ended up liking the next movie much better. The other would be, of course, The Purge."

However, this felt like it would have been much better as a 30 short in a horror anthology rather than a full feature.

","...quoth Little Feat. But seriously, this tripe held my interest for an unfairly long time, considering that I was never really scared. Creeped out? Sure - but the storyline is so ridiculous & nonsensical, along with idiotic acts on the part of the protagonist & shaky motivations all 'round. Doesn't help that I watched on a free streamer - is the film supposed to be so dark, so much? If so, someone in production had to have an inkling that the story is weak - keeping things dark makes the jump scares jumpier - seems a cheap trick. The film is a waste of the actors' talents. James Ransone, who I love, couldn't save it. The interesting, Italian progressive/metal score? Also wasted.<br/><br/>It should probably be added that I've recently seen both The Witch & Hereditary for the first times - it's getting harder to pull me into horror if it isn't really well done."

","Scott Derrickson's ""Sinister"" is one of the best horror films I've seen in recent years and like ""The Conjuring"" that came out not long after this movie did it never let up for one second of its runtime, and is really worth your time if you're a fan of horror movies or not. The movie stars Ethan Hawke as Ellison Oswalt a crime novelist who moves with his wife (Juliet Rylance) and children to a new home only to find out that something isn't right after a bunch of old film reels are found in the attic, and a bunch of paranormal things happen with their children (Michael Hall D'Addario and Claire Foley) which leads to a series of events that make the movie even creepier and scarier as the film progresses. In the beginning of the movie when Ellison decides to movie into the house even the local sherriff (Fred Thompson) warns him not to move in and he doesn't listen which makes you ask questions as to what his motives were. Scott Derrickson does a very good directing job and did a very good job with co-writing the screenplay inot not making this movie rely on jump scares all the time like ""It"" (2017) did. Derrickson's other credits include ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" (2005) and ""Doctor Strange"" (2016) which is one of the best Marvel movies that I've ever seen. The performances are also very strong in the movie with Hawke's performance being the one that stood out to me the most while watching this movie. The movie is one of the best horror flicks I've seen that this century has to offer along with ""The Conjuring"" (2013) which I consider to be one of the finest horror films ever made. The supporting performances are very good, and the suspense that this movie builds makes you feel like you are watching evil unfold right in front of your very eyes, and is right up there with ""The Conjuring"" and ""The Silence of the Lambs"" as one of the creepiest horror films that I've ever seen."

The tantalising mystery we discover alongside the main guy made me feel conflicted on whether I want to tell him to get out while he still can or to keep digging that little bit more to uncover the mystery.<br/><br/>The other characters are pretty annoying but a lot of visuals make up for that.

"CrookedStairs","9","0","0","18 February 2019"," A Crooked Stairs Review: Sinister
","When the initial teasers and trailers for a new Scott Derrickson horror feature came around, I must admit that I was very intrigued. His work on 'The Exorcism Of Emily Rose' previously for me was a game changer, tying up a killer combination of classic scripting, fleshed out characters and acting- all while adding the little technical flares of visuals and unnerving sound that make a good horror tale come to life. Could he repeat his new found talents...<br/><br/>BASIC PLOT: A true crime writer moves into a new home with his wife and two children. The local authorities initially do not seem too happy to have the family around digging up facts about the towns grizzly past, not to mention the authors potential to get deeply involved in unsolved cases. It's safe to say that what transpires, changes everyone's perspective...<br/><br/>REVIEW: I love the horror genre for many reasons, but for me it has always been very important for a movie to scare effectively while building a solid background. Sinister delivers this straight up. I connected with the family, with the writer who needed to try and elevate his career again but equally with the family who had to deal with the situation as a whole. The script is a solid one, a slightly different take on a few kinds of horror including traditional old school suspense mixed with more modern almost 'found footage' style horror which has become popular in recent years. For me, what director Scott Derrickson and the team have done here so well is to fuse the two together. From the first scene I felt like I was on a journey and the acting from all members of the immediate family was fantastically portrayed.
Derrickson (I was relieved to discover) delivered yet again in his original brand of slow building tension, strange & eerie lighting in key scenes (look out for it in all of his horror work) and sudden intense visuals and sound to create a genuinely griping experience.
Where there cons? Yep. Never wanting to give too much story away, but I feel anyone who has seen the movie will have some reservations with the Scream/Scary Movie Deputy Dewey-esque character. It seemed to just take the viewer right out of an engaging and scary piece and into the realm of what can only be described as comedy. I do wonder who pushed for this particular character to have such a large role in the final cut...<br/><br/>***POSSIBLE SPOILER***<br/><br/>Also, it is just strictly my opinion and not meant to annoy, but while I feel the main horror character in the film has some very nicely shot key scenes (found footage), I think the overall character is just not all that terrifying... At times it seems to resemble a character from the rock band Kiss more than a true horror character. Just my opinion.<br/><br/>***POSSIBLE SPOILER DONE***<br/><br/>VERDICT: Overall despite a few cons, a fantastic piece of horror work from Mr.Derrickson in my humble opinion. It builds a classic narrative around a family in distress, and then we slowly see the creepy elements take place and unfold at an alarming rate leaving the viewer engaged until the end. Thumbs up on this one."

","This movie starts off and before its halfway over I'm not sure if its like Seven or some supernatural type flick. There is a point at which the answer is obvious. Before that point the movie had the makings for something great. Once the viewer discovers that it is indeed a supernatural being it kind of loses something. I feel like the writer had a hell of script and someone said ""lets put the boogie man in it and see what happens."" It is scary. The acting is good. There is one scene from the trailer that would have been scary as heck had it not been in the trailer. The opening scene is crazy awesome/horrible. I do wonder why authors always wear sweaters?"

The theme of the mystery and the flashes of gore interpreted by different POV's are creative. The video tapes can get a good creep out and one of them actually scared me due to it's nature. However, there's a few scenes that I didn't like. Such as the scene where you see the family behind Ethan Hawke outside and when they run around or say ""shhhh"". That just takes me out of it. The final thing I wanna say is that the ending is done great and is in a way a pretty good twist.

"dromasca","7","0","0","3 January 2019"," for fans of horror to enjoy
","Being scared is not fun for everybody. The horror movies genre has its addicts and fans, but also its haters or people who just avoid watching. I believe that with 'Sinister' directed by Scott Derrickson in 2012 we face one of those cases of a film that spectators who love or at least can live with the genre will like, while people who dislike horror movies would better be advised to skip it.<br/><br/>The story in 'Sinister' fits into one of the most used patterns. A family which seems 'normative' by all criteria moves into a new house. It will soon be clear that the family is not that normative (the father makes a living from writing about sordid true crime stories) and that the house is also marked by having been a crime scene in the past. What is different in this film is that the fight between sanity and horror, between the tentative to explain things by logic and the powers of darkness is well described and the gradual fall in fear that happens in almost any good horror film is described in a credible manner. There is logic in what happens on screen, but this is the logic of horror films, and the viewers need to accept the rules in order to enjoy.<br/><br/>What I liked. 'Sinister' follows the rules of the horror movies and the script graduates well the slow transition between 'normal' and 'horror'. Ethan Hawke gives a good performance of the writer trying to rationalize what happens to him and to his family and fights the occult with the wrong tools. The use of 16mm film to bring back the crimes of the past is a nice idea, and never has a box with film reels looked so frightening. Much of the film action takes place deep in the night, and the cinematography is adequate.<br/><br/>What I liked less. I am always uneasy with kids in horror movies. I guess, however that this is part of the typical scripts in the genre or sub-genre. I also found the other characters and especially the wife (Juliet Rylance) too schematic.<br/><br/>Fans of the genre will probably love this film. Most of the other, better chose something else."

","After several horror websites raved about this movie I was expecting a lot more. I guess the plot was okay but the execution left much to be desired. I get it, horror movies are dark for a reason but when you literally cannot see what is going on it's gone too far. The music was good. There were several parts I just could not see. It did not grasp my attention. Conversely when spooky figures were on screen, they were on screen a LONG time. This is where the quick shots are normally but we got to have a good look at the figures, examine them, and then they continued to stand on screen. The jump scares didn't work because they were only when nothing was happening. If the jump scares were quick shots of the ghost children or whatever the heck they were it probably would have got me. Instead I stared at the screen wondering why dead kids doing the shhh thing is scary in literally every other movie besides this one."
"Garoux","4","0","0","22 May 2018"," Interesting ideas diluted in a mess of cheesy horror cliches.
","I'm always wary of advertising campaigns riding the coattails of big summer movies. It cheapens everything when a movie boasts the PRODUCERS of other horror movies, as though they're directors. I always expect a rehash of the aforementioned films into a familiar formula that will sell tickets. Sinister is most of those things. <br/><br/>The beginning of this movie looks promising, creating huge atmosphere; often at the cost of realism (nobody turns on a light in this movie!). Our true crime author protagonist (Ethan Hawke) intentionally moves into a murder house, hoping for inspiration for his new book. He hits the jackpot when he finds a bunch of snuff films in the attic (including the murder of the previous owners). They are genuinely creepy, and easily the redeeming quality of this movie. Then, of course, strange things start happening. <br/><br/>Shortly after this film dips into the paranormal, we spend the rest of the film drowning in a highly predictable mess of horror cliches. From ridiculous jump scares of faces popping out of the corner of the screen (think ""TOASY"" from the old Mortal Kombat games), to our antagonist wearing a Slipknot mask. The worst offender, however, are the ghost children and their awful makeup. It was cheap haunted house quality, and killed the atmosphere every time. Even the ""plot twist"" was easy to notice in the first half hour of the film. <br/><br/>Sinister is worth it to see the snuff films, but everything else may have you rolling your eyes."

","I remember desperately wanting to see Sinister when it first came out in theaters, but I was still fairly young at the time, so I put it on the back-burner until recently when I decided to finally give it a watch. Maybe it was because of my high hopes or incredible trailers that left me feeling like it could have been much more.<br/><br/>Sinister does a lot right. The visual and audio presentation in top-notch, and the acting from all the adult actors is dramatic and convincing. You can really see that a lot of care and effort was put into each frame. Without spoiling anything, I'll just say that at least the idea behind the plot is fantastic, and the pacing of the story-telling is excellent.<br/><br/>There are only a few actual problems I have with Sinister, but sadly they happen to be very prominent issues. It's hard to criticize child actors, but when the plot revolves so much around children, having sub-par acting from the children really hurts the atmosphere. My other big issue that really detracted from the overall experience is the ending. As fitting as it is, it lacks the creativity seen in earlier parts of the movie.<br/><br/>In the end, I really do feel like I can recommend Sinister.

","This film is a watered down version of the hand held camera genre. In instances where they didn't use home video footage, they filmed the scene bad enough to make it feel like found footage. The movie opens showing us a family being hung in their back yard. True crime author Ellison Oswalt (Ethan Hawke) moves into the same house with the intention of investigating the gruesome killing and writing about it. The locals are not warm to the idea, but we don't see any incidences due to budget constraints. Ellison doesn't inform his family they are in the same house that the killings took place.<br/><br/>In the attic, Ellison discovers a horde of super 8 movies (some that have their own sound track, or so it seems) of the killing he is investigating as well as other killings that date back to the 1960's. He asks the questions, ""Who is filming this?"" and ""Why?"" and ""Where is Stephanie?"" She was the daughter of the family that was hung. They never found her.<br/><br/>Ellison begins to investigate the other cases as weird things start to happen in the home. As usual it starts out slow and escalates.<br/><br/>I liked the concept of the film more than its amateurish execution. Ellison drinks rather heavily which makes for an alternate explanation of his ""hallucinations."" The film would have been better if it had lead us in that direction, rather than just discuss it. Those who enjoy the ""Paranormal"" type movies should find a friend in this film. I loved the film in the beginning, but then it slowly wanes.

","Nowadays, if someone were to ask you what film genre are you into, and you mentioned horror without sharing which ones you actually enjoyed, they would try to keep some distance from you being sort of an outcast or your don't have a good taste generally speaking. The scare genre had been the abominable of cinema since the early 80s, right after the success of Sir Carpenter's Halloween. Now, for the film, good news is it's a pretty decent horror comeback. But bad news is what you are about to witness, once you popped in the copy, is an unsettling 1/1/2 hour journey that may drive you to sleep deprivation. So without further do, if you are sensitive to graphic visuals and eerie soundtrack, then welcome to read this SPOILER-filled review.<br/><br/>From what I can recall, the story was basically about these group of you everyday middle-class family who had just moved into this ordinary, later mysterious, home that hadn't been occupied since the 90s. The father, a lately successful writer, decided to check the attic to find some interesting stuffs that were left untouched. Turns out, that's where the movie begins to play out as it should.<br/><br/>Hawke's character discovered a very eerie, yet innocent looking box filed with 4 vintage Super-8 films the previous owner seemed to had forgotten. He carried it all the way to his current office to watch all 4 tapes. The tapes, from each decade, consist of the similar premise: family enjoying their spare time only to be killed by their youngest son/daughter in different sadistic ways at moon presence.<br/><br/>Then seconds after viewing, strange sounds could be heard and paranormal events starts to take place. All of this goes on until day 4, when the writer made up his mind to move back to their original house. Unfortunately, things only got worse since it turns out the demon had been following them since they opened the door to Hawke's character's ""new place"". But in the end, he and his family were murdered by his 9 year old (I assumed) girl, similar to how the previous families met their demise.<br/><br/>Anti-climactic wasn't it? Let me tell you that this may be the dumbest, cheesiest, last minute story anyone could came up with before shooting takes place. In detail, the main action scene revolves around the souls of the dead kids, doing supposedly creepy, but ridiculous acts like running around the corridor when our main guy wasn't looking. If you sit back, putting the pieces together as best as you can, it didn't add up. How can a kid tie up his/her ENTIRE family and hang them all up on a tree without supervision?<br/><br/>Nevertheless, they totally nailed the lost footage of the old victims. From the disturbing camera perspective of the killers to the spectacular editing, utilizing teeth-grinding background music with arguably the closest representation to an actual super-8 footage. Not to mention this is one of the few scary films that puts me a hard time to fall asleep. Thus, my warning from the first paragraph sums it up.<br/><br/>In conclusion, if they just scratch the main plot and instead add more coherent mystery elements to it (like Ringu), I might give it a ton more credit. This is like one of those dumb movies that you should at least come across a few times on Netflix with a beautifully crafted gem hiding inside. Hey, even though I'm spoiling like a brat, you can still get nightmares watching just the tapes alone. It's all over on Youtube if you are interested. All in all, a solid 7/10."

"Icarus_prime","6","0","0","25 May 2016"," Some interesting horror ideas tossed around without any purpose
","Throughout the entire movie, I was waiting for something interesting to happen and it never did. Watching this reminded me why I decided to watch more Asian horror films these days. They're way better in terms of building an atmosphere. I particularly have a disdain for horror movies that uses situations where the characters are predictably gonna get involved in bad situations. Although this movie wasn't a huge offender for this since the crux of the film is actually quite interesting, I wish they executed the inner conflict of Ethan Hawke's character better. He makes a lot of dumb decisions throughout (aka Plot Induced Stupidity) but I will praise once again on the neat idea of a guy dedicating his life to expressing horrific stories actually getting involved in one himself. The movie follows all your typical horror clichés such as the classic ""home invasion at night"" style of environment and some cheap jump-scares (the ending one was pretty lame) and fake jump-scares. At least the supernatural aspects of this picture weren't that distracting for me. I have no idea who on earth was the costume/makeup designer for this movie because they did a really abysmal job and made the movie a lot less creepy when the actual horror scenes came. I didn't even care THAT much about the ending either even when it was quite refreshing since it wasn't all sunshine and rainbows. Also I felt like all this bizarre religious occult reference symbolisms near the end felt incredibly tacked on to the movie. Kind of sad since it ultimately ended up relying on it as the foundation of the whole movie.<br/><br/>Overall, I found the movie to be a bit disappointing and everything that featured within Sinister was done without a sense of purpose; just a bunch of ideas being thrown in just for the sake of it (my biggest problem with this ""horror"" movie). Even worse that the all the ingredients to make a good horror: Atmosphere (obviously), a coherent story and scares (duh) were nearly non-existent when being meshed together.<br/><br/>Oh did I forget to mention the film isn't even that scary? A few attempted jump scares ain't going to cut it for me. Actually, I'm more impressed with horror movies if they don't use it in the first place which the movie did in some parts. But it wasn't enough."

","This 2012 horror film stars Ethan Hawke, Juliet Rylance, Fred Dalton Thompson and Vincent D'Onofrio. Hawke (Training Day) plays Ellison, a true-crime writer who moves to a house where the previous occupants were murdered, but his wife, Tracy (Rylance) and their 2 children don't know about it. Soon, Ellison finds snuff films of the murders and others before and as he tries to uncover whose behind them, he and his family become terrorized by a dark, supernatural force. The late, Thompson (Die Hard 2) plays the Sheriff and D'Onofrio (Men in Black) plays Professor Jonas. This is a shocking flick sort of similar to ""The Conjuring,"" ""White Noise"" & ""The Babadook,"" Hawke is great in it and Christopher Young's score is chilling. Horror fans should check this out at least once."
"Leviathan80","6","0","0","28 November 2015"," Sinister is very unsettling and definitely left with me.
","I am usually disappointed when I see a film which came with very high expectations. However, I must make an exception to ""Sinister."" I had heard very good things about this film making it a must-see for a horror movie fan like me. However, I had to be out of the country during the days it was shown in the theaters locally last month, so I only got to watch it now. And these high expectations were fulfilled. ""Sinister"" is indeed a very good horror film. In fact, I will go on to say that it was one of the best American horror films ever made.<br/><br/>Ellison (Ethan Hawke in his first appearance in a horror film) is an author of true crime novels who is seeking to follow up his one hit book. He moves his family into the very home where a gruesome family massacre had previously taken place. When he discovers a box of film reels which turned out to be video footage documenting the deaths of several families, his research turns into a real life horror for him and his family.<br/><br/>The eerie and tense atmosphere is set up from the very first scene where we see four people hanging from a tree. It never let up from there up to the bloody end. OK, there are horror clichés here like the house in seemingly perpetual darkness, or the sudden scares that lead nowhere, creepy children drawing on walls, and so on, but in this movie, these things actually work well to work up the audience's heart rates and goosebumps. The music is pulsating as it is unsettling, very effective to work you up some more with every step that Ellison takes in the house.<br/><br/>I liked the way that the gore was suggested instead of blatant. I liked the subtlety of many of its scare moments. I liked the way that Ethan Hawke realistically portrayed the tormented but desperate Ellison. A male protagonist is not always as easy to play in a horror film than a female one. I like the ending, how it may seem that you can figure out what is going to happen in the end, but the way it played out was pretty out-of-the-box disturbing and ultimately, shocking. I highly recommend horror film fans to watch ""Sinister."" It is as it is entitled."

","Let's start with the title. Sinister. Really. Has to be the most banal and boring horror movie title you can come up with. Let's call it Terror. or Horror. A far more apt title would have been 'Home Movie' or ""The Hell Projector"", or something vaguely amusing.<br/><br/>The jyst of the movie is that a struggling true crime writer, looking for inspiration, moves his entire family into a murder scene house.<br/><br/>Really.<br/><br/>What kind of PSYCHO would DO that???? They really don't explore that this author must be a frikken SOCIOPATH to even contemplate something like that...<br/><br/>And his oh so DUMB WIFE who doesn't figure this out until 3/4 of the way through the movie??? And she doesn't even figure it out, her kids tell her??? The only saving grace to this movie are the home movies themselves. Well filmed on super 8, they convey a real creepiness and add a ton of atmosphere. However, even these little movie in a movie gems are not without their flaws. For example: In one movie, a small girl saws through a foot thick tree limb, with the small saw at the end of a tree pruner (which, for the tool challenged, is meant for TWIGS and SMALL BRANCHES). Oh, and apparently in that same video, this little girl has managed to hog tie and noose up her entire family by herself...<br/><br/>This theme continues, and I'm sorry to give away the plot but the plot is so thin you would have to be severely mentally challenged to not get the secret 10 minutes into this movie. NONE of the murders could possibly have been committed by the children.<br/><br/>The amusing thing is, they have the perfect plot device to explain why: The children are serving a Dark Sumerian Demon Lord. Oh good! Except that all this supposedly powerful demon lord does is hang out in his scary clown mask and get his jollies watching his demon kids carry out the murders. Why didn't they just show him giving them help to subdue the family? Apparently he just teaches them all how to make, I dunno, foamy Sumerian knock out poison.<br/><br/>The ghostly kids, which run around haunting every new house targeted for mass murder, make no sense whatsoever. They are apparently trapped in the Haunted Projector? yet they are not. They apparently fear their demon lord, yet obey his every command. None of this is explained."

","Somehow I was unaware of this film, which apparently did okay at the box office in 2012, three years ago, and was amazed at how tense and creepy it was for the first hour or so. Ethan Hawke and even Fred Thompson, plus a literate script and fine performances had me totally involved. But then, it became rather repetitive, poorly lit, and increasingly hinting at a supernatural explanation. IMO the best horror films are based more on human evil, and less on ghosts, evil-spirits, ancient curses, or religious beliefs being substantiated. The set up was so good, I predicted the ending would be a letdown. Even though it did have a twist, it still was completely unbelievable, at least for me. Still, it was done so well, I gave it a generous 7 for keeping me interested and hopeful it would be a keeper, like ""Uninvited"", or ""TCM"". Worth seeing, but not repeatedly."

","Just watched this movie and truly ponder why many gave this movie a ten stars. I am not yet a movie maker, but have watched tons of film, thus thinking maybe I am a sinister, thus missed something that people find great.<br/><br/>The Good This movie has a potential to be a great movie, with the idea, but too much focus on the main character. The horror in the movie is actually about how a man can put risk to his family by what he is doing. Thus, moral of the story, never move into a house in which a family was murdered with no explanation, or never try to be a drug dealer, occult leader or try to reanimate a dino egg.<br/><br/>The Bad Again, too much focus was put on Ellison - the lead - while it is a movie about (seems to be) family. Maybe some will say it is about character development, but I'd say it is boring. Not even sure if this movie is a horror movie or troubled man family drama slash how economic crisis affected our life. The pace is also too slow. And literally very dark, as if zombies had eaten all the electricity. To all horror movie maker, to make a movie scary, you do not have to turn off the light all through a movie. That's a trick for toddler.<br/><br/>Summary It could learn from the Japanese Grudge which has similar theme. Yet, there is a very good scene in this movie, when the wife told Ellison that the meaning to his life was his family and his legacy was his children. It shows a mother's perspective which is different to the idea of a working man."

","Very effective haunted house story.<br/><br/>The soundtrack plays a big part, but without being obvious. The suspense is very strong, and I got to a point where I dreaded what was coming next - uncomfortable to watch. The acting was good throughout, and there are several good jump scares.<br/><br/>It takes about 40 mins to confirm the supernatural element - up to then it's a serial killer investigation. Then there's an element of the protagonist losing his mind, and eventually the spirits are revealed. <br/><br/>After that point some of the sinister element was lost, and I definitely could have done without Mr Boogie in the flesh - much better when he was a crude image in the background. If you judge a horror by the final effect, then this disappoints as the final scenes felt like a relief from the creepiness that went before.<br/><br/>A few other weaknesses. It's a little too long, should have come in under 100 mins. Second the son's night terrors don't tie into the plot, and he's almost forgotten after the first hour. Some reviewers couldn't get past the decision to stay in the house, and the constant darkness, but that was OK for me and created a claustrophobic atmosphere."
"JohnnyPHreak","6","0","0","13 September 2014"," This confined horror thriller is just plain creepy
","I heard of Sinister before I saw it. I had not heard much. I knew it was another horror movie starting Ethan Hawke. It got bigger on my radar when people started to put it in there top ten lists of horror movies of the 2010's. Then the word came out that the director Scott Derrickson was hired for Marvel's Doctor Strange. I was interested in his work so I did catch before this his big Hollywood horror film Deliver Us From Evil. And now after seeing Sinister I definitely think he's a nice choice for Doctor Strange.<br/><br/>Sinister is a small confined film about a writer (Ethan Hawke) who moves his family to a house in order to write his new crime novel. He's not popular with the police and stuck in a bit of a rut. When strange occurrences start happening he realizes that he might be in over his head. This is one of those films that has to been seen totally cold. The film unfolds itself for the audience and the characters at the same time. <br/><br/>The film is mostly contained to this house. All the characters and side characters converge here. Which makes the film feel a bit claustrophobic. The tension is built well, with a few jump scares that pay off. It's not a false scare of a red herring. When the story eventually plays out, everyone is hit with a proverbial brick to the face. The horror elements aren't shown in graphic details. This help the thrill of the film making you imagine the brutally. Even the film opening scene will get under my skin. There is a bit of a twist at the end. But it comes at a point where things just might develop. I was knocked me off my guard. <br/><br/>Ethan Hawke is usually a hit or miss for me. But he does the down on his life writer well. The family around him aren't giving much to do. They help convey the story well. I was sucked into the story wanting to know what happened next. Derrickson knows his horror. There are inventive shots. He has a nice style on display. The movie moves at a pace that keeps the story from not getting too boring. When it starts to slow, there is a moment where something small will happen just to get the mind racing. <br/><br/>I was on the edge of my seat from the beginning. I'm not easily scared. The jump scares do nothing for me. But not being able to see the brutal horror filled my mind with thoughts of unease. The film spreads dread from opening to end credits. That's something you don't get very often. It sat with me for hours after the film was over. It didn't help that I had watched The Conjuring hours beforehand. A small creepy film great for a late night viewings is what Sinister is."

"Horror-yo","6","0","0","31 December 2013"," ""Sinister"" ? Not really...
","*NO SPOILER PART* This isn't a good horror. It starts off very well, it feels very genuine, actors are good, Hawke in particular. Unfortunately the film does what many recent horrors have done, from around 2005 onwards: they start off with a strong impression, good atmosphere, and capture the audience's attention. Eventually it's only a matter of time before its authenticity crumbles apart as the story wanders on, completely drops in intensity, predictability sets in big clichés appear, we start to lose focus and stop caring for the characters...bits and pieces copy/pasted directly from other films... ultimately, it's just a bit of a mess. There are good scares in this film though, and like I said the movie is well conducted for a good hour or so.<br/><br/>It could/should've been a lot more 'sinister' and genuine, as this movie highly relies on the footage Hawke finds and analyzes. If you're going to go for a snuff-type, vivid horror might as well go all the way and make it really weird, borderline disturbing. It feels completely amateurish and lacks courage. In fact, it feels so underdeveloped overall it feels like a short story that's been adapted to the big screen and stretches into a full length blockbuster. It's all too fugitive, the plot hangs about, and the fundamental elements never flourish to full life and it seems yet another consumable/disposable 90min experience. <br/><br/>*SPOILER PART* Of course, the haunted house theme this movie does touch on majorly isn't the most original, and this...: the freaking dark house the whole way. Ridiculous, turn the darn lights on !! Turn em on, turn em on !!! Oh, and Ethan Hawke really likes 'Apple'.<br/><br/>A sympathy 6/10 because it was still quite enjoyable though and never gets putridly boring, rather than 5/10."
"nebk","6","0","0","30 December 2013"," Not as Sinister as it could have been...
","...but not bad either. This movie has a lot of things going for it but the negatives stop it from being a brilliant horror. <br/><br/>The premise is that a true crime novelist and his family move to a house where a family was murdered and one of the children disappeared. The novelist conveniently forgets to mention this fact to his wife. Although to be accurate the murders took place in the back yard so technically he is not lying. The novelist played by Ethan Hawke is trying to rekindle his literary success and is hoping that his latest book will bring him both fame and fortune. Soon after moving in he discovers a box with 8mm movies. Upon playing the movies he realizes he is looking at different families before and during their murders. He also realizes that there is a mysterious figure present in each movie and be believes that he is on the trail of a serial killer who has been killing families and kidnapping one child from each family from the mid-1960's. So far it sound like a psychological thriller....<br/><br/>....until the missing (ghost) children start appearing all over the house, the projector starts switching on by itself,weird noises and footsteps are heard and some genuinely creepy stuff starts happening. <br/><br/>The good aspects of the movie are: the acting is great and Hawke is especially good in his role. You don't know whether to sympathize with his character who is the family man or despise the fact that he is so indecisive and self centered because of his career. The effects are well made and there are some unexpected scares in the movie. There are more predictable ones but they can also be entertaining. The music score is also very well done and effective. The 8mm footage is genuinely unpleasant to watch and very effectively scary in the movie. Even though you know what the footage is about to reveal after you see the first clip it is still very scary stuff. However...<br/><br/>The bad aspects are: there are too many predictable scenes and scares and the whole movie tends to be predictable if you are paying enough attention. Within the first 30 minutes I was sure I knew who the killer was and I was pretty sure about how the movie would end. Throughout the movie it is eluded to that the family is not doing well financially and yet when they move back into their old house near the end of the movie it looks like a mansion. For someone not doing well in the money department they sure can afford to live well, buy a house to do research in and hire movers twice. That might explain why they are broke...<br/><br/>The author keeps on claiming that everything he does Is for his family and not the money or success but when he is presented with evidence of multiple murders he takes no action to report it to the police or at least talk to them. He hoards the footage for the purpose of writing his book. Not exactly the action of someone who exclaimed he would rather cut off his hands then see injustice done. The same can be said of the sheriffs deputy who does some research into the murders for the writer but doesn't see it as necessary to take actual police action. <br/><br/>Another problem is that even though he is spooked almost from the start the writer is in denial most of the time and hardly ever switches on the light when entering a dark room...even when he starts seeing ghosts and inexplicable sinister things. You would think that that would be the first thing he would do....but no, he persists in exploring the house in near darkness using a flashlight and starts drinking more. So the scares soon lose their validity since every time it is dark you expect something creepy to happen. Furthermore, even when he sees a photo of himself falling through the floor of the attic as he is being pulled by ghost hands his immediate action is to pull his laptop screen down and ignore it...not to run away to safety with his family. So there are definite inconsistencies and things which make no sense. <br/><br/>Overall however this movie even with its flaws is not bad. There are definite scares and even though it's predictable at times it is still very watchable. So I would give it a 6-6.5 but it could have been better."

","When this movie was unreleased and the trailer was brought out. It looked extremely promising. A newly imported horror that genuinely looked terrifying. The villain was something different and that's how you will succeed in the horror genre. <br/><br/>Personally from watching the movie it really had nothing special about it that was already in the trailer. The thing that it most had going for it was the jump scares and they where actually rather rare. The storyline was very interesting and its great to see a horror plot that extends my interests. Ethan Hawke played a true crime author looking for another best seller. His idea was to base it around the previous murders that occurred over the years and is researching into them. More and more he gets into the hidden messages behind them he finds out that once you see the murderer, you wont get away. <br/><br/>Overall the idea and plot is brilliant. I just don't think that this was very well thought through. I think that there could of been so much more added to the storyline and made it that much creepier. The villain was brilliant as he had such a frightening face and that is what drawn me into watching it. Its a shame that I've written a poor review really."

","To begin with, this horror movie is not without its flaws, but then again, what horror movie is? As we all know, most horror movies are cliché, predictable, and downright bad. But this little gem is something different and certainly should not be missed by those who enjoy a good scare.<br/><br/>The bad: What the main character (Ethan Hawke) does throughout the movie is a bit unrealistic at times. It was though he was asking to fall deeper within the ominous environment around him with little to no regard for his family's well being. Other viewers may disagree with me, but the path Ethan Hawke chooses to take throughout the course of the movie was inevitably towards his own doom and could have realistically been avoided. I would liked to have seen more rational choices been made by the characters, especially Ethan Hawke's character, to make for an even better solid horror movie.<br/><br/>The Good: There is plenty good to say about this movie. The idea was original, the acting was solid, the humor was placed ever so gently, and the build up to the climax was on point. I am not easily scared, but I found myself cringing in my seat during the dark scenes and gripping the chair I was sitting in. The movie gives away subtle clues to the ending but in no way does it reveal anything that will deter the viewer from finishing the movie.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of blood and gore, look elsewhere because this movie does not have much of it at all and if you think you know the ending, you are probably wrong. You may know part of it, but you do not know all of it. Viewers can rest assure that they may think they know the whole ending, but in all probability, they do not.<br/><br/>Overall, if you want so endure a solid, original horror movie, you have found your film. Sinister delivers."

How did they manage to do some heavy work which was required to set the executions up anyway?<br/><br/>2. The way the father reacts seemed unrealistic. He was way too collected and I wished the director delved deeper into his psyche going haywire with the events. The rest of the family somehow never heard or saw anything weird in the meantime.<br/><br/>3. I was under the impression that the families had been living in the house for some time before they were killed but somehow the family we see die the night they arrive at their new house.<br/><br/>4. None of the previous families reported anything spooky or acted strange when it seems that if the pattern was identical to what happened to the one we saw (which is what the film suggests) then somebody would have noticed something for sure. THEN the father never showed anything to the police so as to conveniently keep the murders a mystery.<br/><br/>It may seem that I have quite a strong opinion against this film but the truth is that while viewing it I was too busy feeling horrified to fully make these realizations. Hence 7/10. It was scary but unfortunately there were things at the back of my mind which didn't really click together. Also, my mind didn't feel devastated afterward as I rather quickly overcame the fear as I continued to see flaws in logic."

","Good American horror is hard to come by these days, especially if you grew up on horror as I have and know all the tricks of the trade. I don't get scared by movies anymore, but I did enjoy the first two Paranormal Activity films the first time through which is what lead me to check out both Insidious (average film from the writer and director of Paranormal Activity) and Sinister (from a producer of both Paranormal Activity and Insidious).<br/><br/>So is Sinister a good Horror film? No, it's not a particularly good horror film, but it's worth a watch if you watch it for what it truly is, a mystery with horror elements. The direction of this film often relies heavily on the same old jump scares that only work on someone young or new to the genre. Hearing the same old ominous horror music played during what are supposed to be tense moments, followed by a gotcha surprise can be tedious (try ominous silence over music, has any modern horror director ever seen Hitchcock's The Birds?), but Ethan Hawke's performance and the mystery he is trying to unravel kept my attention and did in fact make me uneasy at times.<br/><br/>Ellison Oswalt (Ethan Hawke) is a True Crime writer who hasn't had a successful book in 10 years. Apparently his last two books were received so poorly that they put his entire career and legacy in jeopardy which has driven him to both drink and obsess over writing another best seller. He learns of a family which was murdered in their home in a small town in middle America, the young girl went missing, and the killer/abductor was never found. He makes the controversial decision to move himself and his entire family into this home so he can investigate the crime and write his novel. This decision to move into a murder house where the killer was never caught is where the movie loses a lot of people. Why would anyone put their whole family in jeopardy by moving into a house with the slightest chance the killer might return to the scene of the crime? The script attempts to highlight Oswalt's desperation to write another successful book, and frequently reminds us of his drinking problem, but for the most part he seems like a rational guy and the decision to move his family into this murder house is understandably too much for many people to swallow.<br/><br/>I personally just accepted the premise and suspended my disbelief. However, I expected Sinister to be smarter than it was. After moving into the new home, Ellison Oswalt soon finds 8 mm footage of smut films showing the murders of the family which lived at the very house he moved into, as well as murders of other families at other homes. After being initially horrified with what he found, he soon felt a morbid excitement over his discovery and fascinated over using it all in his next book; instead of investigating one crime, he could link it to multiple crimes as the work of a serial killer. His investigation of this disturbing smut footage is where the movie gets interesting, and quite creepy, but once strange things start happening in the house it started to lose me. <br/><br/>At first it seemed like Sinister was going to tease me over exactly what was going on: Is there a serial killer stalking him and his family? Is it a supernatural entity haunting his family? Is he losing his mind Jack Nicholson style in The Shining? I was hoping all three of these possibilities would be presented as equal possibilities to keep me wondering throughout, but it was pretty clear what the threat truly was early on in the movie. I still enjoyed the mystery we had, I just thought it could have went deeper and been more ambiguous about what the threat was, if there even was one. Has the killer returned to retrieve his film? Is it a ghost? Is Oswalt just a crazy drunk? I wanted Sinister to keep me guessing throughout.<br/><br/>I say it's worth a watch if you can suspend your disbelief that an author, no matter how desperate, would put his wife and two kids in the slightest bit of danger to write his next work. Had I seen this in the theaters I wouldn't have been disappointed, but I definitely think it could have been better."

The movie follows a pattern of watch films, argue with family, talk to Deputy so and so. At times it was difficult to keep my attention on the film. <br/><br/>When the movie ended, in what I assumed was a dreadful ending, I was already to come onto IMDb and assign one star to the film and give it a bad review.

By the time I was a teenager, I was more desensitized. This is not to say that no movies have scared me, but they are extremely rare. And there was nothing in Sinister that I can recall being remotely scary.<br/><br/>However, as I got up to go to the bathroom, an unexplained feeling of apprehension came over me. I actually ended up turning on the hallway light, which is rare because I tend to spend a lot of my time in the dark. I found myself looking back and forth. While I was in the bathroom, I heard a sound (probably one of the four cats) that further bugged me.<br/><br/>The thing I can't explain is that I can think of nothing in this movie that was scary. Absolutely nothing. However I was mildly frightened moving around in my house in the dark after watching it. So even if I can't pinpoint what it was, I had to come to the conclusion that there was something in this movie that scared me. And I like being scared. So even though I was sure I did not like this movie, I have to give it a good review because on some level, it did what no horror movie in years has been able to do: scare me in some way."

","Let me start out by saying that I didn't hate this film. It was one of those films that had me hanging off the edge of my seat, and even my husband who finds most films these days, predictable, found it to be different. I guess this was supposed to be a new take on the Found Footage genre, but i didn't really find it to really fit in that category other than it involved videotapes. The story line was really well scripted, I liked the characters, and thought most of the movie was pretty believable. The problem for me was the ""Found Footage"" part. Most of the movie is the Main Character sitting down and watching ""Snuff Films"" and the problem is that it shows way too much for my liking. I know when I watch a horror movie, i'm going to see gore/ explicit stuff, but I'd really like to not watch it as it happens. The video stuff was just over the top for me. I know horror films are always trying to push boundaries and while i'm all for it, lets leave out violence against pregnant mothers and children."

","Since my childhood, I've been a fan of horror films. In recent years, the quality of horror films have dwindled and many films are recycled versions of older movies. How is a horror film measured, then?<br/><br/>Well firstly, it has to be scary. A horror must disturb, frighten, shock, surprise and make you cover your eyes. About 1 out of every 10 horrors manages to truly achieve this. Secondly, it has to be entertaining. ""Sinister"", recycled and clichéd as it is, fortunately is most of the former. I can't recall a film that made me feel so much dread, I almost couldn't bring myself to watch with full intent. The latter... it was most definitely not. I did not enjoy watching this film, ONE BIT. <br/><br/>So, when it comes to scoring ""Sinister"" I give praise to the director for terrifying the wits out of me, because that's what a horror is supposed to do! The imagery is very creepy from the start, and the diabolical character Baghuul is frighteningly twisted to say the least, and forgive me for adding - ""pretty f***ed up."" The director's last horror offering, ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose (2005)"" was almost equally disturbing in this sense. What Emily Rose had and ""Sinister"" didn't, though, was that enjoyment factor.... that 'kick' I get out of watching really good horror films. ""Sinister"" scary as it was, was too tedious. Aside from great acting by Ethan Hawke, I don't have any other praise for this movie.<br/><br/>Cut-above-the-average horror, disturbing & hair-raising - but not enjoyable at all. I dare you to watch it."
"joben-525-633946","7","0","0","21 December 2012"," Scary and creepy, 'Sinister' is a fine horror, but nothing too terrifying.
","Certainly creepy on a regular basis, 'Sinister' is able to sustain a chilling atmospheric feel throughout however you won't be requiring a new pair of pants.<br/><br/>Ethan Hawke is outstanding and believable as a man who's insanity is tested to the limit. Ellison Oswalt is a wannabe author who moves he and his family into a new house in search of an interesting non-fiction tale to tell. Keeping the house's gruesome past to himself, Ellison attempts to figure out answers to the investigation, only to come across forces even he thought unimaginable.<br/><br/>Yes, the narrative and the scenes are clichéd. However, its the clichés which are so scary. 'Sinister' is certainly scary occasionally and without crying out with fear or whimpering in the corner, it certainly leaves its mark - if you're a timid person in search of scares, 'Sinister' should tick the boxes. Perhaps if you are more relaxed with the horror genre, you may be a little disappointed.<br/><br/>The actual story is rather intriguing and the whole investigation had me hooked. The story may not be pact full of terrifying moments, but their is certainly a shivery ambiance throughout - this certainly compelled me into the film further.<br/><br/>Critics have described 'Sinister' as 'the scariest movie in decades' and others say that Scott Derrickson the films's writer and director did 'absolutely nothing right'. Certainly the latter is not true and extremely harsh however the former is perhaps a little to generous. Definitely 'Sinister' does many things right - enough to warrant seven marks out of ten - however it is far from the scariest movie in decades."

","We have all heard the saying ""what goes around comes around"", which normally is meant to be said towards a bad guy, but have you heard that same saying used towards a good guy? No. The horror movie Sinister directed by Scott Derrickson tells us that this saying is not always meant to be towards bad guys but it can be for good guys as well. The movie shows that Karma can played on anyone, not just bad people. In the beginning of the film, Super 8 footage shows a family of four standing underneath a tree with bags over their heads and nooses around their necks. An unseen figure makes one of the tree limb falls as the family are rising up being hung. Several months later, a crime novelist, Ellison Oswalt (played well by Ethan Hawke), now moves into the same house as the murder family of four with his wife Tracy (played well by Juliet Rylance) and their two children Ashley (played well by Clare Foley) and Trevor (played well by Michaek Hall D'Addario). Ellison uses these types of murders for his new book. Supposedly, there were five members of the family and one of them went missing after the murders. Throughout the film, there is foreshadowing in that he says to his family that he is going to be famous. In the middle of the night something falls in the attic and he finds a box of super 8 footage. Each film that he finds has a family dying at the end in some gruesome way. He begins to put together the mystery by watching these films until he see's an unknown figure in each film. When Scott started shooting the film Sinister, it began in the autumn of 2011. Sinster was released in 2011 at the SXSW festival in United States. Sinister premiered in the United Kingdom at the London Fright Fest and in Spain. Film.com stated that Sinister was a deeply freighting horror movie. Crickets and reviewers give it a three out of four stars calling it a ""Undeniably"" scary movie. What I really like about the movie sinister was its visual effects, their acting and some of their comedy. The visual effects came out at me in surprising way. Neat colors, no glitches just perfect. There was a part in the movie where Ellison is on the phone and he turns his back on the computer. Now there was an image of a person on the computer when he paused it. As he was on the phone while the computer was still put on paused, just some how the person move its head side to side then back to its normal position. The acting and comedy played with everybody. The things I didn't like about this movie was the plot. We all know when we see a scary movie there has to be some type of plot in it. Well this one kind of did but it really didn't make any sense. This ""unseen"" figure name is Boogieman. They say he was some type of demon creature from ancient Babylon that can take kids soul and put his soul into theirs even know the kid is still alive. Basically the kids are being possessed. The movie did not provide enough information about this Boogieman or how this could happen etc. Also in some parts of the movie it will make you confused because you don't have any idea what they are talking about half of the time."
"Robert_duder","8","0","0","30 October 2012"," Sinister delivers creepy chills with an empty ending
","Certainly the October month is crowded with horror films. Sinister does manage to bring a certain unique quality to the genre and provides a story that could be easily spread over multiple films although its also not the type of horror flick that would normally get a sequel. The suspense is good and it doesn't leave you to a long elaborate build up but instead jumps right into the plot and the chills. The film has a solid story, good lore to the whole concept, decent performances, just all around a well done, entertaining and downright creepy flick. I think its the type of film that Stephen King would absolutely love. It reeks of his style (and that's a big compliment!) Struggling writer, paranormal circumstances, small town, and perhaps most importantly a man who progressively is losing his grip on sanity and reality throughout the course of the film. The only issue with the movie is perhaps they create too big of a potential story arc for one movie to handle so some of the details gets left behind.<br/><br/>Ethan Hawke is excellent, really top notch as the determined writer, husband and father. In a short amount of time you can actually see the insanity of this paranormal entity getting to him. He fits his character well and basically single-handedly carries the film star wise. Juliet Rylance plays his devoted but frustrated wife. She is sort of understated in the film, her character is not well developed and is really just there to be support to his character. Michael Hall D'Addario and Clare Foley do a great job as Hawke's children. They are both very convincing and really have some great moments in the film. Considering the direction the film takes they should have had a more leading role in the movie. James Ransone is good as ""Deputy so and so"" as he's known. He doesn't have a huge role but him and Hawke have good chemistry and his character is integral to the story. I very much would have liked to have seen more from Vincent D'Onofrio who has an uncredited role as Professor Jonas, the expert. So much more could have been done with his character.<br/><br/>Sinister does not use the biggest horror fad now of hand cam, ""this is real"" type direction and yet it does. It works it in there by using the old home videos that Hawke finds. This brings us full circle and will actually make you feel creeped out again by the home movie style of direction. Director Scott Derrickson's first film was a bonafide horror classic ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose."" While Sinister doesn't quite match how great that was, you can still tell the man knows how to tell a solid story. If the only thing I can say bad about this is that I wanted more than they did a great job. Sinister delivers everything you'd expect from the trailers and descriptions. Its a good solid horror flick. The ending is supposed to be a twist although I don't think it really shocked me all that much and it will certainly leave lots of questions in your mind. Well worth the price of admission this Halloween! 8/10"
"cummingsjosh7","7","0","0","26 October 2012"," Sinister is creepy at times but still delivers some cheap scares
","Just because something pops into a screen and makes a loud noise, doesn't necessarily make it scary. Most of us are more afraid of what we don't know. If you are on the edge of your seat because you are creeped out and you are anticipating something, but you aren't quite sure what that thing is going to be, then you are really scared. However, if you are anticipating a loud noise and then that noise that you are braced for actually happens, then you aren't scared at all. Predictable jump scares can ruin a movie.<br/><br/>Sinister is the latest horror film coming out this weekend that stars Ethan Hawke. Hawke plays a crime novelist that has just decided to move into a home where a family was murdered. He is hoping he can uncover something about the case so he has a story for his new book. During his investigation, he stumbles upon some old super 8 footage in his attic. After watching some of this disturbing footage, strange and unexplained events start occurring in his home.<br/><br/>There were parts of Sinister that I loved and then there were parts that I absolutely hated. There were moments in Sinister that were very creepy and I was genuinely scared. I was even thinking to myself, ""Finally, a horror movie that is actually scaring me without resulting to cheap jumpy noises."" Unfortunately, there are a lot of parts in Sinister, that lead up to cliché horror moments. For example, you hear a dull thud. The character goes to investigate and the music is slowly building up. He stops to peer into the darkness and the music comes to a quiet. After a long pause, BOOM! A face appears and a crash or a loud instrument sound erupts into your eardrums making you jump out of your seat. How many times have we seen that before? When you're expecting it, it's not scary.<br/><br/>Jump scares make me furious. I'm not mad because the movie startled me; I'm mad because this is lazy writing. Anyone can throw a loud moment into a scary movie. It takes real creativity to come up with something that is truly scary and completely unexpected. Fortunately, there are some of those creative moments that a fan of horror movies can appreciate. Don't get me wrong, there are a lot of aspects of this movie that I enjoyed. I was very pleased with the performance of Ethan Hawke. Also, the music in Sinister is awesome. It has an edgy feel to it and it really sucks you into the scene you're watching.<br/><br/>Sinister could have been a fantastic horror movie and a breath of fresh air to a dying genre. The movie really did have a lot of good direction and great pacing with very scary moments. I will say that there are a tad more of the actual terrifying moments instead of the dull predictable moments making this more of a good movie than bad. For some reason though, the director decided he needed to throw in some clichés which may work for some viewers but will definitely anger the true fans of horror. B-"
"mvinnaco","5","0","0","25 October 2012"," It was okay
","Sinister is greater than the sum of its parts for sure, but still not a great movie. <br/><br/>It's jumpy-scary without being scary-scary. All the scares are boo noises, without that element of pervasive dread that really makes a movie stick with you. Sinister is over when you leave the theater. <br/><br/>The soundtrack was the weakest link for me, with the thin dialog coming in a close second. Practical and special effects looked like something your average Norwegian Black Metal band could throw together in a self-produced music video. In fact, the boogie man himself bore a remarkable resemblance to King Diamond (which you can tell from the trailer). The movie would have been better off not showing that character at all. <br/><br/>Despite the problems with dialog, the actors did a good job looking scared. The jumps were jumpy, so even though that's a lame effect it did its job. There's nothing here Hollywood hasn't done a million times before. Like too many American movies, everything gets explained in way too much detail, leaving no stone left ambiguous. <br/><br/>Best part of the filmmaking was the cinematography, hands down. Each reel was crafted with close attention to period-accurate detail. These were the most believable parts of the movie. I'm glad we didn't descend into shaky-cam ridiculousness; we could actually see what was going on in each frame, which was nice. <br/><br/>All in all, Sinister is probably the scariest of the Horror McNuggets. If you're going to see it, see it in the theater because it isn't going to work without surround sound. But I would wait until it hits the dollar theater. It just isn't worth 10$."
"TheSquiss","7","0","0","23 October 2012"," Avoid the trailer, watch it cold & clench your buttocks. Or watch the trailer and have the experience spoilt.
","It was with great trepidation that I took my seat for Sinister. I often veer away from horror films, as frequently they tend to be less about chilling and more about shocking with gratuitous violence. No sensitivity required, just a strong stomach and a certain bloodlust. The likes of Hostel and the latter Saw gore-fests may have made mucho $$$ but were never going to trouble Oscar or satisfy a discerning audience in the way The Exorcist still manages.<br/><br/>Oh, and I was clenching my buttocks even before the lights dimmed having read a fellow reviewer's comment: I have never heard a female audience member scream as loud as I heard last night...<br/><br/>Oh, dear.<br/><br/>Post event? Well, the midnight drive home through dark, winding country lanes wasn't the most fun I've had on my own but Sinister is nowhere near the terrifying experience that some would have you believe. If you've seen the trailer, you know what's going to happen, you'll know when the biggest shocks are coming and there is nothing left to be surprised by. If you haven't, I'd urge you to ignore the link above and go into Sinister blind and completely unprepared in order to benefit fully. When is Hollywood going to relearn the art of 'teasers' rather than feeding us 'show all the best bits' trailers that destroy the experience? Watching Sinister after viewing the trailer is akin to sitting through The Others when you know they are ghosts.<br/><br/>Ellison Oswalt (Ethan Hawke) is a 'true-crime' writer whose success has dwindled. Close to financial ruin, he uproots his family and moves to a new home, neglecting to tell them it is the scene of the murders in his latest book. Oswalt then finds a Super 8 projector and spools of films in the attic. Spools of film that show grisly scenes. And then bad things happen. Very bad things.<br/><br/>There is more than a whiff of Jack Torrance about Oswalt but that is almost inevitable given his career choice and location (author writing in a building with dark secrets). However, the hints of madness, the inner torture and the genuine fear with which Hawke imbues Oswalt are original and not lifted from another character. His determination that evolves into stubbornness, teeters on the edge of insanity and then tumbles into considered panic is real enough to feel from the safety of a cinema seat and highlights again the quality of Hawke. Perhaps true movie stardom has bypassed him but he consistently gives fine performances and is an actor who will paint multi-faceted characters for us to watch, admire and shy from for a great many years yet.<br/><br/>The lack of impact from the supporting actors implies a heavy-handed editor or over-bearing producer. Juliet Rylance is given little to do as Oswalt's wife, Tracy, other than to react to his actions. Likewise, the children, Trevor and Ashley, feel as though there was more given to them that was consigned to the cutting room floor. Yes, they have an impact, they are important to the plot in their own ways but neither is allowed to develop fully. Upon arrival at the house, Oswalt verbally spars with the sheriff and we see the mutual contempt they feel for each other's roles but again, this left unexplored and the most we get is a cameo, that is almost humorous but never really effective, in the shape of a cop forever known as Deputy So-and-so.<br/><br/>But, flaws aside, Sinister is a film of tension, a film that, given a dark room, no fore-warning and the right mindset, will really put the willies up you, not least of all for the soundtrack. The music frequently feels little more than moans, screeches and rhythmic noise that claws its way under the skin and scratches at the underside of your hair follicles.<br/><br/>Inevitably, given the success of the Paranormal Activity series, writer/director Scott Derrickson (The Day The Earth Stood Still, The Exorcism of Emily Rose) has set Sinister up for both sequels and prequels. But with his next film an adaptation of Stephen King's The Breathing Method, it remains to be seen if he takes the easy money or leaves it to another b-lister on the rise. Regardless, Sinister is a film that currently belongs at the top of his CV.<br/><br/>Now switch the light off, try to ignore the banging and creaking in the attic and sleep well<br/><br/>For more reviews from The Squiss subscribe to my blog at www.thesquiss.co.uk<br/><br/>Like the Facebook page: http://on.fb.me/RpitOG"

","So I read a lot of the reviews on here before going out to see Sinister on the second weekend after it was released and these reviews got me all fired up to see it with all the ""scariest horror movie in a decade"" reviews. But alas, if these people find this movie one of the scariest movies ever, would they even be able to survive The Exorcist, the first two Halloweens (the originals), the first Friday the 13th, or most episodes of Paranormal Witness on SyFy? While I thoroughly enjoyed this film, with its inventive take on the too tired found footage genre, only once or twice did I actually jump in my seat and those instances were not followed up by much to make me scared. I have to admit, I was sitting on the edge of my seat waiting for something to happen, as this film is creepy and does a good job of making you uneasy, but by the time it was over I realized, ""I never really got scared"". If you are interested in a decent mystery with a ""sinister"" plot, thus the title I guess, and can take some somewhat gory images, then this movie is recommended. But if you are a true horror fan, don't go see this expecting to be scream out loud frightened or cover your eyes horrified. No real gore, no true frights, just an interesting story that in the end is a bit predictable but worth a look."

","One thing I can guarantee you as a movie goer, this film will not bore you. I was expecting to sh*t a brick or two while watching this movie kinda like I did with Insidious.However, No bricks were shat.<br/><br/>The movie kinda hits you over the head with the fact Ethan Hawke's character has not written a successful novel in awhile. In fact, I believe 5 people on screen within 10 minutes make some remark along the lines of ""hey so are you gonna finally write a good book this time"" Once you get past that though the story is fast paced fun from there on out. <br/><br/>If you have seen the trailers for this movie then congrats...you have just viewed about 90% of this movies scariest scenes. This movie could have been one of the scariest films known to man if it really wanted too with crazy pop outs of Bagul and all that but for the most part they play it pretty casual and I respected that part. The problem is the couple of times I did jump in this movie were all from just loud sounds and not from anything in the plot. The movie wants to be scary but to horror fans you really aren't going to get much more then some Paranormal activity type scares here. <br/><br/>The reason I do give this movie a 7/10 still despite it not being that scary is because it was entertaining. It does not take 50 minutes to set up the story and build up character development. This is a fast paced cant wait to see what is next film. Where it falls short is how it is handled. Etahn Hawke investigating who Bagul is and the links of the murders is what made this movie entertaining. This film would have been talked about for years if it had been focused on Hawke being more of a detective and the back story of who/what Bagul is and who the murdered family's were and all that good stuff. Instead we get mild at best scares,loud noises and stupid children running around the house attempting to be scary all while a very entertaining investigation is being thrown on the back burner.<br/><br/>Sinister is more thrilling then it is scary. It is a fun film but for people familiar with the whole ""show creepy thing but don't show too much of it because its super scary to leave stuff to peoples imagination"" genre, I highly doubt you will walk away from this film genuinely scared."

","'Sinister' is advertised as being one of the scariest films of 2012 and it probably is, but nothing more.<br/><br/>The acting is poor but this is due to the bad dialogue in the script. The conversations have all occurred before in countless other films, discussions can seem false and wooden throughout the whole film. Ethan Hawke does try his best to give a decent performance but it fails due to the poor script.<br/><br/>The storyline is a bit unique; there have not been many supernatural horror movies in the past twenty years but 2012 has seen quite a few so far. The plot is scary and quite disturbing at some points, I was surprised because it's rated as a 15, personally, I think it should have been an 18. However, the plot does work it's just the dialogue that lets it down. <br/><br/>Overall, the film will frighten most people; there are lots of jumpy scenes and quite a few creepy ones too. The films' only let down was its boring dialogue which made this film a lot worse than it should be and far more forgettable."

","Sinister, Scott Dickerson's horror follow up to the 2005 Exorcism of Emily Rose (turning a blind eye to the ill advised Day the Earth stood still remake) is a rare horror film in modern Hollywood. It manages to be scary. Anchored by a solid turn by Ethan Hawke and an old school approach to scares, Sinister is arguable one of the better horror films of the year if not the last few.<br/><br/>Early trailers for Sinister tended to highlight the found footage aspect of the film. It is admiring that the film has a much fresher approach to it. The story instead chooses to focus on the person who finds the footage. Ethan Hawke plays Ellison, a struggling true crime writer working on his latest book. He finds a box of disturbing Super 8 films in the attic of his new home and the movie focuses on the strange goings on surrounding this ''found footage''.<br/><br/>Why this film succeeds over other more recent Horror films is in the writing of Hawkes character. Having tasted fame a decade earlier Ellison has struggled to capture the success he once had. Facing financial ruin he moves his family into a new house which was once the scene of a horrific family murder. The idea is to get closer to the victims, write his best book yet, save his family from financial hardship and more importantly get back the fame he so desperately craves. It's the constant threat of financial hardship and Hawke's ego that makes him and his family remaining in the house all the more believable when things start to go bump in the night. Hawke is lucky to be blessed with a character that is a lot deeper than you would get in this type of film. He captures the stress and desperation of his situation perfectly. At times he can come across has arrogant but it's a testament to Hawke's performance that you are always rooting for him.<br/><br/>Scott Dickerson and co screen writer C. Robert Cargill has expertly crafted a horror film with very old school sensibilities. The action is set predominantly in the confines of the house and the photography coupled with an unnerving score provides a constant level of threat throughout. There are no quick edits to get scares, no flashy photography. The whole thing has a very 70's style feel to it. The film is grim and tense without ever reeling on gore or violence. The scares when they do come are well crafted. With the exception of one unnecessary jump scare near the beginning the film never seems to relay on cheap tricks in order to get goose bumps. The terror seems to be at a high level from the get go providing tension in scenes that might not be seeking it. In one particular scene, a heated exchange between Ellison and his wife. I found myself focusing on the background, constantly waiting for a figure to appear in the doorway, or from something strike. The use of the old super 8 footage is creepy in itself and I would suggest if you haven't seen the trailer to avoid has the less you see of them the better. Finally the villain of the piece is unnerving, well designed and used just sparingly enough that it is certain to leave an impression. <br/><br/>Sinister isn't flawless. Performances outside of Hawke's are more hit and miss. Juliet Rylance has Ellison's wife is given one or two scenes to shine but disappears for large chunks of the screen time. The same faith befalls his children in particular his son who only seems to appear in the house when something strange has to occur. After awhile he disappears altogether and there is never a sense that all these characters exist under the same roof. Some much need comedy moments arrive in the form of Deputy so and so who is used sparingly enough. Vincent Di Onofrio literally web cams it in a small role has an occult college professor. <br/><br/>Overall Sinister works, Sure, his family seem to be heavily sedated come night has they never seem to wake to any of the strange goings on. Sure Ellison seems to be very environmentally conscious has he insists on investing the strange goings on in his house without ever turning a light on. These are minor issues in a film that works so well. Sinister is creepy and disturbing and will stay with you long after the house lights come on. If you are looking for some genuine scares, you couldn't get any better than this."

","Every now and then I kid myself into thinking that the latest Hollywood Horror, which has all the hallmarks of the tired old formula, will actually be a bit different and rise above the rest. In the process Ill drag all my friends along to see it, under duress, and end up having to admit that once again my instincts were wrong... and that's exactly what happened here. <br/><br/>Sinister could have been creepy and for fleeting moments it was, but for the majority of it the scares were cheap and the plot was tacked-on and unoriginal. My biggest gripe of all is the unnecessary use of the dead/undead/possessed children format; to say that Hollywood has over- used the concept is redundant but as soon as this film revealed the first pale, head-tilted, expressionless kid I actually felt embarrassed, which is a new emotion for me when watching a horror film. <br/><br/>The home movies had potential but were just a cheap method for shoe- horning in some disturbing sequences without a need for the plot to actually take the audience on a journey to get there.<br/><br/>It wasn't all bad and there were some moments which briefly took the film off its generic course, for example the scenes between Ethan Hawke and the slightly odd 'Deputy so and so'; their interactions were awkward and some-what surreal but ended up being the best bits of the film.<br/><br/>All in all I think there is still a market for this sort of film and there is still a large proportion of film-goers who will equate the interjection of shockingly loud, unexpected noises and evil children with effective Horror, but for me I need a film that makes me feel rather than just see and this fell way short of the mark."

","Sinister Plot A once successful crime writer moves his unsuspecting family into a house with a dark past.<br/><br/>Review True crime writer Ellison Oswalt is looking for his next big story and decides it may lie in a house that was once witness to a mass hanging. Without telling his family of its tragic past they move in and as his research begins Ellison uncovers the properties true past.<br/><br/>For the past few decades cinema has been awash with lazy throw away horror films, each a copy and paste from the one before. Hollywood's sure way to make a quick buck, ""If it's not broken then why fix it"". Hollywood knows its market and its teenage target audience who have become so accustomed to the sloppy, poorly made genre movie that they have inevitably become the norm.<br/><br/>So what makes Sinister different....well. Nothing really. The film starts with promise but quickly slides into the ridiculous and ultimately the monotonous.<br/><br/>The cast never quite seem to gel on screen as a family. The dialogue between them seems clunky and unnatural. When the supernatural element eventually kicks off the special effects feel and look extremely amateurish and leave you feeling cheated. The drama that unfolds in several key scenes in the film are poorly executed and at times are more likely to result in a snigger than a gasp. With a wafer thin narrative there's very little here to keep you guessing for its 110min running time...<br/><br/>Another horror film that far from delivers its promise. Poorly written, directed and executed <br/><br/>Read more of my Reviews at http://www.moviereviewworld.com/"

","i went to watch sinister in the cinema, and for a teenager who gets a thrill from being sh!t scared, sinister was disappointing. If i can become scared watching a horror movie in the daytime, then why couldn't sinister deliver that experience within a pitch black theatre? i believe that it has a interesting plot but it failed to deliver the scary thrills that other horror movies can deliver such as insidious and paranormal activity, but then again what do you expect from a movie that has an age rating of 15, this was foreseeable.<br/><br/>even though it was bad at the horror parts, it had a good gripping storyline and for that I'm gonna give it a 4/10.

If you have half a brain- this movie is TERRIBLE. I mean really terrible. These kids calling it a horror classic have no idea. Jump scares. Boards Of Canada detuned music and improbable scares are what gets them through. They've never known real horror movies apparently. Skip this movie and use that time to watch a real horror movie that actually builds tension and real scares not based on setups that Derrickson and the writers manufactured to create atmosphere.

","I am watching sinister 1&2 with my step daughter and her friends and we got into a conversation about making more Sinister movies using the murders from the movies. Go back to the first murder recorded and make a movie for each one. It would make a great horror series :-) Each movie should leave a trail leading to each murder so that way all murders connect and when you get back to the first movie just connect it. We have many more ideas for movies and if anyone would love to hear them just comment and let me know. We are more than willing to share our ideas. I am 22 & the ages of the theirs are 12 13 13.

"Viator Veritatis","2","2","5","3 April 2015"," Far-fetched, illogical plot and poor character development
","Whether you like this (or any other) movie depends on what you're looking for. If you, like me, demand a sensible plot, a consistent evil threat and you require characters to behave in a passably realistic way, you are going to puke over this pitiful abortion. If, on the other side, you concentrate on cheap scares, occasional eerie moments and you don't mind heavily repeated clichés, you might find 'Sinister' of your liking.<br/><br/>It's basically a matter whether you're going for thoughts or for flashes. As other reviewers remarked, the plot is full of holes. The son's night scares are not connected in any way to the main story. Ethan Hawke gropes his way in a house full of mysterious whispers without feeling the need to switch any light on. He makes awful noises without any family member waking up and coming to investigate. The evil menace is as exotic and far-flung as imaginable. Neither the policeman or the researcher helping Ethan really fit in the story -- they are just momentary addictions with no consistency of their own. And so on and so on."

","This is my first IMDb review, i know i'm not a great critic or anything but i felt like i had to come on here and give a review on Sinister. As a HUGE horror movie fan i try to watch pretty much every horror movie out there that might seem even a bit scary. I've gone through countless average-subpar movies as well as a few good ones. Somehow i managed to skip over sinister and never really thought twice thinking it was just another mediocre horror movie with terrible acting and a flaky story that relied heavily on jump scares. When i actually got around to watching sinister i was extremely impressed, and very scared. It is extremely rare these days for movies to be genuinely creepy. Jump scares are fun and all but rarely, RARELY am i genuinely creeped out by a movie. After watching sinister, i must say i was actually a little disturbed, which has only happened with a select few horror movies. Not to spoil anything but i swear if i ever see that sinister face IRL i will lose it. What really impressed me about sinister is that it wasn't really ""weak"" in any particular area. As horror movies go, i'd say it was one of the strongest well rounded titles i've ever seen. A solid thought-through story, good acting, good pace, and overall did a very good job of keeping your attention with very few lulls in the scarefest. All the ""super 8"" films probably had THE MOST disturbing audio and video i've ever seen. This movie was not made for the average viewer, not even for the average horror fan. One of if not the scariest movie ever, i hope to see more from this director."
"jmbwithcats","9","2","5","9 May 2014"," My Review
","Sinister is imho the best horror film of recent years, in large part to the incredible soundtrack ""Silence Teaches You How To Sing"" by Ulver. Amazing work, I played it last Halloween on the porch, and it's super creepy stuff...<br/><br/>Ethan Hawke, Vincent D'Onofrio, soundtrack by Ulver, written and directed by Scott Derrickson, definitely his best work.<br/><br/>Sinister has a respectable horror film rating of 6.8 on IMDb, and a 63% on Rotten Tomatoes, so I think it's better than the average moviegoer, but they don't think it's that bad. I'm just more forgiving because of the elements I mentioned, plus I love the writing, the pacing, the music, I love mythology based weirdness.<br/><br/>I think I've always been a sucker for found footage horror, even before it was its own genre, it was used sparingly, like in Prince of Darkness, The Ring, Hexen all the way back in the '20s is technically the very first found footage horror film ever made.<br/><br/>Blair Witch brought it back as a genre, Grave Encounters is a personal favorite because it's also a parody of the show Ghost Adventures."

But this one has it all.<br/><br/>I didn't know anything about the title when I saw it first except Ethan Hawke. But I gave it a shot, watched it at home with the lights dimmed alone and it was great! There is a story that actually makes sense. There is not excessive blood that makes it ridiculous.

It's just that younger audiences won't know what hit them and it will likely make them upset.<br/><br/>Sinister is easily one of the most disturbing and scary movies I have ever seen in my entire life.

","I watched this because it rated 6.7. The reviews were glowing. I can only conclude said reviews were faked or written by people who are too easily pleased.<br/><br/>The opening was promising. Intriguing. Stylish. But the style -- with its dimly lit interiors -- becomes simply annoying real fast and the plot degenerates into utter nonsense.<br/><br/>What kind of nutcase moves his wife and two young kids into a home where the gruesome multiple murder of a family occurred? It wasn't necessary. Then when presented with a set of horrific home movies, what kind of person would take days to work their way through them? You'd stay up all night if you had to in search of answers. What kind of dullard doesn't react to the fact that the projector switches on in the middle of the night in a locked room on at least two occasions? Doesn't seem to bother our hero much if at all. And, given the above, why should we have any sympathy with him??? No reason at all. <br/><br/>There's a truly awful reveal scene towards the end where Mum & Dad go on to argue over the wisdom of staying in the house. The dialog feels like it was improvised and the scene shot in one take. Improvised badly that is. It totally exposes what a load of bunkum we are being expected to swallow.<br/><br/>It's not often that I end watching a film feeling angry but this one managed it.

I've chosen this film because of Ethan Hawke, who till now has never disappointed me, but from this moment i have to add him to the list of actors who definitely decline. there is no action in this film, no thrill at all (despite some violence in the description of the crimes - but it takes about 5 minutes of 2 hours of boredom). the biggest terror, according to the creators of this ""masterpiece"", should be caused by the sudden appearance of pale children in the dark (in dirty clothes and with dirty hands) - wow I'm so scared, really - and i shouldn't forget about the man in a white mask, who appears from time to time at the edge of the screen - I'm terrified. the only thing that's really scary is the thought that the real money were spent on this failure - so i strongly recommend you to avoid this title and watch something more advanced intellectually for example Baywatch."

"jdneukom","5","2","5","15 February 2013"," This Sounds Like a Job for Captain Hindsight
","I feel like this film deserves a good, solid damning with faint praise...it was watchable.<br/><br/>Well, the bar has been set very low for the horror genre over the past 20 years, so it isn't surprising this film is getting some audacious praise. But if you are looking for a horror film on par with HALLOWEEN, THE SHINING, or even THE RING you really needn't watch this film. In my opinion, if you look up the word ""mediocre"" in a dictionary, it should have Derrickson's SINISTER listed as a synonym.<br/><br/>Ethan Hawke was believable in his role as Ellison Oswalt, but really he was a supporting actor in this film--the projector was the lead. There was also one of the better marital blow-up scenes since WAR OF THE ROSES I've seen on film, kudos for that. But, Juliet Rylance's Tracy didn't seem very solid of a character. She basically tells hubby Ellison that she doesn't want to know what he's up to writing about grisly, unsolved murders, but then goes ballistic about him not telling her they moved into a ""haunted"" house. In the middle of this film, Tracy is satisfied to perform ""mommy duties,"" and isn't really shown with any hobbies, work, etc. A very 2D portrait of really any female character ever in a horror film.<br/><br/>The found footage was good stuff, and the murders depicted therein were pretty creative for a horror movie--I can't recall seeing a good ole fashioned drowning in a horror picture lately. The lawnmower was also right at home in this grisly horror movie. The pace was fairly good for suspense, if somewhat monotonous in nature. Example:<br/><br/>-goes to sleep<br/><br/>-creeeeeek<br/><br/>-""huh, what's that?"" (I should go investigate) /walks around house sloooooowly with a knife/bat/flashlight.<br/><br/>-finds a box of films or a scorpion or a snake or some kids with mudpaint on their faces that he can't see, because they are later revealed to exist in Bughuul-Land...kinda like Disney Land except not as touristy or happy.<br/><br/>-JUMP SCARE!!! /end suspense<br/><br/>While there were some legitimate scares that didn't feel too cheap, the first one really coming slightly over an hour into the film, anyone who DID NOT assume the missing child was the murderer from the first ""home movie"" was not paying attention!! Hmm...family of 5, 4 hanging from a tree, 1 missing and no trace.../scratches head. Officer Barbrady from South Park would've been very proud of this police work.<br/><br/>So, the climax and end of the film did not pay off for me that well. I was waiting for Oswalt's family to show up in a ""family film"" for about a half hour before it actually happened. Excruciatingly predictable. Not to mention, we have these 10 y/o super human kids who are lifting/dragging/transporting/roping/drugging/murdering their entire families, which seems out of the realm of their physical capabilities. Now, I'd be fine suspending my disbelief if this occult deity somehow gave these kids special powers, but that didn't seem to be the case. That doesn't even account for the plotting and planning. Why again did these otherwise normal kids become homicidal maniacs? From looking at a picture and getting their souls eaten? Oh, that's right...<br/><br/>As you have it, there's a (famous??) non-fiction murder-mystery writer who likes scotch, watching interviews of himself being a tool on Tavis Smiley, and locking himself in his office to watch found footage. But, for a guy who deals with scary ish all of the time, presumably, you'd have to think this Ellison Oswalt guy is just a tad jumpy? I mean this guy wrote Kentucky Blood!! How can anyone be scared after that? OK, so we never found out what it was about...touche.<br/><br/>Raise your hand if this movie would have been better had that deputy cop been the deranged killer, rather than Bughuul--a forgotten, ancient, pagan, Babylonian deity. /raises hand. Oh, yeah, and they could have figured a more creative way than an axe at the end right? No one's ever done axe murderer in a horror film before...<br/><br/>TL;DR: If you like horror flicks that are pretty OK, and kind of interesting, but somewhat scary, then you just might make it a point to put this film on the backburner to watch sometime, maybe. Not as gory as SAW, and sort of in the suspense-psychological tradition of THE SHINING (right down to the wall paintings), with an inanimate object (projector) as the lead role no less; this movie is certain to make you twitch once or twice and let out a good hearty ""meh"" at the end. 5/10."

","""Sinister, is a really good horror film. If you have read reviews stating otherwise, those are people that probably shouldn't be allowed to judge this genre in the first place. I have to start by stating that horror in itself, should be considered FANTASY. The most absurd thing a critic could say about a horror film is that ""the concept is ridiculous"" or anything along those lines. Generally, we are diving deep into someones imagination when we see stories like this. Imagination = no bounds, no limits on where a story can go. Ethan Hawke is Ellison Oswald, a crime writer who has let fame get to his head and is looking for his next big hit, which is about ten years overdue. Add stress. His ego has clouded his better judgement. In the past he has done whatever he can to get as close to the murder scenes as possible, and this time he moves his family into a home where a disturbing murder occurred the year prior. Naturally, he doesn't tell his wife, Tracy (Juliet Rylance), knowing she would never let him make such a terrible decision.""

"mattematask-495-772462","4","2","5","16 December 2012"," What a let-down...
","And once again, the positive ratings here on IMDb tricks me into watching a new over-hyped horror movie that doesn't contribute with anything original or refreshing at all.<br/><br/>It's the typical family moves into house, the house is haunted, horrible stuff happens and the family has to leave-plot, now with Ethan Hawke as the main character. Hawkes performance is really great and convincing, as well as the young cop. <br/><br/>I have to admit that I really enjoyed the movie's build up. It started off not too slow nor too fast and it introduced the movie's plot in a interesting way that made me curious about what's going on. The first appearance you see of the antagonist was really eerie and creepy, and he actually looked demonic and non-human. But sadly as the movie went on, he started looking more and more like an human and I got annoyed at how I only could think of him as Mick Thomson of Slipknot in the end. <br/><br/>Something I found really unnecessary in this movie was the nagging between the wife and the husband. Seriously, they went from caring and loving to yell-the-crap-out-of-each other from scene to scene. I have of course seen that kind of couple in movies before, but this time around, it just felt unrealistic and lazily written.<br/><br/>But what about the horror? Is the movie scary? No, not really. It does have jump scares, several cliché-ridden jumps scares that you know are coming but you twitch anyway because the sudden sound of ""hoogabooga!"" penetrates your ears. So if jump scares is your definition of scary, then yes, you will most likely find this movie very scary.<br/><br/>On a finale note, the ending must be one of the most boring horror twists I've seen in a long time. Something that started off really intriguing became the same disappointing mediocre effort we're already getting forced down our throats today."

","I didn't care much about this film and to be honest i don't know why its getting so much praise because when i saw this film i thought it was very slow and very boring especially at the start and i'm sorry to say this film wasn't that scary, it definitely isn't as scary as everyone is saying it is and yes i will admit that one scene made me jump but thats it! and the problem with this film is it revolves around jump scares the majority of the time and after a while it becomes very lame. I just did not care for the story or for the characters and i personally thought the father in this film was a bit of an Idiot because during the whole film all he ever did was obsess about his stupid book! and it becomes very boring and it made me dislike the guy. I just found the whole situation very stupid because the lead man in the film knows a bunch of murders took place in the house he's moved into and does he tell his wife? No and later in the film when he finds out his house is haunted by a bunch of ghosts he still does nothing and he doesn't tell his wife that either in fact he never tells her anything! instead all he does is obsess over his story! the man didn't even seem to care about his own safety or the safety of his family and that to me is pretty dumb! i mean i could understand if he didn't know the house was haunted because then it would make sense for him to stay there! but he does know and he still does nothing! and he just continues with his stupid investigation, if that was me i'd leave the house and write my book somewhere else! or write a new story, i wouldn't stay in a house with a bunch of ghosts! especially if they had nearly killed me!.The man should have just left the moment he found out about the ghosts, that would have made much more sense. I'm sorry to say that not much happened in this film and there weren't many scares either, basically the whole film is about this family man investigating and finding old videos about murders and then watching them and thats it! thats pretty much all that happens!, we hear a few noises half way through the film and we see a few ghosts and the ghosts looked stupid in my opinion they did not scare me and then finally right at the end of the film thats when he decides to tell his wife about the ghosts and then they leave and i'm thinking to myself its about time!.God that man was so selfish all he thought about was his story and he only leaves with his family at the end but i guess that didn't matter anyway because even when they got to their old house the ghosts had followed them there! and i'm guessing that was supposed to be some sort of twist? well if it was then i thought it was a stupid twist not to mention i saw it coming! i wasn't at all surprised and then we have a typical horror movie ending which i'm sure you can guess what that is a bad ending! which most of these horror films seem to have!."

"caseymoviemania","4","2","5","4 November 2012"," Casey's Movie Mania: SINISTER (2012)
","Seven years ago, Scott Derrickson made his first directing debut in a terrifying horror movie, THE EXORCISM OF EMILY ROSE (2005). That movie was a rare gem, especially the way how he tackled the theme of exorcism so effectively. Now seven years later, he's back with the same horror genre in SINISTER. At the first glance, SINSTER sounds like another winner for Derrickson: a classic, haunted-house spookfest mixed with found-footage horror genre. Unfortunately, this movie is mostly a ho-hum experience that only works in certain portions.<br/><br/>The story involves Ellison Oswalt (Ethan Hawke), a highly-successful true-crime novelist who took the publishing world by storm with ""Kentucky Blood"". But that was ten years ago. Now he's been laying low for so long that he has exhausted most of his earnings and desperately needs another bestselling hit. In hope to begin his writing on his new book, he moves his family to a rural town in Pennsylvania. Unbeknownst by his wife, Tracy (Juliet Rylance) and children, 12-year-old Trevor (Michael Hall D'Addario) and 8-year-old Ashley (Clare Foley), the house they have currently moved in is actually a subject of Ellison's latest work. Apparently it is the same location where a family was murdered and found hang from the tree that still stands in the backyard. Except for the only member who was not found -- the youngest daughter named Stephanie (Victoria Leigh), abducted and long-presumed to be dead.<br/><br/>One day, Ellison stumbles upon a box of Super 8 reels and a projector in the attic. Curious to know what it is, he brings it down to his private office and discovers that each reels are labeled like home movies for the family. When he begins playing each of the reels, he is shocked to discover that the footage contains a different family being first stalked by the Super 8 camera, then ended up being killed. As he tries to piece out the eerie connection together, he slowly discovers that it has something to do with a demonic pagan deity known as Bughuul a.k.a. Mr. Boogie (Nicholas King), who seems to appear in every reels Ellison has been playing all along.<br/><br/>Judging from the premise itself, C. Robert Cargill and Scott Derrickson's screenplay does sounds like creepy enough. Personally, I appreciate what Derrickson has done to replicate the classic horror genre of the yesteryears -- deliberate pacing, build-up tension and such. But the overall execution is so patchy and shopworn to the point that the movie does feels redundant most of the time. Not only that, it seems that Derrickson is often stuck with lots of flashy visual style (you'll know when you see one) that they are more like showy bag of horror tricks than anything else matters. Then there's the payoff, which is sadly a huge disappointment, especially given with all the slow build-up viewers have patiently trying to expect something shocking is going to happen. Instead what we have here is a winking nod to THE SHINING (1980) and THE RING (2002)-like ending. No doubt those two movies are good inspiration here, except that the ending feels like a total cop-out. And lastly, the Bughuul itself is hardly scary at all. For a supposedly demonic deity, Bughuul comes across like a carbon copy of Jigsaw from SAW movies or simply a weirdo wearing a Halloween mask.<br/><br/>Despite all the glaring flaws, there are some minor saving grace here. The cast does their best to make their otherwise stereotypical roles worthwhile. Ethan Hawke gives a very esteemed performance as a overly-ambitious novelist who is about to go way over his head. Making her first major feature, Juliet Rylance is perfectly cast as an estranged wife trying to make sense with her ignorant husband, Ellison, who doesn't realizes his course of action has jeopardized his own family. Lastly, James Ransone brings a welcome comic relief as a young town deputy who adores Ellison's work and wants to help him with his new book.<br/><br/>Technical-wise, SINISTER is adequate enough. Aside from Christopher Young's suspenseful score, the spooky sound effects is particularly well done here, thus making some of the jump scares worthy of a jolting experience."

","After viewing the trailer at the movies and saw the reasonably high score that it hit here I figured it's worth a shot. Well how misled I was! No originality,no character development,no scare factor. All in all I spent a worthless hour and a half in the cinema and left me wonder what this movie actually aimed for...Even the casting seemed pretty weak.I did not find Ethan Hawke suitable for this role.He tries his best to make that character work but hardly succeeds.His wife is probably the low-point.Absolutely no chemistry between them,I couldn't believe for one second they are a married couple.Their kids and their abnormalities are not shown detailed enough to make any impact in the storyline. It should have built up from the promising start-moving to a remote house with a history of violence attached to it,truth hidden from family,box found w disturbing videos in it and uncertain origin etc.-but I felt let down.The ""supposed"" scary scenes seemed to me that they were just put in randomly and therefore they don't deliver at all.. So I'd say to even hardcore horror fans to wait till it's out on DVD. There's just much better movies of this kind around,take your pick but leave this one alone."

","Sinister is exactly what it says on the tin - a freakishly scary supernatural horror which will have your skin crawling. Normally comedy and horror don't mix, I.e. Scre4m, however with the numerous scares and appropriately integrated funny bits, this film doesn't fail to deliver. Arguably scarier and better than paranormal activity 4 as it has an intricate plot and delivers more scares than Freddy and Michael combined! Ethan Hawke successfully portrays a workaholic true crime writer who decides not to tell his family that he's moved them into a house where a family was brutally murdered under peculiar circumstances just so he can write a book about it. The demon Bagul, mentioned in ""Possession"" features in this film and will scare you so much that you won't be able to sleep with the lights off. Shh!"

It is quite creepy and I could believe that Ethan Hawke's character had a good reason for not turning over the snuff films he found over to police immediately. I really liked the lack of supernatural activity until later in the film...it would have been perfect had the ghosts waited until the very end perhaps. In particular the snake under the box scene was very effective. While it finally gave way to horror movie clichés the beginning was truly outstandingly creepy and the whole atmosphere of the movie was disturbing and I left the movie feeling quite unsettled. I didn't feel as though I would see a ghost or monster so much as wonder if my family would live through the night. I looked at my children in a different light (just for a second). With a different more mysterious slant on the supernatural or without it at all this could have been a 10. Ethan Hawke deserves better roles. I also feel the young man who played Trevor has a good future in acting... See this film because, hey its Halloween ...."

","*FULL PLOT REVEALED, MAJOR SPOILERS*When I saw the ""From the producers of Insidious and Paranormal Activity"" in the commercials I knew I had to see this movie. First off, let me say that the music was amazing in this movie. There were also a lot of jump scares, but I feel that some of these scares were ruined for 2 reasons. 1) Commercials: There were some scenes that I saw in the commercials that I identified immediately when they appeared in the movie. 2) Predictable: Almost every jump scare that occurred in this movie was preceded by silence, so you knew that when every thing got quiet there was going to be one. The only jump scare that caught me off guard was the one with the girl that appears right next to the main character, and when that scene happened I literally jumped 20 feet into the air! Regardless, a majority of the jump scares still scared the crap out of me. One of the things that surprised me in this movie was how fast the story started, for instance, the first scene in this movie is the family that had lived there being hung! <br/><br/>The storyline is pretty much this: Family (which consists of a dad, mom, pre-teen son, and younger daughter) moves into new house where murders took place. The dad, who is a true crime writer, discovers a box of old films and a projector in the attic, and each film is marked by a cute, fun name that looks completely innocent at a glance, for example, ""Hanging out"", and ""BBQ"". Dad starts watching family films, and each video starts out with a few scenes of the family having fun and chilling out, but then the video flips over to a scene where the entire family, with the exception of one kid from each family, is murdered. There are five videos in all, which means five different families and five different types of murders. Tears come to dad's eyes after watching each film, but he keeps his calm for the first four films, although he completely loses it after watching the last film, which is a family getting their faces run over by a lawnmower. One thing the dad does notice is that a creepy figure appears in each film, later referred to as the ""Boogie Man"", in addition to some sort of cult symbol also appearing in a few of the films. After the dad watches the films, creepy things start happening, such as appearance of the ""missing kids"" and his pre-teen son having ""night terrors"". The dad gets help from a friendly police officer, and a professor that studies cult symbols and appearances, but in the end it all becomes too much for the dad and the family moves back into their old house. The dad is then contacted by the cult professor and pretty much told that leaving the house and burning the films doesn't help at all, and that the dad and his family are pretty much f*cked. The daughter turns out to be possessed, and soon to be the ""missing child"", and kills the entire family, and in the end, falls into the care of the ""Boogie Man"".<br/><br/>Overall I found the movie very creative and definitely worth seeing. It may not have been as scary as Insidious, in my opinion, but it will still leave you shaking as you walk out of the theater!"

","I usually hate horror films. Not because they are horror films, but because they are usually clichéd, predictable and just plain bad. There hasn't been a decent horror film since Saw and before that, not since the late 80's. I wanted to give this one a go though because Ethan Hawke was in it and also because the plot was actually somewhat good and put a twist on the whole found footage thing. To my surprise the film was better than I thought it would be. It was good and enjoyable. Not an engrossing film and the characters are somewhat two-dimensional, although they do try to make them more. <br/><br/>The film was a bit predictable at times and had a few stupid horror moments, but I liked it. I like the fact that they created Ethan Hawke's character as a writer looking for his next big hit and that's why he stays on. Because to be honest, the second I saw the villain I'd be gone. But this character is determined to seek the answer to the question: who killed the family? There are a few jumpy bits, but it's because of the sound editing more than anything else. It is one of the best modern horrors I've seen. But obviously cannot compete with the old-school."

","For people who have lost faith in the horror genre, especially with the multitude of failed found footage films, this movie will change that. This movie provides an original perspective on the found footage genre. It's about the person who watches the footage (it's not in found footage form). It has a very original plot, original methods for scaring the audience, and a very original antagonist, which is a demon. Plus, it stars Ethan Hawk who is an excellent actor and gives us an amazing performance in this film. The opening scene is disturbing enough, with found footage showing a family being hung from a tree in their backyard. Ethan hawk views five disturbing films, the one I just mentioned, a family having their throats slit, a family be drowned in a pool, and a family being incinerated alive in their car. The fifth film is the most disturbing one of all, and I won't ruin it. After watching the films, strange unexplainable things start to occur in Ethan Hawk's home. Watch this filmed! It scared the hell out of me and I'm sure it will do the same to you."

Hawke as Ellison is excellent here as his descent into utter terror is gripping & disturbing, this is a shocker that drips pure terror & dread in it's Atmosphere, mood & look.
The movie looks fantastic & the scares are as frightening as can be for a Horror flick, especially a Horror flick about the supernatural!!!
Another major thing here that stands out is it's ridiculously terrifying soundtrack, the music score is completely engulfing with it's creepy sounds & almost suffocating noises that make everything feel so claustrophobic & full of dread!!!

Nothing in it made sense, although to be fair within 30 minutes I'd pretty much given up trying to find a plot so maybe I missed something obvious through sheer boredom.<br/><br/>The only reason I gave it two stars was because of the following:<br/><br/>1-decent cinematography, without resorting to the hated wobby cam/wet poodle cam (that's a cam attached to a wet, shivering poodle which you then let lose on a film set)<br/><br/>2-the acting was okay, with Hawke turning in an excellent performance as always.

I've worn trousers that were more frightening than this.

","""Sinister"" has been waiting in my watch queue for quite a while now, but for a variety of reasons I always postponed my viewing. On one hand I had really high hopes that the film would be worthwhile, since I read several praising reviews from people, or in magazines and on websites, that I usually find very reliable and with tastes similar to mine. But on the other hand this still is a primarily mainstream film that almost purely exists of clichés and tries a little too desperately to obtain a passable rating R. So what's the final verdict? ""Sinister"" honestly is one of the better and scarier horror films of the last 10 to 15 years, but that's almost solely thanks to the genuinely disturbing and nightmarish super-8 home movies that are integrally shown throughout the movie. As stated already, the plot as well as the setting and the character drawings are derivative and clichéd. Ellison Oswalt is a true-crime writer, but it's been more than a decade since he scored the huge bestseller hit ""Kentucky Blood"". In his exaggeratedly fanatic search to surpass that success, he moves with his family into a house where – unbeknown to his wife and children – a horrible and still unsolved tragedy took place. So far, it's all routine and familiar stuff The local sheriff tries to chase them away, Oswalt's marriage is under a lot of pressure because of his professional stress and drinking problem and his children suffer from nightmares in their new surroundings. But then our writer stumbles upon a box full of uncanny old-fashioned super-8 home videos in the attic and THEY undeniably form the eminence of ""Sinister"". Every self-respecting horror fanatic will consider these videos little masterpieces in their own right: shocking, morbid, raw and yet impossible to turn away from. The videos depict the gruesome murder of the family in whose house Oswalt is now living with his family, but also the sick murders of several other once happy families all over the United States. By the time that Oswalt discovers the truth of who (or what) is behind these vile massacres and who filmed them, the fate of his own family is already sealed Ethan Hawke does a terrific and mature job carrying the film, Scott Derrickson's direction is more than competent and the ice cold & spooky soundtrack contributes a lot to the tension and atmosphere as well. But still, like I assume every horror fan with me, I personally just kept looking forward to the each showing of the next super-8 video and didn't care all that much about the supernatural explanation connecting them. These little short films ought to be released separately on DVD, as far as I'm concerned, as every single one of them is a parental nightmare captured on film. Loving family scenes degenerate into harrowing killings, now that is horror! IF only the script didn't revert to ancient mythologies to provide clarification and IF only the producers would have had the guts to make the murders explicit and brutal instead of suggestive, well than ""Sinister"" would have been the greatest genre hit of the new millennium.

Even the children and minor characters did a good job. Just a couple of minor actors could have been better cast.<br/><br/>3) Cinematography: Cinematography gets a three here. I loved the 8mm film that the antagonist uses. The movie plays very dark on TV but not so dark that you can't see what's going on.

","What a massive difference having an effective looking ghost/ghoul/monster, whatever you want to call it, can make. 'Sinister' has one of, if not the single most, effective ones I've ever seen in a horror film. It is creepy to no end and it will effect you, I guarantee that. Then add in the fact that it's a very finely made film and you have horror at its absolute clinical best.<br/><br/>They used to say in reference to Michael Jordan, ""Greatness is knowing exactly what someone's going to do, and still not being able to stop it."" There were times in 'Sinister' where I knew a scare was coming, I even knew what the scare was going to be, and still it made me jump out of my skin, and I don't jump easily. Horror will always be a touch predictable, there are not enough tricks left in the book for it not to be. So for a film to have the ability to scare you despite you knowing what's coming is a very handy quality to have, and a sign of excellent filmmaking.<br/><br/>Ethan Hawke in the lead role does a fantastic job. I read that his reactions to the super 8 videos were genuine and I love that they did it this way. The whole cast in fact were superb, including the children. Genuinely creative and high-quality horror films are somewhat of a rarity today, so when a good one comes along it is always very much appreciated. There is already a sequel out which I look forward to checking out next. If it is to half the standard that this one was it will be a very fine film."

","Very rarely in today's day in age is there a truly original concept for a movie, especially in the already-crowded field of horror films. Now, this doesn't mean that movie themes we've already seen before, like vampires, witches, poltergeists or whatever, aren't any good, because there are some excellent films that have those themes. However, Sinister deserves major props for originality; combining typical horror film elements like creepy kids, possessions, and mysterious demon-like creatures sets this film apart from and way ahead of a lot of other frightening films.<br/><br/>Before diving into what's so great about Sinister, there are a few things about it that aren't so great. Despite its cohesion with the events of the film, the soundtrack was just plain annoying at times. During a particular scene in the movie and again throughout the end credits, this bongo-type beat was so loud it was uncomfortable. I know one of the main purposes of horror films is to make the audience as uncomfortable as possible, which is part of the reason I love them so much, but this background noise was so loud and out of place compared to the rest of the non-diagetic audio of the movie. Along with the irritating bongo beat, the use of the poorly-timed, oh-so-inconvenient phone call that could have prevented numerous issues from transpiring. I won't go into details, but this part of the movie genuinely irked me, to say the least.<br/><br/>I'm a huge fan of horror. Huge. That being said, I have relatively high standards when it comes to films of this genre and can be very nitpicky about details that would otherwise not matter to most people. So, some bothering bongos and one irritating phone call isn't a lot of negative things to say about a 110-minute movie that's chock-full of chills and thrills.<br/><br/>Sadly, because there are only 24 hours in a day and I should probably designate some of them to grabbing a shower, I'm going to limit myself to giving Sinister my two main praises: the non-diegetic audio (surprisingly) throughout the movie and all the mysterious, spine- tingling, psychotic and breathtakingly ""sinister"" elements all wrapped up in a terrifying package that is ""Bughuul,"" the film's main antagonist.<br/><br/>In short, I thought every chilling moment throughout Sinister was beautifully matched with an equally-chilling audio background to accompany it. Despite my above-mentioned distaste for the bongos used in some parts of this movie, they are actually one of my favorite things about Sinister. If they were at a reasonable volume and didn't distract me from the events occurring, that is. They add to the film's originality, in my opinion. I could be anywhere and hear that insane bongo score, like being in the middle of watching the Super Bowl in my living room in February, months after viewing the movie, and immediately connect it to Sinister.<br/><br/>Writer C. Robert Cargill has truly created something so unique and brilliant yet so frightening with Bughuul. It can be difficult for a writer to keep a character in a horror film shrouded in mystery and intriguing to the audience at the same time without revealing too much about them. Because Bughuul is never clearly identified as dead or a ghost, it can be left up to the viewer to decide on their own what they think he is. By the way Cargill includes home movies that are dated all the way back to the '60s, he beautifully sets up the possibility for a sequel (which was released on August 21, 2015), and the idea that Bughuul and the heinous acts of the children he ""seduces"" into performing could go on forever without ceasing, which is the most sinister part of the entire feature."

Right away we have a viewer placing himself on the scene of horror.

Each one of them culminates with murder of course, the grisly stuff we've come to see, throats slashed etc. But more pertinently about the kind of horror they give rise to. Each one is a little more elaborately staged, making us grope in the dark of a house in search of horror we know is coming. Each one contains a hidden reflection of the boogeyman on the scene. Each one is filmed by an unseen presence. Nothing at all is explained of them but taken together they suggest malevolence that spills from them.<br/><br/>The other placement simply has weird things happening around the house at night, the usual apparitions, noises from the attic, that before long we come to understand as supernatural in origin. It's all as contrived as it sounds on that end and seems to come from a lesser film. Nothing is intricately sketched in this set of images, no hidden reflections. Everything is explained about them in due time.<br/><br/>And you'll see what I mean by looking at the stories that evolve from each set of images.<br/><br/>One gives rise to a frightening reality; someone in an eerie mask has been out there for a long time committing atrocity to some inscrutable purpose, a devious mind who has hid in sleepy suburbias like this and might be out there now, watching. The story emanates from what the images conceal (with a little help from a policeman).<br/><br/>The other story is formulaic fantasy foisted on us by an ""occult expert"", simply delivered by a talking head to a camera; nonsense about a Babylonian deity that actually lives in images and comes out to literally harness souls. Here we have ""devious"" scares and then a full story comes up to explain them.<br/><br/>In both cases we end up in theory with much the same thing; evil that defies sense, hides in and inhabits images and spills out from them to haunt the place. But what a world of difference between them. Don't listen to me; what part did you find eerie?"

","Okay so this is my first time writing a review for any movie. But this movie just forced me to write one for it. I was searching for a good horror movie as I am a big fan of horror genre. So i just could n't ignore the hype about this movie and people saying that its a masterpiece and best horror movie of the decade and Blah Blah.. Let me tell you do not believe any of this nonsense its just an ordinary movie with extremely predictable story and the ending was the worst part of it. During the whole movie me and my friends were like okay now something interesting would be coming and duh nothing interesting ever happened. Those eight home movies they were awful and disgusting and lead to a predictable end but we were hoping that may be they will explain everything at the end but no explanation is given as to why that boy was having nightmares and what the hell was that ""baghlol"" or whatever his name was. so the movie was plain boring and extremely predictable. If you want to watch a good horror movie then watch The conjuring or Mirror part 1 don't waste your time on this shitty movie."

","Sinister (2012): Dir: Scott Derrickson / Cast: Ethan Hawke, Juliet Rylance, Michael Hall D'Addario, Clare Foley, Vincent D'Onofrio: Sinister is exactly the word to describe this morbid trash. It is yet another hellish horror film where evil conquers just so that we can be promised a miserable sequel that will further rips us off. It stars Ethan Hawke as a struggling writer who moves his family into a house without informing them that the topic of his new book is the series of murders that occurred that resulted in missing children. When he discovers a box of old films in the attic he learns that these are the crimes. After a worthy premise the film becomes a series of noises and a villain that appears with a life of his own in photographs. This character looks like a cross between Jigsaw of the Saw franchise, and Ronald McDonald. Unfortunately viewers will not likely get fries with this. Scott Derrickson previously directed the remake of The Day the Earth Stood Still as well as the mediocre Exorcism of Emily Rose. Ethan Hawke holds his own as the paranoid writer starving for fame and neglecting his family. Juliet Rylance has the limited role of wife. Then we have the kids, the son having night terrors, and the daughter painting and ultimately being a pain in the ass. Vincent D'Onofrio has an uncredited role as a professor. Perhaps he was too embarrassed to have his name associated with it. Who can blame him. There is a scene where Hawke burns the old films in the backyard. How apparent would it be if he added this film to the box of reels. That would be a much better ending than what we are left with. Score: 3 ½ / 10"

Sure, everything can always be better. If you cannot suspend your disbelief to watch a horror movie, though... why are you even watching it? Especially a supernatural one.

"Aaron1375","7","1","2","10 November 2014"," Sinister turned out to be a pretty good horror film
","This film is like Lords of Salem, in that I have been wanting to see it for a while and finally got the chance one night. Unlike Lords of Salem, this one was pretty good. It was not spectacular or anything and like a lot of horror films it lacks certain things and certain things are done in such a way to prevent it from being super good, but it was still an enjoyable enough horror film. It made me wonder where it was going, the acting pretty good and it had some nice creepy imagery. With that it also had plot points that went nowhere and an ending that while not completely disappointing still left me feel it was lacking and not satisfactory. Of course, compare it to most recent horror films it was greatlike Lords of Salem for instance. Sorry, but I had seen that one recently at the time of me writing this review and it just stunk on ice. Granted, it is better than all those numerous PG-13 rated flicks that populate the cinemas these days and those once a year lazy flicks that essentially have extremely small budgets and repeat the same things over and over again.<br/><br/>The story has a true crime novelist wishing to write about a heinous crime where a family was hung and the little girl of the family is now missing. The author makes his new home the very home where this terrible crime took place. The sheriff does not like the idea of him writing about this particular crime and his wife is iffy about the circumstances as well. Of course, had the author told his wife that they had just moved into the very house where this crime took place she probably would have been way more iffy! Well, the man starts trying to connect the dots and get inside the crime, he is aided by a mysterious box full of movies that are apparently of the victims. They seem to be nothing more 'sinister' than home movies of first depicting the family during happy times, but as they progress the author sees that there is a darkness within them as soon the film shows the family being murdered. This shakes up the author, but due to his seemingly wanting to be famous once again he presses on rather than inform the authorities about his grisly find (he wrote a best seller, but has fallen on a bit of a cold streak). He soon looks deeper and finds a strange figure present during all the murders and this figure seems to be living within the film itself.<br/><br/>So yes, one of the things that made this film good was the interesting concept. It was spooky seeing author (played by Ethan Hawke) watch the films and they did a good job making them spooky. At the same time, the film did rely a bit on clichés. In the film, the son seems to be suffering night terrors and this seemed to really go nowhere. Perhaps they were trying to surprise us when the ending came along, but certain facts were not revealed till nearly the end and thus making the son's night terrors just seem to be an almost pointless plot point. I also thought the one occultist should have been in the film more and I wish they would have let him respond to the author's query at the end.<br/><br/>So, overall, I did enjoy the film, just a few too many flaws here and there and a few loose ends that could have used tying up. I do believe that a sequel to this one is being made; however, seeing as how the first on is now a couple of years old at least it is not going to be like Paranormal Activity or The Conjuring. Sure, Annabelle is not a direct sequel, but it is a sort of sequel that uses one aspect of that film that everyone loved and they stretched it to a full length film that took like a week to make. So here is hoping that if they do make another film they explain a bit more, but not too much. That is what happened to Phantasm, they made a film where they explained nothing and then just tried to explain it too much. I also do not wish to see the same film repeatedthey need to do some things differently. So, overall a pretty good horror film, but it contains a couple of the flaws that plague so many horror films that prevent it from being great."

","This movie is exactly what the title says - Sinister. I really enjoy these types of horror/mystery/suspense movies and while I get drawn into a lot of them and love the tension & feeling I get, very few of them can easily creep me out. This one did, though, and I LOVED it.<br/><br/>The movie has just got something about it that brings out the disturbed feeling in you. Whether it's the way it was filmed; the way the victims died; the glimpses you see of ""Mr Boogie"" (name sounds cheesy but upon watching the movie you'll find that it's not); or just the general subject matter....I don't know and maybe it's a whole combination of the above (and more) that does it. All I do know is that it is creepy as hell.<br/><br/>The first scene of the movie grips you right from the off and it doesn't really ease up either. There are some slower moments, but because you get drawn in you don't really feel it getting slow. It moves along at a good pace overall, and it keeps you watching while building up the suspense factor, and there are a good amount of genuinely creepy moments as well.<br/><br/>I thoroughly recommended watching this movie at night, with the lights off and the sound up. A definite MUST watch."

","""Sinister"" represents a good, sincere effort in the overworked genre known as ""found footage"". It's generally well acted, with the cast managing to create some watchable enough characters. Co-writer / director Scott Derrickson (""Deliver Us from Evil"", ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"") is able to craft some suspense, atmosphere, and overall creepiness. That said, the whole thing reeks of familiarity, too much of it for it to work that well, and in the end it's pretty damn predictable.<br/><br/>Ethan Hawke stars as Ellison Oswalt, a struggling true crime author desperate to recapture the success of an earlier book. So he makes the standard Dumb Horror Movie Choice of moving with his wife and kids into a forbidding setting: the home of a family who was hung in their backyard. When he ventures into the attic, he finds scores of Super 8 film left behind - all of it featuring murder and much of it featuring an ominous presence.<br/><br/>Hawke does alright, and has some good moments with Juliet Rylance as the long suffering wife Tracy, Fred Dalton Thompson as the disapproving sheriff, and James Ransone as the young deputy who's eager to be of service to the author, in hopes of receiving a shout out in Ellisons' current book. Clare Foley and Michael Hall D'Addario are decent as the kids, who each pick up on the bad vibes in the house and express their feelings in similar ways. Vincent D'Onofrio has a key uncredited role as an exposition provider.<br/><br/>Basically, this is very slickly made, with top notch cinematography by Chris Norr, and it is somewhat spooky at times, but it doesn't bring that much to the table, and is prone to too many jump scares and ""stinger"" moments in the music score.<br/><br/>Six out of 10."

","It's funny, I agree with the negative reviews on here but... somehow still managed to kind of enjoy this film.<br/><br/>Main highlight for me was finally hearing BoC - Boards Of Canada - used to major effect in a Hollywood feature film. (OOOH LOOKY THAT! If you lowercase 'hollywood' IMDb uppercases it for you! Just as I don't want it to!)<br/><br/>I always take Ethan Hawke as the Tom Cruise who can actually act (most of the time). It's like if you took Tom, removed the scientology, removed the ego, toned down his John Malkovich screaming-and-throwing-things-is-acting habits, and added some more true acting ability, you'd get Hawke. I thought he was adequate in this, though he could have been given more to do.<br/><br/>Main problem I had was with the story itself: as soon as I realised it was supernatural ooga-booga nonsense, not a serial killer, the fun kinda went out with the rules.<br/><br/>Another problem was when Ethan was doing his endless wander-around-in-the-dark-with-an-old-unreliable-torch bits, why did the rest of the family not wake up? He was knocking stuff over left right and centre, with the bogey man doing the same. Heavy sleepers, indeed.<br/><br/>The final - literally- problem I had was with the ending, it went on and on (and on... and on) and could have been removed entirely and the film would have been punchier.<br/><br/>Still - an OK film I thought.

","With generic 'horrors' that rely purely on jump scares apparently being churned out year after year, I was becoming increasingly pessimistic about the future of the genre. I saw Sinister not long ago, however, and I have to say I was surprised at how good it was by comparison. <br/><br/>Better than Insidious and The Conjuring, Sinister succeeds at being genuinely scary. Yes it has a few jump scares that feel a little contrived, but it's a film that effectively unnerves you and stays in your head for at least a few days after (I can't think of many modern horrors that I could say the same of). The murder clips were genuinely disturbing, made all the more so by the great uses of cinematography and music. It's properly harrowing stuff that will keep your attention right until the end.<br/><br/>And about the end- not going to spoil anything, but I was as surprised as I was shocked by it. It has its flaws, but as a whole, Sinister succeeds where most of the horrors of the last 10 years have failed. For any fans of the genre, I'd definitely recommend a viewing."

","""Sinister"" follows a recent trend of low budget horror films to make it to theatres and do quite well. Usually done in the found footage format, a sort of evolution of the Blair Witch style. This film is director Scott Derrickson's return to form from the disastrous crap fest ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"". His breakout film ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" was one of the sleeper hits of 2005. What's different about ""Sinister"" is that it owes a lot to its clever premise and script by first timer C. Robert Cargil.<br/><br/>Ethan Hawke anchors this film as true crime writer Ellison Oswalt, who has been trying to recapture the success of his first book ""Kentucky Blood"". His wife and two young children move to a new town for each new book and now they have arrived in a small Pennsylvania town where an entire family was hanged, except for one of the kids that went missing. Ellison also fails to mention to his family that they are moving into the actual murder house. The local authorities are not to happy with their new residents as Ellison usually paints the local police as inept bumbling idiots who botch investigations.<br/><br/>Instead of the standard creepy basement, we get the standard creepy attic where Ellison finds an old box of super 8 movies and a projector. The movies all have innocuous titles like Family BBQ, Pool Party, Lawn Work, Hanging Out and so on. Desperate for leads and information on the family he views the old home movies, only to find that they end up being snuff films. Sort of reminiscent of the Nic Cage Film 8 MM. Ellison is now determined to find out who made these films. Although he does think about reporting these to the police, he is blinded by the thought of what this could do for his fledgling career. Ellison is a very self absorbed and fame obsessed man. He tasted celebrity once and will stop at nothing to feel it again, even it means putting his family at risk. His son already suffers from night terrors which are becoming worse while at the new house.<br/><br/>After repeated viewings of the films he starts to notice a shadowy figure in each of them. He finds out that this is a pagan deity called Bughuul, the eater of children, who lives inside the images. The films are a gateway to his world that Ellison has now opened, putting his kids in grave danger. Ghosts and demons living in images is something you see in a lot of Japanese and Asian horror like The Ring, Shutter, and many others. ""Sinister"" does a good job mixing and matching several common horror elements into a cleverly made film. It's not something that's going to reinvent the genre, but it's always nice to see new twists in the same old thing. The way the story and the whole mythology is structured they could and probably will make several sequels."

Shortly after moving in, the author discovers a box of 8mm home movies in the attic. The home movies show various families being murdered. <br/><br/>The subject matter of this movie is quite grisly. The story is interesting, but the tempo is a bit too slow and the attempts at suspense fall short. At times the lighting is so dark it obscures the subject. I understand this is an attempt to create a mood, but if you can't see anything it defeats the purpose. However, the acting is good, very believable. In general the movie would be good to watch on a Saturday night with nothing else to do. Some might find it a bit scary to watch."

","Yes, I'm an Ethan Hawke fan so of course I'm going to love his movies, but I have to say, this was one creepy film. The only thing annoying about it is that a good bit of the film is in one room; where Ellison writes his true crime novels. It's not an extraordinary storyline, but I found the reels of film Ellison discovers in the attic disturbing. I'm glad they didn't get too graphic with the murder scenes although the family hanging in the tree was horrifying. Of course we do see how each of the crimes were committed which is creepy enough in itself. I thought it was interesting that whenever he was making noise in the house, like when he fell from the attic, no one else in the house heard any of the noise. In any case, we never find out who the creepy guy is, but we do know the children are possessed and are sadly killing their own families. There wasn't much of a storyline on the rest of the roles as they were only a fraction of what the story is about anyway; at least until the end. I liked it, but cannot watch it alone! The music is just as eerie as the film itself."

","Don't get me wrong, I gave it a nine, because its brilliant, but with all the goings on at night-time, why did the noise never wake his wife???? other than that glitch, be prepared for a great shocking twisting movie that surpasses the great as far<br/><br/>as suspense and gut wrenching horror,<br/><br/>the snuff movies contain enough horror for another set of six movies. Ethan Hawke is brilliant in this I think his first move into horror, a brilliant twist at the end, you don't see it coming.<br/><br/>Lighting in the Oswalt home, where most of the action takes place, is appropriately subdued and rife with interplays of light and shadow. Hawke is often seen in silhouette, masking dark corners hiding secrets, literally. Terrifying night scenes beg the question, ""Why are you going up into the attic?"" Christopher Young's original score blends perfectly with needle-drop songs from some of the filmmakers' favorite indie bands. In a typical production, where third party songs will be inserted, the actors work to a temp track -- music that plays in the background until the company can obtain licensing for the tunes they want for the finished product, usually unknown (although often hoped for) during filming, that are then added to the soundtrack in post- production. With ""Sinister,"" Derrickson and his team were able to purchase the rights prior to shooting so the cast members performed to a playback of the songs that would actually be used in the final cut. It does make a difference, especially when seasoned professionals like Hawke are ""acting"" in sync with the same music the audience hears in those scenes. It creates a symbiotic ambiance that links viewer to actor."

Another type that we watch actually is scary...and I don't mean the Freddie-type films with blood spattering all over, but rather the type of film that really is a bit disturbing. This is one of those films. So, it gets high marks for that.<br/><br/>I'm also going to give it high marks for the performance of its lead actor -- Ethan Hawke. It was 14 years ago I first really noticed Hawke, when I was sincerely impressed with his performance in ""Snow Falling On Cedars"". But then, over 14 years I was not impressed again. Not that he was a bad actor...just run of the mill. But here he carries the entire film, and does so brilliantly.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is fine...nothing great, nothing poor. They do their jobs.<br/><br/>So what is it that's disturbing here? Something you don't see in a lot of horror or murder movies -- the slaughter of children. In this case, it's far more graphic than what you would see in most horror/murder films. Almost a snuff film, although that is overstating it a bit. But no doubt that a nebulous line was crossed in this film.<br/><br/>For horror fans, recommended. But be clear, in this film good does not triumph over evil."

","Its really refreshing when a movie comes along that raises the bar. I've seen two horror movies this year that were really something special in the horror genre - The Conjuring and Sinister.<br/><br/>In Sinister, the sets, lighting and most especially music and sound effects really hits the viewer on all levels - conscious and unconscious. The background music is chaotic and rhythmic and you may not even notice how upset you're becoming with that in the background, nor the lighting and sets which are dark, dingy and depressing. I admit I had no idea what was coming and the first climax came when the main character (Ethan Hawke) has a skype conversation with a professor who explains about the demon. The second climax, if you will, comes near the end when the Sheriff's deputy calls him and explains why he shouldn't have moved. <br/><br/>I do feel that movies like this, which deal with the archetypal battle of Good vs. Evil, tend to be more frightetning and thought-provoking than a basic monster or slasher movie.<br/><br/>Another element of Sinister is how the children became the agents of evil. Hardly a day goes by that we don't hear something about children doing something horrible to someone. What is happening to our society? I'm not saying I agree with the premise of this movie, but it certainly give you something to think about."

","So yes, makeup could have been better, but who cares? It had me feeling that tightness in my chest and my heart picking up the pace that I love about horror movies. It has some really good scares in it, and I loved the ending! So many people found in lacking and I'm not sure why. The films were freaky and during some scenes of the movie I was holding my breath. And, OK, yes, there were a few scares that you could see coming thanks to the trailers, but overall it left me feeling unsettled and at times uncomfortable. A horror film isn't doing its job if you are relaxed and enjoying. The suspense lasted throughout the whole film. <br/><br/>For the hardcore horror fans whom need everything to be plausible and realistic- not the film for you. But if you enjoy creepy films and tense scenes, you may enjoy this movie. Overall I thought it was good. Not the best horror movie ever, but good for what it claims to be."

","I have to say, this film was more than I bargained for. Of course, seeing it in theaters gives a completely different feel than watching it at home. But if you did get to see this in theaters...OH MY GOD. There's something about the sounds in this film that get me more than anything else. The music gives you the freaking creeps! Because of the sound thing though, nothing can replicate what it is like to watch this with big surround sound speakers. So, try to do that. Otherwise,you will miss a lot of what the movie is trying to get across.<br/><br/>All in all, I would definitely recommend seeing this movie. Anyone that is horror fan will appreciate what they did with this one. My only other note is that everyone I know has a different opinion on the ending. Some people loved it, some hated it.

"josh-halse","10","1","2","9 June 2013"," Sinister: One of the creepiest movies I have ever seen.
","I went to watch Sinister with high expectations and left shivering as I expected. I went in a group of 6 but Sinister didn't have the effect on them that it had on myself. I am a 16 year old student who studies visual effects so I gained a lot of inspiration from this film. I really did not expect it to be so good and after watching it am totally impressed. The sound effects are amazing and the special effects were exceptional. The opening of the film is particularly disturbing— the movie begins with the family hanging murder, which sets an unsettling tone for the rest of the film. The highlight however is the use of the 8mm films. Sinister is in love with the idea of film, rather than the common DVD or VHS tapes we are treated to super 8 films instead which I have never seen in any other film before. Another way 'Sinister' differs from most modern horror movies is that it doesn't show the audience all of the super 8 films at once but drills into their heads that every time they hear the projector start up something unusual and disturbing is going to happen which sustains the tension throughout. <br/><br/>As the film progresses and our character Ellison discovers more and more unusual home movies the plot gradually unravels, twisting your mind as you try to fit together the pieces if the available possible endings. The most memorable parts of the movie was the eerie atmosphere and silence during most of the home movie analysis, which made people viewing this in the cinema feel uneasy at the time as they felt like they were in the shoes of Ellison solving this gruesome case. The tension was always rising as there were many silent moments with strange goings on with Ellison unaware of how serious the case actually was. It felt like watching an old fashioned horror movie with the long periods of silence combined with modern day special effect scares. <br/><br/>I would totally recommend Sinister to any lover of horror and give it a 9/10, it would have been a 10 but the scene where Ellison and his wife were arguing caused giggles in the cinema due to it being a reasonably poor scene."
"brando647","7","1","2","2 June 2013"," Sinister Vibes Save This Film from Bouts of Boredom
","I took a chance with SINISTER because the trailers reminded me a bit of INSIDIOUS (one of the better recent horror movies) and because the initial reviews were curiously positive. Ethan Hawke is a talented actor and the trailer was pretty creepy. I would love to say it met my expectations and, at first, I suppose it did. My first viewing left me a nice creepy vibe but future viewings left me feeling a little bored. Not just because I knew the story and the final plot ""twist"". I knew that before I ever sat down to watch the movie because of some careless reviewers. After some thought, I realized it was because SINISTER is pretty drawn out. Writer/director Scott Derrickson and cinematographer Chris Norr have mastered creating a (no pun intended) sinister atmosphere but the movie suffers from a weak script. The movie is about a true crime novelist, Ellison Oswalt (Hawke), who moves his family into the home of a family that was brutally murdered under mysterious circumstances. Ellison uses the environment of the home to help inspire his writing while keeping his wife and kids oblivious to the fate of the home's previous tenants. He believes he's hit the mother-load when he discovers a box of old 8mm home movies in the attic. To Ellison's surprise, these are more than your average home video footagethey're a series of snuff films detailing the gruesome murders of five families. Ellison becomes obsessed with his study of the films, eager to find a missing clue as to the person behind these acts, and he uncovers a terrifying secretthat was sort of ruined in the trailers anyway.<br/><br/>SINISTER is a fun enough movie the first time you watch it. Even knowing the big reveal at the end, Derrickson and Norr have put together one of the creepiest movies I've seen. Most of the credit really goes to the film's music. Seriously, SINISTER has the eeriest soundtrack: part music, part ambient sound, and totally chillingespecially when paired with near total silence and the click of an 8mm projector. The snuff films are the scariest part of the film. I suppose that should go without saying. Anyway, the snuff films in this movie are done incredibly well. When combined with the minimalist soundtrack, the films (shot in actual 8mm) are haunting. SINISTER jumps right in from the very beginning with one of it's most powerful images: a family of four stand beneath a massive tree with hoods over their faces and nooses around their necks while an unseen force slowly saws away at a mammoth tree branch on the other side. Once that branch is loosed, the counterweight lifts the family off their feet and we watch them kick and struggle for a minute before finally going still. It's incredibly effective and sets the tone of the movie perfectly. The rest of the snuff films are at least as effective and give the movie its most unsettling moments. It's just a shame the rest of the movie doesn't really keep that vibe alive.<br/><br/>The real problem with SINISTER is how it bounces between horror/thriller and mystery. The horror elements, for the most part, do their job well. The mystery elements, not so much. A lot of the film is Ethan Hawke's Ellison as he investigates the snuff films and slowly pieces together the bigger picture. Unfortunately for SINISTER, that's where the movie starts to lose momentum. After we've seen the snuff films a few times, the effect diminishes a bit and all we're left with is Ellison playing detective. This mostly consists of Ellison being awoken in the middle of the night, experiencing something creepy, then waking up the next morning and watching the movies again with a bottle of booze and a notepad. Once you go through the cycle a few times, you just want the movie to move on to the next bit of scares. The whole supernatural element (effectively ruined in the trailers with Vincent D'Onofrio giving us the exposition via Skype) arrives in full about halfway through the movie and comes to a climax well past the point where I stopped caring. The ending is a little too predictable and might be determined well in advance by some viewers, but it plays out pretty nicely in the final 5 to 10 minutes of the movie. Ethan Hawke is great despite the little he has to work with, but his supporting cast drop the ball. Juliet Rylance is a little tooemotive. I know it's weird to claim an actress too emotive, seeing as how creating emotion is the name of their game. She doesn't quite ham it up but she comes on a little too strong. Either too happy or too angry, never quite right for the scene. Her performances reminds me of something from TV family drama; it doesn't fit well here. Ellison's kids don't get much to do, so that leaves our only other supporting cast as James Ransone as Deputy So-n-So. The deputy avoids the usual pitfall as a cop in a horror film by maintaining a good head on his shoulders. He actually becomes Ellison's voice of reason once the weirdness goes to the good author's head. Still, the deputy is mostly around to advance the story with new discoveries and guide us to the final haunting sequence.<br/><br/>SINISTER is not a 'great' movie but it does deserve the chance to work its creepiness on you. When you watch this movie, in an effort to get the most from the experience, watch it in a dim room with minimal background noise. Let it establish it's atmosphere and draw you in. It's good for some chills and maybe a jump scare or two. Outside of that, SINISTER might find itself doomed to be forgotten as a movie in the dreaded category of ""not bad, but not great."""
"tomwood5","7","1","2","29 May 2013"," One of the more decent horrors out there.
","""Sinister"" movie review<br/><br/>As a fan of the horror genre, as soon as I saw the trailer for the movie 'Sinister', I decided I would have to see it. I'd never heard of any of the stars, but the premise of the film seemed interesting, and the trailer had a very creepy vibe to it.<br/><br/>I went to see this movie at the cinema (on Halloween and on Screen 13, coincidence?). It was the first, and at the moment, only horror I've seen on the big screen, so I was excited to see if this enhanced the experience.<br/><br/>In short, this movie terrified me. Some scenes left me hiding behind my jacket with my fingers in my ears crying like a toddler. I felt genuine fear and dread watching this movie, as I spent the entirety of it expecting something terrifying to happen. Something I despise about most horrors (modern ones especially) is when a jump-scare is built up to (or the classic build up, but nothing happens) but there were moments in this film where jump-scares were so spontaneous they had me literally leaping from my seat. Obviously, it does have some built up jump-scares, but even these are effective. One that will always stick with my mind is the scene where we see a lawnmower going along some grass, accompanied by silence. Obviously something is about to happen any time now. It goes on for so long, the tension makes it truly terrifying, and when the scare hits, prepare for a full on brown pants moment. <br/><br/>The story of the movie is interesting to say the least. I won't go into too much detail in case you haven't seen it, so here's a brief overview. The film opens with a shot of a family hanging (morbid I know) but this is a great example of foreshadowing. Crime writer Ellison into home of the family we saw hanging with his wife and their two children, one of which begins experiencing bizarre night terrors upon moving into the home. Only Ellison knows about what happened at the home, he intends to use the murders as the basis for his new book, and hopes that his research will turn up the fate of the family's fifth member, a little girl who disappeared following the murders. He finds a box in the attic containing a projector and several pieces of footage that are each labelled as innocent home movies. As he watches the films, he discovers that they shows families being murdered in various ways including the hanging that opened the movie. He notices a strange figure in one of the films, and then realises the figure is in all of the films, watching over the murders along with a strange symbol. With the films he discovers childish drawings depicting the murders, along with crude sketches of the demonic figure, identified as ""Mr Boogie"". He consults a local police officer and discovers that the murders shown in the films took place at different times, beginning in the 1960s, and in different cities across the country. He also learns that the families were all drugged before being killed; and that a child from each family went missing following every murder. <br/><br/>I'll leave it there and let you watch the rest of the film for yourself. The story is consistently interesting throughout and genuinely captivating. The ending becomes fairly predictable as you get further into the film, and yes, they've done the classic horror movie cliché and left it open for a sequel (Which I can only imagine will be exactly the same as this movie if it's ever made). The acting is also good, with Ethan Hawke providing a very believable role, even when it's just him and a projector on screen, we really feel as vulnerable as his character is.<br/><br/>Now for the criticisms. The worst part of this movie is the trailer, it reveals way, way too much about the plot, and shows off lots of the jump-scares (I can only assume the majority of the people in the cinema had not seen the trailer, because people were still terrified by these moments.) So if you haven't seen the trailer and intend to watch this movie, do not watch the trailer. My only other complaint would be the venue. As I said, this is the first horror film I saw at the cinema, and after buying the movie on DVD, I wasn't scared at all watching it a second time. I've narrowed it down to 2 possibilities of why this happened. 1. Because I've seen it all before. 2. Because I was constantly waiting for a really loud noise and something to flash in front of the giant screen. Thinking back, the reason I jumped so much at some scares may have just been because of how loud the cinema was. See for yourself I guess.<br/><br/>My rating for ""Sinister"": 7/10"
"pyrocitor","7","1","2","28 May 2013"," Blood Drawings, Creepy Kids, and Ghoul-Masks Softly Lit by an iPhone
","Few horror films are bold enough to not only root their cause of frights in an obsession with screens – both the computer and cinema variety – but also incriminate audiences (by proxy) as predominantly responsible for horrific happenings through their inability to tear their gaze away. Such audacious self-reflexivity should be difficult to execute without the film unraveling, but director Scott Derrickson instead alludes to recent genre trends erring towards 'found footage, documentary style realism', without skimping on the old-school supernatural scares and jumps. As such, Sinister cannily blends 'old and new', a post-Paranormal Activity thriller unafraid to exploit the genre's roots in melodrama and excess. <br/><br/>Indeed, Derrickson, like his first foray into horror, 2005's The Exorcism of Emily Rose, proves adept at marinating in genre conventions while subtly riffing on them to tweak expectations just enough. The premise (a 'true crime' writer who moves his family into the house of the recent murder victims whose case he is documenting discovers a box of 'home movies' that suggest a chain of interconnected serial family murders) is just outlandish enough to be original, yet just grounded enough to fly. <br/><br/>Equally, Sinister flourishes atmospherically, with its scores of documented murders adopting a surreal, grotesque beauty, rendered operatic through Christopher Young's exquisitely cacophonous musical score. Anchored through Ethan Hawke's magnetic, jittery performance and a couple of refreshing plot twists where (gasp!) characters actually result to horrific happenings sensibly, Derrickson nonetheless quashes such baited hope through an unflinching fatalism. Sinister's horror is fast, furious and relentless, and sure to spook hardened horror-vets and casual thrill-seekers alike.<br/><br/>-7/10"

","I have been watching horror for about 12 years now, or more depending on when you are reading this review, and I have loved the Genre. I have been watching films from the good old Horror 70's and not much has beaten those; Friday the 13th, A Nightmare on Elm Street, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and Halloween are just a few of those. When I watched these, I fell in love with the genre, to me nobody could out do Wes Craven or George A. Romero, even with the crappy remakes, b-movies, and terrible ""blockbuster"" movies of nowadays, I almost lost hope on Horrors altogether... until I saw this movie. Ya sure, it wasn't original, but what is nowadays? I was speculative before I saw this movie, but when I found myself sucked into the movie so much that I was not realizing what was going on around me, I knew this movie was on to something... mind you, I am not much of a Occult or Paranormal person, (I actually thought that Paranormal Activity movies are overdone and boring, as the ""found footage"" movies are coming out almost once to twice a year) however this movie does it in such a way that it ""seems"" interesting, a lot of work was obviously put into this movie... it could have been a lot more, but for what they did do, I will applaud them. They have given me something to look forward to in the Horror franchise, now all we need is the ""Next Robert Englund"" and I will be happy again."
"hereiwaz","8","1","2","6 May 2013"," I almost peed myself.
","Sinister is what every horror loving fans look for. It has the blood, it has the music, and it has the story. Oh the story is so twisted even the foreshadowing of the end does not prepare you for the shocking ending. For once a horror movie does not have a happy ending. The music is what sends chills crawling everywhere for it is the backbone of Sinister and even though silence is usually what frightens an audience, the music has more of an impact than the darkness. It is nice to see Ethan Hawke in movies again for this role was made for him. Visually, this movie is stunning not leaving room for the imagination to fill in the gaps, but the most impressive part is the movies within the movie that shows the killings of the families only because they kept film as part of their historical moment. This movie is a must see because all in all, I almost peed myself."

You were led to believe that it was going to be about a serial killer, with a lot of snuff movie stuff. Which it is. But there is also a strong supernatural element, which makes the movie enjoyable also for classical ghost-story addicts like me! Also, for once I was wrong about guessing the ending. You CANNOT guess the ending! The only thing I think was a little bad, was that the missing children were not better explained. Were they also dead - that is: were they ghosts..? In that case, I think they looked and sounded too much like living children. Ghosts should be a little transparent, more ethereal - and their feet should not make sounds when they run! On the other hand, if they were alive but had been stunned in their growth and development, I would have liked an explanation to THAT."

"MrGKB","7","1","2","18 April 2013"," Perhaps mistitled, but still effective...
","...this third full-length outing from writer/director Scott ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" Derrickson squeezes great value out of its relatively minuscule budget (and was certainly a success at the box office, earning more than fifteen times its production costs!), thanks to a relatively tight script, solid ensemble acting (including fine work by Ethan ""Tape"" Hawke---ignore the naysayers), effective sound design and equally effective cinematography by Chris ""Trumbo"" Norr. I won't belabor the plot---others have done that already---but if you let yourself go with the flow, the ride is satisfyingly creepy. ""Sinister"" isn't really a scare-fest; there aren't a whole lot of ""Boo!"" moments, but it accomplishes its goal of unsettling you, and leaves you with a distinct interest in a sequel, if only to find out if anyone can deal with ""Mr. Boogie.""<br/><br/>I caught this for free, thanks to my public library, but I think if I'd sprung for it in the theater, I wouldn't have felt ripped off. Despite his having been saddled with the disappointing remake of ""The Day The Earth Stood Still,"" Derrickson bounced back nicely with this one, and I look forward to his future endeavors, particularly his remake of ""Poltergeist"" and an adaptation of George Alec Effinger's cyberpunk novel, ""When Gravity Fails.""<br/><br/>This Derrickson guy is a director to keep an eye on; I predict great things for him in the future."

In this day and age, the ""horror"" genre has been belittled to porn, blood and gore. The genre lost it's interesting stories a long time ago as, sadly, those three things are apparently enough to sustain the life of a ""horror"" movie. So, the fact that this movie almost lacks those and actually has a story to it is a MAJOR plus. I say ""almost"" due to a few scenes that involve a knife and lawn mower though not much is shown.<br/><br/>I'm not sure if Bagul (spelling is probably wrong), was/is truly a Pagan deity but I found myself drawn to the idea. The ""Eater of Children"" who can travel through images of himself and corrupt the minds of children who, in turn, kill their family. Or, that's what the movie depicts. So, good work writers/director(s) if he was of your creation!<br/><br/>The characters of this movie were believable and the actors portrayed them almost perfectly. I found myself irritated with the sheriff in his two appearances and I felt bad for the Deputy at certain points. <br/><br/>I can say that I didn't see the ending coming. I knew that moving homes hadn't ended the story. Anyone with half a brain or slight knowledge of horror films could guess that. I don't want to spoil too much, so I'll leave at I expected a happy ending.<br/><br/>Now, as I said above, I couldn't bring myself to give this movie a full ten because it wasn't exactly...scary. I jumped at a few moments and I was holding my breath for a few seconds but I wasn't shaking behind a pillow. Then again, it is pretty hard to find a movie like that anymore."
"theflukeman93","8","1","2","11 April 2013"," Very effective
","I hardly ever get frightened from a horror movie, I can only recall being frightened by the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and this is mostly due to the atmosphere of the movie and the sound effects, coupled with all the screaming. While watching Sinister this same feeling came back to me. What I found really terrifying were mostly the sound effects, especially the ones playing during the ""snuff"" scenes. Another terrifying thing were the snuff scenes themselves, no they aren't gory or anything, but the fact that they seem as something that is plausible in the real world, that could really exist, also that they are silent, so when we see someone talking we cannot hear them.<br/><br/>Now, this was effective for most of the movie, until the story went to being a supernatural horror. I feel as though the movie would be even scarier without the supernatural element, because it would feel real, as if it could happen in the real world. And by removing the supernatural elements I don't mean removing the ""Mr. Boogie"" from the movie, actually the shots in the videos where he appears only made the movie creepier. However, they could have made him some serial killer's accomplice, or a member of some cult during initiation, anything that could be real. Or they could have left it at the main character having a nervous breakdown.<br/><br/>All in all, I enjoyed the movie because it made me feel something I hardly ever feel while watching horror movies, but I think that the story would be more effective without the supernatural elements."

","The creators of Paranormal Activity and Insidious stick to what they do best with Sinister. People live in a house, then comes something unexpected, and then the nightmare begins. The plot is ideal for not making the scares seem forced (a true-crime novelist has to investigate everything). These filmmakers have understood what frightens people. It's what we don't understand, feeling that we lose control, and being stuck with it. So we see disturbing Super 8-clips, ghosts of children, and an extremely creepy demon. The family is stuck with this house. And it's all accompanied by chilling, eerie soundtracks. Psychologically, it's devastating. Because it's that simple. So goes for the demon of the movie, named Bughuul (or Mr. Boogie). The whole concept of a demon actually lives in pictures and can (and will) get the ones who see him is a much needed original twist in supernatural horror. As for the thought of what he does, which is eating children, he becomes more and more frightening throughout the film. He is only shown on several brief occasions in the films, then one night, Ellison spots him in his backyard. The result? The feeling of something terribly wrong is completely out of hand, and Mr. Boogie becomes REALLY horrifying. The film has got humor as well, though. Officer ""So-and-so"" is the comical relief, and I laughed hard at Ellison's feeble attempts to defend himself when his wife found out that they had moved into a crime scene. But all in all, the constant building tension, the sneaking, claustrophobic feeling and the gruesome ending makes this a highly efficient horror movie. Sinister indeed."
"christine_yau","7","1","2","17 March 2013"," . If you're not afraid, don't mind a little predictability, and love the random hair-raising loud noises, then go see ""Sinister"" and find out for yourself!
","It's been a while since I've seen a horror movie in the theater, so with a friend we decided to give ""Sinister"" a go. The plot intrigued me enough to want to see this film; a writer who stumbles upon 'snuff' footage and unfortunately decides to do a little hands-on research. As the title suggests, the footage is rather 'sinister', and I would not suggest anyone who happens to reside in a big creepy house in the middle of nowhere to view this film!<br/><br/>Without exposing too much, ""Sinister"" begins with a struggling writer – Ellison Oswalt (Ethan Hawke) – who once wrote a top true-crime novel, but has continuously failed to produce anything of any worth since. I actually missed the first 15 minutes of this film, but somehow he discovers several 8mm snuff footages' that dates from the 1960s to the 1980s; all of differing horrific and mysterious transgressions. Oswalt embarks on the quest to dig up more information and clues to the unsolved crimes from the footage, and sadly moves his whole family into the house where one of the original crime footage was exhibited. Of course without mentioning the important details, being these crimes were LITERALLY committed in the very same home. Weird stuff starts happening, more open-ended truths uncovered, and yadda yadda; basically it becomes another one of THOSE types of horror flicks.<br/><br/>8mm footage might immediately make you want to relate to the film ""8mm"" with Nicholas Cage; in case you haven't seen it, I would highly recommend it! This movie is NOTHING like it however, only perhaps the idea of the snuff and the eerie constant re-visitation of the footage.<br/><br/>In terms of acting, other than Ethan Hawke (who was pretty well cast here – managing to project his paranoia and obsessions onto the audience), there weren't many major players. ""Sinister"" isn't a gory slasher flick, but more so of suspense and well-timed peculiar noises which put the audience on edge. A lot of the scenes were shot inside the house during the darkest hours, which attributed to its strongest points.<br/><br/>""Sinister"" was a good watch, but not a great watch – I really wish it had a better ending. Great suspense horror films however, are hard to come by, and are almost all pretty predictable. If you're not afraid, don't mind a little predictability, and love the random hair-raising loud noises, then go see ""Sinister"" and find out for yourself!"

","Not terrible, not great. Creepy/scary enough I guess, but really if the guy just turned the lights on once in a while, it would have lost 99% of the suspense factor. The ending wasn't so much the conclusion of the plot as it was just where the film ended, seemingly haphazardly. It was like they just ran out of film so figured ""Eh, lets just call it a day here"". Still, not as bad as so many of the films these days that call themselves ""horror films"" and really aren't. <br/><br/>Id recommend watching with all lights off, curtains drawn and with a minimum of distractions for the full effect. If you liked this, Id also recommend VHS. That was similar in some ways but far weirder/creepier/more creative."

Usually in these types of movies a family will move into a ""haunted house"" where a spirit or two lurks, but this movie is so layered with details and thrills that is keeps us viewers glued to the television set for nearly 2 hours.<br/><br/>Ethan Hawke, being the good actor that he is, does a good job here, just as Kevin Bacon did in Stir of Echoes. As he plunges deeper and deeper into the dark history of what he has found in his attic, he starts questioning more and more whether unveiling facts for his new book is even worth putting his family at risk.<br/><br/>Sinister is a quite good thriller which had all the elements to keep me interested for nearly 2 hours, not to mention make me jump and squirm a few times, which is no easy task.<br/><br/>***/****"

","First of all, I just want to say that I'm glad I didn't know who directed this before I saw it (directed by the man behind the remake of The Day The Earth Stood Still), and if I had known, I wouldn't have even given it a look.<br/><br/>However, I'm glad that I did see it, because this movie has a number of great aspects that have more or less disappeared in recent years regarding horror films. The best thing about the movie is the brilliant musical score. It is creepy, and captures the tone of the movie very well, exactly what a great horror film score should do (see Halloween or A Nightmare on Elm Street). I also liked the villain of the film. I won't say who (or what) he is, but he's somebody everybody has been scared of at some point in their childhood, and the film does a good job building him up.<br/><br/>Ethan Hawke does well in the main role, and James Ransone and Vincent D'Onofrio are good in their supporting roles. There are a few silly scenes, like when the ghost children are running around the house, and the last shot of the movie is very predictable, but overall the film does a very good job with its creepy atmosphere, good characters, and excellent score."

It makes the movie very slow and boring in my opinion, even though it is an OK story line. I have a headache from trying to see. I think the actors were good, but it really wasn't scary to me because I was so annoyed trying to see it that I couldn't concentrate.

","Ethan Hawke is a great actor. He is one of - but just one - the best things in this film. He is believable and draws you in as a writer whose world is slowly unraveling - is what he's seeing and discovering a result of his drinking or does he need to drink because of what he's seeing and discovering? He is marvelous when he's trying to manipulate his wife and attempting to quell his terror in a conversation with a deputy. The plot moves at a great pace and is engaging the whole time. The music score and sound effects are eerily creepy and enhance the suspense. Truly some disturbing images of violence. Directing - great angles and scary. Some people did not like the ending - I did. Smart and scary and went with the theme of the film. Unpredictable as well. :-) A fantastic combination of horror, slasher, and supernatural.

","I was definitely a fan of the movie for a while, it definitely had some unique twists that I didn't see coming, but as for the ending that was just sad. They wasted all of the potential of the movie with such a cheesy and unoriginal ending. It definitely started to resemble Children of the Corn, which I just couldn't get scared by. Little kids in cheap make-up shushing the camera... just was way too corny. I was also really disappointed that they just threw in some half-baked scares that were detrimental to the overall scare factor of the movie, which really came from the unknown. Bagul was a nice touch but they made it preposterous at the end when he carried her into the movie. Overall another horror movie with a bad ending, can't say I'm surprised, because that seems to be the trend these days."

You can see all of the best bits in the trailer, so if you're wanting to watch the movie I wouldn't watch the trailer before hand. Mr boogie was a cross between the joker and the doll from the Saw franchise, and with a name like that I was expecting some disco flares and an Afro!

"fast_eddyv3","7","1","2","11 February 2013"," You'll Appreciate the Effort but not the Outcome
","This movie could have been an eight or nine out of ten if not for some overlooked mistakes. It was enjoyable right up until the very end. But the weak finale really disappointed me after a great build up of anticipation. I found the jump scares to be satisfying. The music a little out of place in some spots but overall not detrimental to the experience. Like most people I thought the found footage was done well. There's something about the 60's-80's time period that makes for creepy atmosphere. The clothes? The lack of technology? The innocence? <br/><br/>I do agree having both children affected by the pagan demon was foolish and unnecessary. Almost as if the writers were forced to switch killers halfway through because it was too obvious. Yet, knowing what was going to happen didn't bother me. But the poor execution of the conclusion did, however. The lost or taken children ghosts and the pagan Deity shown in person were not sinister in the slightest and ruined the experience. Yes, he was frightening in the pictures/8mm film but not in the makeup up close.<br/><br/>When Ethan found extended cuts I licked my chops. My expectations were set too high, though. The kids shushing us was silly and overdone. Seeing too much in a horror is never a good idea. But the girl hanging from her dead dad's leg was creative.<br/><br/>The interaction between Ethan and his daughter after he's drugged was uninspiring. Her talking normally at all felt wrong. She's possessed. Either no voice or something completely different would have been smarter. If there were alternate versions of the last ten minutes or so. They should have explored those, instead.<br/><br/>Everything else was fantastic. The other reviewers are being overly critical or way too nice. I would have recommended this. A sequel even. It's worth a look to see for yourself if you scare easily.<br/><br/>I gave it a 6.5 or 7 because it was entertaining but ultimately a let down. I believe the average should be a 5.5-7.5 range."

","A few months back, I saw ""The Apparition"" and ""The Possession"" - two would-be horror films that were so utterly boring and generic that they blur together to the point that I now struggle to remember what detail belonged to which film. I suspect in three months time I will be saying the same thing about ""Sinister"". As mainstream US horror movies go, Scott Derrickson first gained attention with the success of ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" and then the widely disliked remake of ""The Day the Earth Stood Still.""<br/><br/>The film follows true-crime writer Ellison Oswalt (Ethan Hawke) as he discovers a box of home movies that puts his family in eminent danger. Ellison Oswalt moves himself and his family into a house where a horrific crime took place earlier, but his family doesn't know. He is trying to find out more about the crime so he can write a new book about it to help his flailing career. He uses some ""snuff"" film that he finds which show the crimes to help in his research, but he soon finds more than he bargained for. Some credit is due for an intriguing twist to the central concept, blending what's happening in the reels with the actual action on-screen. This is what provides the film's best jump-out-of-your-seat moments, with Hawke giving a solid lead performance as the ""cardigan-clad"" Ellison.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the film become less effective and more predictable as the film's narrative meanders on of just more of the same. Day turns to night, the projector film rolls, creepy noises are coming from the attic, and it's time to go investigate. The best spook house flicks offer credible reasons why the family stay in such a terrifying environment. Yet ""Sinister"" struggles to convince us. It takes sometime to determine if you are watching a film about the mundane activities of a killer, or a haunted house story as the film seems to wander aimlessly. Hawke is subjected to horrific experiences yet unbelievably brushes them off. He keeps it all from his family which is some feat given the loud racket every night which his wife happily sleeps through. Nothing groundbreaking here, but as a late night watch on Netflix, you'll get what you are expecting."

Find out :) <br/><br/>With an old footage showing four people being lifted off the ground by their neck, with a rope tied to a falling branch, leaving them limp in mid air, the movie starts off brilliantly and sets the tone for the rest of the story to fall into place.

","Although it doesn't bring new stuff that you haven't seen around, sinister will give you goosebumps, for sure. The acting is by far superior than most of the movies from the horror genre. There is a lot of horror tricks that will keep you at the edge of the seats. Music and sound effects are eerie and they will rise atmosphere. <br/><br/>The story is seen: Family goes to a house where family murder happened recently. Yes, you recognize it: the Amityville horror stuff. But soon the father (Ethan Hawke) realizes it is not the house it is the ancient evil spirit. The problem is that he stubbornly doesn't want to see obvious, and he can not believe in it,before it is too late. So, yeah, the story is borrowed and seen, but the ending doesn't give a 1% chance for main actors to survive. It is unsettling, just goes without the fight. Evil prevails. Period. Most people ,including myself, don't like this kind of ending. <br/><br/>So all in all, the movie is above average horror movie, gory with good sounds and tricks, but it will not leave you satisfied. It gives no chance to main characters, and I see no point in that."
"LloydBayer","7","1","2","10 January 2013"," Terrifying from the get go!
","From my personal experience, there are essentially two types of true horror movies – best described as 'sinkers' and 'jumpers'. SINISTER manages a rare feat in that it will cruelly weigh you down into your seat with its undeniably chilling atmosphere. And just when you think you can't sink any further, the film will throw you some well-timed moments of sheer fright that will launch you off your seat.<br/><br/>Any fan of the genre will find the beginning clichéd with all the trappings of some classic horror films of yesteryears. Ellison Oswalt (Ethan Hawke) is a non-fiction crime writer whose previous book has brought him fame and fortune by detailing some gruesome homicides in a manner that questions the competence of law enforcement personnel. As expected, Ellison does not receive a warm welcome when he moves into a new house with his wife and two children. The local Sheriff (Fred Thompson) warns the Oswalts that the house has seen better years, but only Ellison knows that their new home was the scene of a multiple homicide, where the previous family was hanged to death. Looking for inspiration on his new book, Ellison finds it in a box of super-8 film footage; five in all. Each film depicts the hideous deaths of different families in various locations, including the family that was killed in the house before the Oswalts moved in. As Ellison becomes obsessed with the footage, his family slips into utter chaos with terrifying consequences; but this is where the clichés end. Through close scrutiny, Ellison discovers a link threading all five murders – an unsettling demonic presence that seems to be reaching out from within the films.<br/><br/>Right from the title, the director works towards delivering his promise. This is a scary film in part or whole, depending on how experienced you are as a horror fan. Believe me, there is something for everyone; even the hardest of skeptics. Aiding the plot is strong character build-up by Hawke, and as the film progresses, Juliet Rylance as Ellison's wife Tracy. Hawke is convincing as a crime-writer with an appetite for fame. There is an amusing confrontation when Tracy discovers Ellison's true motive behind moving into the new house. This is Rylance's moment, delivering with the fierceness of a protective mother who has only just realised the dangerous consequences of her husband's stupidity, even though they are sitting on a goldmine of a story.<br/><br/>It is no secret that the horror genre is dying. This is because film makers, and screen writers for that matter, are always searching for the next best way to scare an unsuspecting audience – 'Unsuspecting' being the key word. Inspired by paralysing horror films like THE RING and INSIDIOUS, director Scott Derrickson uses C. Robert Cargill's screenplay to maximum knee-jerking effect. Yes, there are moments that allow the viewer to cower in preparation for a frightening jolt, but Derrickson's nuance is in those unnerving moments that seem to reach out to the viewer directly, while oblivious to the on-screen character. Watch out for these scenes where things happen off-centre but extremely intentional in spooking you. Blink and you might miss it, but Derrickson has thrown in quite a few of these scenes just in case you blink a lot!<br/><br/>Despite its faults towards the end, there is a lot to like about SINISTER. Even if you end up watching this movie by peeping through your fingers, there is mystery, murder and mayhem and it all leads to a morbid twist you won't see coming. Oh, and one more thing, the soundtrack is dreadful, in a ghastly way. It's as if Derrickson recorded the wailing of tormented souls and played it back just for kicks. You have been warned."
"SatanReturns","5","1","2","29 December 2012"," Promising Concept
","I will not lie, I did thoroughly enjoy the first 1/2 or 3/4 of this movie, I found the murder-tapes to be 'genuine' looking and the ambient soundtrack within the movie was fantastic; a real difference from most cheesy horror movies that put loud songs on to let you know you're meant to be scared.<br/><br/>Yes it was a very predictable movie, as soon as I heard one kid was missing and I seen the first tape I knew right away that it was the children murdering their families, but the tapes themselves and even the 'environment' (if you will) of the movie was not predictable. You may have been able to know when the scares were coming but at the same time you had a feeling deep down, a feeling which only came around when Ethan Hawke played those tapes.<br/><br/>Now the reason I called this summary ""Promising Concept"" was because I firmly believe the whole idea of Baghul was great, it was evil and demonic. However as soon as the 'ghost kids' came in moving around I just thought it all went downhill from there. <br/><br/>I just didn't like that revelation, it's as if the writer or director got lazy toward the end and wanted to finish it as quickly as possible instead of expanding and explaining a very advanced concept.<br/><br/>I would recommend this to somebody who is ready to love and hate the movie. I sure hope somebody follows up on something like this creating a real solid blockbuster."
"estebangonzalez10","6","1","2","8 December 2012"," The ending almost ruined it for me
","¨Get the kids. Pack the car. We have to leave here now.¨<br/><br/>It's a known fact that before watching a horror movie you have to leave your brain out of the room. I usually hate horror movies because I find them predictable and dumb. Most of the leading characters end up making really bad decisions. These rules aren't the exception with Sinister. The film has several plot holes (like how the police officers can't make the connections between the murders in the first place) and it also has the leading character making one terrible decision after another. Despite all that, and a terrible ending, I still found some sort of enjoyment in this film. It did manage to scare me in a couple of scenes and for that I must give credit to a horror movie. It's really hard to find a scary movie nowadays, and Sinister did manage to make me jump on a few occasions. By no means am I saying that this is a great film, but I will admit that it was enjoyable for at least more than half of the film. Sinister was directed by Scott Derrickson who also directed The Exorcism of Emily Rose. This film also deals with supernatural powers, but is much more violent and spooky. There are several scenes of homemade video murders that will give you some goose bumps. The screenplay was written by Derrickson and C. Robert Cargill. Like in most films of this genre the easy part is to find some spooky scenes, the difficult part is to find a decent ending to put everything together. Sinister fails to find a satisfying ending, had it found one it could have been one of the best horror films in a long time. I can't recommend Sinister unless you are a huge fan of the genre; otherwise it is yet another forgettable picture.<br/><br/>The movie opens with what looks to be a homemade video of a family being hung over a tree in their backyard. Then we are introduced to the main character: Ellison Oswalt (Ethan Hawke) who is moving in to the house where the horrific murders took place. Oswalt is a true-crime novelist who became famous for his first book on a crime he investigated in Kentucky. His next books didn't have the same success so he and his family are going through some rough times economically. The reason Ellison wants to move to this house is because he thinks he can write another powerful novel on the horrific murders that took place in the house. Moving to that same house would be a great start for his investigation. His wife, Tracy (Juliet Ryliance) and their two children Ashley (Clare Foley) and Trevor (Michael Hall D'Addario) do not know about the terrible murders that took place in that same house, and Ellison tries to keep it that way. Once they arrive at the house, Ellison finds a box containing a projector and several super 8 films of footage from horrific murders (including the murder in his own house which we saw at the beginning of the movie). This all seems as great material for his next book as he begins to investigate each one of these murders and finds some connections between them, but the more he digs deeper into the case the more strange things begin to get around the house. The question he has to ask himself is whether he and his family can remain safe there. <br/><br/>The film has some interesting premises but it does get very predictable half way through the movie. Sometimes I just felt like hitting Ellison for all the terrible decision he was making (so typical in a horror film. Ethan Hawke gives a pretty solid lead performance, despite all the mistakes he makes you still end up caring for him. He is really the only character that is developed in the story. The rest of the cast you could really care less for, especially the wife who I didn't like one bit. I thought Ryliance's performance wasn't really up to par with Hawke's. The chemistry between them was nonexistent. The kid actors were good, but they really weren't developed at all. The entire film was focused around Hawke and his investigation of the murders. There were a few other supporting characters, but none really worth a mention. Sinister has a terrible ending and that really cost the film in my opinion because it did have some potential. It isn't a great horror film, but it probably is the best one of the year.<br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com"
"Superunknovvn","7","1","2","25 November 2012"," Positively creepy and thrilling, but not without some major flaws
","It's quite frustrating being a horror fan. Most of us have grown up watching scary movies, loving the feeling of getting so scared you couldn't fall asleep at night. However, as a kid it is much easier getting scared. The older you get the more you get accostumed with the genre and its thrills. You start to see patterns and the formula wears thin before too long. Horror movies that start off as promising as ""Sinister"" in its first hour are extremely seldom and when they do come along, our fan hearts jump.<br/><br/>It's not that Scott Derrickson's movie is all that original. Actually, it's more or less another found footage movie with some creepy kids thrown in (more about that later), but the director sets it up so well that you find yourself creeped out and intrigued right from the start. Ethan Hawke's character is given enough depth that we can somehow understand why he would not be taking his family and running away as far as possible within the first five minutes. Derrickson moves things along at exactly the right pace and stays away from cheap scares . The dark house that serves as a setting for most of the film adds a lot of tension, and you never feel safe watching the screen and the movie stays relentlessly tense throughout. Like most good horror movies (see also The Omen, The Ring, In The Mouth Of Madness) there's a mystery that builds up to the horror, like Derrikson had his hand on some kind of scary lever and he kept turning it up with sadistic delight.<br/><br/>This very good start makes it all the more frustrating when Derrickson makes some painful choices in the last third. You know you'e in trouble when creepy kids starts to appear. Too many people making horror movies seem to think that kids are really creepy per se (probably due in part to some of those movies mentioned above). The fact is, they're not, not in this movie at least. These kids are so obviously excited child actors with bad make-up on. As soon as the movie starts to rely on them, you know you can relax. It's like that moment in ""Say Anything"" when John Cusack and whatshername are tense on a plane until they see the seat belt sign go off and they know there's nothing to fear anymore. We know from this moment that things aren't going to get any scarier and it really kills the movies momentum. It doesn't help that Derrickson throws in some of those scares where a big creepy face pops up directly in front of the camera. We've all been victim to this on the internet when we're tricked into concentrating on an image on the screen and all of a sudden some terrible monster face appears and almost makes you soil your pants. That's okay for the internet, in a movie it's awfully uncreative and lame, and although you probably will jump at those scenes, the feeling will be followed by immediate annoyance and disappointment.<br/><br/>The second, any maybe even bigger problem, is that the movie doesn't have a third act. As in one of Derrickson's previous movies, ""The Exorcism Of Emily Rose"", the director doesn't seem to know how to end the movie. Just like in ""Emily Rose"" the final act cannot live up to the great set up that preceded it. The movie ends really quickly without a huge revelation or a big fight or anything. It just ends and leaves you feeling disappointment.<br/><br/>All that doesn't make ""Sinister"" a failure. In fact, this is probably the best horror movie I've seen all year (not that there's been a lot of competition). It's just a pity that Derrickson couldn't hold up the high quality throughout the movie's entire running time, because then this could have been one of the rare examples of a horror film that satisfies even hard boiled fans of the genre. ""Sinister"" does make one look forward to Derrickson's next problem, although one can only hope that the man will soon learn how to give his films proper endings.<br/><br/>(Piece of advice: If you can, avoid the trailers before watching ""Sinister"", as most of the highlights are given away. It surely ruined a lot of fun for me, when I watched the movie and was already familiar with the best bits.)"
"thatheo","8","1","2","25 November 2012"," great, despite some flaws
","Sinister is one of those movies that received a lot of negative reviews for predictable reasons. It is too reliant on horror tropes and jump- scares, tries to give the movie gravitas by using a snuff-movie aesthetic, and the characters are not particularly well-rounded or likable. And while these criticisms hold up, as a fan of horror movies I can still say I enjoyed the hell out of this movie. Warts and all, Sinister does something that less and less movies do these days: it scared the crap out of me. And beyond that, it did it without resorting to the usual fare of extreme violence and cynicism, while still maintaining an extremely brutal and grisly atmosphere.<br/><br/>Our movie starts out with crime writer Ellisson Oswalt, moving into a new home to investigate the gruesome murder of a family for his upcoming novel. He is down on his luck, his latest successful work being written ten years ago, and is aching for new success. It is in this house where he finds a collection of Super-8 tapes that shows families being together at various family outings, cut to a bleak, poorly lit scene were these families are murdered in the most horrific ways possible. Against his better judgement, he decides not to go to the police with these tapes, but uses them as material to write a new non-fiction novel that he hopes will bring him new success. As the story progresses, he discovers that he might have gotten more than that he bargained for, and that something inexplicable is going on, and horror fans can pretty much fill in the blanks from there.<br/><br/>Ellisson, played by Ethan Hawke, is very similar to the self-centered alcoholic writer for whom his work absorbs him to the point he neglects his family. Mildly arrogant, obsessive and easily possessed by both internal and external demons, he is not the most original character. But Ethan Hawke plays him well, and he is well-rounded enough to carry the story. His character traits, tropes or not, hooked me in and made the character empathetic enough to be interested into what happens during the rest of the story. The rest of the characters are very much set- dressing. Not particularly deep or involving and very much used as devices for the movie. Ethan Hawke pretty much has to carry the movie, and despite the fact his character is old as dirt, he is pretty compelling.<br/><br/>But even though the characters are clichéd, and the story is slightly predictable, this movie is still pretty great. The main reason is simply because its scary. The videos that Ellisson discovers are genuinely disturbing, the build-up of the story is methodical and grisly, slowly working towards great jump-scares (and I love jump-scares. Screw you if you dislike cheap shocks, if it makes me jump out of my seat I like it), all with a phenomenal atmosphere to boot. Props also for the music and sound effects in this movie. The entire house creaks and fumbles, the atonal, dreary music gives the movie a strong sense of dread and despair, and the ominous music that plays as Ellisson watches the Super- 8 video tapes made me feel genuinely queasy.<br/><br/>Sinister to me falls into a list of movies that had mixed reviews because of the obvious flaws of the story and characters, but I can still heartily recommend because they genuinely scared me and were rich with atmosphere. Films like The Strangers, The Woman in Black and Rec, for me, also fall under that category. Scary, atmospheric movies that deserve way more praise than they received, and deserve some recognition. I can heartily recommend this movie if you like a good scare.<br/><br/>This review can also be found at my blog: http://dutchentertainmentjunkie.blogspot.nl/2012/11/sinister_25.html"
"bushtony","5","1","2","25 November 2012"," Deliver us from dumbness
","Critics praised and the public turned-out so see it in decent numbers. I found it dull, toothless and disappointing. I could stop there. However, IMDb requires more word-burning, so...<br/><br/>True crime book writer Ellison Oswalt (Ethan Hawke) is on the skids, desperate to come up with another hit bestseller. To this end, he moves his wife, son and daughter to a house in the sticks where the previous occupants were found hanged from a tree out back and the youngest daughter remains missing. He omits to inform his wife and kids of this information, because it's the sort of stuff that might influence a decision to buy or live in a particular property, and sets out on his merry investigative way.<br/><br/>Hawke finds a collection of old 8mm films in the loft. They depict a series of murders of several families. Hawke reasons that someone must have filmed these events (smart guy) but who could it have been? The killer, perhaps? This is the point where it all falls apart and reason and logic evaporate into the ether never to be seen or heard from again.<br/><br/>Right, yes, I know that horror/fantasy flicks arbitrarily require that logical behaviour need not fully apply and characters are fully within their rights to behave in ways that in the real world would give others some reasonable pause for thought. It's a given. This has to remain, though, to some acceptable degree, within logically explainable parameters in order to suspend disbelief and not alienate the audience and consequently erode their patience and goodwill.<br/><br/>Now, I can accept the supernatural rationale for events, because in SINISTER's particular cinematic world it is the chosen raison d'être of the movie. And that's fine. But anyone who finds a box full of snuff films on their property and watches them and after doing so decides that it would be a really great idea not to turn them over to the police has just drop-kicked the living daylights out of all conception of what constitutes reasonable behaviour – even for a character in a horror flick.<br/><br/>OK, it can be argued Hawke's character is under pressure, he's desperate to write a hit true crime expose, but come on! He's unearthed new evidence the police don't have. Handing it over makes him a part of the case, puts him square in the picture, part of the focus rather than an outsider and does not jeopardise in any way his chances of completing the book he wants to write. Rather, it increases them by getting the rather hostile fuzz onside. So concealing this new found evidence is intended to achieve what, exactly? Answers on a postcard.<br/><br/>My sympathy for the character dissolved and with it much of my interest in the way things would then play out. An evil pagan entity is influencing kids to snuff their families and then join him in some spiritual parallel-dimension netherworld once the deed is done. This provides lots of scenes of ghostly looking zombie kids popping up at random moments and putting their fingers to their lips and going ""Shhhhh!"" in an attempt to elicit some jump-scares, but really that's all it amounts to. Predictably, as is the way with most modern horror movies these days, everyone is doomed, evil triumphs, that's how it concludes.<br/><br/>It's a shame, because the lead-in up to the point where Hawke makes his decision about the films is cleverly constructed and quite creepy and unnerving. There is a sense of genuine style, flair and atmosphere-building bubbling away. Then it vaporises. <br/><br/>Recently, INSIDIOUS suffered from much the same problem – an excellent build-up blown to bits by a crass second half of irrationality and a humdrum cookie-cutter denouement. It would be nice if more often than not these movies were fashioned to deliver on their earlier promise. Dare to be different."
"patryk-czekaj","7","1","2","24 November 2012"," Surprisingly, Sinister is a very satisfying horror flick
","Without giving away too much of the plot, I would like to explain why Sinister might arguably be by far one of the most rewarding, and – at the same time – one of the least offensive horrors of the last year. While the fact that the main idea presented in the film is sometimes poorly executed is rather discouraging, I think that Sinister is able to overcome many of its mistakes in a rather successful fashion.<br/><br/>First of all, I loved the way Sinister played with the concept of snuff films, making them one of the scariest and most shocking images seen during the whole movie. They add the much- needed amateurishness, so to say, and show a darker, more sinister side of the picture. Without any hesitation, they attack the audience with obscure recordings of some grizzly murders that look as disturbing and realistic as they definitely should.<br/><br/>Second of all, the amazingly climatic music sets the mood just right for a series of abrupt and unexpected scares. These aren't just some silly cookie cutters, no. It's rather a blend of electronic tunes and an a bunch of raw sounds combined together to intensify the unnerving and sombre ambiance every time something frightening and otherworldly is about to happen.<br/><br/>Third of all, Sinister doesn't overuse the idea of paranormal activity and nightmarish creatures as such. The weird 'thing' (too stay spoiler-free) is there, yes, but it appears only a few times in order to implement the possibility of an some mystic, occultist presence. Even though the film ultimately fails to get rid of most of its clichés, they're not really that striking and don't downgrade the overall experience. Surprisingly, even the ending is as satisfying as it is abrupt and forced.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the characters are rather superficial and one-dimensional, and their inability to think clearly is the film's biggest problem. For a (un) trained eye the plot might seem predictable after some time, but the people involved in the whole horrendous intrigue can't comprehended that they're in grave danger, and that moving to a house, where people got killed before isn't always a reasonable thing (the blame is on Ethan Hawke's characters, just to be clear).<br/><br/>Sinister gives a reasonable amount of scares (although sometimes I wished for some more), and does so through a successful use of violent snuffs, grim and claustrophobic cinematography, and aforementioned distressing soundtrack. Even though Sinister doesn't really bring anything new to the table, it's both an eerie and enjoyable addition to the horror genre."
"thesar-2","5","1","2","23 November 2012"," Sillister
","I made a mistake when I first read the description on IMDb, which has now since changed – ha, of Sinister. The first two words read: ""Found footage"" and even though I read the remaining synopsis, my desire to see this was lost on found footage.<br/><br/>It also didn't help that I'm not into ghost/haunted house stories, or that I was turned off by the tagline: ""From the Producer of 'Paranormal Activity' and 'Insidious'"" – both, of which, I didn't care for or the over-advertisements, as I saw the film's poster all over the place, including the bus stop in front of my office for months.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, with the encouragement of some of my on-line friends and the fact that I do like Ethan Hawke, I gave this a shot and I didn't fully regret it.<br/><br/>Sure, the movie does provide (some) found footage – so much so, it's the main definition of the term, and it's a ghost story, but the grand substance involves a deep story of a family man's Red Dragon'ish investigation into several ""unrelated"" family murders and I always dig that kind of mystery plot.<br/><br/>Hawke does hold up, as much as he can, though I feel maybe someone else would've been more active in emotions from all the events. I can't say the same about the cardboard cutouts the actor/actresses who played his family. They weren't just incidental to the actions of head-of-family and writer, Ellison (Hawke,) but their performances were all-but boring and staged.<br/><br/>What was interesting was his peering into the murders of several families and subsequence disappearance of one of the children of said families. He lazily uses a far-out Deputy Dewey clone over an easy internet search and somewhat brings his family to the brink of crazy while uncovering the truth.<br/><br/>As stated, I'm not a ghost story/haunted house fan, but I'll admit to some actual scares and absolute jumps from me – even when I knew what should be coming. That said, most of the ""shocks"" were positively silly, including the laugh-out-loud final frame.<br/><br/>Sinister is a mostly well-made film with good cinematography, score, decent twists and genuine scares. Despite its just-above average runtime, you'll desire more time to uncover the mystery Hawke's character is writing about alongside him. And for that, it's a recommendation."
"cheryl-renee1993","9","1","2","1 November 2012"," Great Movie!
","I see a few bad reviews about this movie, and I have to wonder why. The movie was supposed to tell the story of a family going through some hellish things, just like the Paranormal Activity series of which has the same creators, and The Devil Inside (which, in my opinion was a complete flop.) And it did tell the story of a family, but aside from the previously mentioned titles, this movie was better for several reasons. First and foremost, it's not a cam, first person type thing. Because seriously. If some creepy stuff was going down in my house, my first thought would NOT be ""Oh hey, something is terrorizing my family, better grab the camera."" It'd be ""Get the HECK out of the house!"" So in that aspect, this movie is better. Second, it kinda takes you away from the usual ghost/serial killer type thing. It takes a little bit to get actually interesting, but once the movie actually kicks off, things just get weirder and weirder. All in all, this movie is one of the best I've seen in a while. Definitely worth seeing!"
"christenson-megan11","8","1","2","1 November 2012"," Sinister accounts for real ""scary"" v. big money maker Paranormal 4
","The tail end of Halloween week is here. So if you're tired of dressing up and going to parties, catching a spooky flick might be a good way to end this weekend. So which new box office hit do you go see? Sinister and Paranormal Activity 4 would be good candidates depending on the levels of intensity you can handle.<br/><br/>Though both movies are packed with 'jumpy' scenes and creepy possessed children their modes of scaring are on different scales. <br/><br/>Yet another sequel in the Paranormal Activity franchise was released on October 19. Since the highly successful beginning in 2007 with Paranormal Activity 1, the following three have significantly lost integrity and loyal viewers. After watching the fourth movie, it is hard to believe it would pick up any first timers. <br/><br/>If a loyal Paranormal Activity follower saw this movie, I am convinced he/she could have predicted the outcome of several scenes as I did. Just like the last 3, our anxiety rises when the scene reaches night, and levels back out when it's daytime. Paranormal Activity follower Alan Tam, 23, agrees, ""even though I like Paranormal 4, the series is starting to get played out.""<br/><br/>This movie was full of dead space and lost opportunities to scare. Several times we watched an empty room or stared at a door waiting for something, or someone, to appear. It was disappointing how long this movie lasted compared to how little times I was spooked. And even when there was a jump, it usually was just a loud thud, a gasp from a character, or the meaningless cat that leaped onto a desk. <br/><br/>Along with that, the film's realistic attempts fell short. Of course Alex (the teenage girl determined to stop what is disturbing her home) has parents who don't listen to her fears and who seem to have somewhere to go for a few hours every night. Of course they never call the police for help (then again, what horror movie character does?). And of course they have a laptop for every room that can record every minute of every day. More seriously, if baby Hunter was kidnapped in PA2, how did the family in PA4 adopt him as a toddler named Wyatt?<br/><br/>As much as I would love to give my criticism of the end of the movie, if you've seen the previous three Paranormal Activities I don't think my spoiler would come as a shock. <br/><br/>Devoted Paranormal fans only have to wait another year for Paranormal Activity 5 to release in October 2013. Another devotee Mark LaBellarte, 24, says, ""as each movie came out around Halloween I found myself heading to the movie theater to watch the next installment of the series; but every time I came out of each movie I was disappointed more and more."" <br/><br/>With a much larger budget, a higher rating on Rotten Tomatoes, a tripod, and a Hollywood big name actor, Sinister is a tough competitor in the paranormal category. Sinister entered theaters on October 12.<br/><br/>In this spine-chilling thriller, Ethan Hawk plays a crime writer who struggles to repeat his 15- minutes of fame with another bestseller. He dishonestly moves his wife and two children into a crime scene house where a whole family was murdered by hanging except for a little girl. Hawk, desperate to uncover the whereabouts of her discovers a box in the attic full of video footage of this killer's past work. Determined to attain justice for the families and his own fame and fortune he finds himself in the middle of the demon slaughterer's path. <br/><br/>Though Jason Blum produced both Paranormal Activity 4 and Sinister he wasted no time in getting the audience to the edge of their seats in Sinister. In the opening credits, we watched the four victims squirm helplessly as they hang until suffocation. Right away I knew this movie was going to be disturbing. <br/><br/>Like Paranormal, the scenes in Sinister also got the best of my imagination in unsettling lengthy scenes. The camera slowly lingered toward a mysterious object or suspicious room only to drum a loud noise as a snake or sleepwalking boy appeared. However, sometimes the surprises were really terrifying images of the 'demon' called ""Bagul"" or creepy ghostlike children. <br/><br/>It is accurate how Hawk plays his character so realistically in wanting to get his fame and riches back. He also appears to be a normal guy who gets disturbed by murders and fears what is happening to his life. LaBellarte says, ""The death scenes seemed so real and believable. I felt like I was a detective trying to figure out the story, but it had a super natural twist that I really liked.""<br/><br/>To my surprise, the ending to Sinister was not the classic Hollywood horror ending where the protagonist conquers evil. It definitely is shocking. 21 year-old self proclaimed horror movie enthusiast, Sidney Wilson compared the two movie's endings, ""The ending of Paranormal left me looking around the theater going, 'Wait, was that really it? You're kidding.' and at the end of Sinister I had the chills and was a little afraid to go to sleep"".<br/><br/>So before you decide to go out and throw on the same costume from two nights ago, consider celebrating the last weekend of Halloween with a trip to the theater. Depending if you enjoy being spooked from nervous anticipation or you like being so disturbed that you can't look away, each movie would suffice. Or do what I did and watch both startling flicks in the same day. Their effects have put higher speed in my step when I walk to my car at night, and I dare not look out my window when it is dark."
"btoews","6","1","2","26 October 2012"," Lack of internal logic is a problem
","SINISTER wasn't terrible but certainly was a disappointment as the trailer looked quite promising. IMO the basic problem with the film was the lack of a plausible internal logic. Example: SPOILER ALERT: A true crime novelist (Hawke) moves into a house which was the location for a gruesome mass murder of the previous owners and the subject for his next book (his wife is unaware of and definitely not in favour of this). Anyway, they move into this empty house and Hawke finds in the attic a box of Super 8 home movies detailing not only that mass murder but many others, all shot by the killer. The same guy who left Hawke a box of these films also left about 6 copies of Hawke's biggest selling book in the attic. Hawke does not feel threatened in any way by this,does not think he or his family is in any danger. Imagine if a serial killer had left you this evidence in your house and obviously knows who you are and what you have been up to. Hawke doesn't notify anyone or even think it is a problem in any way-from there things get worse for Hawke but you have already disconnected from the whole thing."
"anasnajmie","8","1","2","26 October 2012"," This is a very sinister movie!
","From the producer of Paranormal Activity & Insidious, comes Sinister. True to its name, the movie is a very good horror movie, it's almost....sinister. <br/><br/>Plot: In short, the movie is about a true-crime-novelist, Ellison Oswalt (Ethan Hawke) who moved to his new home with his wife and two kids to write his new book about the gruesome murder that happen in the neighborhood. The only problem was, the murder actually happened in the house, but he hid this fact from his family. From his investigation, he found that the murder was actually connected to several murder cases from the past. As he tries to unravel the terrifying mystery behind the murders, strange things started to happen in his house-something not from this world...Soon, he realized that he and his family were in danger to becoming the next victim...<br/><br/>Review: This is the 3rd horror movie I watched in cinema this year (previously watched Cabin in the Woods and The Possession), but it easily becomes the best horror movie this year! This movie has enough fear and suspense (plus several jump scare scene) to keep you biting your nails and watched the movie between your fingers. <br/><br/>Ethan Hawke's performance as an obsessed writer but a loving husband and father is very believable, and he especially shined in the scene where he is stressed out. The story is intriguing and always moving. The difference between Sinister and other Hollywood horror movies is that, the director focuses on the plot development as much as he does in scaring the viewer. Sinister has a nice blend of family drama, paranormal, horror and myth. It also contains some of the most gruesome murder I've seen, although nothing too graphic is shown. The best part is, this movie is never too cliché as most horror movies are; it never cheats you, it tries to be real as best as it could, and the movie is twisted and very disturbing, especially the ending, where the mystery is finally revealed. Some may not like the ending, but for me, that is the best and will most probably happened if the movie actually real life.<br/><br/>As an avid horror movie fan, I could safely say that this is the best horror movie this year, heck, make it in a decade! Mainstream movie- goers might not like the movie, but for horror fan, this is the movie for you.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: 10/10 for horror movie fan, 7/10 for others. Please do not watch the movie if you have heart disease, are a pregnant lady or you are just damn sissy."
"MissOceanB","5","1","2","21 October 2012"," Not So Sinister
","Unfortunately, this movie should be re-named...""Not So Sinister"". Very slow start, not chilling or eerie or a challenging horror/thriller. I was quite surprised because even the reviews from true Horror fans/maniacs (like myself) rated it high. If you have seen Insidious, it is MUCH more thrilling/creepy than Sinister, and I didn't find Insidious to be too creepy. Sinister was more of a drama/thriller with a few loud bangs and the old home movies bit was slightly redeeming, but we've seen this before. <br/><br/>At any rate, each person will have to draw their own conclusion but I suggest true Horror fans wait for a free download. Not worth the theatre. I almost considered walking across the hall to Paranormal Activity 4 aka ""attack of the chandeliers and visit from little boy across the street."" And Paranormal Activity 1, 2 and 3 were not scary at all."
"rlinebarger","8","1","2","19 October 2012"," Turn out the lights and get under the blanket...
","Very refreshing to see a horror movie bring back the classical psychological thrill ride along with the ghost/demon story. But what was more refreshing is that they actually gave an ounce of depth to the family. We knew that each of them had their problems and I enjoyed the marriage turmoil, it felt very real. I wish the wife had finished through in a realist way, however. <br/><br/>The jumps and spook moments are fast and furious -- there's very long periods of tension. I loved the adrenaline rush and while I wish they'd made more of the demon, I left extremely pleased that it had the right amount of spook, horror and gut-wrenching torture scene that it didn't leave me overly disturbed, but just enough to know the movie did it's job."
"kylemcghee12","6","1","2","15 October 2012"," Another cliché horror flick
","You know, every once in a while there comes a film that startles audiences in ways you can't even imagine. This is not that film. Sinister is a mediocre horror film that disappointed me. My girlfriend and I had been waiting to see this movie since we saw the trailer at around July. We were really pumped. We went to see it Friday during the first showing, and needless to say we were disappointed. Ethan Hawke plays a writer whose only famous writing is a book titled ""Kentucky Blood"". He moves to a rural town where he decides to write his next book based on the murders that occurred in that area. Well guess what? The house that he bought is where the murders occurred! Acting wise I think Ethan Hawke did an OK job. One of the things that bugged me is that every time that him and his wife would get into a yelling match, he would YELL and then whisper.... Every scene. This is not what broke the movie for me. What did that is what every other horror film has done in the past 20 years: It doesn't scare. There was one moment where I jumped because he yelled like a girl and it was completely unintentional hilarity. Horror films nowadays try to scare by shock value. The key to a good horror film is to want th main characters to persevere and live another day! I did not like this family so I did not care what happened to them. The ""jumpy"" moments are very predictable, and you know what's going to happen. Now I will say this: I did very much enjoy the ending to this movie as it does not end the same way as other ""scary"" movies. I won't give it away but it's interesting... Sinister is an average scary movie that doesn't work as well as I thought it would. Here's to the future and hoping that scary movies actually get it right for once. 6/10"
"ittybittybug","5","2","7","13 October 2012"," Enh...Too predictable
","My boyfriend and I didn't really have any expectations when we decided to go see this movie. Even with no expectations, we were quite disappointed. It was incredibly predictable and within the first 15 minutes of the movie, we had the whole plot figured out between the two of us. Because of the trailer, we already knew a lot of what was going to happen. There were a few twists, but they just didn't have that shock factor.<br/><br/>Let's talk background quality. The lighting in the movie was AWFUL. We could hardly see the set and even during the day everything was dark. In the 'nighttime' scenes, the windows were so lit up that we could never tell if it was day or night. The background music was pretty creepy, but we couldn't tell if some of the noises were background music or if they were noises in the house.<br/><br/>The scare tactics in the movie were pretty weak. The music stops right before something scary is supposed to happen, so that the loud noises will make you jump. The makeup on the dead children was totally out of context for the movie. And we couldn't understand how the rest of the family never heard him shouting or falling. The best scare was the lawn mower scene, as it was quite intense.<br/><br/>The plot 'twists' were pretty predictable. The audience is led to originally think that one of the children is the victim, but then it turns out to be the other child. The connection between the houses and the families moving was predictable, but a good twist nonetheless. The children being the murderers, however, was inevitable, and we saw it coming as soon as we heard about the missing children.<br/><br/>This movie was dragged out much longer than it should have been, but it didn't end happily as many scary movies do (as of recent years) so props for that. The last attempt at a jumpy scare was pathetic. The acting wasn't too bad. Not the best movie, but not the worst."

At the end you just want the bogey man to kill the family fast so that the film ends. <br/><br/>If this film has received 6.8 at IMDb it must be because the whole film crew that have voted on their own film. I can't find any other reason to give a good rating on this truly HORRIBLE movie."

","One thing that will turn me off to a movie faster than just about anything is (pointless) child death. This movie is just full of scene after scene of children dying. Although they generally don't show the grisly details, very little is left to the imagination. Now I'm not saying that a kid can't ever die in a movie, but this seemed rather gratuitous and in large part unnecessary. While it is 'horrifying' as per the genre, it is in a way that I personally don't find so much frightening as just vile, crude, and almost vexatious. It is the sort of thing that just leaves a bad taste in your mouth. On the whole the movie was fairly well done. The special effects were good, the acting was decent, the score was well-fitted, and the story was intriguing, but the movie looses a LOT of points in my book for the above reason."

","Ellison Oswalt (Ethan Hawke) is a true crime writer chasing after the fame and recognition he experienced after his years-ago hit, Kentucky Blood. His wife, Tracy (Juliet Rylance), and two kids, Trevor (Michael Hall D'Addario) and Ashley (Clare Foley), have been as patient as can be thus far, despite him burying himself in his work and becoming more alcoholic over the years. In his quest to produce something groundbreaking, he moves them in to an actual crime scene: the house where a family of five was brutalized (four of them murdered by hanging from a tree outside, and the youngest child missing). He quickly realizes there's even more to the investigation than he initially thought, and soon he's too deep in it to escape unscathed.<br/><br/>I have some real admiration for this movie, and a few complaints as well. Let's start with the good.<br/><br/>Firstly, there's no doubt this movie has great production value and some fantastic acting. I was actually surprised, since I really can't think of anything else I've seen Ethan Hawke in (after some IMDBing there's really nothing that jumped out at me besides Assault on Precinct 13), but he's really great, as are Rylance and the two kids for that matter. This was apparently Hawke's first foray into horror, something he said he'd never do but he fell in love with Scott Derrickson's script.<br/><br/>The plot is not only engaging but they did a great job with character development. One of the biggest oversights I see in horror movies is a lack of really letting us get to know the characters involved. I appreciate the occasional cheap thrill and gratuitous gore as much as the next person, but I really love seeing a horror movie that seems to effortlessly get me involved in the characters' lives and personalities. This movie was just as much about Oswalt's simultaneous obsession with his work and overwhelming desire to prove to himself that he can reach a level of fame again as it was about the increasingly supernatural story unfolding in front of his eyes. There's a few very genuine scenes of discord between him and his wife where you feel like you can really relate to both of them equally — her desire to have a present husband and father to her children, and his desire to be free to pursue his passion.<br/><br/>There's some truly chilling scenes throughout the movie. Oswalt's sleepwalking son popping backwards out of the cardboard box in the hallway yeah, pretty damn freaky. The ""home movies"" of the murders that he finds in the attic disturbing enough that you really can't look away, made especially creepy by the old timey music that plays during each one. Each killing is sort of themed in this kind of bloody, gory twist on the idyllic happy family stereotype — the video of the family duct taped to pool chairs and drowned is called ""pool party"", the one of the family burned to death in their own car is ""BBQ"". You get the idea. Twisted.<br/><br/>The deputy who wants to be Oswalt's man on the inside — played by James Ransone — is just so awesome. It's a shame he has such a relatively minor character, because he has this understated humor and just natural acting ability that I loved immediately.<br/><br/>And now the bad. It's hard to notice that almost every damn thing that Oswalt does in this movie is in the dark. It's clearly done for creeptastic effect but it winds up being a little repetitive and not entirely believable considering he's got nothing else going on during the day, so why is everything in the pitch freaking black?<br/><br/>The bad guy in the movie, who we eventually find out is referred to as ""Bughuul"" or ""Mr. Boogie"" to the kids he abducts, is somewhat creepy when spotted in the shadows of the home movies but upon closer inspection he seems like he might fit in better in some kind of Slipknot-esque metal band. The concept of his character — that he's a pagan deity from Babylonian times that needs to feed on the souls of human children to survive and can travel between his realm and ours through images of himself and symbols — is minorly interesting, but the logistics of all of it are just frustrating to me. I'd honestly be more into this movie if the killer was simply a serial killing human he doesn't need a supernatural aspect, it was all creepy enough on its own.<br/><br/>The scene where Oswalt is investigating around the house because the Super 8 projector started playing on its own for the millionth time and the kids are all sneaking around behind him cheesy as hell. Same with the kids sitting around watching the video up in the attic. I am just convinced that it's damn near impossible for me to think that kids — whether they're dead or alive, murderous or innocent — are scary. His daughter, Ashley, does a pretty decent job at being a creepy little murderer but still, it just doesn't do much for me. The ending was only a little bit creepy but again, I could really do without the supernatural aspect, and seeing Mr. Boogie more up close kind of shook away the creepiness that came from him being so shrouded in mystery.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I think it did great for a ""Hollywood horror"". Strong acting and cinematography saved what wound up being an unnecessarily convoluted plot and a kinda goofy villain. I'll check out the sequel, Sinister 2 (which looks like it has James Ransone in a more central role, yesss!), and report back!"

Anyway, this is a creepy ass movie!<br/><br/>Damn! I watched it alone, at night, as I do with pretty much all movies I watch, at least horror. And you know what? A couple of times I looked behind my back, just to check I was alone. That's not something I often do. The atmosphere is very creepy in this little flick. There are some sound effects that can really chill ya! Chilled me, anyway.<br/><br/>Without giving high hopes I can say it is one of the very, very few horror movies that kind of scared me a little. Which I just love. And it impresses me, because movie wise I do not scare easily. (Not saying that to sound cool and tough, although I am those things)<br/><br/>Ethan Hawke does a great job, some of his reaction shots are excellent, and really ups the scary. You can read some trivia on that here on IMDb, after you have watched this little gem.<br/><br/>I liked this one very much, it's up there with Insidious, and a couple of others. This blessed new wave of creepy, well made horror movies. Huzzah!"
"daniyalkhan857","8","1","3","5 April 2015"," Sinister (2012)
","Sinister is very well made horror film.Sinister is a movie that combined elements of eeriness, creepiness, and classical theme that turned it into a horror masterpiece.<br/><br/>Some of the scenes had the scare factor, I admit I did jump a couple of times. The tension builds nicely and you find yourself getting pulled right in to the movie, almost like you're there with the characters.<br/><br/>In short, I'd highly recommend you (or better still DARE YOU) to see SINISTER.The best horror film of the year and a good story behind it! I mean it may not be INSIDIOUS, nevertheless, if you love that then you'll love this. A must Movie for horror fans."
"inkyabus","8","1","3","27 March 2015"," Worth the watch.
","Overall, I thought this film was pretty creatively written and not your average horror movie film. The movie really makes you think about what's actually been portrayed rather than just a whole heap of scares throughout the entire movie (although those are present). Ethan Hawke plays a great role and I was pleasantly surprised he was cast because I had no idea who was cast or what the plot was about which I'm happy I didn't research anything about the movie beforehand because I found that I enjoyed it more because I knew nothing about what was happening. <br/><br/>I will recommend that if anyone does plan on watching this movie, don't watch the trailer as I believe it gives away some spoilers/detailed insight to what happens.<br/><br/>It's worth the watch!"
"oskar-mellblom98","8","1","3","22 March 2015"," Sinister - One of the Best
","Sinister - One of the best scary movies i've ever watched!<br/><br/>I have watched the scariest and the most successful scary movies and Sinister is on the top of my list. If you don't want to get scared I recommend watching it with your friends and if you watch it alone I can guarantee it will scare you ;)<br/><br/>I really enjoyed watching Sinister, it was very scary and it had some jump scares in it. I don't get scared so easily but this movie succeeded with that. The actors were great and an excellent story. I have watched the movie a couple of times and I still like it as much as the first time. If you like scary movies like Insidious, Paranormal activity you'll definitely like this one too. <br/><br/>You won't regret watching it and I think Sinister deserves better rating then 6.8"
"sunshinestate0307","1","1","3","6 February 2015"," Why?
","I like the beginning of the movie, but the end is not that good. Because it was so good until the end. Why did they all have to die? Why does Bughuul take the souls of deceased children? sometimes in the movie, the scary part leads up to nothing, when he saw a scorpion and Trevor hiding in the bushes, and the plot was good, but how could the children possess Ashley to attack all of her family members? the movie was way over hyped. It was a good performance by Ethan Hawke.The daughter doesn't really have enough lines, and Trevor suffers a lot of night terrors, why did Ellison not pick up the phone and listen to the deputy,, and maybe this would of been a good movie."

"lusitania_sacra","8","1","3","25 May 2014"," The best horror movie i've seen in a very long time
","I loved this movie! For starters i must say i love supernatural elements in a movie, that's the kind of movies i like the most. My favorite horror movie, for instance is 'The Ring', and i dislike movies like 'Saw' or 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'. This one is the best horror movie i've seen in a long time. The soundtrack is absolutely scary and it appears in the right moments to make you want to scream or open your eyes with fear. The acting is really good, and i am talking about all the cast, even simple scenes that don't add much to the story, like the scene where Ethan Hawke fights with his wife about the motif that took them to that house. Their chemistry is amazing! The story itself is really scary and has the right elements to make you scared (the tapes are absolutely terrifying). Some people here say they saw the final coming, well, i didn't, i was absolutely startled when i realized who were doing the crimes.<br/><br/>I was really satisfied with all the movie, it wasn't boring at all, despite it's lenght, and the story really captures you so you want to know more and get you curious to see how's it going to end.<br/><br/>I highly recommend it for any horror fan. After seeing many garbage i finally found a good horror film. 8 out of 10."
"allisonlscates","4","1","3","10 March 2014"," This is supposed to be a horror film?
","Originally when I got this movie in the mail from Netflix, I had high hopes after reading a lot of positive reviews, but this movie ultimately falls short as a horror film for many reasons. <br/><br/>First, the pacing of the Sinister is dreadfully slow and we don't see anything 'scary' until about 40 minutes in. Almost the whole movie, I was waiting for something to jump out and scare me and those moments never came. The few 'fright' scenes are 100% predictable, unoriginal and often didn't make sense. <br/><br/>For example, there is a scene in the movie where Ellison's son is sleepwalking and is found in the backyard. When Ellison goes outside to retrieve him, there is a Rottweiler randomly in his backyard along with a bunch of dead kids. What was the point of the dog? And why are there a bunch of dead kids in your backyard?<br/><br/>Those dead kids. I'm sure they were supposed to be scary, but their makeup made them look laughable and ridiculous. They were running all over Ellison's house and dashing into rooms in slow motion and Ellison is oblivious to this the whole time. Then there was the main monster, who looked more like a member from Insane Clown Posse. His name is the Bughuul and there is no back story at all as to who this guy/demon is; we don't see him enough to fully understand his character. <br/><br/>Another thing that bothered me was the majority of the movie was filmed in the house; there were very few scenes that didn't take place in their home. It would have even been nice if Ellison left his house to do some research or if there were different shot locations. Ellison's family also experiences problems in town due to the unpopularity of Ellison's current crime novel. The mom says people give her dirty looks at the grocery store and their son gets teased at school. It would have been nice if we had seen some of these scenes because they would have added more to the story. <br/><br/>The last thing that I will say about Sinister is that during the whole movie Ellison is wearing a woman's sweater. I could not get over this. His sweater literally looks like something you would find at Forever 21. Sinister loses a lot of points because of that woman sweater. Over all Sinister wasn't that bad. It had a lot of potential with the cinematography and the shot compositions, but failed to use that to properly scare the viewer. It's presented more as a mystery than a horror flick. If you want to see a better movie with a bunch of dead kids running around, watch The Orphanage (El Orfanato)."
"rohit_vit2020","5","1","3","2 March 2014"," Not so good
","Movie is definitely scary. But its all about sounds. The movie lacks the reality. The lead actor does anything for his crime story, by putting their family in danger, which is a negative show, and De-motivates me. Even though he has seen some paranormal activities going in his newly shifted house, he dares to stay and put his family and himself in danger, which lacks the reality absolutely, The movie lacks performances also. And they made the film funny by making children as ghosts, which is not appropriate and scary. It is amateurish. I gave 5/10, just because it is scary.. But remember, the scare is brought in through disturbing ""Thud"" background sounds."
"Jlw18101995-699-373385","3","1","3","14 November 2013"," Scary? Where? I've seen cartoons that are more horrifying!
","Several days ago, I sat down comfortably, anticipating a great film ahead. Sinister was a film I had been aching to see for months, but I wish I hadn't bothered. A real let down. The story actually wasn't that bad, although it could have included a bigger plot twist. However, for a horror, it lacked horror! A couple of semi-creepy moments kept me awake, but it was a film I continued watching in the hope of it improving which it never did. The inclusion of Ethan Hawke as the main character surprised me, but he did a good job without blowing me away. Also a couple of things don't seem to have been properly thought through, for example, the house is in Pennsylvania, so why was there a scorpion in the attic? I give the film credit for trying, but it majorly disappointed, and I won't be in a rush to watch Sinister 2."
"CinemaClown","Null","1","3","5 October 2013"," Marred By Its Final Act But A Chilling Experience Nonetheless
","From the director of The Exorcism of Emily Rose, Sinister marks director Scott Derrickson's second stint with the genre of horror & is an impressive improvement over his debut chiller. It might not have reached the dizzying heights of the genre masterpieces when it comes to storytelling aspects but it nonetheless accomplishes its goal of scaring the audience in a pretty impressive manner.<br/><br/>Opening with an 8mm footage of a family being killed by an unseen figure, Sinister concerns a true-crime writer who along with his family moves into the very house where a disturbing crime once took place in order to help his research. The plot is set in motion when he discovers a cache of snuff films in the attic depicting families being murdered in various ways & ultimately ends up finding much more than he bargained for.<br/><br/>Brilliantly directed by Derrickson, the first half of the film is ingeniously structured thanks to the excellent build-up of its premise but its second half plays spoilsport here, especially the final act, although it's not that bad enough to destroy the entire picture. The atmosphere is chilling for the most part, jump cuts are smartly used, sound & music is effectively carried out, and performances by its cast isn't much of a letdown.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Sinister does carry many genre-clichés throughout its runtime while also including few elements which bring the story down by a slight extent but there's less denying that it's a cinematic experience not many horror films of today are able to deliver. Arguably the scariest flick of 2012 and in my opinion the second best Hollywood horror of its year after The Cabin in the Woods, Sinister is definitely worth a shot."
"Jazzband-9-565776","7","1","3","29 August 2013"," it's midnight. why am I watching this movie again?
","at the start of the movie I had not really an expectation from what it could or would be. I only had a friend who suggested me this film because he could not stop screaming during the film, or at least thats what he told me. finally I followed his advise and dared myself to watch this film in the middle of the night on my laptop with my headphones on. first of all i've been trough a lot of paranormal experiences myself not going in further detail on that. ( WATCH OUT SPOILER )so the movie starts of with the 4 people getting hanged on a tree, which slightly disturbed me, because it brought an unpleasant feeling with it, of course it does because you see people die thats not fun to watch, but it was not the fact i saw 4 people getting hanged which disturbed me it was the mixture of the music and the old camera recording in this really creepy way that did the thing. so I got interested because it made me feel that way, this feeling i felt almost the whole movie especially the parts (spoiler...) he watches the films where he sees each family getting murdered in horrible disgusting ways. the other thing I liked where the use of animals, ( spoiler ) the part with the dog seemed very familiar because an animal always gets uncomfortable when he feels the presence of someone not there ( I love the detail in the film many of you would not know ) but getting to the end the film got into the usual kinda horror thing with a predictable ending which didn't scare me, slightly disturbed me though. but i felt i've seen that part. it was a shame because the movie really scared the hell out of me the first hour which only a few films can do for me. 7/10 <br/><br/>Jesse this was my first review please let me know what you think about it, and sorry for the grammar mistakes i; m dutch so my English isn't perfect"

","I started to watch this with a sense of trepidation in that ""you have seen one you have seen them all"" kind of mood. However this film throws up up its own surprises , none of which I shall give away.<br/><br/>This film does not go for unnecessary gore , blood and violence but uses good,old fashioned well built up tension with a music score that leads you into the story, you know something is going to happen, you even think you can guess what is going to happen but you will invariably be wrong.<br/><br/>Ethan Hawkes plays his character brilliantly going through all the emotions of a writer, father and husband, wrestling with his emotions as he tries to combine all three parts of his life. <br/><br/>Moving into the new house our story opens and really gets going on the discovery of home films which assist Hawke in his book writing. As he investigates further and starts to ask more and more questions strange things begin to occur. You may jump a little but there is nothing over excessive in the violence stakes with many scenes cutting away at the point where the most disturbance could be caused.<br/><br/>The speed of the destroy accelerates but not to quickly allowing the story to develop at its good pace making sure you don't miss anything as our other characters are introduced. The ending is not predictable (in my humble opinion) and maintains the integrity of the who,e film without going into the outrageous as many of these films ca do.<br/><br/>Sit back and enjoy like I did."
"horrorhound85","10","1","3","17 August 2013"," another of the best horrors I have seen.
","I watched this film last night at a friends house. From the very first shot of this film it had me hooked. I would not call this movie Scary in the convensional sense I would say it was more disturbing than anything. A family moves into a new house and the father finds in the attack 6 roles of super 8 films. Playing these may just be the worst thing he has ever done. I don't want to tell people too much about this film because the less you know the better the film is. I cannot rate it highly enough. There are plenty of WTF moments and my friend turned to me during the film and said ""this movie has got you by the balls hasn't it"". He was 100% right and it will have you by the balls too."
"Tehmeh","8","1","3","5 August 2013"," Not perfect, but very good for a modern horror film
","The Ring (both original and the remake), The Conjuring and Insidious are one of the best modern horror movies for me. Most of them with plenty of flaws and tired clichés, but the good outweighed the bad in such a fashion that I was impressed. It was probably natural that I enjoyed this one too.<br/><br/>There are enough jump-scares for people who see horror films for that kind of material, but luckily Sinister doesn't rely solely on them. The atmosphere just gets more and more tense as the movie goes by. There are just enough lighter moments to keep you from getting overly nervous but also not too much to let you lose that sense of horror. <br/><br/>The ""real crime author in a house of murder"" - type plot is executed surprisingly well, and besides supernatural horror there's a little detective side to the story as well. Most people probably guess what the ending will be like, as I did too. It falls a little flat. Some things are handled a little poorly and the bar is lowered a little. If you're like me and usually give horror movies some slack, you probably won't be bothered too much.<br/><br/>There is an element to this movie that is absolutely handled with utmost skill and care. ""Sinister"" is built around a certain gimmick. Our main character (played by Ethan Hawke) finds mysterious film reels, which are basically snuff films. We get to see them, and they are disturbing in a way that is rare for horror movies today. It's almost like taking the best out of the whole found-footage genre, and putting bits of it inside a ""real"" movie. It doesn't feel like a gimmick, even though it probably is, and it works amazingly well. Not only is it genuinely creepy, but it sets up the mystery plot nicely as well.<br/><br/>At times the filmmakers stop relying on the atmosphere and shove a few really idiotic jumpscares or senseless tropes in the film. I like scares, but I also like it when they compliment the story itself and not take you out of it. It's certainly clear that with ""Sinister"", less would've been more. Either the script wasn't that great or the filmmakers wanted to please the dumber ones in the general audience or the production company demanded more stupidity in the name of lowest common denominator. We may never know. That is a shame, because for me this could've been a modern classic. There, I got my gripes out of the way. <br/><br/>Cinematography, use of sound and lighting all work very well and compliment each other. Technically, very well made. <br/><br/>Ethan Hawke delivers, no worries there. I'm really glad they cast him, he just fits. I've always found him enjoyable to watch, even if he doesn't always choose the best movies to work on. His character has that certain edge that doesn't make him bland or too perfect. <br/><br/>8 out of 10 might be too much because there are some things that bother me, but then again I was truly scared and really immersed - the film just worked for me. Watched it on blu-ray at night, and I even had to take breaks because of the tension. Modern horror movies can be really bad but when there are exceptions like this one, I rejoice (and soil myself in the process). <br/><br/>If I had to compare this to ie. ""The Conjuring"", I'd say that both are very well made, and while ""Sinister"" didn't have the tightest script or the balls to rely on its wonderful atmosphere enough, it still scared me more. Both are recommended."

From the first shot of this movie, you get freaked out and it continues for the entire movie.<br/><br/>It delivers many jump scares, the entire movie is unsettling and they have done a real good job by prolonging the scenes where he heres something and goes down an dark hallway..<br/><br/>If your are a kid or easily get nightmares, don't watch this movie.

","In a time where we seem to see a new ""Found Footage"" movie on a weekly basis and filming already well underway for Paranormal Activity 5 I was pleasantly surprised by Sinister. Sure i had heard this was meant to be a genuinely scary movie, but i hear that a lot and am very rarely impressed. Although none of Sinister idea's of particularly original and as mentioned before its not the first of its kind but still found myself enjoying the movie the further i got into it. Although this isn't strictly a found footage movie it plays on the premises of finding home movies of murders and the effect it is having on the lead character much like the Ring movies did. The one thing that really sets Sinister apart for me was the quality of acting in the movie which really help draw the watcher in as a pose to wonder how the actor was related to the director in order to get the part.<br/><br/>Despite the fact i think the studio put this movie together to be a combination of Paranormal Activity and Insidious Sinister is a good horror movie and i would swing in more in favour of V/H/S that i would the more mainstream counterparts."

The film language used some nice deep focus shots that helped build up and sustain the tension. The acting was good and Mr. Hawke was superb. One of the main building blocks of this film was the found-footage styled tapes. These creeped me out more than I thought they would. Definitely worth watching at night with some friends or if you don't want to sleep for the next few days, like me, then watch with headphones at night.

","First off, I am no professional movie critic, but I have seen many horror films throughout the years and own over hundreds of titles. This one definitely caught my attention not only as being a dark spooky film, but also for the superior actors and ideas that the Director used. This movie needed no special CGI or chainsaw wielding characters to illustrate a good horror film. It portrayed a very dark atmosphere and creepy music involving Super 8 films, which makes the viewer guessing what is going to happen next. This movie definitely has jump scenes. This movie involves a very favorite actor of mine, Ethan Hawke, who I believe played a great role in a scary movie as most of his movies involved him playing the role of a police officer. I will admit that some parts the viewer can guess, but first time viewers will be surprised. This movie has become one of my all time favorites in modern horror. I am looking forward to a sequel as good as this first one."

","I haven't done a review for a movie on IMDb before but I really felt like I should with this film just because it was so amazingly scary. I saw it last night with some friends. Sadly Sinister never came to Australia via cinema but on the TV it was still really scary. The opening scene for me although not much happened was just so disturbing and messed up. Watching though people slowly lift up from the ground to be hung is just such a strong point in the film. I found all the tapes that Ethan watched were really messed up. All the deaths were really disturbing but you couldn't stop watching them. This film had such a great. Story and used amazing techniques through camera angles and sound to show this story. <br/><br/>Spoiler alert I would love to give it 10 out of 10 but I really think that it could have gone a little but further with a few more jump scares and the final death could have been a bit more disturbing or at least shown.

"FilmGuy34567","8","1","3","7 July 2013"," Sinister Review
","I have to applaud this film for being a truly original, terrifying, and non-gory horror film. What I like most about it is its build-up and how it sustains suspense to the end instead of petering out like many horror films do. It is consistently scary and suspenseful right up to its shocking finale. It also works as a very surreal film, for not too many details are revealed about ""Mr. Boogie"", the menace of this film. It is this lack of awareness on our part which keeps us watching and keeps us interesting. My hat goes off to the screenwriter, who keeps things tense all the way through and you have to appreciate the creepy cinematography and use of score as well."
"brettjtalley","10","1","3","29 June 2013"," Truly Frightening Horror Movie
","I am always on the lookout for good horror. Despite my best efforts, I rarely come across a movie that scares me. I found one. <br/><br/>Sinister tells the story of Ellison Oswalt, a true-crime writer whose best work was ten years ago. In an effort to get his mojo back, he moves his family to a small town in the middle of nowhere to chronicle the murder of four people and the disappearance of the family's youngest daughter. And in a move that the local sheriff notes is in ""bad taste,"" he decides to move into the house previously occupied by the murdered family. Did I mention the family was murdered in the back yard, hanged from the branch of a particularly sturdy tree?<br/><br/>Things start to go hairy when Ellison discovers a box of Super-8 films in the attic of his home, films that shouldn't be there (we are treated to a crime scene photo showing an empty attic). One of the films depicts the murder of the people Ellison is investigating. But when Ellison watches some of the other films in the box—spanning several decades—he finds that each one depicts another family, and another murder. But when Ellison makes out the image of the killer in one of the films, that's when things take a turn for the worst. <br/><br/>I tell you what, this movie is freaky-deaky from the word go. From the very first frame, it's go time. I am reminded of the similarly named Insidious, a movie that was wonderfully horrific until the last 15 minutes or so, when it sorta falls apart. This movie doesn't fall apart. And the thing is, it almost never lets up. There are very few opportunities to relax. The Super 8 films harken back to Peeping Tom, the excellent 1960 horror film that was so far ahead of its time that it destroyed the director's career. But the heart of the movie is purely supernatural and altogether unsettling. The fact that the family dynamic is so well-established only makes it worse. I can honestly say that Sinister is one of the scariest movies I have seen since The Ring. <br/><br/>Highly recommended for anyone who loves a good scare.<br/><br/>Bonus: Sinister manages to breathe new life into the jump scare as well. There is one scene where the lead character sees something that makes him jump out of his chair. I almost fell out of mine. <br/><br/>Bonus, with a spoiler: So I always say, if you end up in a place where something crazy is going on, just move. Yeah, didn't quite work in this one<br/><br/>Originally published at www.brettjtalley.com"

","It was a brilliant story line that I really enjoyed watching, It was really thought through and well directed, the effects were good, and it was different to all the other horror films I've watched in the past. I think its good how they didn't realize that they were living in a house where someone was murdered, and when you think its a person that did it, you have a shock when you find out it was some sort of paranormal creature that murdered the people that previously lived there. It has a very different ending than to what I expected, their normally happy endings where they kill or stop the creature, but not this one it had a different ending and that's what made it stand out to the rest of the horror films that I've seen. And yes I've seen a lot. Seriously, you should watch it, if you haven't already."
"davelucas1974","9","1","3","1 April 2013"," Sinister Movie Review
","www.TheMovieFrog.com <br/><br/>Down with Sinister Lies! 0<br/><br/>In today's crop of DVD reviews we reap the French equivalent of The Big Chill, another preachy film about failing schools & a horror film that was actually pretty good for once. Might as well dive in...<br/><br/>Won't Back Down - You know, this picture has made me a believer. No, not about the problems in our modern school systems, I was already a believer about that. It has made me a believer that even someone as talented as Viola Davis faces great difficulty finding decent roles as a middle aged black woman in Hollywood. How else can you explain the two time Oscar nominee accepting this role in Won't Back Down? She does a great job (as always), but even someone as seasoned as she is unable to elevate this material into something more. Maybe they should have given her the Oscar for The Help while they had the chance.<br/><br/>That explains her choice, I suppose, and actresses Holly Hunter and Rosie Perez haven't exactly been beating offers off with a stick the last few years either, but didn't Maggie Gyllenhall get nominated for an Oscar for Crazy Heart just a few years back? And she follows that triumph up with this film and Hysteria? I'm a little lost.<br/><br/>I'm sure that when Daniel Barnz (who also directs) and Brin Hill sat down to write this screenplay, it was with the best of intentions. I'm sure that they really wanted to call attention to the problems of American schools, celebrate those who are working to fix it, and inspire others to do the same. They might as well have written a greeting card. What they've produced is an obvious and cloying message movie. Message movies belong on television as after school specials, but occasionally they get enough stars attached to them that they wind up on the big screen.<br/><br/>The performances by the two lead actresses DO make the film somewhat watchable, but all in all it's a bit of a snoozer, unfortunately. To Ms. Davis and Ms. Gyllenhall, demand that your agents find you something worthier of your talents. This time, Don't Back Down...3 of 5 stars.<br/><br/>Sinister - I have not seen writer/director Scott Derrickson's creation The Exorcism of Emily Rose but now I feel as if maybe I should go back and watch it. I love a GOOD horror movie, but even a Movie Frog like me sees so few of merit nowadays. They mostly go in for the gross out, replacing elements like suspense and mystery with blood, guts, and (cheap looking) special effects. That is not the sort of film that Mr. Derrickson and co-screenwriter C. Robert Cargill have crafted here at all.<br/><br/>Sinister is full of suspense AND mystery. It has a sufficiently original villain with a credible back story. It goes for creepy more often than it goes for shock value (the slow motion movements of the ghost children who vanish in such a way that you can almost see them dimension hopping is a particularly nice touch). It takes some effort to craft interesting characters, and builds a sub-plot of family drama that actually works. It tells a real story that actually somewhere.<br/><br/>Of course, it doesn't hurt to have a capable veteran actor like Ethan Hawke in the lead. He plays the part for all it is worth without ever going too far over the line. We share his curiosity, frustration and terror because it is always in reaction to what has happened. His acting never telegraphs what is coming; the viewer believes that he is just as surprised by every twist as they are. Relatively unknown supporting players Juliet Rylance (as his wife) and James Ransone (as Deputy So-and-So) also lend much stronger back up than you usually expect...

"Red_Identity","Null","1","3","14 March 2013"," Surprisingly really great
","I've always been someone who's never really scared of 95% of horror films out there. Even when some horror films scare me, they only do it to a certain degree. So either I've turned into a total coward or this is one of those 5%, because I found myself quite unsettled and truly terrified for much of this film's running time. Much of that is because of the really atmospheric music score, which incorporates many sounds that only heighten the suspense. There hasn't been a horror score this brilliantly orchestrated or scary in a very long time.And while there are definite jump scares in this one, I think, for the most part, they truly worked. The suspense-building was unbearable at times, and the murder mystery at the core is also truly strong. You kinda see how the film will end 20 minutes before it's over, but it still had some more twists that surprised me. It does get a bit implausible, but nothing totally crazy or anything that kills the mood. This is definitely a very strong horror film backed by a pretty effective lead performance from Ethan Hawke."
"tuc02726","3","1","3","11 March 2013"," I've got 99 problems and this movie is most of them.
","Okay, so first impression: We got some family getting hanged in the first 6.5 seconds of the movie. If you've ever see a horror movie where people were hanged....or a western, then you look at these people doing the lazy air-moonwalk and think ""Damn, they must have been the shittiest actors. Probably ever."" Now, you're walking on down through this film, and its your standard Paranormal Activity/Found footage style movie where they have some kind of eerie noise which signals a jump-scare is imminent. (Or the sound goes dead altogether for a second) ...And that's where *all* the scares come from. It really pushes hard for a ""Boogie-man's gonna get 'cha"" aspect, but even by the end of the movie, it just isn't there. Unless of course you're scared by the prospect of a supernatural spirit killing you while you're drugged or half asleep with no idea whats going on. At which point you forget about that and realized you judged the actors from those 6.5 seconds a bit harshly, and really it was just a questionable plot device. The film keeps throwing these gruesome 8mm camera snuff films at you, presumably to put you in that ""Good god, that could happen to me!"" state of mind.<br/><br/>Anyway, let's say you can forgive it for that. Then you get punched in the face with the lack of subtlety. If you can't figure out at 16:39 what's going on, then maybe this movie is for you. They practically serve the answers up for you on a silver platter. If you don't have a clue by then, don't worry. They later throw Professor Expert at you who immediately knows exactly what's going on. You might never see him again after he provides 3-4 sentences of plot explanation. He might not contribute, but at least he has the decency to appear again.<br/><br/>The one shake-up from tradition here is that when everyone in the audience is tearing their hair out because the family is staying in a haunted house, they actually move. Unexpected. I assume this was plenty scary for the target audience of parents with children? In the end, I was more impressed that an ancient Babylonian demon-spirit learned how to use a camera than I was with the the actual film.."
"amesmonde","Null","1","3","6 March 2013"," A Defining Horror - Hawke is Outstanding
","Eager for another bestseller a writer moves his family to another town where a series of murders has taken place to research his next book. However, he uncovers something more terrifying than he can put to paper, namely Mr. Boogieman.<br/><br/>With a family hanging from a tree in the opening shot you know that Sinister is not pulling any punches. Rather than focusing on other worldly phantoms like Insidious (2010) (by the same producer Jason Blum), Sinister is more grounded even if still essentially a supernatural thriller. Thankfully, the now common place in horror found footage aspect is not focal in the traditional sense and is a product to move the intriguing premise forward.<br/><br/>Director Scott Derrickson along with writers Derrickson and C. Robert Cargill deliver an absorbing slow build up with the main flawed, borderline alcoholic character Ellison Oswalt (Ethan Hawke). Derrickson with director of photography Chris Norr give the film a innovative look, it's dark - very dark, with inky blacks, depth and shadows always on display. In all its boldly minimally lit going against convention creating some real ominous atmosphere. The production is tight and sharply edited by Frédéric Thoraval.<br/><br/>With all you'd want there's haunting moving images and figures, creepy super 8 footage, spooky photos, a series of snuff films, local snooping cops and a concerned wife to name few. Although part murder mystery, Sinister is full of horror. Clever directing and lighting allows the viewer to make discoveries at the same time as Hawke and the sound design and visuals present several effective jump scares.<br/><br/>Sinister's bonus is that it's well acted for the genre. Both Professor Jonas Vincent D'Onofrio and Fred Thompson as the Sheriff are natural and to Cargill and Derrickson's credit certainly character wise tries to go against predicable. The eerie Mr. Boogieman's appearance is limited and part of a larger mythology avoiding the need for a typical showdown which has been done to death in many horror films. There's not an annoying child actor in sight. I can't put my finger on it but Juliet Rylance while a good actress playing the down to earth wife and mother Tracy feels slightly out of place, possibly miscast. Notable is James Ransone as quirky concerned cop Deputy So-And-So. Hawke is on fine form - in what could have been stereotype writer going mad but plays it perfectly balanced and convincingly from the outset. He becomes desperate as the film becomes increasingly paranormal and the ancient demon reverence becomes prevalent. Debatably not since The Shining (1980) and Stir of Echoes (1999) has a male horror lead character been as interesting. You warm the guy despite his faults and you care about his fate.<br/><br/>As it unfolds clichés rear their heads, a child's drawings on a wall, ghosts and so on but it all done in a naturalistic fashion with outstanding special visual effects. Again the special effects are not just for effects sake and fit within the scenes. There's an especially creepy scene when Oswalt investigates the noises in his house armed with a baseball bat but cannot see the sounds origins.<br/><br/>It has a tight story and although the downbeat ending while well done leaves you a little empty. You feel there is going to be an inevitable sequel but you really wish they'd leave it neatly wrapped up. While Sinister's elements may not be entirely original it encompasses, combines and defines satisfyingly ideas that other horrors of it's kind have failed to do."
"m-a-elsewhere","7","1","3","2 March 2013"," Satisfying suburban horror fantasy
","Although hardly a future classic, SINISTER is nevertheless among the more satisfying and sure-footed horror fantasies in the past couple of years--the equivalent of a solidly hit two-base grounder--and a major professional improvement for writer/director Scott Derrickson.<br/><br/>Combining effects and motifs from Western and J-horror, Derrickson's script deftly turns the screws from natural mystery to supernatural as Ethan Hawke's true-crime author Ellison Oswalt delves into a cold case, only to uncover pattern killings which prove ultimately mythic. The ""suburban nightmare"" structure is strictly conventional, but contains enough twists to keep from collapsing on itself. There are a few too many red herrings, but not an egregious number. <br/><br/>The characters aren't terribly intelligent, but they're not incapable of doing sensible things...at least, within the set-up's context. One problem with the script is that the dysfunctional marriage portrayed couldn't have lasted long enough to produce even one child (whenever Oswalt goes to another small town, researching some notorious local crime, Juliet Rylance's wife Tracy: a) insists that the whole family move with him; b) but demands that he never discuss even the topic of his work; c) then reliably freaks out to learn that the old case had been big news among the chatty new neighbors). Clearly, if she didn't require so much nuclear togetherness, his career wouldn't be an issue; indeed, the characters' whole dynamic should have been better constructed. Still, Derrickson deserves credit for creating characters with enough weight to warrant even that level of critique."
"view_and_review","5","1","3","28 February 2013"," Sinister? Yes, but not in a good way
","This movie is eerie, spooky, and creepy but never scary. I suppose that it's good that the main character, Ellison, was a true crime writer so that the viewers could be duly clued in on what was going on. In an attempt to write another best-seller, Ellison moved his family into the home where the subjects of his next book were killed.<br/><br/>Layer by layer, super 8 film by super 8 film the story unfolded but to me it never amounted to more than a malevolent drama. There were never any real shocks or surprises and nor was there any real frightening moments. The movie is OK. The movie will keep you tense with the musical scores and the cliché unexplained-noises-investigations-in-the-dark. But in the end many of those tense moments were met with disappointment."

Instead he loses everything.It says based on a true story, but who in their right mind would move into a house like that????? In some ways it is like The Stranger, except he is fighting the paranormal, not crazed killers. I liked it because it did make me jump out of my seat many many times. That is a rarity today.

Don't listen to these other reviewers, they obviously want tons of gore, or some major evil monster to stare at.... this is more like the older horror films that relied on atmosphere and pure dread to make the viewer feel connected. This isn't a slasher type movie although there are scenes that are very unsettling. This director also did Exorcism of Emily Rose which I also liked. He's (Derrickson) one of the best directors of horror out there. Iv'e seen almost every horror movie made and this one is easily in the top 10%. Check it out...."

","This review contains spoiler, please don't read it before watching the movie.<br/><br/>Sinister is about a true-crime writer who moves into houses that were the scenes of the crimes he is writing about and he is also dragging his family with him. This time they move into a house where four members of a family of five were hung in the backyard while the youngest kid went missing. After writing a bestseller, the guy decides to repeat the success, just making it even better. The story really starts when he finds a box with ""home movies"" that are super 8 footages of several murders covering a 40-year period, including the one he is working on. As time is going on many paranormal things are happening which slowly lead back to an ancient legend. <br/><br/>Well, as the story is unfolding it's not hard to find out what will happen, but this time it wasn't disturbing. Is the movie using clichés? You bet it is. But the story is so nicely built and feels like a whole that it's just fine. Besides I found it quite scary too in spite of using many well-known cheap scare tricks. So if you are a horror fan, you won't get anything new in terms of horror raw material, but I always like when clichés are used to make something new and the strong story with this interesting redefinition of found footage is quite enjoyable, so give it a try."

","Normally, i don't like horror movies. The only reason i was even remotely interested in Sinister was because of Ethan Hawke. Never less to say, i watched the movie solely expecting some decent acting from Hawke. However, my low expectations were completely blown away. <br/><br/>The major draw for this film is that it doesn't rely on jump scares to frighten viewers. Now, there are a couple of jump scares in the film, but don't let that deter you, its much more than that. The writing is fantastic, always giving you a sense of intrigue and mystery. In a very good way, the entire film was me thinking: ""What the hell?!"" <br/><br/>Now, some may be unhappy with the ending, some may like it. I don't like movies where everything is sunshine and rainbows. The ending is (somewhat) unexpected and to my definition, it what a true horror movie should be."

","The movie had scares; it had things that made you want to sleep with a night light. I am no ""fearless"" person but I am a horror fan, when I was watching this my little sister did not scream as much as I did, it could be the fact she probably didn't comprehend some of what was going on but the point is this movie frightened me from beginning to end. It kept you on the edge of your couch wondering what's going to happen next. Is the main character going to be okay? The story progressed well in my opinion and having the main character be a writer who studies murders just really kept it going good. Some people can't appreciate a good horror movie just because they aren't scared of most things anymore, but if you scare easy then this is something to get your heart pumping. The ending went well too, I personally don't like endings like it did, but it had to happen and they did it well."

There was on the upside some good traditional creepy make your hair stand on end bits which i did enjoy. The acting was good in a lot of it. the child actors were quite good also there were a few jumpy bits that had the audience letting out a scream or two. For me personally there needs to be more to scare me and to leave a lasting effect as i leave the cinema this movie did not provide me with that experience. I left the cinema feeling cheated out of a movie that was supposed to scare me into submission, i at no time felt i needed to cover my eyes in anticipation.

"sohansurag","4","1","3","14 December 2012"," A Drab Affair!
","Sinister, I was told, was original and one of the scariest movies this season. I am severely disappointed after what I saw. First of all lemme get this out: ""What the bloody F did I just watch?"" It wasn't even remotely scary, it had inevitable jump scares which fell flat as well as flawed monster closets. Nothing in the movie ever worked well for it. The plot is disastrous. To begin with The Bagul didn't even exist in any mythology. They do say some mumbo-jumbo about some Pagan Deity but sadly it doesn't make any sense nor does it add to the scare factor. They just made it up and usually these imaginative stuff from the film-makers does work, but Bagul is so awfully garish, so unimaginative that it fails on so many levels. I saw in forums that Bagul was being compared to to Slenderman which was 10 times scarier. There is nothing scary about an entity with pale make-up (who seemed like The Crow and WWE's Kain had a lovechild) who just does nothing than be shown in random shots. Hell, Slenderman did a much better job just doing nothing! Over-rated, entirely predictable, vastly tasteless with vague characters and an uninteresting plot, Sinister is one movie you'd want to stay away from."

Ghastly. The story lacks integrity and leaves you dazed after a disjointed second half. Too many lingering horror shots, irrelevant scenes and pointless characters. What a shame.<br/><br/>The writers definitely gave up and went home after lunch."

","Sinister Trailer is scarier than the actual product!! 2/4 stars <br/><br/>I guess seeing this in the theatre up on the big screen would make this more scary then it was (I was privileged enough to see a home copy that was lent to me by a friend of mine who gets screeners sent to him) However that being said i would have to say over all the film itself was creepy but i guess i don't scare that easily as i only jumped once or twice (Unlike movies like the Paranormal films where you can find me plastered to the ceiling) the scariest thing about this flick was the soundtrack...plan on looking for a copy of this to buy and play on the next Halloween!<br/><br/>I also have to mention that the storyline here was one of the creepiest i have seen in a while... Ethan Hawke portrays true crime novelist Elison Oswalt who after having a run of bad books moves his family of 4 into a house that the former tenants also a family were hung from a tree (Elison finds the footage from this grisly murder along with other Super 8 murders in his attic) this spurs on his next writing project and gets caught up in watching the films that he has found for his homework. The more films he watches however the more supernatural activity keeps occurring in his new home.<br/><br/>The death of the family that lived there before is still being investigated as the daughter of the family has disappeared something Elison hopes to uncover whilst writing his next book. Investigating this crime puts his family at danger of course.<br/><br/>Overall a very creepy film however light on the scare factor in my opinion."

","My review will be short and sweet. The movie would have you believe that it is going to be scary....or thrilling...or good...it doesn't pay off, and it's none of these things. <br/><br/>It starts out as any ordinary thriller or horror movie would with an innocent family moving to a new place. New sights, kinda, a new house is all you see, you never get to see the town or anything else really. Basically, the story never truly develops or blossoms into what it's trying to be. As the movie progresses through the story you think that with all these kind of good reviews and the decent story mid way through, and pretty decent acting too that it's really going to pay off and its all gonna make sense...right? Sorry, it does go that far into fooling you though. By the time you get to the end scene you will see just how badly this movie actually unravels itself, comically too; it really is too bad because it did have a lot of potential. It just seems like they must have run into some budget problems or something. Skip it"
"Nibbler007","7","1","3","20 November 2012"," Not overrated, but close...
","I left the theater with mixed feelings. Reviews on IMDb blew my mind with comparisons (Insidious, one of my all time favourites) so I guess I gave Sinister a chance because of some good reviews. I'm not at all disappointed, but may be not the huge horror movie I expected to see.<br/><br/>The thing with Sinister is that you have this wonderful music composed by Christopher Young. Chilly as hell. The best soundtrack for a horror movie in a while. Music is a factor of fear by itself in Sinister. I liked the plot though it may be redundant and have not so many surprises. I liked Ethan Hawke at the final part of the movie. He portraits so good his character. In fact, it has some connections with The Shining in order to character development. One man who begins to freak out and loses his temper and calm with things occurring. His annoying wife, though, spoiled the entire movie. She's not the bond Ethan needs to continue with his obsession to find the killer of those families. <br/><br/>Nevertheless, Sinister has some good scare jumps, but lacks in gore. This was a movie which could've improved the path of Insidious. Of course, demons, haunted houses, but no James Wan. Neither gory scenes. But yes, good scares guaranteed. <br/><br/>It is pretty solid plot, I find no holes in it, but from time to time, situations on the movie become a little overexposed and boring. <br/><br/>We have a villain, people! Bagghul is badass, I liked the inventive on this issue: it becomes harder these days as horror movies go by, to create a menacing villain. This is the case, and that's a good point to mention. <br/><br/>But I'm not sure this is THE horror movie of the decade. It's a good one, better than many, but still a little clichéed and lacks in development of the villain and his awful methods as well as my hunger for gore and spectacularity was not fulfilled.<br/><br/>But it's still worth the watch. It is all-the-way tense (at least in Ethan's crime investigations and the eventual finding of Bagghul), but there were some scenes that conspired against perpetuating the tense feeling. Kind of relief scenes which could have been erased. Also, there is a lot of redundancy on common images and themes. C'mon, Bagghul! You could have killed some more families! And for those who ask; nothing to do with Saw.<br/><br/>I liked Sinister, don't say I didn't. It deserves a 7 out of 10. Excellent soundtrack, good plot, better acting, tense moments, a little naive snuff and scary jumps spreaded once in a while. It is a 7. <br/><br/>Cheers from Argentina!"
"Scrius","Null","1","3","19 November 2012"," Testifies that graphic violence is unnecessary to make a frightening ghost story.
","When it comes to the underside of modern cinema, the horror genre frequently falls victim, plagued by uninspired remakes and tiresome clichés. For some time it's been apparent that fresh original ideas are not easy to come by and I'm among the many that misses being scared. I attended a theatrical showing of Sinister with soaring expectations, prepared to be frightened once again, and left almost two hours later more satisfied than I've been in a long time. This supernatural movie is easily the most impressive of it's kind in recent years. Exorcism of Emily Rose director Scott Derrickson has demonstrated an effective ability to convey horror and understands how powerful atmosphere and suspense can be. Let's hope that he'll continue to give us more.<br/><br/>True crime novelist Ellison Oswalt (Ethan Hawke) sees great potential for his accomplishment of a lifetime in an unsolved murder that has taken place in the house that he and his family have moved into. His only lead, a mysterious box of Super 8 footage of the murder that has taken place in his new home as well as several other cases of unsolved family murders abroad, found in the attic. Oswalt's findings deduce two aspects that make a connection with each murder. A disappearance of one child in each family and a demonic apparition that appears somewhere in each film. The malevolent phenomenon of the movie is the Pagan deity Buhguul, who subsists on the souls of vulnerable children and resides in a netherworld to which images serve as a gateway for him. Even though Buhguul is silent and makes brief appearances, his presence is felt and feared throughout the movie and he is sure to find his way into your nightmares for a long while to come. The possibility of solving the mystery is opened thanks to the advantage of modernized technology. As the investigation unfolds, eerily evocative happenings begin happening to Oswalt's family. Against forces beyond his comprehension, Oswalt becomes torn between his goal of uncovering the truth and the well being of his loved ones. <br/><br/>Ethan Hawke is very believable in portraying his role. You feel his determination to uncover the truth and how much his job means to him. As he becomes more detached from his family so do we as an audience. He emphasizes a potential that I hope won't remain obscured. Palpable tension builds as the climax draws ever closer and the intensity is amplified by haunting visuals and Christopher Young's spine-chilling soundtrack. The blend of Super 8 footage with traditional cinematography gives Sinister a gritty down-to-earth feel, taking the viewers along for the experience. <br/><br/>I've long grown accustomed to foreseeing and identifying film clichés and predictable outcomes, especially in the horror genre, but to my great surprise I found myself frightened on both a conscious and subconscious level. Graphic violence and explicit bloodshed are not needed to make a ghost story scary and Sinister deserves to be admired in this respect. What greater horror can exist than the evil that defies our comprehension? To all my fellow avid fans of the horror genre that have thought about giving Sinister a watch, surrender to your temptation because a refreshing treat awaits you!"

","Ethan Hawke? Actor? Author? Director? What did he see in this? The first two thirds were really excellent. Lots of suspense, jolts, mystery and twists. I even bought the supernatural aspects of the plot. Then it got derivative, disappointing, and predictable. Ethan Hawke plays a writer looking for the next great story and moves his family into a home where a horrible crime occurred and a child disappeared. His kids start acting strange, he finds some old movies that depict possibly-related murders, he starts drinking and not sleeping, then discovers the attic full of vermin and more snuff films. The ending is telegraphed an hour before it happens, our hero's actions come too little, too late, and I'm bored just writing about it. Maybe a viewing on Netflix, but don't waste your money at the theater."
"Point-Blank","5","1","3","23 October 2012"," Horror is misunderstood these days
","True horror is defined in my opinion as to a combination of violence (if needed - it is not *required*), character development, drama, ambiance and overall disturbing factor. It provokes an emotional, psychological or physical response within the individual that causes viewers to react in fear, essentially. If any of these elements don't work - it's like any weak link to a chain. Sadly, over 95% of ""horror"" movies don't get these all right.<br/><br/>Of course, every one reacts differently to each movie - to different types of directing. The disturbing factor in viewers also depends of the way they were raised, what they went through in life which may of caused trauma to various extents, values and religion (if any). <br/><br/>This movie felt promising, but it wasn't. The violence was cut to a pg-13 level, the R rating was a fraud. The demon character was very interesting and intriguing, however it lost it's meaning throughout the movie - ending up being almost non-existent. The ""other side"" where the children were brought to was never explained or explored contrarily to Insidious. The jump scares were predictable and laughable. The demon had a promising history of cult religion - which again, was not explored enough."

I guess it really isn't that bad. If you love any type of horror movie, than this one is for you. But if you prefer a classic original(that is not promoted with the over commercialized hype of what terror ""should"" consist of), than you will want to watch another movie. All in all, if you want to watch something that is current and new, or you just simply waste time on a boring Sunday, than this could be entertaining. Who knows? You might even end up liking this movie. I can say one thing, it clearly has its predictable, downfall moments - but then it redeems itself with a few moments that justifies the reason you are or should watch this move.

","At first I went into this movie with low hopes, I mean seriously, it was produced by the same guy who produced Paranormal Activity (OK but not scary) and Insidious (one of the worst movies I can ever unsee which I finally decided must be a comedy). At the start of the movie it shows the previous family being hung from a tree behind their house, as seen in one of the many trailers. The story then switches to, and begins with, true crime author Ellison Oswalt (Hawke) and his family of course moving into said house to write his new book. Later he finds a box containing ""home videos"" in the attic and begins watching them which then unlocks Bughuul into the story, which uses photographs and videos as a gate way into our realm and creating some of the creepiest scenes I've seen in awhile. Bughuul is one of the best scary movie characters of all time and just can't get his face out of my head, especially when a photograph of Bughuul's face on Ellison's laptop turns to look at him and turns back to normal. The ending was also kind of messed up....OK, really messed up from what you can tell in a drawing near the end.<br/><br/>Now I love scary movies and horror films, not because they're scary or anything, but because i find them entertaining. It's been awhile since a movie has truly made me jump in my seat (recalling ""Mirrors' bathtub scene) more than once (about 4 to times to be exact) which places it on my top scary movie list.<br/><br/>If you're a person who loves scary movies with a few good, random laughs (despite the predictability) or just want to take your girlfriend (or boyfriend?) that scares easily, i would highly recommend this film. Also you must see this film in theaters. Can't beat seeing and hearing people scream during this film.<br/><br/>Overall 8/10"

","Ellison (Ethan Hawke) is a writer of true-life crime accounts, which explains why he moves his family (wife and two children) into a house where a mass murder took place. When he finds a box of super 8 movies in the loft, he watches them all even after seeing that the first one shows the murders which took place in this very house. Keen watchers of this sort of film will be expecting creepy occurrences and unexplained noises at this point and, sure enough, they arrive right on cue. Ellison clearly is not a keen watcher of this sort of film, because he not only ignores these unexplained phenomena, he digs deeper into the mystery. Run for the hills, Ellison, and take your family with you! <br/><br/>I'm not very good at spotting twists, wrinkles and the like, but this film held no surprises for me at all. In particular, I spotted the catch towards the end when it was telegraphed earlier on. But for all that, this is quite a good movie of its type. Without being loaded up with scares, it is pretty creepy all the way through, and it gets under way quickly and without excessive preamble. Ethan Hawke forms a solid centre in a movie which is very nearly a single-hander.<br/><br/>Moderately scary, and keeps you interested."

","I saw some trailers for this film and thought it looked interesting to try, and I saw positive reviews from critics, annoyed that I missed The Possession at the cinema (which also looked good) I wasn't going to miss this one, from director Scott Derrickson (The Exorcism of Emily Rose, The Day the Earth Stood Still). Basically the film opens as a Super 8 film seeing a family four with bags on their heads being hanged with rope nooses from a tree, and an unseen figure snaps the opposite trunk that is acting as a counter weight, sending them up and strangling them to death. Months later, struggling true-crime novel writer Ellison Oswalt (Ethan Hawke) has moved his family: wife Tracy (Juliet Rylance), young daughter Ashley (Clare Foley) and teenage son Trevor (Michael Hall D'Addario), who suffers night terrors, into this house where the murder occurred, he is hoping to write his next novel based on this horrific event, and the fact that a fifth member of the family went missing when it happened. While moving boxes into the attic Ellis comes across a box containing a projector and several reels of Super 8 film, each with innocent looking family home movie labels, and setting up the projector and a white sheet on the wall he decides to watch one the films. The film called Family Hanging Out '11 starts as just a normal innocent home movie with the family, but then he is shocked to see it change scene and show the murder of the family, being hanged (the film seen at the beginning) on screen. He watches the rest of the home movies one by one, and he is continually shocked by seeing other families murdered and their deaths caught on film, including Sleepy Time '98 seeing a family having their throats slit in bed, BBQ '79 seeing a family burned to death in arson in their car, Pool Party '66 seeing a family pulled into their pool to be drowned, and Lawn Work '86 seeing a family run over by a lawn mower. Ellis was originally going to report what he has found to the police, but he decides not to because he feels he could be on to both a winning book, and all the murders are surely connected, despite the distance of time the murders have occurred, and he keeps seeing a dark figure in each film that is most likely the killer. After seeing this dark figure the first time, after using his computer to edit and re-watch the footage, strange things start happening in the house, including noises coming from the attic, but he continues to investigate the films, and each one also contains a symbol painted in each murder scene, so he decides to get help from outsider sources for his research. A Deputy (James Ransone) helps him to find out where all of the murders caught on camera happened based on the years labelled, and he refers to college Professor Jonas (Vincent D'Onofrio) who has expertise on religion to decipher what the strange symbols mean, and he concludes that is to do with the Pagan deity named Bughuul who was known for eating children's souls, including killing a child and taking into a dark realm. One night Ellis hears the projector running in the attic, and investigating he sees five children watching one of the films, all of them are the missing children from the murders, and then Bughuul the demon appears and Ellis falls causing an injury to his ankle. He and Tracy have an argument that he is spending too much time trying to write his new novel and that the family could be in danger or moving into the house of a murder scene, but eventually he realises she is right and the situation is becoming too dangerous, so he burns the projector and films and gets the family packed and ready to move back. Having moved back into their old house Ellis is putting some boxes back, and he is shocked to see the projector and films intact in the box in the attic, but there is also a new film inside called Extended Endings, and when he watches it he sees all the murders again, but they follow with the missing child of the family coming on screen and revealing themselves as the murderers, before disappearing. After getting some more insight from Professor Jonas about the symbols and the Bughuul legend he is visited by the Deputy, who he has been ignoring calls from, he gives him the information that all the murdered families lives in the same house the last murder took place, meaning Ellis has put him and his family in danger as the pattern may continue. Feeling lightheaded Ellis made himself a cup of coffee, and he notices a strange liquid left in it, and he sees a note from his daughter before passing out, and when he wakes up he and his family are tied up and gagged together just like the families before them. Ashley walks in clutching the Super 8 film camera and an axe, she films as she murders her father, mother and brother, and paints the walls with images of unicorns, cats and dogs with their blood, and she watches the film back again where she also appears on screen, the other dead children appear but run away when Bugheel appears and takes Ashley into the film projection, and the last moment sees the box with the projector and films containing a film called House Painting '12 in the Oswalt attic. Also starring Fred Dalton Thompson as Sheriff and Victoria Leigh as Stephanie. Hawke gives a good performance as the man determined if not obsessed to get to the bottom of the crimes and write a successful book, the story is well paced and has a good amount of jumps and gripping moments, it is a good old fashioned scary movie, a terrific supernatural horror. Very good!"

And I like very much Ethan Hawke but I don't get the point in watching Ethan Hawke watching super 8 fake snuff movies, trying to write a book (he never writes anything, BTW), drinking and moving back home.<br/><br/>I found the plot quite childish, the most stupid and senseless thing is NOT answering the Deputy's calls until night, when it's too late.

","If you watched the beginning with the four people being hung from a tree after a branch is cut, you have seen the best part of this movie. It is slow, makes very little sense, you can follow it, but it is stupid. The killer shown in the films appears to have used the mask from the Saw movies. I don't remember who the killer is cause I stopped giving a crap. It was actually the missing kids for some stupid reason. Something to do with living in the same house as other murders. This movie is boring, if it wasn't for the few videos of the families being murdered it would have been completely unbearable. Watch it, you will probably like it. You probably have no idea what a good movie is."

","First of all, I wouldn't even call this a horror movie! When I first saw the trailer, I began making plans to see this movie in theaters. I convinced myself that I HAD to see it. So tonight, I finally watched it on DVD. It was one of the most long, boring movies I have ever seen. It didn't even make sense! It was extremely generic as far as what horror has become. It's always a family being haunted with NO originality. This movie is awful. The only reason I wrote the review is because I just found out that ""Sinister 2"" is in development! Are you kidding me?! The world didn't need ""Sinister"", why would we need ""Sinister 2""? Avoid this pathetic excuse for a film at all costs!"
"harryplinkett14","3","1","4","20 May 2013"," Illogical and dull
","The premise was a good one, but the execution was poor. The characters are not interesting, the story is convoluted, and the lack of logic almost renders it a parody. Who in their right mind would move into a house where a grotesque murder has taken place, and then continue living there after films of actual murders start appearing out of nowhere and demons start appearing in person? I am sorry, but I think the horror genre has reached a point where this kind of nonsense can no longer be tolerated. I cannot suspend my disbelief any more when faced with such incredible nonsense. <br/><br/>Another problem with this film is that it is too long. There simply isn't enough material here for a film that long and what we see is constant repetition of scenes which do not add anything to the story. Finally we have the obvious ending: the missing children committed the murders.<br/><br/>This film is completely unnecessary, adds nothing to the horror genre, and fails to utilize the potential of the idea about a demon who appears in home video. This story could have taken a much more original route, but instead the screenwriters chose to deliver this uninspired, dull, and predictable film which, as a matter of fact, isn't even particularly scary."

","It's called Sinister. That's a very generic title for a movie that doesn't have personality or anything new to say.

How convenient!<br/><br/>Most critics praise this film, and, frankly, I don't understand why. It did not scare me and everything was pretty predictable and sometimes even meaningless. How many horror films are set up when a good old family moves into a house and then we here the line ""This house has secrets"". Secrets are revealed in designed dosages using ""found footage"" as a devise to push the story forward, but this idea does not create the same ""suspension of disbelief"" of other films of the sort, because, basically, you see known actors there, so our brain won't let us believe.<br/><br/>It was directed with very formulaic solutions, and with no creativity at all. Just consider the numerous takes of Ethan loading the projector and watching the home movies... Even Paranormal Activities, with its minimalistic tricks caused more scares per minute than this."
"trnjamesbond","8","1","4","14 February 2013"," This film is Sinister!
","Scott Derrickson's Sinister gives us confusion with an old fashion detective twist. Ethan Hawke delivers a stellar performance in this latest title Sinister. <br/><br/>We start out this wonder macabre film with us witnessing a family getting hanged, then we move onto a family moving in to a new house where the hanging took place.<br/><br/>At first glance I thought this would be the traditional writer/detective style film, as we move along with Ethan Hawke's character I thought this is going to be one of those ""who done it?"" type films.<br/><br/>I was wrong, Ethan Hawke brings us through a dark portal where we don't know what is real or I should say unreality and not of this world. We all learn as the film moves on that this maybe a serial killer at work. But I just wondered throughout the film why in 1998, in which year one of the murders took place why this was being filmed on 8mm? I guess it was because that's when all these murders started, when most people had an 8mm video camera at their dispose starting in the 1960's, where all these murders began, or maybe it's because that's when home movies started to become popular. Your guess is as good as mine.<br/><br/>In this paranormal film I find there were plenty of scares, not really by the ghosts or demons, but by the dark atmosphere of the film, and also by it's strange sounding score, it also uses a lot of imagery to get that aspect across to it's audience. I really love this film, but in the same thought, it is a very dark psychological film. I have some mixed feelings, but all good feelings about the style of this film, it is a true noir horror, with a unhappy ending. Mr.Derricksons used a lot of old school camera technique's not really seen in new films. The dead children that appear had a mix of good make up and also great slow motion effects, which I haven't seen since the film ""The Cell"" It has an ending being positive or negative, it could go either way.<br/><br/>The only thing that annoyed me about this film is the very end when Mr. Boogie flashed in front of us before the credits rolled. I thought that was kind of immature for the director to do such a thing, it wasn't scary, and felt kind of cheap to try and squeeze in that one last scare. They should of left it as is, with the camera panning out on the box of ""Home Movies"", that would of been much classier. Overall a very entertaining watch."
"kletskeh","9","1","4","13 February 2013"," Underrated. For the true movie-lovers out there.
","I would initially rate this movie 8 out of 10, but I feel that it is underrated here on IMDb.<br/><br/>What really bothers is me is that many of the reviews I read on here about Sinister tell you that it's full of stereotypical scares, and a very predictable story that is not very interesting or innovating.<br/><br/>This is completely wrong, from my point of view. No idea why people found these scares in here so stereotypical. I think the writers of those reviews want you to believe it's got scares like a scream-o movie. Honestly, this movie didn't really have to rely on how good the sudden scares were, that popped up after some tension was built up like in the stereotypical horror movie. To me this was really a Thriller-horror movie, not like any other horror movies claim to be thrillers when it's really just a normal movie but with blood and random scary moments. The whole movie on itself was a scare. I felt like there was a constant tension and the only relief would be when it became day, and Ellison wasn't in his room watching tapes. No other movie has done this to me before.<br/><br/>They accomplished that constant tension by doing what most people hate, not really making the movie progress. As more stuff happens you get lured deeper into the mystery and the darkness of the story. You don't feel like you watched a great movie because it doesn't end with a culprit who has been identified, it doesn't lead to a point where the story progresses. In the last 20 minutes or so, everything rounds up and you can make your own end to this movie. The professor giving hints, this being confirmed when Mr. Boogie flashes into the tape at the end.<br/><br/>It's kind of a Debbie Downer watching this movie, it ends. And nothing ends. The story doesn't end, it goes on. And you've been told a story that doesn't have the stereotypical bad guy that gets arrested. Which was my original expectation, for the deputy to show up. Stop the girl or something. But since some supernatural with weird symbols etc happens as well, I guess I shouldn't have expected that deputy to save the day. Also about this supernatural stuff it leaves you questioning it throughout the whole movie. Is it the killer, boogie, in the house or is it some supernatural ghost-personality doing stuff.<br/><br/>Scariness: 8 / 10 (would give 7, but the constant tension really did catch me and I liked how I never really had this before) Storyline: 8,5 / 10 (I like the dark theme, having the viewer to question things himself) Acting: 8,5 / 10 (No remarks, good acting)<br/><br/>This sums up to a total score of roughly 8,5/10 but I feel like giving a score between 8 and 9 for a movie is very high, so I would go for 8 maximum. Even though this movie was one of the best I had seen in a while. I then went for the 9 / 10 because it's underrated on here (6,7/10 if I remember correctly).<br/><br/>Hope this was helpful, critics won't enjoy this movie as much. Movie- lovers will."
"Convictions","8","1","4","13 February 2013"," Proves that there's still life left in the found footage genre
","Ever since Cloverfield and Paranormal Activity the found footage genre has boomed. Now there seems to be more coming out than ever, so the freshness of it has worn off sort of like 3-D. For every 10 bad found footage films there's one good one like Sinister, which is why I now actively avoid found footage films. Sinister isn't shot from a first person style of shooting that we've grown accustomed to with most movies within the found footage genre, which is a good thing because I've grown so sick of the gimmick.<br/><br/>I will admit that I was letdown a bit. Maybe because the trailers promised so much more or maybe because they showed too much. Whichever the case, if you haven't seen the trailer don't watch it as it gives away some of the scares. Then we also have people doing some dumb things that we wouldn't normally do, like trying to find something in the dark instead of turning on the lights or not leaving the house right away. Once you accept these things however, the movie will become much more enjoyable.<br/><br/>Sinister didn't scare me as much as Insidious did, but that doesn't mean there aren't any scares. The videos are disturbing with one of them involving a lawnmower that has forever traumatized me. Kudos to the filmmakers. The ""Boo!"" scenes, which are plentiful aren't as cheap as you would normally find in recent horror movies. They stick with you way after the credits roll. Of course these things wouldn't have worked without atmosphere and mood which Sinister establishes effectively with the videos and the house which is creepy.<br/><br/>The acting is better than what you'd normally find in a horror movie. Ethan Hawke is effective as the ""everyman"", he's believable and he shares nice chemistry with his female co-star Juliet Rylance who plays his wife. They make a nice couple and we believe that they're husband and wife. The kids do nice jobs too and didn't manage to annoy the crap out of me. James Ransone who plays the deputy that helps Hawke with his investigation is nice as the comic relief. As for everyone else, they don't do much and are barely in the movie but, they were good nonetheless.<br/><br/>Then there's the ending, this is where most horror movies have the biggest problem. While I thought the ending was good, some of you may be disappointed. Yes there is a twist, but it was more obvious to me than I wanted it to be. I still liked it anyway, the same cannot be said for everyone else.<br/><br/>The other thing with horror movies is sound. The music in Sinister is perfect and adds another layer of creepiness to each scene and it adds that extra punch to the ""Boo!"" moments giving them a longer lasting effect. The make up for the creature is well-done, he's just downright terrifying and doesn't resemble anything out there(that was one of the problems with Insidious). The make-up for the children too is good making them seem more creepy than they really are.<br/><br/>Overall, though this is a good movie I was a tad disappointed as I expected more from what I saw in the previews. The character's do some pretty dumb things that you see in almost every horror movie but, it's more easily forgivable here and if you let it go you'll find yourself enjoying this movie more. 2012 we saw a lot of found footage movies some good to great (Vhs/The Bay/Chronicle) and some pretty terrible ones (Project X, The Devil Inside). Sinister belongs in the former category, it may have not been the best found footage movie of 2012 but, it can take it's rightful crown as the best horror movie of 2012."

","Everyone has their own opinion of what a horror film should be and what elements make a horror film good... In my opinion, I believe simplicity is the key to something that will scare the crap out of you. This movie has that very simplistic approach. The violence and horror of the atrocities isn't really in your face with this film. A lot of what's going on is really implied. So if you're expecting gore and that's what gets you ramped then you're probably not going to like this. Ethan Hawke is a True Crime writer in the film and being the husband of a psychologist... I've seen a lot of true crime documentaries, TV shows and have read a lot of true crime novels... The horror in what people REALLY do is scarier than any boogie man, monster, demon, etc... Hopefully this isn't a spoiler for anyone but I'll note it is possible this needs a spoiler alert. Beyond the true crime portion there is a character in the film that is supernatural? So that part is a little different but before you figure that part out everything is very real. The score is great and plays a big part as well and you should watch this movie with a good sound system to include a sub-woofer. If you're watching in on a TV with 3"" speakers then you're not going to get the full effect. There are a lot of different ingredients to a good horror film and I hope that if you're actually into horror films you do it right and watch it in pitch black darkness with a good size television, great sound system and only a few people in the room. Otherwise you're going to be just some random person with an opinion. I value horror films and I take it seriously."

This may seem like a boring plot but thanks to the 8mm films, that really help a lot in creating the creepy feeling. Some criticize that Bughuul(the evil)should have noticed that there is something called digital camera may be? well, what's the point then? It's the 8mm film that makes it so horrible and creepy. Of course you can always make it digital but that would not be so shocking visually. And I love the scrambled images when playing the 8mm films, that's why it's so creepy.<br/><br/>I thought it was a killer movie but when Mr Boogie moves his head in the screen, I was like: really? supernatural? ghost? creepy masked man? come on!! I used to think that all the ghost type of movies are bad. They are either too fake or totally meaningless. But Sinister is surprisingly good in such genre.<br/><br/>What I mean good is not referring to the scary look of the boogie man or the way how people are killed. It's actually about investigation of the crimes. The boogie man isn't even the main character in the story, but once you see his face like you can never forget it until the movie is finished. And by the time the writer learns more about the crimes, the closer he puts his family and himself to the dead end.<br/><br/>One thing I don't like about this film is that the time for the writer walking in corridors is too long. Too many unnecessary scenes for him to get up at midnight checking out who opens the film player. But I do love the ghost creeping around in his house, that terrifies me.<br/><br/>After all it is a very surprisingly good movie about supernatural, I would definitely recommend to those who love horror movies, trust me, it's worth-watching."

I'm sure there is a reason why such plot device occupies such a preponderant place in Hollywood imagery or subconsciousness, but I any theory at this point would be speculative.<br/><br/>Other than that, this is a mix of pretty much everything we've seen in horror for the last forty years, especially films such as The Ring.

I went into the cinema to watch Sinister expecting the exact same as the rest; but this was different; a rather original, enticing story with very good execution from the actors - needless to say very little scares me, but after this rather sinister film I found myself the next couple of nights refraining from getting out of bed to go to the toilet.

"zardoz-13","8","1","4","16 October 2012"," ""Sinister"" Will Make U Scream!
","""Sinister"" qualifies as both spooky as well as scary. This clearly superior but derivative haunted house chiller lives up to its atmospheric title. Merriam-Webster defines the adjective 'sinister' as ""singularly evil or productive of evil."" Furthermore, the dictionary adds 'sinister' portends either misfortune or tragedy. Not surprisingly, ""Sinister"" wallows in misfortune and tragedy. Alas, too many horror pictures promise more blood, sweat, and screams than they deliver with similar titular adjectives. Fortunately, ""Sinister"" serves as the exception to this cliché. Writer/director Scott Derrickson and rookie writer C. Robert Cargill have conjured up a genuinely spine-chilling spectacle with found footage that will keep you on the edge of your seat for most of its 109 minutes. You might anticipate some of the scares, but you won't be prepared for the cacophony of sound effects that accompanies each and is calculated to make lesser souls shriek. Squeamish film goers would do well to shun ""Sinister."" Derrickson has staged four disturbing scenes that unfold individually as smaller films within the film. Actually, these scenes constitute little more than snuff movies. Strictly based on these unsavory moments, ""Sinister"" amounts to far more than just sinister. Sick might be a more appropriate adjective.<br/><br/>Oscar-nominated Ethan Hawke of ""Training Day"" toplines this enigmatic, bump-in-the-night nail biter with a sure-footed supporting cast that features Fred Dalton Thompson and Vincent D'Onofrio. Ostensibly, the plot concerns a bestselling true-crime author determined to duplicate an earlier literary success. Ellison Oswalt (Ethan Hawke) hasn't written a bestseller in about a decade, but he believes he has found the right stuff to write about in a sleepy Pennsylvania town. Four macabre murders where three family members perished in cold blood while an adolescent was abducted obsess this down-on-his-luck writer. Oswalt assures his wife, Tracy (Juliet Rylance of ""Animal""), that this project could be the equivalent of what ""In Cold Blood"" was for Truman Capote. The County Sheriff (Fred Dalton Thompson of ""Die Hard 2"") wants nothing to do with Oswalt. He abhors the way the author has treated law enforcement in his tomes. Meantime, one of his deputies (James Ransone of ""Inside Man"") eagerly wants to help Oswalt so the author will acknowledge his contribution in print.<br/><br/>Strange things begin to occur not long after Oswalt and his family move into their new house. Nothing about the house looks ominous. Oswalt discovers a box of Super 8 films with a projector hidden in the attic. He watches these gruesome little films and starts hitting the bottle. Oswalt's son Trevor (Michael Hall D'Addario of ""People Like Us"") has relapses of nightmares or what his parents refer to as 'night terrors' that they thought he had out-grown. Trevor learns about the murders and paints a picture of them at his new school. Naturally, Tracy isn't happy about this incident. Later, while he is prowling around in the attic, Oswalt crashes through the ceiling and injures his leg. Eventually, he breaks down and informs long suffering Tracy that they are living in the same house where the previous family was hanged from a tree in the backyard and their daughter disappeared without a trace. Tracy becomes hysterical and demands that they leave. Now, Oswalt begins to have second thoughts, especially when he finds extended cuts of the very same films that he incinerated. They cannot pack up soon enough to get out of town. Nevertheless, trouble follows them.<br/><br/>Along the way, Derrickson and Cargill conjure up a devilish ghoul named Bughuul. This elusive demon behaves like Freddy Kruger with his razor-blade-tipped fingers, and Bughuul (stunt man Nicolas King of ""The Green Hornet"") lurks on the periphery of the murders in each small film. Somehow, Bughuul can migrate between the real world and the cinematic world without any problems and wreck havoc. The filmmakers give him a face that resembles the creepy doll in the ""Saw"" film franchise. Apparently, Bughuul—otherwise known by the kids as Mr. Boogie—exerts a hypnotic influence over children and can convince them do his bidding. If Derrickson and Cargill play their cards correctly, they could parlay a franchise out of this frightening film that combines elements of Stanley Kubrick's ""The Shining"" with Jack Nicholson and the snuff saga ""8MM"" with Nicolas Cage. Homages to classics such as ""Blow-Up,"" ""Manhunter,"" ""Saw,"" ""Jeepers Creepers,"" show up. ""Indisputably, ""Sinister"" ranks as Derrickson at the top of his game after previous outing such as the tedious ""Exorcism of Emily Rose"" and the anemic remake ""The Day the Earth Stood Still."" Derrickson manages to make even ordinary action, like threading up a film projector, appear suspenseful. Unfortunately, despite its marvelously menacing aura, ""Sinister"" keeps Mr. Boogie confined to the periphery so Oswalt and he never have a face-to-face confrontation."

","Sinister review<br/><br/>It's almost Halloween. I know this not because I looked at a calendar this morning, but because I checked the showings at my local cinema. Frankenweenie, Paranorman, Paranormal activity 4 and my choice for Saturday night, Sinister. From director Scott Derrickson, his first after 4 years since the poor 'The Day the Earth Stood Still' remake, he has a lot to prove with his latest foray into the horror genre.<br/><br/>And from the film's opening shot, super 8 footage of a family of 4 being hanged from a tree in their backyard, Sinister begins as grimly as it means to go on. Focusing on true crime writer Ellison Oswalt (Ethan Hawke) and his family. Things begin innocuously enough, he moves into his new home in a new town so he can attempt to write his next big hit, as well as solve mystery of a missing girl Stephanie, the 5th member of the family we see in the film's opening. It seems that Ellison likes to move as close as possible to crime scenes, as in his garden is the tree used to hang the family we saw in the opening shot. From here, Sinister throws everything from bumps in the night, malevolent spirits and some very grisly violence at its audience in its almost desperate attempt to generate scares.<br/><br/>And the thing is it does. If based solely on the originality of its content, Sinister could and should be thrown of the scrap heap with most of the horror offerings from the past 10 years. Predictable doesn't begin to describe it. False scares, people tripping, strange figures that lurk so obviously in photos that it's a wonder they've never been noticed . But for its lack on original ideas, Derrickson does a good job of pacing his film efficiently, giving enough family themed lowdown to balance out the blood chilling scares. After finding a box of 'home movies' in the otherwise empty attic of this new home (where else would they be?) they reveal the horrific murders of other families, with each family having one survivor, the youngest child, who promptly goes missing. <br/><br/>The plot development happens almost exclusively in these tapes as Ellison watches and re watches them, hunting for clues. Without wanting to spoil proceeding too much, the evidence that Ellison gathers takes the film in a different direction than previously implied, and this change hurts the film dramatically. It becomes less psychological and threatening, but the trade-off is an increase in scares, both quality and quantity. These scares do little to get inside your head and creep you out, but capitalise of the tension that Derrickson builds up so well with decent camera work and pulse pounding music. The second half of sinister features a plethora of scary faces, screaming heads and creepy, half decayed children lurking in the shadows. It's a real waste that some of the jumps are telegraphed to the point where you can see events 2 minutes before they happen. Yes, the attic isn't the best place to go at 3am in the morning, ever. <br/><br/>It's this stupidity from the characters that lowers the quality of sinister yet another degree. Why creep round a darkened house with a torch when it's sunny outside and you could just open the curtains? If the attic steps suddenly descend from the ceiling, don't go up there. And if the masked serial killer committed all of the murders in the tapes left in your attic appears in your garden; don't exit your house to 'investigate'. These aren't crimes that are exclusive to Sinister, if characters were smart in horror films the genre would probably die, but here it sure as hell damaged my enjoyment of the film. <br/><br/>It has a myriad of flaws, its predictable, cheap and wont haunt your dreams like it should, but sinister almost effortlessly generates the scares that horror junkies so badly crave. It's nothing that you probably haven't seen before, but sinister is worth its weight in screams. 5"

This year is no different as we have our big horror sequel of the year Paranormal Activity 4 and Silent Hill Revelation which is a follow-up to 2006′s video game adaption.Sinister appears to be a movie that hearkens itself more to the idea of the first Saw or Insidious in the sense that it is trying to make something low key and more creative than a studio horror movie.

","...but it was by no means bad. I have seen well over two hundred horror movies, so I have seen it all from the mild to grotesque. Perhaps I am a bit desensitized, but I was not the only person in the audience who walked away completely unshaken. This movie is not scary. It is, however, a very well done thriller. Do not go in expecting a horror movie, because you will be disappointed. However, be prepared to witness a well constructed story with some imagery that will stick with you for a while. <br/><br/>The main problem I had with this movie was that the villain - a demon named Bagul - was scary to look at but did little to nothing as far as violent action was concerned. He orchestrated everything, but I found him to be much less scary of a character because you didn't even really need to see him and the movie would have reached the same means to an end as it did. It is one thing to make a character look terrifying, but unless he or she follows through with actions that back up their appearance I feel like a lot is lost. <br/><br/>That being said, every one of the recorded murders were difficult to watch. Although a lot was implied (only showing blood in one case) there was enough to go on that you knew the families met a horrible demise. I do not want to give anything away, but the look of terror in one of the victim's faces on the lawn is not one I will soon forget. The visuals were very effective and the characters were all there, but for some reason I felt like it never ""clicked."" <br/><br/>I would highly recommend seeing it if you want to get in the Halloween spirit and feel uncomfortable for an evening, but if you want to watch a truly shocking movie I have a whole list of ones available on Netflix instant streaming that are a lot scarier."

","Ellison (Ethan Hawke) is a writer who follows unsolved crime stories and writes books investigating them himself. He had a bestseller ten years ago called ""Kentucky Blood"" but hasn't had a hit since. So he moves his family into a new home where the family occupying the house had been murdered with the exception of a little girl, who was missing. Desperate for another hit book and buried under pressure from his unknowing and un-patient wife, Ellison works diligently to solve the case of the missing little girl for his new book. After coming across a box of videos in the attic of the family that was murdered he realizes he may be opening a door to something he won't be able to walk away from.<br/><br/>Ethan Hawke delivers a performance we aren't used to in horror films. He plays a character not sure of his own true motives. He wonders whether he is putting his family through this to save a missing child or to prove he can write a great book after his last several have failed. He closes himself off from his family out of obsession with the book yet never goes off the deep end. He is reserved and does a great job showing his inner turmoil using subtle facial expressions and line delivery rather than going off the deep end and overacting. You can sense his fear without being told about it. It's a refreshing performance for a genre not known for its acting. Especially since for the majority of the film he's the only one on screen.<br/><br/>Most of the horror in Sinister comes from the found footage video reels we view alongside Ellison. They document several terrible incidents; one in particular involving a lawn mower that is extremely unsettling. A lot of the other scenes meant to frighten though are much less original and less disturbing. Even with the slow burning suspense of the film; the ending scene comes fast and is slightly disappointing. It always felt as though the scares could have been taken a step further. <br/><br/>Sinister has a nice platform to tell a horror story and a capable actor in a role that fits him perfectly. At times the slow pace is perfectly suspenseful, leading us to believe we are in for an emotionally scarring climax (in a good way). At other times it had me rolling my eyes as plot lines were re-enforced over and over again (We get it, he needs a new bestseller!) and left me wondering if the film had enough time left after an hour and fifteen minutes passed to truly frighten. The footage Ellison finds delivers a lot of extremely eerie sequences but when the horror begins to occur in real time Sinister loses its originality and feels like a different film entirely. <br/><br/>The whole story and feel of the film though is pleasantly creepy and it's ultimately a well-made horror film that unfortunately falls short of being as memorable or frightening as I'd hoped. It may not have been as scary as I would have liked, but it is a good film that happens to be horror. That's rare enough to appreciate a little. 7/10"
"airsnob","9","1","5","28 April 2014"," People are crazy that didn't like this movie.
","This is the epitome of a great horror film for me. Unlike the blood, guts and sadistic torture film fare that horror fans consider worthy of high ratings, this film has a story ( that's complex, creepy and smart for a horror movie) this movie has good acting. ( to the people that said the acting is bad- what planet are you from? ) this movie has a awesome soundtrack that is about as creepy and unnerving a music score as I've ever heard) this movie sticks you with a really bad feeling. And it's not from thoughtless slasher gore and bouncy fake boobs. This movie picks at happy scabs and let's them bleed. It really has some outrageous scenes , that are just awful. But amazingly they are done in good taste. If that is even possible. I wouldn't watch this film if you like happy feel good movies , or even light ghost stories. This movie is for people that don't mind having to watch a sitcom after to cleanse their brains of the memories of it. It is one of those films that makes you feel funny. In a bad way . Great story idea. Great script. The only crappy part of this film was the dumb cop. He must have been related to someone. Fortunately, the movie is too good to be ruined. Great atmosphere, great scare. This is a movie that I saw in theaters and no one said a word. No one laughed. No one moved. It is the only horror movie I have ever seen in a theater that wasn't completely ruined by the idiots in the audience. I think it even shut them up. Which is all good. Don't listen to the people giving it bad reviews. I hate the Saw films and Texas Chainsaw garbage. Since when did that trash become horror? It has to be smart enough to actually scare you. You have to be able to believe it , no matter how ludicrous the premise. Not just gross you out to death, or insult your intelligence with a horrific rape or mutilation scene, that makes you doubt your faith in humanity. ( I mean , really?) This has plenty of gore, don't get me wrong, it's just not pointless. And it isn't to shock me, or gross me out. Trust me. It will take you at least an hour to shake it off. Unless of course, you're a Saw/ Spit on your Grave fan. You probably got confused by it instead."

","Ethan Hawke is crime writer Ellison Oswalt. It's been 10 years since his breakout hit. He has moved his whole family into a murder house intending to write his new book on. The old family had all been hung in the old tree in the backyard, but the family's young daughter went missing. Strange things keep happening in the house. For example, he finds some 8mm snuff films in the attic, and discover there may be other related murders.<br/><br/>Ethan Hawke is rock solid in driving this movie. This is all his movie. The atmosphere is amazing. If there's anything they desperately needed, it's some better supporting characters. The wife, the kids, the bumpkin young cop, they are all stock characters done by unknown actors. There're no standouts in those areas. The movie works from the creepy atmosphere that builds and builds."

Don't get me wrong, I love slow pace detective sorta movie, I'm not the kind that only into mindless action/gory so that's not the reason why I think this movie is bad. The fact that they make the movie seems like there will be an actual smart explanation to the mystery is what makes it very disappointing. The beginning show some potential, it actually makes me wanna follow the main character in his quest to finds out the truth on what actually happened to the families and who was the killer. But then, like any bad movie, after piling up all the questions, making us wait for answers (and even make me do some thinking and speculation there), it just dump a very typical ghost story at the end. The ending won't be as disappointing if they removed the detective ""feel"" in the movie and just make it a mindless ghost/spooky action like Insidious."

I'm not familiar with the critics the filmmaker wrote, but one thing is for sure: He did make notes and obeyed them, which resulted in a pretty good movie.<br/><br/>Of course Ethan Hawke playing the main character is helping a lot. But the dialog and the story as it moves forward is really good. There are still things you could argue might feel wrong or some smaller flaws in the story (that might not make too much sense under the microscope). Still a very good movie, with enough good solid scares, that actually makes sense overall. I'd call this a comeback after the terrible Keanu R. movie he made prior to this.

","Ellison(Hawke, in a great performance, really capturing his increasing obsession; a flawed, yet ultimately sympathetic lead, who makes mistakes we can understand) is an author of true crime novels, and he moves to a house(and the dynamics and relationships between him and his wife and their two kids(who are capable actors... everyone in this is)... a good balance is struck between cute and dysfunctional) where a family was killed and the daughter went missing to research a new one. In the attic, he finds several Super 8 reels, and as he watches them, he finds that they feature increasingly stalkery shots of families - at first quaint and sweet, then warping into snuff films of them being murdered(one of numerous examples in this of the comfortable and innocent being perverted into something deeply disturbing and haunting... you won't be able to sleep after seeing this), the fact that he continues putting them on dealing with the theme of voyeurism - his, and ours, as we remain in the theatre seats, in spite of what we see. This is extremely effective. Even when you can see it coming, or when it's occasionally a jumpscare, the scares work. It's immensely atmospheric, gradually building(worth your patience) throughout this, until its unforgettable climax. I found it reminiscent of 80's John Carpenter... my friend compared it to Prince of Darkness, which I agree with completely. The mercilessly dark lighting(even when they're having breakfast... they do mention still owning the old house, I guess they want to save money on electricity), the intricately done sound design(creaky floor-boards, tree branches, etc.), the isolation and claustrophobia brought on by the whole thing taking place in this one house(the first thing you see is them moving into it), never leaving it - all of it results in an eerie mood, with the many creepy sights and sounds terrifying you. The humor brings much needed relief, being natural and coming out of real situations. Fred Thompson is his brand of awesome as the sheriff. Every character is credible, even though some of them at first seem like they'll be a pointless stereotype. Dialog is fine, if exposition is sometimes delivered with all the subtlety of a hammer. This doesn't avoid every expected cliché, however, it offers enough to make up for it. There is a bit of brutal, bloody violence(not all of it graphic, but always sickening imagery) and a little moderate to strong language in this. I highly recommend this to any fan of horror - this is a very positive detour from the modern downfall of the genre. 8/10"

","Sinister
2012
Dir.: Scott Derrickson
Starring: Ethan Hawke, James Ransone<br/><br/>10 *s out of 10<br/><br/>This fairly low-budget horror is an insta-classic from Blumhouse Productions, and is a perfect example of how a straight, commercial, mainstream horror film should be executed these days; although, for as commercial as it is, it's actually quite surreal, edgy, and nightmarish, with this successful streak of ""arthouse"" running entirely throughout the picture, totally gelling with all the mainstream tendencies. The soundscore is especially noteworthy for being just about as creepy as they can possible come; furthermore, Ethan Hawke and the rest of cast are as convincing as can be, including the children who are (gratefully) not annoying and damn decent ... The clichés are pretty endless, but are supposed to be there, and they are played on with taste, nuance, balance, and a never-ending, unnerving sense of dread that doesn't ever slip away from the corners of the frames; at times the viewer feels as if the subject-matter has never even been approached before, although there's now been hundreds (maybe) of horror films of this general nature .. it feels that fresh, yes.<br/><br/>What I love here more than anything, and what I believe makes this a ""real film"" and not just a typical ""B-horror"", is the fact that the images, as well as the skin-curdling soundscore, tell the story, instead of the usual poor writing, poor dialogue, embarrassing twists, etc, that these types of films typically fall victim to .. Derrickson allows for the mise-en-scene to drive the film and deliver it home; nothing feels spoon-fed, contrived, including the last act, which is, like most of the film, brilliant because of what it doesn't say.<br/><br/>10 *s out of 10"

The movie is about a writer who writes true crime stories and moves to a house where there was a murder of the family who lived in there apart from one of the children. He finds some home footage of 5 different murders and begins to try to piece everything together.<br/><br/>The main problems with this film for me is the tension and scare factor, not once did I feel uncomfortable or on edge and even when the jumpscares came on I didn't really get much from it because i was expecting it. The son of Ellison the main character has these night terrors and they dont really serve a purpose other than to scare you with jumpscares. I feel like the acting particularly when the family would converse with each other felt really forced and fake and dont even get me started on ellisons wife i dont know if its just the way she speaks or if shes doing that on purpose but she is easily the weakest actress in the movie. The ghost children werent very scary and neither was the main villain, I'll admit i genuinely was interested in the pagan deity despite it being quite cliché and despite being called the: ""eater of children."" Which made me laugh, I do quite like the idea of worshipping or being a slave to some demon that makes you kill in their name as I feel like you can really build any kind of character from that. A good example of a movie that does that well is red dragon the hannibal lecter film in which we see the killer, Francis struggle when the voice in his head/demon tells him to kill a woman who he has come to love and it pains him that he has to kill her to please the voice.<br/><br/>The film had good shots a lot of the time and i really liked how the filmed footage was shot but other than that i was really bored and dissapointed i wouldnt reccomend this to anyone if you want to be scared and I am surprised how much praise it has gotten."

"daniele-iannarelli","4","0","2","10 February 2019"," Usual clichés, different wrapping...
","From the beginning, this movie (basically a 'murder-mystery', rather than a 'horror') employs the somewhat overused, although effective, technique of a menacing, low-vibrational ambient background soundtrack rumbling. This is designed to stimulate the innate, ancient primeval sense of fear and foreboding in the viewer, thereby enhancing susceptibility to sudden scares etc. Although this thriller movie technique is used way too often these days, it is still strangely effective.<br/><br/>The trouble with this type of film is that the director and writer, more often than not, go overboard with effects. This movie is not much different in this respect. Ghost children appearing full-apparition and in glorious 'Technicolor' is an example of how this film's audience is similarly patronisingly treated, with the statutory 'jump' moments scattered in like herbs into a pot of soup.<br/><br/>As for the characters, Ellison Oswalt (played by Ethan Hawke) is simply Ethan Hawke playing Ethan Hawke in another 'groundhog day' role, not good nor bad but... simply 'okay'.<br/><br/>The deputy (played by James Ransone) is the most unbelievable character in the film. He, supposedly, holds a degree in Criminology and a stack of forensic courses under his belt, and yet is portrayed as - almost - retarded, or simply an imbecile! Just doesn't make sense.<br/><br/>There is a point in the film in which the young daughter wall-paints a picture of a similarly young girl sitting on a makeshift 'swing' (a tyre slung from a tree). Now, if this young girl painter *that*, then she must've an art-prodigy...! Perhaps the next art-equivalent genius to Mozart, and yet... the parents don't bat an eyelid in surprise as to the quality of it (simply too good for a girl of that age).<br/><br/>The Oswalt family complains about their lack of money, that they're not very well off. However, they seem to be moving from house to house with no worries at all. Within the final half-hour they move to an even bigger house (like a mansion)... and yet they complain about being lacking financially. If they rent/lease, this last move gives no indication of completing rental payment for the previous one. If the previous house was bought, there's no indication of selling it before moving. The writing does not fit the proposed storyline.<br/><br/>As I said at the beginning, this film is NOT a 'horror' (whatever that word really means)... it is a murder-mystery thriller with some supernatural elements and a sympathetic policeman (portrayed as somewhat thick) slung in for good measure.<br/><br/>Nor is this film 'scary''. Yes, there are the usual 'jumps' (including a corny final one), but does not compare in the least with any of the classics.<br/><br/>This is a mediocre hotch-potch of the usual slow and plodding stuff."

"Matt345","Null","0","2","19 January 2018"," Scary but with annoying and silly elements
","This movie was mentioned in a list of recommended scary movies. I guess this movie is quite scary, and also quite sinister, and while I would commend its little use of jump-scares, I would say it makes an even greater sin: trying to make things scary by loud sound effects and music. While those are themselves conceptually and technically commendable, I find it an equally annoying and silly tactic. Speaking of silly, the film's ""boogeyman"" looks just like some ""evil"" metal band member in face-paint. Which I find ridiculous. At least one sees him rarely and there are some other alteration-effects to his look.<br/><br/>The plot contains some baffling elements, and the protagonist unfortunately, while at first seeming relatively intelligent, turns out to be quite a douche, in a gratuitous way. A scene where we see him in an old TV-interview (he's a True Crime writer) is almost like a parody-sketch of an interview. The plot is generally unexplained and things ""just happen"" from a day-to-day-basis, which makes the plot feel somewhat unconnected. Maybe to some extent this is deliberate, however the premise and other things could still require more explanation. E.g. of how the writer is in possession of all his research material, which no-one else seems to have seen (although he is not a very secretive person either), and he himself seems kind of slow and indulgent in getting through. Assuming to be able to solve a crime by just watching all the ritualistic murder videos seems also fairly contrived.<br/><br/>A minor but consistent element of bafflement, and attempt to make things more scary, was that the protagonist, who almost always works at night, always leaves the lights out when he wanders around the house following some strange sounds, presumably to be more thoroughly surprised when he finds something or someone (it is otherwise pointless)."

","I enjoyed 'Sinister 2' so made the move to watch its prequel – to find I'd actually seen it before and had forgotten. I'm not sure what that says about me or the film. It doesn't avoid what the sequel managed to avoid – the curse of the bratty kid. In fact, both children belonging to Ethan Hawke's Ellison Oswalt are pretty obnoxious at times. As Bad Things happen, the children become more precocious. This is a difficult problem, and one that can actually ruin a film for me. Troubled children don't have to be petulant, do they? Luckily, they don't go on to play a huge part in the story.<br/><br/>Earning him the chagrin of the local constabulary, Oswalt moves into the house where previously, gruesome murders have taken place. Unfortunately, his wife and offspring are not told about this history. He has moved himself and the family here so he can research the horrific incidents for a book he is writing. He also finds an ally in Deputy 'So & So' (James Ransone), who is the one cast member to appear in the sequel.<br/><br/>'Sinister' is a fairly routine haunted house horror a couple of notches above the usual 'family in peril' fare, lifted by the performances of Hawke and Juliet Rylance as his English-but-American-speaking wife Tracy. It is somewhat overlong and slow-moving, but I don't really have a problem with that. Oswalt trips down the familiar path of encroaching obsession and insanity, a descent sprinkled with the occasional ghost-faced child. The main villain, the Gothic and spectral Bughuul, makes a fleeting appearance and is pretty menacing, making me wonder why the character isn't used more.<br/><br/>I actually prefer the sequel. The production seems tighter and less traditional, as recompense for a lack of a 'name' lead. Both films have notable musical soundtracks; this deliciously dark OST is by Christopher Young."

","What's up with the lighting throughout? This family lives like bats. What kind of family with little kids eats dinner with only the table gathering lit? Everything around them is pitch black. The dad keeps searching the house in the dark and the little girl, early on, searches for the bathroom in the pitch black, then tells him she can't find it. Gee, I wonder why. No little girl would even begin to that without light on. Even at the end, back at their real house, he's working at his desk in the dark. It's apparently awfully hard in this movie for lights/lamps to light up a room; it's like reflection doesn't exist. And a cop wouldn't just so happening to be camped on the side of a countryside road in the wee hours of the morning in the middle of nowhere. Also, the mom repeatedly yells at the dad about living there being a bad idea and that they should leave, and then when the dad finally tells her she's right when burning the films, she's curious as to why, telling him he's scaring her. Very annoying. And typical. At the very end, what the deputy explains to the dad over the phone after some research shouldn't've been a shock because that's what the dad realized about halfway through as he abruptly hung up."

","Original ideas in horror are hard to come by given the nature of the genre. The fans all want to be scared, some want blood and gore, and do we ever really want to see a happy ending? The idea behind Sinster was simple, lets give fans a little bit of everything and see how they react. Seeking peace and solitude, real crime writer, Ellison Oswalt (Ethan Hawke), moves his family to the country, unaware that the house he's living in has a checkered past. That is until he finds an old movie projector with 8mm films, that will horrify the man to his core. Having children as the perpetrators of these crimes was my favorite part of the film, I love it when horror movies do that, because what could be scarier than an evil child. You take the most innocent thing in the world, turn it evil, and once that happens what can you do about it? Would you be able to shoot a kid? So how do you stop them? The idea is bone chilling. I also liked the fact that they touch on every aspect of the genre they could from ghosts to possession, from gore to jump scares, they really did include a lot. The problem however is that the film focuses on Ethan Hawke, who tries to shield his family from what's happening, while investigating the events on his own, and this makes the time in between events move at a snails pace. With so much going for it, this is a movie that should have a lot going on, not long periods of nothingness. Personally I'd like to see the story focus on a child and watch as he/she transforms into one of the kids in the 8mm films, that would be cool. For what it's worth, this wasn't a bad film, the cast was pretty good, and they did a lot with what they had, but ultimately Sinister just moved a little too slowly for me."

Any supernatural aspect to this need to be sold to the audience. This movie totally fails selling the basic premise of the story it wants to tell.

"dsalouk","5","0","2","13 February 2017"," Surprising, but not fantastic
","Sinister is a surprisingly interesting and intriguing horror film. It maintains an element of mystery, it keeps the catalyst of horror on the outskirts, and uses lighting and music to glamorise and set the tone. Per usual to the genre, there are stupid mistakes made by the protagonist to drive the story and the horror element. Hawke does a well enough job, but the cheap shock drops, especially at the end, do nothing for him or the movie. Better than its counterparts in the genre, Sinister has just enough story to bring a little bit of scare to the table. Sinister raises enough questions, and is barely good enough to consider what a sequel might look like, if done properly, and hopefully, better."

","There was a movie I watched just the other day that really scared the pants off me. (Okay, I'll say it: it was ""Bone Tomahawk,"" all right?) So---I just want you to know that I can see a recently made bone-chilling (ha!) movie and say, ""WOW. That had it ALL! That's one frickin' pleasureful scarefest. 10/10.""<br/><br/>""Sinister"" wasn't the worst horror/BOO! type movie I've ever seen. It has its good points. But I feel obligated to question all of those glowing reviews. As the one guy (maelstrom0370) wrote in his much more noteworthy review, back in 2012, ""Did we see the same movie?""<br/><br/>Here's my review: <br/><br/>Ethan Hawke's performance is great. The kids aren't half bad. The English-accented Mom had a great role in 2014 as ""Cornelia"" in ""The Knick"" (which, if you haven't seen on Netflix, you should go tee it up right now). I couldn't get past her accent in this flick (not even the slightest hint, either, as to why this author guy married a Brit). Playing a housewife Mommy seemed a bit awkward for her. Maybe she should stick to period pieces. Or maybe it's my fault, I suppose, for not being able to overlook her terrific representation of Cornelia. In ""Sinister,"" I kept expecting her to flounce out into the living room or hallway or backyard wearing some super frilly 19th Century get up.<br/><br/>SPOILER (I think): Deputy So and so had me going for a while. I hoped maybe he was one of the abducted kids following in the '60s killer's footsteps. That's what comes from seeing too many other such serial killer movies and lots of Criminal Minds, I guess. And how come these murders only date back to the '60s anyway? Hmm?<br/><br/>GTFO. If you haven't seen YouTuber Ryan Higa's hilarious, fabulous ""How to Survive a Horror Movie,"" please do so now. I am certain Ryan's GTFO helped to make me more jaded about horror movies in general. I sure couldn't stop thinking about Ryan's take on things, as I watched ""Sinister.""<br/><br/>As ""Sinister"" progressed, I found myself shouting out, ""GTFO!"" throughout every third scene. Why oh WHY was Ethan walking around in the dark, going up into the attic, being lured into his study and out into the deepest darkest night by noises? Is his smartphone flashlight the only flashlight he owns, for Pete's sake? (Oh, yeah, that's right. Later on he does utilize a proper flashlight.) <br/><br/>Were we really supposed to believe that this famous author, obviously no newbie to the warped minds of serial killers, was so imbecilic and mutton-headed as to keep bumbling around after gawd-knows-what potentially supernatural freakazoid whacko---- armed only with a baseball bat? Seriously?<br/><br/>And you REALLY have to suspend all belief in order to delude yourself into thinking that wifey- dear wasn't told--- gleefully --- by the first chatty store clerk she came in contact with that the new homestead hubby had moved them all into was murder central. What a gaping plot hole.<br/><br/>I wanted to like this movie; yes, I did. I love Ethan Hawke. Sadly, I found ""Sinister"" to be a huge disappointment. Don't even get me started about the ending. SPOILER ALERT: Where was Deputy So and So when you needed him?<br/><br/>You want to see something scary---see Bone Tomahawk. THAT's how scary is done.<br/><br/>5/10"
"malhereux","3","0","2","2 August 2016"," even Ethan Hawke couldn't save the unpleasantness that was this entire film
","Coming from a non-horror movie fanatic and a downright sissy, I did not enjoy this film. Scary? Yes. Unpleasant? Yes. Depressing? Very much so. In fact, presumably your perfect specimen of an all round a+ horror film, however, not enjoyable in the least.<br/><br/>I'm an old-fashioned girl; I like my horror flicks to come with one of the following: something positive to maintain my (however mild) will to live throughout or, a somewhat happy ending. Sinister had neither. It was grisly, depressing, anxiety provoking and presented it's fair share of jump scares. In the midst of the (somewhat repetitive) suspense scenes there were moments of release, but not frequently enough to balance out the draining gloom the bulk of the movie consisted of. <br/><br/>While I understand that the point of the horror genre is to horrify, I detest the idea of a film that provides nothing positive whatsoever. While I did enjoy the score, the acting and for the most part the aesthetic side of Sinister, in terms of substance the film was exactly what the name predicts; sinister. So sinister in fact that post watching I felt cheated, robbed of 1hr 50mins of my life, planted with new psychological material for future paranoia/nightmares - and little else. I don't see much new that Sinister would have brought to the table of horror cinema, with its curse, slipknot-faced demon, child ghosts, found-footage snuff films, half-arsed cgi, jump scares, family moving to a haunted house and a protagonist who screws up his possible chance of survival with lack of communication. For a more horror-hearted cinephile who feeds on misery and hopelessness this might sit better, but for my soft self this was a pass."

The Man who allegedly (and to my sheer disappointment never) ate bogeys was the only smart actor in this movie, barely featuring in it and covering his face with make-up when he did.<br/><br/>Total lack of dynamic between the so-called family members, lack of sufficient back story so that viewers may at least be able to attempt working out what rubbish they're being expected to swallow whilst paying for it.<br/><br/>And then the absolute shocker that had me thinking I was seeing things?

"Demetrius_Stork","10","0","1","27 November 2015"," One of the best
","This film is a masterpiece of the horror genre. It does its job of scaring the audience and then some. It's one of my favorite movies ever and for very good reason. <br/><br/>The film is excellent on all regards but in my opinion the thing that it does the best is its scares. It does exactly as it should, it scares the crap out of you consistently and effectively. Some of this is due to the excellent cinematography by Chris Norr. The opening shot of the movie instantly lets you know what you're in for and it does an excellent job of setting the tone for the rest of the film. The shots in this movie are all brilliant otherwise. Most of them are shot in dark gloomy areas where the film sets a personal, as the film is shot inside of the home for the majority, yet also a very distant, isolated feel as the viewer feels in a state of suspense as to what can truly invade their home. In this case, it's a lot. While the film has the ability to take something as tired and overused as a jump scare and turn it into great horror. The key is the images that jump out at you. Very similarly to Insidious, another great movie in the horror genre, the film contains absolutely terrifying imagery, from the ghosts and ghouls to the tape scenes and so forth. Overall the film is simply terrifying and has the capability of making the viewer jump at every small bump in the night for a while after. <br/><br/>I absolutely can't go without mentioning the 8mm film scenes. These scenes are some of the most terrifying, awesome, well done scenes ever put into any horror movie. And what a great idea to develop a story! Yes, I know it was sort of stolen from 8mm but this movie just did it so much better. These scenes are awesome and whether or not you like this movie I'd find it hard to believe for a human being on this planet to not at least appreciate these scenes.<br/><br/>The main villain is good, possibly the least effective part of this movie but still done very well. This particular boogie man's design isn't particularly scary, he sort of looks like the predator got a bad haircut. But the way that he's shot and the way that the director Scott Derrickson places him throughout the movie is brilliant and can really turn him into a much more threatening villain to our main characters.<br/><br/>The acting in this film is fantastic, aside from maybe the daughter in some scenes but she doesn't get very many lines so it's very passable. Ethan Hawke does his usual amazing performance as formerly successful writer Ellison Oswalt who is trying to regain his fame for reasons that are left up to the viewer as either selfish or to help his family stay happy and secure(Brilliant!). Ellison throughout the film, as he starts getting the picture of how serious of a situation he's in, really struggles with himself and has that inner conflict as the horrible events he sees on the tapes and in his home unfold. The film shows this wonderfully. His reactions are all just. When he shrugs something off it isn't because he's a clichéd movie skeptic like we've seen a million times before, instead he does it for his own sanity and to protect his family which he knows he might have put in danger. Vincent D'Onofrio, who isn't credited in this movie for some reason, is good as the professor. James Ransone does a pretty good job as Deputy So and so and can even get a laugh once in awhile. Juliet Rylance also does a fine job as Ellison's wife Tracy.<br/><br/>The plot for this movie is so well done, with situations that are always in motion and stuff going on to keep viewers constantly interested. There is certainly no phone checking during this movie! The Climax for this movie is also great, with a jump scare that made me poop my pants and a lot of creepy imagery to boot, this movie raps up really nicely.<br/><br/>Christopher Young, who always does a good job no matter how bad of a movie he's in, delivers with a fantastic score that really adds to the creepy atmosphere. It adds a lot to the movie and he clearly knows when NOT to use a lot of sound, which is very important.<br/><br/>Overall, wow! This movie really kept me on the edge of my seat (and up until three A.M.), and really gave me hope for the horror genre at least until I saw the sequel. Nonetheless this is one of the greatest horror movies ever and I would without a doubt recommend it to anyone who wants to hear a great score, see great acting, and of course get scared."

","While Sinister starts off like a cliché horror movie would, it does from time to time become original enough so that it stands out. But in between some of Sinister's great moments, there are long, boring and filling scenes which take you right out of the moment. I will commemorate Sinister for using original horror techniques rather then the traditional jumpscare, but there just isn't enough heart and substance in this film for it to be entertaining throughout.<br/><br/>It does suffer from some poor characterization, writing and story elements, but on the other hand it does serve up some nice twists and turns in the story.

","For the longest time I'd heard that Sinister was one of the best horror movies out there. Rumors abound of a horror film that returns to bone chilling terror, but I'd heard that so many times before only to be met with disappointment that I decided to give it a pass. While seeing another film at the theater I saw that Sinister was getting ready to produce a sequel and, looking back into the film, saw it had pretty good reviews and still with mentions of how truly scary a film it was and so decided to give it a watch. <br/><br/>Ellison Oswalt is a true crime writer who hasn't had a decent book in a decade. He's struggling to find a new idea that will make him boatloads of cash and set him and his family on the right financial track. Ellison moves his family into a new home in a new town in order to research his new novel about the brutal murder of a family and the child that went missing in the aftermath. To really get into his research Ellison moves his family into the same home where the murder took place something he fails to mention. Ellison discovers a recording of the crime and others on old film reels and sets out to uncover the truth behind the killings. <br/><br/>Now this is all interesting and compelling at first and to be fair the film actually did hook me in with its opening scene, maybe one of the best I've ever seen in a horror film, and its intriguing mystery. Unfortunately as soon as the supernatural elements take hold the movie really began to fall apart and the story begins to make less and less sense especially as the killer is revealed to be a child eating deity and not a human killer as the movie at first wants us to believe. Elliot is an interesting character, but does very little spending much of his time watching the film reels, arguing with his wife, or wandering around his house in the dark with a baseball bat as the movie tries to figure out what it should do next. <br/><br/>That's not to say the movie doesn't have its moments. Ethan Hawke does a good job as a father who slowly loses himself in alcohol as he obsesses over his book and the murders. I found the footage of the murders to be quite chilling and the music accompanying the burning is especially creepy. <br/><br/>Aside from the creepy movie reels I didn't find the movie in the least bit scary. I found it slow, repetitive, predictable, and the ending was not at all shocking, but came off as typical horror movie cliché. <br/><br/>In the end Sinister presents an interesting idea but it goes nowhere. It seems the writers had an idea for some found snuff films and didn't quite know where to go from there."

","Its been a little while since I saw this movie. I saw there's a sequel coming out soon so I looked up the original (on IMDb) first and saw a lot of ""Greatest horror film in the last decade"" or ""Scariest movie I've seen this year"" reviews and other statements along those lines, but I gotta say I don't remember it being that at all. First off I will not be tearing this movie a new one an saying it was horrible but I honestly had to watch the trailer again to even remember if I had seen this movie before or if it was another film I was thinking of. Since it was this film that I had seen combined with the fact that I could barely remember it seemed to me that this was not a good sign. A good movie (horror or otherwise) should leave an impression on you, and even an OK movie should at least be remembered a bit, unfortunately ""Sinister"" did neither. to me ""Sinister"" was just another run of the mill horror movie with a few creepy scenes, a few cheap jump scares and a very forgettable story. The acting was OK from what I remembered and it started off OK but it was nothing to write home about and certainly wasn't anything that gave me nightmares or even a second thought. Sorry ""Sinister"" maybe your sequel will be a little more memorable."

","Coming up with new concepts for movie genres isn't as easy it seems. For every new creation, there's always a bit of material borrowed from prior work. Sometimes these parts are taken from the same creators or from others. As long as it's not done verbatim, most film studios and filmmakers don't receive too much criticism over such details. Other than The Day the Earth Stood Still (2008) remake (which many didn't find engaging), director Scott Derrickson hasn't had much trouble making his own films with lifting various aspects of other films and putting it into his. The ability to do that without being obvious about it is important because it keeps things interesting for generations to come later on. For what is presented here, it shows promise but wistfully, this horror film has about as many positives as it does negatives.<br/><br/>The story is about family man one-hit-wonder writer Ellison Oswalt (Ethan Hawke) trying to make one more comeback after a series of failures. Oswalt is an unusual writer; instead of writing about fiction or other imaginary things, he delves into actual crime cases and digs further into what may have been missed by police officials. After moving in with his family into the exact home of which a gruesome murder took place, he finds a box full of Super 8 films in the attic that turn out to be snuff films of several murders. The writing, which was drafted by Scott Derrickson and first time writer C. Robert Cargill has a wonderfully interesting premise. The beginning to this story is one giant question and the mystery behind it is purely disturbing. What doesn't work as a whole is the last half of the running time. With not much else said, the execution becomes highly predictable making it a tensionless conclusion.<br/><br/>To say that the actors involved in this production can't act wouldn't be truthful. All thespians involved act as their character was written. The problem is how the characters were written. Woefully, Ellison is one of those forgetful fathers who tends to lose track of what's important to him when it comes to work and family. Mrs. Oswalt (Juliet Rylance), Trevor (Michael Hall D'Addario) and Ashley (Clare Foley) feel like a family but there's barely a side explored where the they have fun. Most of it is about them having friction against each other and not disturbing daddy from his work. For almost two hours, there could've been a little something added. This is a problem because this doesn't exactly make the family very likable. On the other hand, there are other characters more interesting than they are. James Ransone plays a cop who looks to help Mr. Oswalt uncover more information about the gruesome cases. The other is an uncredited performance by Vincent D'Onofrio as a professor who specializes in the supernatural.<br/><br/>The final actor that makes a notable performance is Nicholas King who portrays the main antagonist (Bughuul) and of whose face of the franchise is represents. Although King doesn't actually give Bughuul much of a distinguished personality, the look of him is quite memorable with such a uniquely ghoulish face. With that also leads to some mostly effective chilling scenes. It is rated R but the gore isn't what makes it that. The gore is in fact almost none existent (which may upset some). It's not so much scary although some jump scares work as well. The cinematography shot by Chris Norr is adequate but isn't anything much to talk about. There's nothing special look to point out. It's dark and well-lit when the script calls for it unfortunately. Norr is competent but lacks a trademark.<br/><br/>As for music, the highly underrated horror composer Christopher Young scored the tunes for this movie. For those who are more familiar with Young's classically recorded scores from A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge (1985) and Hellraiser (1987) or even Ghost Rider (2007), it may take some time to get used to this listening experience. It is definitely far from being bad or underdeveloped; it just doesn't sound like your everyday symphonic score. Unlike in his early work, Young now uses a mix of some organic orchestra and more of electronic synths. There are a number of themes composed for different events, the best being for Ellison's investigative work, which involves heavily warped electronic bass beats. Along with that are other tracks that are in more of the lines of soundscaping, this is for the series' main theme. One thing that doesn't work for this movie musically is anything that isn't Young's work, which is used for the snuff films. When these songs are played they are extremely distracting and somewhat annoying. They really should've have just stuck with Young only.<br/><br/>For what it proposed, it definitely looked promising. The villain has a memorable design, the actors efficiently work in their roles, the music is effective and it is unsettling in general. Tragically, the bad evenly outweighs the good with not very many likable main characters, an obnoxious soundtrack from other artists, acceptable but uninspired camera work and a predictable last hour once the ball gets rolling."

","There isn't many actors that can stand alone in a horror movie. Ethan Hawke manages just this. Although his character has a family, Ellison (Hawke) spends his waking hours in solitary confinement, or rather, his office, writing a book about a murder that happened in the house he currently resides. His wife and children are kept out of the loop, therefore, they are the ones to suffer. A sinister presence lurks in the shadows, waiting to tear Ellison's family apart. This is gorgeously shot. Ironically the nasty, scary hubbub happens when the sun's gone down. The house is populated by shadows and dim lights. You'd think Ellison would turn a light or two on. The story is strong; governed by a murderer that's been killing since the 60's. It's down to Ellison and Ellison alone to discover the truth. 8mm videos are his only source, and they're highly disturbing, and not for the faint-hearted. Sinister's shocks come with such perfect precision. It's scary, but mostly jumpy. Hawke is superb, becoming a nervous wreck the deeper in to this case he gets. Liqueur is his only company because his family manage to sleep through all the chaos that occurs. Sinister is a great horror, and will be remembered for its shocking material and creepy killer."
"alaphlosiam","4","0","1","17 June 2015"," The ending ruined the entire movie
","I was drawn to this movie not from seeing any previews and not by word-of-mouth, but by happening to stumble on many good reviews of it. I saw the generic title, and I'd already seen Paranormal Activity and Insidious (both mediocre horror flicks), but most reviews claimed it was better, innovative, etc. Sadly, this is a similar situation to when an ex tries to get back together with you and claims ""it'll be different this time, I promise!""<br/><br/>Now, I will admit, this movie was a lot better than Paranormal Activity. Insidious was alright (also better than Paranormal Activity), but it was also a let-down. Sinister was easily a step up from either.<br/><br/>Interesting premise on the plot, I suppose. I wanna call it original, but I feel like it's been done before. Honestly, up until the ending, it was great. I was on edge the entire time, jumped at every jump scare despite bracing myself for them (and no matter how cheap they were... shame on me), and the tension was HIGH. But... the movie ruined itself. The ""twist ending"" was awful, and where I was worried about getting sleep tonight halfway through the movie, now I'm no longer worried about that. I'm just disappointed that I ended up wasting almost two hours watching this instead of another movie.<br/><br/>I mean, seriously, I'm going to rant for a second here, but that ending. DURR THE KIDS DID IT! Oh my god. It's one thing to use the death of a child for shock factor (because we all know it works), but on top of that making the children the murderers? Seriously? That's just lame and cheesy. I was more excited and scared to find out how the old-man-murderer was still going and why he was still going. Instead, it's a stupid Pagan deity that's possessing kids to kill their families. Geez. <br/><br/>Even movies like The Strangers was scarier than this. At least it implanted that subconscious fear in the back of your mind: ""This could happen to you. This is fairly realistic."" Up until the Pagan deity thing and all that, this WAS realistic. Every adult who's lived on their own for any amount of time knows the fear of waking up to find someone in their house that doesn't belong there. It's realistically terrifying. Instead, Sinister delivers some honky Pagan possession that could only happen to you if you're in a family of four that lived in a house where a previous murder (that also has to be in the same vein) occurred AND THEN you moved after that again.<br/><br/>All-in-all, I'll give it a 4/10. The fantastic atmosphere and good job they did up until the end is fantastic and good, but it doesn't matter when the whole thing is just ruined."

This movie had more plot holes than Gone Girl, and that movie was so retarded. I am honestly so disappointed. I'm not sure I saw the same movie as everyone else because if i did then you all must have very dull taste. Lets start with my problems. 1. Why was the movie so slow? Seriously i almost fell asleep a few times. 2. Why was it necessary that the son has nightmares? Did the producers write that in to get more jump scares? (probably). 3. Lastly, WHY WAS THE ENDING SO FAST PACED? I mean really.... That wasn't even a climax. I'm not even overreacting, that ending lasted 5 minutes. Jeez, this movie was just so sloppy, and I'm so offended by all you scum that actually enjoyed it. This is what's really wrong with the world... Directors really think they can make these DESPICABLE movies and get away with it. Im boycotting this movie everyday until Scott Derrickson isn't allowed to film a movie again.

","A novelist turned true crime writer moves into a house where a mass murder was committed; one of the victims has not been found, a young girl, but she is presumed dead by the local sheriff, who doesn't like the newcomer on account of things he's said about police officers in general. <br/><br/>Our scribe has of course told his wife about the connection, although she has no idea they are living in the actual house where the murders were committed, and when she finds out, she is understandably livid. Well dear he tells her, the victims weren't killed in the house but in the back garden, hung from that thar tree. Unsurprisingly, she's not buying it. <br/><br/>On top of that, their son suffers from night terrors and his daughter wants to move back to their previous palatial home. Naturally this doesn't wash, and of course he wants to both solve the murders and find the missing girl alive. Then he makes a mysterious find, some old style film and a projector in the attic which the police and everyone else appear to have overlooked. When he views this film and with some help from a junior law officer who has a degree in criminology, he becomes convinced this is the work of a serial killer who has been at large since the 1960s. Or could this be some sort of cult? More to the point, how much of it is in his head?<br/><br/>His helper with the badge points him to an academic who suggests there is indeed a demonic connection, an ancient deity called Bagul, the devourer of children. So is he looking for a serial killer, a demon, or maybe he should just pack up and run? After yet another scare he chooses the latter, but is flight the right thing? Somehow you get the impression this is all going to end very badly.<br/><br/>This film has some good atmospheric moments; the implication is that the ghosts of the victims are not in his head, and some of the happenings defy rational explanation. Many films of this type are confusing with dream sequences, flashbacks and so forth. By and large, ""Sinister"" avoids these pitfalls, but don't watch it if you like happy endings."

Scott Derrickson who has given some of good horror drama like The Exorcism Of Emily Rose and Deliver Us From Evil succeeds with this one as well. Nice background score coupled with solid story and attention grabbing screenplay, Sinister is one of best horror movies I have seen recently. The flip side is that screenplay looses the steam in the 2nd half and less spooky moments should have been more. Performances by the star cast is good and convincing. Cinematography and art direction is outstanding. <br/><br/>Mark my words- Watch Sinister to get horrified. Good 3 /5"

I also consider art to be a very Important thing, one of the most important elements of human existence and whenever I hear about museums being pillaged or art being destroyed In thefts, it breaks my heart. I've often said that my art is the most important part of myself and that there's nothing anyone could do to prevent me from being a creative person. ""Sinister"" makes me reconsider. This movie really struck a cord with me. True-crime writer Ellison (Ethan Hawke) is all washed up. He had a big break some years ago, made a lot of money and became famous, but his subsequent works have not been nearly as critically acclaimed or impactful. When he and his family move into a new house, he discovers a box of horrifying home movies that offer ripe material for his next book, but also puts everyone in danger.<br/><br/>""Sinister"" takes the time to show not only why, but how obsession can overcome reason. The characters are well drawn and believable, the performances are good and it does an excellent job of consistently filling you the feeling of dread you get when you know something bad is going to happen. It uses simple, but effective scares to get your heart beating and rarely results to jump scares so you'll be frightened by atmosphere, not surprises. It's a disturbing, very frightening horror film just in time for Halloween that's going to please audiences. (Theatrical version, October 30, 2012)"
"Vartiainen","Null","0","1","18 March 2015"," Effective horror film
","Sinister is a classic horror story told with style. A family moves into town to live in an old house that was the place of a brutal tragedy some time ago. Now, in real world, this would merely bring the price down a little bit and that would be it. But of course in cinema world you can pretty much kiss most, if not all, of the family goodbye instantly, as all of you pretty much guessed the very instant I uttered the words ""old house"". This could very well be a Stephen King novel. It even has a writer as a protagonist. Yet I don't mean that in a bad way. It's an effective formula, if you can keep it from feeling too stale.<br/><br/>Which Sinister does, for the most part. Much of that is helped by the lead man, Ethan Hawke, whose acting capabilities and charisma keep you focused on the film. The atmosphere builds largely around his growing unease and horror as he starts to realize that this time he might have found something real - without having considered what that would mean for him and his family.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast does okay, but none of them stand out or really shine all that much. I have to wonder what this movie might have been if they had gotten another actor of Hawke's caliber.<br/><br/>The other major problem is the ending, like it often is. The majority of the film is mood and atmosphere over slasher horror and jump scares, which is a major plus. There are a couple instances of both, but they're done well and you don't grow tired of them. And then the ending just sort of happens and it's not as satisfying as it could have been. I would like to say I don't mind it being predictable, because in horror the journey is more important, but I will say that it wraps up the loose ends a bit too nicely. There's no punch to it. I will remember Hawke's performance long after I've forgotten this particular ending.<br/><br/>Sinister is one of the better horror films I've seen in years, which to my regret isn't saying all that much. It has a lot of good things going for it, but I get the sense that they just didn't manage to pull in enough talent to really make it work. Definitely worth a watch if you're a fan of horror, though."

What's really scary about it, unlike so many horror movies that are supposed to be scary but have really silly premises, this one is scary because it can really happen in real life. There's a supernatural element in it mixed with murder/crime. The music is also very creepy, kind of reminds me of the soundtrack on ""8MM"" which was also about snuff movies. The killer's name, Bughuul, suggesting something ancient and malevolent, and the foreign words uttered in the soundtrack adds to the creepiness of the atmosphere. Anyway, don't want to reveal too much, except this is really worth the watch."

","The movie ""Sinister"" is part Greek tragedy with the Gashlycrumb tinies thrown in for good measure. Ethan Hawke is Ellison Oswalt, a washed up true crime novelist who had fame from 10 years ago with his only masterpiece ""Kentucky Blood."". Ellison is determined to get his fame back and redeem himself to his British wife, Tracey (Juliette Rylance), young daughter, Ashley and preteen son, Trevor. He moves his family into the Stevenson house where 4 members of the family were killed and the youngest daughter went missing. The Greek tragedy comes about because Ellison won't listen to the Sheriff (portrayed by no- nonsense Fred D. Thompson) and the officer's warnings to Ellison are not listened to. James Ransone is fan-boy Deputy So-and-So and he helps Elllison in research behind the sheriff's back. Ellison finds the Super 8 movies of families including the Stevenson clan being killed in gross, yet creative ways. Ellison sees the figure of Babylonian god Baghuul in the movies and he finds out that Baghuul aka Mr. Boogie is possessing a young child from the family and forcing them to do away with their family. This entity feeds on the souls of these children and he makes them all look ghostly and dead. Ellison and his family pay with their lives for Ellison's refusal to listen to the Sheriff. Ethan Hawke is great as Ellison Oswalt and the other actors play their parts to perfection as well! Clare Foley as Ashley is a wonderful combination of innocence and corruption too!"

","(Major Spoilers) Bad Movies (especially in horror) rely on dim-witted, dumb, or ridiculously stubborn characters to make their plots work, and unfortunately ""Sinister"" fits this category wholly. Truly great horror movies (Shining/Omen/Jaws etc) are great in part because the characters in the stories do not need to be rock-dumb or stubborn to help the story along. Storywriter/director Derrickson doesn't seem to understand this. The movie borrows heavily from ""Ringu"" and some from ""The Ninth Gate"". It is sufficiently foreboding and atmospheric, and has clever ideas and execution. It is not ridiculously gruesome either but implies it. There is potential for the filmmakers to make an excellent movie and classic horror, but there's too much fall-back to the traps of cliché. This one's a missed opportunity. 6/10"

But since this piece of information was revealed at the end of the film, I was disappointed.<br/><br/>Not one of the best horror movies I've seen. Also, the entire movie was really dark and there was a lot of the ""silouhette effect"" going on. <br/><br/>I wasn't really understanding why there was a scorpion and a snake in the attic when they live in Pennsylvania? That made no sense to me until the very end as well.<br/><br/>The wife in this movie is possibly the most annoying actress I've ever heard in my life also...she had a horrible accent and was a complete bitch the entire movie when she should have been supportive over her husbands career.<br/><br/>Props to the children actors in this movie."

","When I take a horror movie to watch, I just do that, I try to watch and be impressed. But since I saw Conjuring earlier, this film reminded me so much on it. Since this film came out before Conjuring it is obvious that makers of Conjuring did copy this a little bit, took some elements out of it.<br/><br/>What to say. acting was excellent, the idea that kids can hurt you is excellent. In real life they kill their parents on a day to day basis. Oh my God, all that money I spent on diapers and braces and other kids stuff, it certainly killed me little by little. Scary moments were excellent. But, in total just another horror movie. If you like them watch this one!"

","Sinister - the highly anticipated and lauded follow-up by Scott Derrickson to the very scary Emily Rose exorcism movie - is a bit of a letdown. The visual images are great, the monster is spooky in an old-school way, and the old movies are very freakily effective. But I found myself counting down the minutes to Ellison Oswald (Ethan Hawke)'s death. The characters simply didn't have enough meat to make the narrative terribly interesting. Deputy So-and-So was a humorous aspect of the film but that felt like it under weighed the film being a serious scary movie. The humor for me disjointed the actual parts of the film designed to scare you. Hawke's line, ""OK Dog, you just stay there, because I'm going to...bash your head in"" when he sees a monstrous spirit in the form of a canine kills the tension. The concept of a demonic deity named Bagul is silly enough so the film should have had a more serious execution. But because of the tongue-in-cheek approach I was more bored or waiting for something really creepy to happen than actually being scared. When the scares did happen, everything else framed around them was so un-involving that while I jumped, I was more surprised than disturbed. The ending has elements of a classic horror film (blood soaked walls, creepy kids, the whole schnozzle) but what sucks is this film could have really been as scary as everyone said it was, but sadly wasn't. Still worth a watch if you're an Ethan Hawke fan and enjoyed Scott's really disturbing exorcism movie The Exorcism of Emily Rose, which I highly recommend."

Though it's the premise of most modern horror flicks these days to have some ancient demon start preying on modern America, it's getting old.

"botrytis","6","0","1","24 February 2013"," Long time no see...
","This movie is far the best you can see these days, but it's not because it's original...<br/><br/>It presents the scariest things what modern horror movies are maintaining: Scary, mysterious DUDE in mask, depressing atmosphere, jumpy-fright moments. For me the most powerful element of this motion picture are the antic camera family-movies. They were top-notch crafted in every way.<br/><br/>But of course, as any other films in this genre, it sets the same damn story build up(!) Please someone tell me, why every horror today starts with MOVING?! (Sorry, not only horror) And of course we know that where they gonna move into, oh yeah, it's a damn haunted house. So unoriginal, and Hackneyed. We encounter with this everywhere now, and makes me wonder: Do the creators ever struggle for new story backgrounds? 'Coz after replying this for the 1000th time ... it's like if you put this genre to a ladder among the others, it's never gonna change it's placement, 'coz it's not even trying to, and that place is really below the top, guys.<br/><br/>There are two types of horror movies: The one where the story is scary and the happenings are more build on the meaning behind it, not only the surface is ugly, but beneath it, also. The other one is where regardless of scary-jumpy and gruesome moments there is nothing else which affects the audience, and can be a merit. <br/><br/>This movie has more emphasis to the other type of this genre. <br/><br/>Besides this major negativity of Sinister, it has some merits: Like I said before, the top-notch camera scenes are perfectly representing the darkest corners of the genre, and as an intro (at the start) worked really well. The attic scene, with the ladder (you know what I'm talking about) was freaking awesome. It could be said to the end too, and this is the strongest merit for me: You know the ending when they thing the nightmare has ended, and everything is fine after-wards, and then the big surprise comes? Well ... it's not different here, but still it is build up so damn good, differently. The sounds effects here makes you the creeps, the visual is perfect, and actually it is a negative ending, but how negative man, WOW! It was refreshing. <br/><br/>But again, back to the downfalls, the jumpy-moments are so predictable, mostly the LAST ONE (you know, before credits). This is the other thing makes me wonder: Why are they emphasize on these moments, in a way, that you know it's going to happen, and the most awkward is, you know WHAT's going to happen, and which a**hole gonna scare you. And you ask the question: Do I wanna see this? I'm already know what's gonna happen, so I'm not watching' it. Well, yeah, we reached the point when actually we know everything, and it's really sad ... really ...<br/><br/>However, I didn't see the lawnmower part coming, damn, that was so strong scene(!)<br/><br/>So ,yeah, it's good, and bad at the same time, it's the same thing as every other movie, but at least this is the best among them."

","Was the movie well-made? Yes, it absolutely was. Was it cliché? It had elements from all the ghost stories we've already seen, particularly the Grudge. Were the characters believable? Definitely. Was the movie scary? Not one bit.<br/><br/>It's a major let down to come across such a well-made horror movie and soon realize that for some reason it fails to scare you. I think the people here who call this the best scary movie haven't seen enough scary movies, otherwise, they would've seen through the banality and repetitiveness of this one.Unfortunately, all ideas for a good horror movie seem to have been used up. Why else would you keep stumbling upon such tasteless ""horror"" movies that could easily pass for comedies?<br/><br/>The thing about horror movies is if they fail to scare you they're useless. Surely you don't want to stare into the darkness hoping that some disfigured ghost jumping onto the screen will scare you, because it's so predictable that it's almost laughable. To me, the movie, while promising, was like stale bread. Watching glue dry would've been more exciting, especially because 10 minutes into the movie I knew exactly what was going to happen, and it happened before the movie even started. It took too long for that predictable event to unfold. Contrary to what some of the reviewers here have said, if you are a ""true horror fan"" you would pass this movie, because you've seen enough horror movies that this one is going to bore you to death. People who have seen no more than 10 horror movies in their life might find it interesting though.I'm giving it a four because the movie had the looks of a high-budget movie to it, and not because of the non-existent horror. <br/><br/>As for the ""best horror movie"" of the decade, I strongly recommend you to go watch ""Drag Me to Hell"" 2009. Your expectations of what counts as a perfect horror movie will get so high that you will stop enjoying ""horror"" movies like ""Sinister"", ""Insidious"", etc. in no time."

","First of all I want to say that it was a good movie. The scenario was very good but the end had a lot of unanswered questions.The flow the first 50 minutes was very slow but the last hour was very good with very fast flow and very interesting comeback! Ethan Hawke had a solid performance in this movie and I believe that he is all the movie! I had seen the trailer and I was expected something different but I believe it was a good classic horror movie with 4-5 very scary point that makes you want more.<br/><br/>If you want to see a good horror movie this is a good choice but nothing special and innovative, just a good American horror movie to spend your time entertaining.

"poyrazbaklan","4","0","2","2 December 2012"," The trailer gives away all the scares!
","I had high hopes for Sinister. Its trailer looked scary enough with decent actors (and Ethan Hawke) and some terrifying jump scares. The main evil, Bughuul, is horrible enough with his looks and the murders, so I jumped in the chance to see the movie. But alas! The scenes in the trailer consists of the only scary scenes in the whole movie. There is definitely nothing else, the remaining 85 minutes consist of Ethan Hawke slowly going crazy and his relationship with his wife(who I might add is somehow scarier than Bughuul with her non-stop complaining and whiny discouragement) deteriorating. Sure there is an evil on the loose and going after this man's family but I would rather see the scary scenes than watch what this does to him. Long story short, when you see the trailer, you have seen enough."

","There are some sinister snuff movies to be seen in this movie, and Ethan Hawke responds to them as if they are the most horrific things he has ever seen. It reminded me of Nicholas Cage in 8MM, which is not a good thing at all. There is a sinister musical score, but that does not a truly scary horror film make. In fact, Sinister relies to heavily on a strange soundtrack to cause discomfort among viewers. The story isn't particularly interesting, and, despite Hawke's OK performance, the characters aren't very convincing and to me it was pretty clear from the beginning where this was going to end. The make-up of the 'ghosts' is not exactly Tom Savini, either, so that in the end this is rather dull stuff."

This is one of the better horror movies I have seen this year. With a truly haunting background score and plethora of disturbing scenes with the minimum amount of gore, this manages to get under your skin. Ethan Hawke is good as usual.

"DustinRahksi","6","0","1","13 November 2012"," It was alright.
","I was bored and wanted something to do, so I went to see Sinister. I would like to start off by saying if I saw this movie seven years ago it would have gave me nightmares. There is a large amount of suspense throughout the film, mostly during the night time. There is also a lot ""LOUD"" noises they use to startle you, even one after another, they worked by the way. I found the Super 8 footage very disturbing, especially the lawn work scene, I thought that was disgusting. The image of that scene was burned into my mind for awhile. The original score is surprisingly good, with some creepy tracks to go along with the snuff films. Buguul was a different change of pass for a haunted house or should I say haunted family film. Much better than all the other paranormal garbage we've been getting. The acting was alright, the story was neat, and the twist was sickening.<br/><br/>If you want a good scare I recommend it, just don't let children watch it because even I was scared, not many movies do that for me."
"ghost_dog86","8","0","1","12 November 2012"," Film vs. Digital
","In this sort of anti-found footage film from director Scott Derrickson, ""Sinister"", a movie I would refer to as more of a thriller than an actual horror because of the limited genre based scares it contains, surprisingly does contain such a high level of suspense throughout its eerie premise, that in the end, even though it does have one major flaw, it turns out to be the scariest movie of the year so far (by far).<br/><br/>The Plot: ""The Shinning"" inspired premise involves a writer of true crime novels by the name of Ellison Oswalt (played by Ethan Hawke) who, in order to gather information for his new book, moves his wife and two children into a house where a family was brutally murdered; without his families prior knowledge of course. You see, it's been ten years since Ellison's last big hit and with his financial situation and marriage both on the rocks, this plot point is seen as his final desperate attempt to write a lucrative novel. While moving in, he finds a series of Super 8 films, he suspects to be home movies, in the attic, and begins watching them as part of his investigation. What he soon discovers is that these films not only document the murder of the family whose house he now resides in, but also the grisly murders (each more gruesome than the last) of three more unknown families. As the days continue, he proceeds to watch each of these films, looking for clues. But what he finds is much more alarming, when during one viewing he discovers that a man (or monster) has been standing in the background of each one of the films, the entire time. <br/><br/>Why this thriller for the most part works so well is quite simple. First of all, Derrickson's direction, aside from a few inevitable hiccups (which I will touch on later) creates an undeniably suspenseful atmosphere, which slowly escalates throughout the entire film. I don't know about you, but that is exactly what I want out of a good horror flick. And aside from the obvious visuals of the all too disturbing killings, Derrickson's use of hand held camera movement and a good amount of visually haunting shots elevates what could have been a true disaster of a film, into one that is a mixture of an intriguing psychological thriller and spooky campfire tale. And if you think I'm giving Derrickson too high of visual praise here, I will end with this: ""Sinister"" is not only the most beautifully shot horror film in recent years, but also makes a compelling case for a best director nomination (which will never happen).<br/><br/>The second reason ""Sinister"" works so well lies in how high the screenplay writer (in this case Scott Derrickson) has upped the hero's stakes. Aside from a movie visually not being scary enough, distractingly obnoxious or unlikeable characters are usually the downfalls of any horror film. For example: Every movie in the ""Saw"" and ""Hostel"" franchise, or a movie where you are rooting for the deformed bad-guy to chop up the beautiful teenagers. That's why I believe that the protagonists motive in ""Sinister"", a struggling artist who will stop at nothing to boost his career (much like Ethan Hawke) is so believable/compelling, as well as contains a fair amount of pathos, that any plot holes, over-the-top supernatural visuals or accounts of bad acting will most likely be immediately forgiven, if not outright ignored by a larger majority of theater going audiences.<br/><br/>As I had made mention to prior, ""Sinister"" is unfortunately held back from being a great horror because of one major flaw. A flaw I'd like to refer to as ""the child-element."" This is the case with many horror films, when the story revolves around children or in the case of ""Sinister"" children play an intricate role in the reveal, the entire movie has the strong potential of visually becoming quite goofy. There are two instances which implement, for lack of a better phrase, ghost children. These two sequences are undeniably silly and in turn are too great to be ignored, instantly taking the viewer out of the film experience. Now, that is not to say that because the story is so good that one of these scenes can't be quickly forgotten. It's just a shame that the other sequence in question makes up (semi-spoiler alert) the final 3 minutes of the film, absolutely ruining Sinister's ending. In short, for 80 or so minutes this is a damn near perfect thriller, but in the latter half, when this film focuses more and more on the man/monster, the movie itself becomes more susceptible to the visually laughable/supernatural ghost children moments in question."

","As his career is in a slump, a true crime writer is desperate to write another best-seller. He likes to be close to his writing subject, so he moves to a house where, unbeknownst to his family, terrible events occurred. It gets even more sinister when he finds a mysterious box in the attic, containing several tapes of 8mm film stock...<br/><br/>Writer-director Scott Derrickson serves up a horror movie not unlike his previous scare-fest The Exorcism of Emily Rose (2005) in terms of mood and execution. Through an exceptional and non-conventional soundtrack, the grainy and scratchy found film footage and the overall solid acting performances, Sinister manages to evoke a very chilling atmosphere, without feeling the need to resort to gore.<br/><br/>The first Act does a good job setting up the characters and their conflicts. Even though their initial predicament is quite common in horror films, it doesn't ruin the uncomfortable eerie mood the film is going for and it offers some form of explanation for the choices certain characters will make. For some, this explanation may not be sufficient to suspend their disbelief later on in the movie, but I personally didn't find this to be that troublesome.<br/><br/>My biggest gripe with Sinister is its structural repetitiveness. Starting from Act 2, tension is built and released at least five times in the exact same way: Family conflict/character development => Man watches some film and switches it off because he got freaked out by it => Man hears strange sounds in his house and sneaks through the hallway to investigate (these scenes are mostly too long) => Back to family conflict, etc.<br/><br/>Generally, this kind of repetition would not be fatal for a sober, slow-burning movie like this one, if each iteration would present something new or if some kind of plot/character evolution is shown throughout. Sadly, except for the fact the strange phenomena get worse, this really isn't the case. This lack of fresh content makes for a second Act that feels much too long. It doesn't help that a lot of the tension build-ups end with the typical sudden movement - loud noise combo. Luckily, these cheap scares are supported by the feelings of dread during the moments that precede them. Ultimately, it's up to you to feel or decide if you can forgive the film for its ""easy tactics"".<br/><br/>The middle Act is also where the ""face of evil"" is shown. I don't know how to feel about this. If this movie had different pacing, I'd probably say the enemy is shown too early and therefore loses all of its mystique. This rings even more true when make-up effects and creature design are rather uninspired, and you get the feeling you've seen it many times before. But in Sinister, I guess the relatively early revelation moved the plot forward in an already (too) slow-moving plot, so it didn't bother me as much as it might have otherwise.<br/><br/>The third Act starts off with one of the characters making a decision that some viewers will say ""should have been made earlier"". As I said before, to me the initial character setup was enough to buy this character's decision-making, but I wouldn't be surprised if not everyone will feel the same way. While the movie really took its time in the second Act, it's a shame the ending felt pretty rushed. It deviates from the classic ""screenwriting 101: how to write a smashing knicker-soiling ending, the Hollywood way"", which will probably polarize viewers. I found it clever in some ways, and it certainly produced a smile on my face, as it was easily the scariest sequence for me.<br/><br/>If you're not a fan of the genre, I doubt Sinister will offer you a rewarding movie experience. Gorehounds will need to look elsewhere as well. It's certainly not a terrible film, but it needs to rely too much on its atmosphere of dread. If you like your horror served creepy and slowly getting under your skin, with feelings of unease very aptly evoked by a great unorthodox soundtrack (check out the band ULVER) and grungy found footage sequences, and you can forgive the film for some of its cheap scares, then this film might be for you.<br/><br/>There once were ten little rats, who went in their movie-hole to watch SINISTER. How many of them came out alive at the end? 6,5/10 !"
"jerrywright15","7","0","1","28 October 2012"," Wasn't Bad at All
","Saw this movie when it first came out and I'll be the first to admit it was not a bad horror movie by a long shot. There is an excellent tension established early through the movie that lasts throughout. The story line is decent and Ethan Hawke does a super job bringing his character to life. As for the rest of the cast its pretty much a hit and miss even the children I find hard to believe are real at times, but then again their young and learning and they managed to keep the film going. The only true downside I'd say is that if you've seen the trailer you've pretty much seen all the jump scares the movie has to offer. I mean a scene would start and I would go, oh this is when so and so happens... so your never really surprised though it doesn't lessen the fear. My theater was pretty much halfway full of boyfriends and girlfriends and the girls screamed pretty much every time a jump scare happened. The guys on the other hand seemed to find the movie funny rather than scary, I don't know if it was a macho thing or what, but I personally didn't see anything funny especially towards the end. By far the SCARIEST thing about this movie to me was Bagul. I give total props to the design team and everyone who made that deity come to life because from the first time I saw him I was terrified of him. That mask or face or whatever is truly chilling and throughout the movie you hope you don't see him. The movie is far from Insidious scary and won't cause you to lose sleep, at least it shouldn't, but its definitely a good movie to get a few chills in or to bring a lover to and cuddle up with. I would definitely suggest seeing this movie in theaters as I think watching it at home will make it lose its luster I definitely don't think it will be as scary unless you have some serious sound systems going and a decent sized screen. Well worth the money and I'd give it a solid 7 out of 10."
"geopridham","7","0","1","25 October 2012"," Tension Roller Coaster- Solid Flick!
","Sinister is solid horror flick and one I would recommend going to see if you are fans of the genre. It has some very disturbing moments and the use of 8mm tape is genius and adds to the mood. The acting is strong and Ethan Hawke shines as a ""has-been"" author trying to strike it big again before his descent into terror.<br/><br/>Another couple of solid notes worth mentioning are the soundtrack and cinematography of the film. Both are excellently done. Both will have you constantly tense and on edge while you constantly strain to see into room corners. Also, the short sequences shot on 8mm tape were excellently done and very disturbing.<br/><br/>The storyline itself was weak. As it unfolds, it shouldn't take the viewer long to come to the only possible explanation as to what happened to the various different families as the simplest solution is probably the correct one. After this, all that's left is to wonder about whether the ending is going to be good or bad. The ending was disappointing and the explanation of what was happening from ""Deputy So-and-So"" was very contrived.<br/><br/>One other note and I'm not really sure if this is a positive or a negative to the film to other people, but I found there was too much tension in the film! The constant darkness the movie seemed to be in started to become familiar to the point that scares weren't having the affect they probably should have. When you are constantly anticipating something, ""surprises"" lose their effect.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, we go to a scary movie though for thrills and this does deliver in that respect. Its a good horror movie with a strong lead acting performance and should leave most people satisfied. I enjoyed it."

","This movie gives the horror genre great outlook in such a crummy time for film. Sinister manages to captivate the audience with not just the same old cheap scares most films do in this genre. They find the captivation in the story, which is rich and very moving. The twists and turns in the plot keep the viewer itching for more, and is satisfied by every event. My only bone to pick with the movie is that of its delivery. Some of the shots in the film are a bit iffy and could have been done to better represent what the story was looking to convey. The three aspects to this film are the mystery, terror, and horror. I think it might have done better had it been classified as a mystery suspense film. I know some viewers like their blood and gore, but a greater number of audience member could have been engaged with this story that had great potential. The terror was done extremely well and was intensely built. <br/><br/>I would strongly encourage those that enjoy horror films to go and see Sinister. It will not be a let down. I gave this movie a 7 out of 10 only if I had felt a little more of the terror aspect of the movie as to the horror. Other than that Sinister is a great film and the actors were magnificent.

","Sinister is one of the rare horror movies to come out in recent years that actually makes an impression on the viewer by being an original work and will be remembered. I'm a HUGE horror fan, but I have to face the awful truth time and time again that horror movies today SUCK. They suck so incredibly bad. With the exception of Insidious and now, thankfully, Sinister, every horror movie to come out of recent years is certifiable trash. Everything is either a remake from earlier successes, a remake of a more successful foreign film, a movie about demonic possession, ""torture porn"" (and I did love the original Saw) or a mash-up of every cliché imaginable overdone with cheap CGI. Sinister works because it avoids all of these.<br/><br/>Instead of relying on cheap tricks, Sinister uses atmosphere, mood, tension and pretty good acting to heighten the horror. I didn't find the ACTUAL story all that scary; the ""deity"" didn't quite do it for me, but luckily, the movie didn't need to rely on it as its only means to produce scares. The one word that comes to mind when I think of Sinister is DISTURBING. It's not essentially a ""scary"" movie but a very dark and DISTURBING one. You understand this from the opening scene. The home videos that Ethan Hawke's character watches will definitely linger with you.<br/><br/>Sinister of course isn't perfect. I guessed the ending almost right away and knew what was happening. And why doesn't anyone turn on a light when they hear something scary at night? TURN ON THE FREAKIN' LIGHTS! Your kid suffers night terrors and wanders around outside? Lock his damn door! Characters in horror movies are usually pretty stupid and don't do what they're supposed to do anyway so you really can't hold that against this movie. The ""pop-up"" scares were predictable as well.<br/><br/>Even with silly flaws Sinister is successful because it goes back to the basic formula for making a genuine horror movie. Mood and atmosphere are scarier than any cheap CGI monster."

","If you are thinking of seeing this movie you better do it while it is still in theaters, because if you don't it won't be anything too special. The movie plot is cool and interesting but very predictable. If you have seen the trailer for this film than you already know one of the key points to this movie, that being a re-occurring image that appears in all the home movies of different families that were murdered. However I was not over impressed with the ""scare"" techniques in this movie. I saw this in the theater and yeah i did jump and get startled more then once, but only because of the loud bang/sound or music being played when a scary sight flashes quick in front of the camera. I can imagine if I was watching this movie at home the intensity would not nearly be the same and I do not like the fact that if I wear to have the sound off or even low, I would not be scared at all by the scenes meant to make the viewer jump. Now I know a lot of scary movies used sound to intensify these parts but more of a sound that the killer/monster/ghost/etc makes... something that will always make you remember them, like the creepy noise the girl makes in the grudge, leather face starting the chainsaw, Freddy laughing, the voice disguiser from scream, things like that. That is something lacking in this movie, as I said before without the loud bang or sudden loud music the scary parts would not be scary in my opinion. As for the creepy face or 'Mr. Boogie"", he is scary looking and creepy but to me he resembled the jigsaw doll (saw) too much, or he may be a member from the band slipknot, which made me feel as though I was not seeing some kind of new villain. Having said that this movie has some of the most disturbing scenes involving the family movies shown on the film projector, which I think was twisted genius to think of. No problem with the acting and as I said before I found the storyline very interesting and was easily caught up in it. I give this a 7 with it losing points based on the fact that it was not as scary as I had heard or expected, but it is worth seeing, but I highly recommend that you see it in the theater, makes the experience more enjoyable and scary."

","'SINISTER': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) <br/><br/>Supernatural horror film from writer/director Scott Derrickson and starring Ethan Hawke. The film has Hawke playing a true-crime novelist who moves his family in to a house where the previous family was murdered, except the youngest girl who went missing, in hopes he'll find material for another hit novel. Derrickson directed and co-wrote the film with C. Robert Cargill. He performed the same duties on other horror films like 'HELLRAISER: INFERNO' and 'THE EXORCISM OF EMILY ROSE' (which is one of my favorites). This film isn't quite as deep or thought provoking as 'THE EXORCISM OF EMILY ROSE' but it's a pretty effective and chilling horror film nonetheless.<br/><br/>Hawke plays Ellison Oswalt, a true-crime novelist who had a hit book a decade earlier in which he also helped authorities solve a crime. The books he followed it with were not nearly as successful and now he's looking for another hit in the house where a family was murdered and the youngest girl went missing some months earlier. He doesn't tell his wife (Juliet Rylance) or son (Michael Hall D'Addario) and daughter (Clare Foley) what happened there. Upon moving boxes in to the attic he discovers a box left there with a projector and multiple reels of Super 8 footage inside. He discovers a recording of the family that lived there prior to them being hung from a tree on one reel and four other families being murdered on the other reels. As he investigates further in to each killing he finds they're all connected and much more as it starts to drive him mad.<br/><br/>As far as being creepy and disturbing the movie really works. The music (by veteran composer Christopher Young) is very haunting and effective and there are several startling moments which are definitely satisfying if that's what you're looking for. Hawke dominates every scene and Derrickson's directing is stylish and fitting. Derrickson's screenplay is intriguing as well but once it gets to the supernatural elements of the story it starts to lose it's effect a little and becomes a little clichéd. I found the film much more effective and disturbing when it was just about murders that were probably arranged by some deranged lunatic rather than some form of a supernatural being. Once a film like this turns to fantasy it seems less creepy and disturbing (to me). A horror film is much scarier when it's something that could really happen. Still it has plenty of great scares and memorable scenes and it works for the most part. It is a grade A production made on a budget of just $3 million so it's an impressive achievement by any measure. Fans of horror films should more than be pleased.<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qTKOxmDvq0"
"MannyTheMovieMan","7","0","1","15 October 2012"," Solid, at times flawed, horror film
","Sinister is a solid spook tale involving a creepy deity and an author trying to piece together the mystery of slaughtered families and missing children. Ethan Hawke turns in a strong performance as the nearly has-been author who, while trying his hand at writing a non-fiction true crime book, discovers some telling and disturbing super 8 films involving shocking murders. The film is well paced and well made. The grainy films of the crimes committed are truly shocking and offer up the film's strongest, most disturbing moments. The perpetual atmosphere of dread is also effective as is Christopher Young's inventively freaky musical score. The good however does not hide Sinister's less successful aspects, chief among them the villains at the core of the story. The Mr. Boogie demon is simply too bland to be as scary as the film assumes he is and the brew of killer ghost children lack any sense of creepiness (the unimpressive make up on the child actors is partly to blame) Sadly this prevents what could have been a true fright fest from achieving great heights of terror. The producers were unable to recapture the clever and genuine scares of Insidious. It's worth look for affecionados of the genre."
"zetes","7","0","1","15 October 2012"," Too many cheap scares harm what is otherwise a very good horror film
","Ethan Hawke stars as a true crime writer who moves with his family into the house where a grisly murder occurred a short while ago. He immediately discovers a box of home movies in his attic (which appear to have been placed there after the police investigation) which show the murder. And not only that one, but several other murders from years past which seem to be connected. As Hawke explores the movies further, strange things begin happening in the house. This is most certainly a scary movie. I was honestly in constant terror all through it. Yet, I have to admit, I didn't really love it. I had a lot of problems. The whole situation is freaky, so why does the director (who previously made the awful Exorcism of Emily Rose) feel the need to scream at us to get us to jump? One also has to question Hawke's actions through much of the film. An antagonism with the local police is set up in the first sequence, but it never makes any real sense. Hawke never seems to be the kind of guy who would obstruct justice for his book, and, really, even if he did give new information to the police (and he absolutely would have called them immediately when he discovered what was in the box), how would that effect his book adversely? Not that it really matters, because the horror is revealed to be supernatural anyway, but it just seems like a pointless obstruction to set up. So, in short, effective, but I'm not exactly happy HOW it is effective."

","See this in the movie theater. That's the first statement I'd like to make in this review. The film is very dark, very suspenseful, and frightens you when it intends to. Most horror films nowadays sadly make the audience laugh in mockery when it tries to spook them (Paranormal Activity Sequels). Yet, this film made the audience jump and scream at its demand.<br/><br/>I will not spoil the movie for you, but it's story is very different, yet interesting for a horror film. I thoroughly enjoyed the story as it progressed and built up to the climax. The one flaw I found in the film was that I figured out the key revelation before it was given at the end of the film. Again, I won't tell you what the surprise was, but I think most audience members figured it out since we were all sucked into the film when it began.<br/><br/>So, in conclusion: 1. See this in theaters during the Halloween season, because packed audience has the potential to make it more frightening. I had the pleasure of watching this movie with a good crowd (the kind that didn't talk or make jokes during suspenseful moments)<br/><br/>2. Scares you with story-telling and acting, as opposed to seeing gore and blood.<br/><br/>3. Good luck going into your attic after watching ""Sinister"". Especially if it's your typical, empty, dusty, dark room of the house."
"idontknowiknowthatidontknow","7","0","7","12 October 2012"," SiNiStEr viciously rapes and kills all other main stream Hollywood horror movies with unrelenting brutality
","September, 2005. As I sat in the packed auditorium watching The Exorcism of Emily Rose, I immediately knew within the first 20 minutes into the film that the scenes and images I've seen so far is the work of a horror director of a like mind. That is, a mind of horror, unrelenting viciousness, a silent and tranquil bloodbath of an imagination. It takes one to know one, and I knew instantly we were of like minds, and I was going to watch very closely all of his future works.<br/><br/>Fast forward seven years, catching the 10 p.m. show of SiNiStEr on Oct. 12, 2012 Thursday night, I eagerly anticipate this work. During the film, I saw probably the most chilling and ingenious five second scene in my entire movie watching experience thus far(I'll give you a clue so you know what I'm talking about after you watch it: it had something to do with a laptop). And I see 3 other very excellent scenes. All in all, it shot straight to my all time top 10 list(I've seen at least 3000 movies), and the best, I repeat best horror film I've ever seen. It was almost watching my own work, because it is very similar to a film I would've made if I had the opportunity. <br/><br/>While there's some room for improvement, it viciously rapes and kills all other main stream Hollywood horror movies with unrelenting brutality and an odd touch of subtle tranquility.<br/><br/>On a side note, I knew I kind of ruined the full potential of my movie experience by watching the trailer because they included that best 5 second scene. I hate the trailer editor so much, why did you have to put the best scene in the whole movie into the trailer? You can be rest assured, I will not watch the next Scott Derrickson's movie trailer. So if you haven't seen the trailer, please don't, and go watch the movie on the big screen."
"lucyrichards27","7","0","6","9 October 2012"," Truly terrifying but long-winded.
","'Sinister' is about a crime novelist who moves his family into a new home to start his new book. He finds found footage in the attic which reveals a string of related murders. In every murder scene, there's a symbol and an image of a paranormal entity. So obviously, he starts to investigate; with devastating consequences.<br/><br/>The trailer for this movie is one you see and go 'screw that, there's no way I'm watching it!'. And it definitely delivered the scares. It was terrifying. I've never jumped so hard at one of the moments in it. There was also loads of creepy and disturbing imagery, dark cinematography and PLENTY of jumpy bits. The only problem I had with it is that it spent too much time focusing on the footage and not enough action happening to the family. I don't know anyone else with this opinion but I definitely felt that way about it."
