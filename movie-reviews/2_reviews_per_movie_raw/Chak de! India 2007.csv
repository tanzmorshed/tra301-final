"devs_17","10","80","100","10 August 2007"," MY views on CHak De India
","In plain and simple words, I loved CDI. Heck, even if you take SRK out of it, I would still love it! This movie is about a man trying to prove his dedication and love for his sport, his people, and his country. This is about a man scorned by the nation, shunned by his close ones, and his redemption in the way he knows best. Its this main underlying theme that makes CDI special. This theme is so universal, and so identifiable, that your heart connects instantly.<br/><br/>CDI is about Indian sportswomen coming to the forefront, about the stark and grim realities staring at our national sport, and the reasons behind that. It is about unity in diversity, strength in weakness, and putting the team above oneself. Its about the sacrifices one has to make in order to achieve his goals. Its about the success of true sporting spirit! Its real, yet entertaining. Its patriotic without being jingoistic. Its international, yet soaked in Indianness. Its a collage of the different states of India, and the difficult but fruitful formation of this collage.<br/><br/>I have never played or watched or been interested in hockey! But this movie does not need that to touch your heart. All it needs is some patriotism, humility and goodness in your heart. If thats in abundance, I am sure you will love it.<br/><br/>As for the performances, I would just say the entire team rocks. the keyword here is TEAM, as thats what this film is all about! Enjoy !"
"die_Heuchler","10","69","87","9 August 2007"," Lots of goosebumps, adrenaline rush and hot Segarika Ghatge
","What's in a name? Although initially this movie drew some amount of controversy outside India among viewers of non-Indian origin, the final movie just falsifies all those who advocated that the title ""Chak De! India"" was non-representative and was supposed to mean to only a niche of moviegoers. This movie would've been just what it is no matter what is was called or which country made it. Director Shimit Amin's entry in YRF simply transforms the entire perspective of movie-making and movie watching, both for the production house and the viewers.<br/><br/>Generally, you enter the theatre for a Yashraj movie expecting foreign locales, lots of song and dance, impossible and unbelievable characters, poor storyline, bad performances and a helluva investment but this movie delivers what no other Yashraj film ever did. Initially a sports movie, Chak De is rather a story of hope, courage, unity, integrity and the dreams. This film finally proves that you don't need Preity or Rani opposite SRK, and he all by himself, with a great screenwriter, great director and a good cast of the hockey team can make a great movie. There are lots of heroes in the movie - the women's team and these ladies simply steal the show. Mainly Bindiya, Balbir, Priya (the hot chic) and Komal.<br/><br/>See it gets very hard when there is an incredible amount of character development to do. There is a ghost that follows Kabir throughout the film and writer Jaideep Sahani makes a very good use of it. I do admit the fact that he's watched an incredible amount of Hollywood sports flick to develop this script, but he adds his very homely formulas and successfully manages to retain this film as an original Indian movie. Some parts of the film are directly lifted like the part of Kabir's ghost and few of the women, but all in all I refuse to say this is a Hollywood copy.<br/><br/>All in all, this is the best summer Hindi movie I've watched so far, not because it's got SRK but I love the script, the witty one-liners where sometimes with double meanings, every girl with her story (but I feel at most points the characters don't fully grow), well coordinated game sequences (though the practise scenes may bore you because there are a LOT), and above all the message the film delivers - when united, there's nothing you can't win over. The message is pretty well conveyed. You feel the adrenaline rush through the World Cup matches, a lot of goosebumps thanks to the great scoring by the Salim Sulaiman duo, well crafted script and good direction. Shimit's work is original contrary to the reservations I carried for him being a product of Ram Gopal Verma's school of direction.<br/><br/>SRK, as usual is great with his acting (and beard,) Vidya Malvade is the overly publicised captain but unfortunately other girls outdo her, the Jharkhand girls provide a dimension against contrasting Bindya and her queen bees. Segarika Ghatge's character Priya Saberwal is most memorable for her looks, style and for being hot and everything. The North East girls do answer some of vital questions of the North East Indians about their existence in their country as foreigners. The class conflict, egoistic chicks and their attitude problem and stuffs are absolutely well portrayed in the film.<br/><br/>All in all a well worth. Requires basic knowledge and enthusiasm in hockey. But avoid if you're looking for SRK as the lover-boy - he's the tough coach."
"hsm2310","8","68","86","11 August 2007"," Bollywood's First of its kind.......Perfection Personified
","Aha..Finally Bollywood has a full fledged sports movie.This one is certainly worth a watch for every movie lover.This is a very well made movie with nothing unnecessary being added.<br/><br/>Being an SRK fan I love to see him in all sorts of roles but these are the ones which bring the real actor out of him, Swades being another example.<br/><br/>Role of a coach is perfectly portrayed by SRK.He is the most energetic actor around and he has put it all into it.The story of this movie moves very subtly and augments the excitement every next second.<br/><br/>For a country like India with its national game as hockey this movie was long due.Finally, when it has arrived,it hasn't disappointed.It has also indirectly displayed the crippled Indian sports system which needs much improvement.Lets hope concerned people learn something from it.This movie can really do wonders for the next generation of aspiring hockey players.<br/><br/>CDI is entertaining,insightful,inspiring and yet very simple which is its greatness.This movie succeeds in bringing out tears and giggles and also lets the adrenaline flow in full pace.<br/><br/>The cinematography and editing are equally good.They succeeded in capturing each moment with its complete emotion.<br/><br/>The director has treated the subject extremely well and has brought 100% from all the new actors.The character selection was spot on too. SRK and all others rocked!!!! All in all 10/10. Nothing less for this one!"
"VirginiaK_NYC","8","50","64","10 August 2007"," A full cup, a nice surprise from SRK & YRF
","Having originally planned to both not see Chak De and also to hate it, I went to see the first show and I now love it very much!!<br/><br/>Two nights ago I saw Kal Ho Naa Ho for the 100th time. I found it beautiful, as always, but also realized it never makes me want to cry. Chak De!, on the other hand, is relatively ""plain"" to look at, and understated (at least for Bollywood), and I felt that wonderful emotional brimming-up-but-not-quite-over time and again throughout the story.<br/><br/>The whole thing about this team of girls from all over India who have to be made into a team really works - you get to know enough about several girls to have a secure sense of the essence of each -- the one with the bad temper, the one whose husband wants her to come home and cook, the senior player who resents the new coach's control, the ones who are out for themselves -- and the problem each presents in relation to SRK's task of making a team out of a collection of individuals <br/><br/>Of course this is any coach's job, but I like the moral resonance with the sad back-story of Shah Rukh Khan's character. Kabir Khan, like the real Indian player on whom the story is based, is an Indian Muslim. He was unjustly accused of throwing a match to Pakistan, and lost his career. A team where all have the identity ""India"" is an actual team; implicitly I think a country with the identity ""India"" doesn't engage in persecutory projection and hatred toward a member perceived as ""other.""<br/><br/>A note about the photography, I like the use of a dusty tone for the first half of the movie, and then a much brighter color skin for the second half, when we leave India and practice fields and go to Australia. The girls' exposure to the bigness and luxury of the west was handled so nicely - we're given their pleasure in all that's new to their eyes--giant swimming pools, exercise machinery, lavish hotel buffets -- but in passing: the Bollywood Visual Excess machine is not in operation, and the shed has several locks on the door. At some official function, we get to see them all in saris and a bit of makeup, but here too it's all under control, they're all dressed alike and half of them hate it.<br/><br/>Shah Rukh is great. There is no sentimentality in the movie and his character is restrained. The music -- no ""songs"" -- is varied and good -- if I could do without the rap music (for life!!), I loved the Sufi refrain that turns up over and over, that seems to express SRK's character's anguish in separation, longing for reunion (with God).<br/><br/>I've always felt that sadness was quite nearby for Shah Rukh -- here he neither conceals nor dramatizes it, he just lets us feel it. On a more mundane note, though I love Shah Rukh in all his Karan-Johar-selected beautiful clothes, I found it relaxing to see him in a small number of normal coach's costumes, shirts, khakis, and blazers that appropriately looked bought off the racks in Macy's.<br/><br/>The movie really never hits a wrong note. It's also just wonderful in its feminist position. Generally speaking I feel just boredom and agitation at movie violence; in this one, when the girls beat up boys who'd been harassing them, I felt joy."
"ashishgautam87","8","44","56","11 August 2007"," well done Shahrukh!!!!!!!
","As Shahrukh khan is trying do work in different type of movies than he has done till now(mostly romantic) he makes an attempt at the sports genre and delivers yet another brilliant performance.<br/><br/>The story is of the Indian women hockey team which because of its poor performance and lack of sponsors is unable to find a good coach.Kabir Khan (Shahrukh Khan ) a former national hockey team player steps in to take the responsibility of the new coach .The rest of the movie shows how he takes Indian women hockey team to a new hight and how he regains his lost dignity The plot of the movie is linear and predictable without any twist or surprises, in fact it is quality of direction and acting by Shahrukh khan ( well supported by the rest of the cast),which sucks you in the movie and does not let you get bored. Music of the movie is good including the title song which is quite inspirational.It has to be said that good level of effort has been put into every part of the movie whether it is casting or hockey(matches)choreography (which is acceptable).<br/><br/>Although the winning streak of the team at the world cup may seem to an extent unrealistic but overall Chak De India can be said as an entertaining and inspirational movie and is a must watch for every Shah Rukh Khan fan and critic for his brilliant performance."
"movie_freak_dubai","8","28","36","9 August 2007"," Very enjoyable movie with an excellent ensemble cast
","I have always loved good melodramatic underdog sports movies such as Remember the Titans,Invincible etc and now we have the bollywood version with Chak De India.<br/><br/>Hats off to the production team and the director for coming out with a fresh and very high quality product with excellently filmed hockey scenes that are quite realistic. I loved the wonderful cast of unknown girls who make up the Indian national women's hockey team. All of them had a part to play and they played them beautifully while executing some rigorous hockey action. They were excellent and gave wonderfully natural performances that should shame some of the already established actresses. Special mention should be given to the actress playing Bindya Naik. My favourite was the actress who played the spirited but pint sized forward from Haryana, she was really cute and funny in a tomboyish sort of way.<br/><br/>Shahrukh Khan was excellent in this movie..... his best performance since Swades in my opinion as he played against type. Had some wonderful moments with the girls and drew lots of cheers and laughs from the audience. If the movie succeeds then a lot of the credit has to go the King khan's crowd pulling power.<br/><br/>If this film succeeds and I sincerely hope it does, I think Amin (director) and Yashraj films are going to start a whole new trend a la DDLJ with a whole slew of sports related movies coming from Bollywood. I am sure cricket will be next on the agenda.<br/><br/>A thoroughly enjoyable ride....go watch it.<br/><br/>P.S. - some interesting trailers shown as well Laga Chunari Main Daag, Aaja Nachle and Goal (the Indian bend it like beckham maybe?)"
"to_mea","10","44","60","12 July 2007"," Saw this movie in a premier- Well Worth the Watch
","When I first saw the first previews I thought it looked horrible, but after a while I saw the second promo and it looked so good. Then after there was a special screening with the director, so I got a special chance to see it, and all I have to say is that this one of my favorite movies of all time. Everything in the movie was very well handled, I loved everyone in the movie but shah rukh khan was freaking awesome, i love shahrukh khan with all my heart, hes so great in every movie, and the director was so amazing, after this movie i so thanked him for making this movie, this movie is one of ask ing, reminds me of the aamir khan movie lagaan, its well wordy everyones watch, this movie definitely should get an Oscar, the music was so splendid, i hope you guys love the music, and everything about this movie was very nice. This is a lot better then most shahrukh khan movies I watch, and this has to be one if finest performances ever, thank u shahrukh Khan for staying in bollywood you truly are the best actor ever!"
"salilgoyal","9","53","74","10 August 2007"," Predictable Yet Great
","Bollywood finally Manages to Pull out a Wonderful Sports Movie and After some upsets, Yash Raj Production comes with a brilliant film (Though they have nothing to do with it (Except the money).. Real stars are indeed the hockey players, SRK and the director Shimit Amin).<br/><br/>Movie starts seven years back when Shahrukh Khan is accused of Match fixing in a hockey world cup final. After seven years, he returns to coach a hopeless Women hockey team. The rest of the movie deals with his journey to glory of the National team..<br/><br/>The things that stands out for me are.. the Team. Talented actresses gathered from all over the country have done a wonderful job. Acting was top class. Shahrukh Khan have played a character that suits his age and does seriously well. Hockey sequences are great and do give a feel of an international tournament. A nice blend of funny and amazingly inspiring dialogs adds to the brilliance.<br/><br/>However, the movie has its share of shortcomings. Most of the times, movie successfully manages to overshadow the predictable nature of the story, but the ending sequence was absolutely the same what i thought of before the movie started. We all knew what would happen in the end, but a bit of fine tuning would have made this film a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Anyways, 'Chak de India' is not just a brave attempt. It goes beyond that tag. It's a wonderful and a courageous attempt. A movie that manages to match the brilliance of Jo Jeeta Wahi Sikander."
"rar_ind","10","39","55","13 August 2007"," Best of 2007!
","We have seen a lot of underdog sports movies over the years which have been inspirational,cinematic and realistic...chak de India follows the realistic genre..... the film is very predictable in most parts but what makes the film memorable is the performance of the actors,screenplay,direction and also the background score...<br/><br/>its a patriotic movie which depicts the story of women's hockey in India,the difficulty faced by the coach in uniting a diverse team and finally make them successful...srk pulls of a fantastic performance without his signature songs and dance...he has silenced all his critics with this performance....amin deserves a perfect 10 for direction which makes him the director to look out in the future....bgm is great throughout the movie...finally all those young girls deserve a standing ovation for their respective roles(most of them are débutante's) My verdict: a must watch...best of 2007"
"dsoumya","7","35","49","11 August 2007"," SRK + Girl Power
","It is so refreshing to see an actor as good as ShahRukh Khan, being given a good role. Here he is stripped from all the gloss and sheen and most of the unnecessary melodrama and the final result is surprisingly entertaining! The story is really simple and there are not really very many surprises in the plot but you really don't care. ShahRukh shows again how much he can entertain given a chance and the director gives him the space to do so. The girls who make up the team he is coaching are really delightful and the time spent developing their stories was time well spent. The director could have eased of a little bit on patriotism where it was not directly relevant, but it doesn't really mar the whole experience.<br/><br/>Overall a fun experience! You will not even notice the absence of many songs!"
"sid_rich","9","10","12","15 August 2012"," I can count 11 Topics that were addressed in this Movie!!!
","I had taken my entire office to see this film, wanted them to observe and learn team-work and team management. I saw this movie again on TV today as a part of our Independence Day celebrations.<br/><br/>This movie very brilliantly addresses so many interesting and thought-provoking topics like --- 1. States Vs The Nation. 2. Cricket Vs all other sports in India. 3. Problem of Muslims in India. 4. Career-Woman Vs Family. 5. Men-sports Vs Women-Sports. 6. How players are treated from smaller towns and states. 7. How north-eastern states are treated as 'tourists' in other states. 8. Women harassment in the streets of India. 9. Team spirit and team management techniques. 10.Hockey as a sport. 11.Patriotism<br/><br/>Am so happy to see an Indian film made so well and with so much of honesty and efforts in detail. The makers of this film have surprisingly dished-out a near-perfect movie. They should be real proud of such works.<br/><br/>I had seen this movie twice in 2 different cinema theaters in Mumbai, and both theaters cater to vastly different sections of our society, and this movie got the same exact treatment from both the crowds. There were whistles and loud cheers in almost every scene of the 2nd half."
"Peter_Young","9","8","11","27 January 2012"," A superior sports film, brilliantly led by Mr. Khan
","Chak De India is without a doubt a one-of-a-kind Hindi film, one that you'd hardly ever expect to see in Indian cinema, and one that is at par with any great foreign production. It is an exceptional sports film, more because there's much more to it than just a series of games, and you never care about the fact that the ending is easy to predict. Shimit Amin, who previously directed Ab Tak Chapphan, directs the film with great skill, care, and feeling for the subject. Jaideep Sahni is responsible for the fantastic script, and that's where we get an original example of expert storytelling.<br/><br/>This is the story of Kabir Khan, once a hockey star and a captain of the Indian team. Seven years ago, he was accused of treason in favour of Pakistan because he missed a crucial penalty against them. Being a Muslim and being good sport about it did the job and, branded a traitor, Kabir left his ancestral home in shame. We know nothing about what he's been through in these seven years, but we do know that he's got a new chance to prove his innocence when he comes back as the coach of the Indian woman's field hockey team. A chance as crucial as this damned penalty stroke.<br/><br/>The second half is much stronger than the first (not that this one's bad), but that's the case with most sports films as the most enjoyable sequences are often in later portions, when the matches finally take place. And well, it is just full of suspense, tension, and even though I could easily predict the ending, the script and direction were good enough to keep me on the edge of my seat and give me quite a few goosebumps throughout it. In fact several moments throughout the matches were so exhilarating and overwhelming that I found myself jumping up off my seat with sheer joy.<br/><br/>Technically the film is superb. The cinematography is amazing, with the camera moving intelligently to focus the viewer's attention on the proceedings. The film is efficiently edited, and the background score more than contributes to the film, building tension where necessary, and making everything so much more captivating. The title track, ""Chak De India"" is really a treat. It is patriotic, joyful, and very well used in the film. That the film's songs atypically play only over montage sequences, as opposed to the traditional style of song and dance, is certainly a great plus.<br/><br/>Shahrukh Khan is tremendous. This is one of his most restrained performances, yet his charismatic presence is as evident as ever. He is perfectly natural and controlled in a most nuanced portrayal that never fails to convey the inner pain, the frustration, the hope and the quiet determination to clear his name and finally make a place in the sun. The supporting cast is roundly good, and the girls are great as a group. Shilpa Shukla enjoys the meatiest part, an assertive girl driven by ego and jealousy, and she is excellent. Sagarika Ghatge and Vidya Malvade are pretty and convincing.<br/><br/>Chak De India can be described as patriotic, feminist, but for me it's more than anything about willpower and the importance of hard and collaborative work. It teaches and reaffirms that what really makes such games work--and for that matter, many other things in life--is lots of training, patience, and team work, without which nothing would quite click. According to me the best Hindi film of 2007; a thrilling and inspiring cinematic experience which is worth many a repeat viewing for more than one reason. Take a bow, Mr. Amin, Mr. Sahni, Mr. Khan, and all of you, twelve brave cuties."

","Shimit Amin's 'Chak De India' is easily one of the best films ever made in the history of Indian Cinema. Why? A fantastic script, which holds your attention from start to end, coupled with natural performances and bloody good dialogs. Chak De India proved to be a huge success at the box office internationally, and it deserved every bit of it. I love this film, I've seen like 4-5 times already. Chak De India is cinema at its very best! <br/><br/>Performances: I am a fan of Shahrukh Khan. His performance is astounding. He swiped all the awards for the best actor category, and yes those awards were meant to come on his kitty. SRK Rules!

"shahabkalim-1","10","15","29","10 August 2007"," United They Stood
","Making a sports based movie in my opinion is a very tricky affair because of two things.Firsty,99% of the sports based films have the same conclusion,i.e David winning over a Goliath ,which the audience knows from the very beginning and Secondly, no matter how much tipsy topsy turvy the screenplay is,the climax scene is where the minnows and the audience rejoice ,exception being Rocky I ,which is one of the best motion pictures ever produced in my opinion.<br/><br/>Be it The Longest Yard,Bend It Like Beckahm,Major League,Angels in the Outfield or our very own Lagaan ,Iqbal ,they all have the same thing. A bunch of not so good team-mates end up winning the world.So in short,when it comes to sporty flicks, we all know everything,yet we watch it and enjoy the every bit of it.<br/><br/>Chak De India , is good but not great.Yet I believe it couldn't have been better.Confused?So am I.The theme is good, the performances are good, the direction is good,but you know what, the sport called Hockey looks dull (which in reality it isn't).The movie starts of well,but one doesn't feel the excitement(in the matches) which one noticed, when say, Kachra of Lagaan got a Hattrick or when Charlie Sheen did it for The Indians in Major League.Hockey doesn't look good on the big screen but Shah Rukh Khan and Bindya Naik(dunno her name) make this movie work. I think the coach and the rebellion plot and then the Mcdonald scenes were terrific. Shah Rukh as Kabir Khan is solid and the girls give him ample support.Dialogues are very good but I wish this movie was 15 mins shorter.And they could have used the title track more often.<br/><br/>Don't expect it to be another Mughal E Azam,but it ain't gonna be a dud either because those who were coming out of theatre looked positive.<br/><br/>United they stood,and they won the match,but sadly we are a nation which still believes in a Bhuvan hitting a six off the last ball and not a chick goalie saving a scorching shot so may be that's y I still consider Aamir Khan's Awwal Number as a fantastic movie.<br/><br/>7 OUT OF 10<br/><br/>Go enjoy Chak de India and Fcuk de box-office"

"suman_rbr","8","7","12","11 August 2007"," One the best sports movie made in India
","Great Movie......I can say that simply go and watch it specially girls.....<br/><br/>The story of the film is about a typical underdog winning the game. The aspect of coach seeking redemption by making his team win added lot of grip to the story. What makes this film different is extraordinary script writing and superb direction. Screenplay is just perfect. The entire film is realistic barring certain episodes demanding creative freedom. The writer avoided the board's politics aspect in the storyline, in order to focus on establishing each and every character of player well and then show how they change their attitude to become team players. The following scenes are defining moments of the film -<br/><br/>Shahrukh Khan did the role of a brilliant coach whose respect is battered by the misconception and the media. He is exceptional as an inspiring and tough coach. The actor in Shahrukh dominates the star in this film. It is nice to see Shahrukh Khan doing purposeful films like Swadesh and Chak De India once in a while. The girls who played the women hockey team are exceptionally good. The girls who did the roles of Preeti, Balbir and Komal dominate the scene.<br/><br/>Cinematography is amazing. Music is good. The background music is peppy and suits the theme. Dialogues are very good. Editing is nice. It is nice to see Yashraj Films producing a purposeful film like this instead of box-office winning inspired popcorn entertainers.<br/><br/>The entire first half is concentrated on establishing all the characters in Hockey team and then inculcating the sense of belongingness among the team members. The second half is more entertaining with nice twists and engaging games. The plus points of the film are writing (Jaideep Sahni), performances (Shahrukh Khan), direction (Shimit Amin) and Cinematography (Sudeep Chatarjee). It is a sensible and a brilliant film with soul. On a whole, Chak De India (along with Lagaan and Iqbal) is one the best sports based films ever made in India. A must watch for everybody!!"
"Dingataca","Null","5","8","18 October 2007"," Each girl stands out, and in their own way, shine above SRK...
","Chak De! India is a sports film, made by Indians, for Indians, (well, not necessarily!), and is one of the better films of 2007 so far. I was reluctant to see the movie because of hype and criticism, but upon seeing it, I have realised that this movie is fantastic - and nothing can take that away.<br/><br/>Shah Rukh Khan - how can I describe this wonderful actor? His role was about undying love for the sport, and undying love for your country - something inspirational, beautiful, and so universal. It is so easy to relate to his character, heck, the guy had been despised, shunned, and loathed by his whole country, forced to leave his home, hated by one and all. He should have been scarred for life! But no, Chak De! India shows that with a little faith, your whole life will come spinning back to you.<br/><br/>It was clever to choose hockey, being our national sport - even though majorly overshadowed by cricket - it worked wonders. There were also no song/dance sequences in this movie, something I thought interesting and expertly handled. It takes skill to take the song and dance out of a Hindi movie and still have it being a hit, but Shimit Amin has handled this with great finesse. The hockey scenes were handled with such amazing expertise and know-how, it is close to Hollywood standards. (Note I said close) The real tone and plot of CDI is about proving that women are just as capable as men. However, CDI is not a feminist film. There is talent, brain, beauty, and practicality available in a woman, she should not be taken for granted. And I am glad to say that after seeing this film, she probably won't be! <br/><br/>Shimit Amin has made an amazing film. I am very proud to call myself an Indian, this movie is excellent. The ending is extremely predictable, but it was handled very well - there is so much tension building up to it, and each minute you clench your fists and lean forward in your chair, waiting for that goal to be scored.<br/><br/>My favourite part: the 16 girls. Each one uniquely has their say in the movie, though the few from further regions of India etc, had lesser to do. Yet they all played their parts and added the one thing CDI needed - grace. The focus was mainly on a few girls, for example Vidya Malvade, Sagarika Ghatge. But I liked the way all the girls worked so well together - they became a real TEAM, which is what CDI is all about. I also admired the way each girl in a way had her own personal storyline behind her, which all added to the tension of winning the World Cup! My personal favourite would be the little one, Chitrashi Rawat as Komal, I thought she showed fabulous potential and her gutsy little performance had me grinning.<br/><br/>So move over guys, the girls are here!"
"amanmann","10","5","8","3 September 2007"," Overall an entertaining film. Great direction.
","I was very pleased by the film. I can't tolerate SRK usually but he gives a powerful performance on this one and isn't his irritating self. Also the unifying theme behind the film about the world cup is something that appeals to everybody. The only disappointment was that I thought this film to have been inspired by a true story but guess not..Actually the best the Indian womens hockey team ever did in a world cup was finishing 4th. <br/><br/>Anyway a must watch film indeed.<br/><br/>Also great direction from a not so experienced director. The game scenes are pretty well shot. Good job."

","I was there when it released. To be honest, I was expecting a good film with expected Hindi film touches but it turned out surprisingly even better experience. I loved the fact there was no need to add a romantic sub-plot involving SRK, since a typical Hindi movie is considered incomplete without the lead actor falling in love.<br/><br/>It is a simple story told skillfully by Shimit Amin and Jaideep Saini with SRK's one of the most memorable performances. Among the girls, 3-4 girls get most of the attention. I wish we had been told more about the other girls like Gul Iqbal but then such compromises have to be made to keep the film's length in check. The hockey matches are filmed very well without any sensationalisation. There is no hate or jingoism. At the end, you walk home with a feeling of triumph, the triumph of an underdog."

","How often do we get a very simple story that makes the biggest impact possible? How often does a dull colorless looking film put a huge smile on your face by the end of the screening? You don't see much of that in Hindi cinema. Chak De does not preach, it does not bore, in fact it's just telling you a story with one sequence or another the viewer can relate to.<br/><br/>Kabir Khan, once a caption of the Indian hockey team is accused of match fixing due to a leaked picture of a casual handshake between him and the Pakistani Captain. One circumstance leads to another, having Kabir fired and out of the team. Not only is Kabir fired but also heavily criticized and labeled as a traitor.<br/><br/>Years later, Kabir returns to hockey. Not to play, but to coach a group of young girls from various states. Then starts Kabir's journey to lead his team to victory and regain his lost respect. As they say, the journey is more important than reaching the destination. Chak De is one tough journey of a coach and his group of girls who don't even know how to play as a team.<br/><br/>Chak De talks about a good number of issues that we all see in our everyday lives. However, it's not the talk of the issues that win you over but it's how subtly the writer points it all out.<br/><br/>Let's analyze: Chak De talks about India's national sport - No, not cricket. Very few know that field hockey was known as India's national sport in which we have received Olympic honors decades ago. Since the cricket wave hit, Indians forgot about their national sport.<br/><br/>Chak De talks about the role of women in our country. Normally seen as housewives, Indian woman in sports is frowned upon. Chak De mentions that in scenes when a player talks to Kabir about her husband. Or when the girls are rejected permission to go to the tournament.<br/><br/>Finally, Chak De is basically about playing for your country over anything else. Whether your Punjabi, Gujrati, Tamil, Bengali or Bihari - It's about I-N-D-I-A. As mentioned in a striking scene in the initial reels.<br/><br/>there are so many remarkable scenes in the movie. To name a couple, the McDonalds scene is genius. Of Course the climax is electrifying.<br/><br/>The writing is flawless. Screenplay glues you. The dialogues are touching, fresh and not a tad bit cheesy. Bravo Jaideep Sahni! Salim-Suleman's music is underrated. The title song and Maula mere are bout gems. Background score is amazing.<br/><br/>Shimmit Amin's direction is top notch. It was his second film after a thrilling Ab Tak Chappan. Hard to believe? All girls are natural. Some are hockey players in real life and some are in reel life. They all play their parts flawlessly. Especially the one's that play Balbir, Komal, Vidiya, Alia and Preeti, respectively.<br/><br/>Shah Rukh Khan is the heart and soul of Chak De India. Every expression, dialogue, mannerism, smile, cry, it's flawless. He carries Chak De all the way. A subtle act that speaks so loudly about the man's talent. One of his best performances. (Says a lot since he's got a great resume of performances) Aplaudworthy! Overall - Chak De is poetic, controversial and nothing short of a classic."
"biman-tripathy","10","4","6","8 March 2011"," Never expected such a movie from Indian film industry, and such a response from Indian audience
","Felt like sharing my experience of watching this movie some 4 years ago...<br/><br/>One fine day none of my friends were in mood to attend college. So we all decided to bunk college and visited nearby theater. Most of my friends suggested to go for Chak De India, while I joined their oppositions who wanted to watch some Hollywood movie (don't remember what that movie was).<br/><br/>Few reasons for which I thought this movie was not worth a watch:<br/><br/>1)This movie is based on Indian sports... and not every movie is ""Lagaan"" (if you haven't seen Lagaan, that should be your next target).<br/><br/>2)This movie is based on Hockey (the 'dying' National Sports), while Lagaan is based on Cricket (the second most Important thing in India after Religion).<br/><br/>3)This movie is based on 'Women's Hockey'!...dude, never in Indian history any movie was made based on women sports (just ignore Bend It Like Bekham... it wasn't an Indian Movie).<br/><br/>4)The movie is starring Shahrukh Khan - the best 'commercial' actor, while Lagaan is starring Aamir Khan - Mr Perfectionist. <br/><br/>OK. I accept. I HAD NEVER BEEN SO WRONG ABOUT A MOVIE BEFORE (forget movie, I had never been so wrong about anything before).<br/><br/>Within the first 10 minutes, I was both mentally and emotionally connected with 'Kabir Khan'- played by Shahrukh Khan. I laughed, I cried, I clapped. Every person in the theater respected the National Anthem by standing up, when it was played in a scene in the movie...damn man I felt so patriotic. This indeed is the best performance by Shahruk Khan. I stopped criticizing him after this. I cannot forget his expressions after the final match...and the background song- Maula mere le le meri jaan (meaning- O lord, take away my life). Every time I see that scene, I try my best to hide my tears...just like I feel every time I see the climax of 'October Sky'.<br/><br/>Well, I thank my friends with whom I was arguing in the beginning. Hats off to the creators of this movie - for bringing back my hope in Hindi movies.<br/><br/>""Watch It AND Get Inspired"" - CHAK DE!"
"denizen_blank","10","7","13","11 August 2007"," Awesome!
","This movie is 1000% formulaic, but the formula works perfectly! The girls are super cute, fresh, spunky, and--what I haven't seen in a long time--exhibit all different kinds of Indian 'looks' (as opposed to every single one of them looking like Kareena with their hair and skin bleached). These girls have a really natural charm, and actually represent their states. I don't know when the last time was I saw a girl on the screen who actually looked South Indian. Great acting all around, lots of chemistry between the characters, and SRK is the perfect actor to play a stern-yet-sensitive leader who gives ridiculous pep talks. This role plays to his strength and avoids his weaknesses (the vibrating crying face is down to a minimum). If you want to see a really fun, energetic, rah-rah-India film, this one's paisa vasool for sure. The only thing is that it represents the Indian public as really nasty and disloyal to its athletes. I'm not sure if that's realistic, but it's kind of an unpleasant part of the film. The girl who plays Komal Chauta is beyond cute! I would love to see more foul-talking, short-haired baby faces on the Indian screen."
"HeadleyLamarr","9","9","18","11 August 2007"," Chak de Chak de, Ek Hockey doongi main Rakh ke!
","Yes I went to see the film because I saw Shahrukh looking super good in the promos (what can I say - I am a shallow person!). But what kept me glued to the seat with my eyes fixed on the screen was a motley crew of ordinary girls with extra-ordinary attitude. AND I like hockey, wish the glory days were back.<br/><br/>Chak de India is an out and out sports film, there is a disgraced coach, there is a team that is fragmented and needs team spirit, and there are matches to be won and glory to reap. The film follows a rather linear path and does not dish out any surprises except one - it is unpredictably wonderful! My football and basketball fanatic little nephew was shouting ""goal"" at every score and the audience was as mesmerized at this tournament being played out on celluloid as they would have been at the live event. There were cheers and claps at every win. Why? Because this team was real, we watched them turn into a team and we yearned for their day in the lights as much as they did. Of course it was a Cinderella story - but what made the story poignant was the fact that all this happened for real, that there was indeed an extraordinary player who was disgraced and redeemed himself in exactly this fashion. <br/><br/>The script was taut, the editing was superb, there were no unnecessary moments in the film. There were no cringe inducing dialogs, no useless song and dance routines, no romance backdrop of the coach falling for the star (a la Bend it Like Beckham). The music was uplifting and extremely well integrated into the narrative - Kuch Kariye was inspirational, Maula mere haunting, Badal Pe Paon a most exuberant transition from stuck in the back waters to out in the happening place of the World Cup! The girls were superbly cast - they represented the true face of India, with all its diversity and its problems that relate to this diversity. Their bickering, their in fights, quest for personal glory and how this slowly changed into a camaraderie was extremely well done. Komal Chautala (Chitrashi Rawat) was CUTE, Bindiya Nayak (Shilpa Shukla) was awesome as the bad girl of the team, Preeti Sabharwal (Segarika Ghatge) was hot, Tanya Abrol was awesome as the Hockey Doongi Balbir, Vidya Sharma (Vidya Malvade) was good as the conflicted housewife turned goalie/captain, but my personal favorite was SoiMoi (Nisha Nair) the girl from Jharkhand. Every one was given their moments to tell us why we should care about them. The other supporting cast of the assistant coach and the federation people did their job well. Of course I had gone in expecting to see SRK in a hot new incarnation. What I saw was a man who was a coach, a haunted man with agony in his eyes, a fire in his belly and a desire to redeem himself at all costs. After about the first 10 minutes I did not even care that Mr. Khan was looking the best he has done in years - he was coach Kabir Khan, the tarter, the disciplinarian, the psychologist, the motivator and above all the man who was in for the long haul and was going to make a miracle happen.<br/><br/>Shimit's direction was superb, Jaideep Sahni wrote a stirring tale, and together with the actors they made sure that this was not just another sports Cinderella story. This was a tale about the empowerment of women, and showcased their ability to triumph in the face of innumerable hurdles both in the home and outside. Chak De!!"

"ijzeren_jan","3","11","28","25 May 2009"," Boring, utterly predictable and overly patriotic
","Perhaps my expectations of Chak De! India were too high, since the movie is so well-received on IMDb and elsewhere. Granted, sports movies aren't exactly my cup of tea, and super-mega-star Shahrukh Khan isn't exactly my favourite actor. Even so, I was very disappointed about this movie. I had hoped for something better.<br/><br/>What disturbs me most is the extreme predictability of CDI. Basically, we have two simple ingredients: a former hockey international, who in the past was unjustly accused of disloyalty after a lost match. That was the end of his career and reputation, and the player disappeared from the scene for a number of years. And secondly, there is a hopelessly disorganised, pitiful team of poor hockey players, who are supposed to represent India in the world series. Once we find out that our former super player is going to be the trainer of this team, we basically know everything. From that moment on, the entire movie is painfully predictable, and doesn't hold a single surprise. While watching it, I caught myself several times on saying: ""Look, now Australia is going to make a goal""... and it was only a matter of seconds before Australia really made its goal.<br/><br/>Sure, this type of movies tend to be like that. But Gods and Saints, couldn't they have added at least a few original ideas? The entire movie is so horribly... schematic and formulaic. Look at this loose, poorly organised pack of players: one girl is nice-looking, one girl is always in a bad mood, one girl has a husband who refuses seeing anything else in her but a housewife, one girl is a tomboy, one girl is older than the rest and always making a fist towards the new coach. Reminds of the Smurf village! What we know in advance is that the new coach will manage to help them overcome their differences, forge them into a unity, and lead them towards a great victory. At least I was hoping to get to know them a little better, to witness a few interesting story lines... but nothing.<br/><br/>And that is precisely what I miss most in this movie: characters. Even about the Shahrukh Khan character there is little we find out, about the girls we find out next to nothing. Some argue this movie is not about Shahrukh but about the team; in my perception, however, this is a one actor movie. And with all due respect to Shahrukh, I don't think he is gifted enough as an actor to pull a movie entirely on his own. I have to admit: as Kabir Khan he is quite alright, even good. But nothing else. As for the girls: Bindia is the only one who somehow manages to catch the eye. In the case of the entire rest I miss role playing of any kind. I can't even say they were playing badly, since they weren't playing at all.<br/><br/>Another thing that irritates me in CDI, is exaggerated patriotism. Had it been an American movie, I'm sure many people would have reacted differently. I can tolerate patriotism and nationalism without much trouble, but not to such idiotic extent. Anyway, how credible is it that a team, after losing against Australia with 7:0, would meet the very same team again in the finale, turning them into minced meat this time? There is a lot I can buy in a movie, but not that.<br/><br/>Of course, the film has a not-so-hidden message: women aren't any worse at all. What a surprise! I don't know much about India, so perhaps this message is revolutionary over there (which I frankly doubt). For me it's not, and even if it were, I wouldn't need a movie like this one to convince me. The only other ""message"" I can accept somehow, is this: how easily public opinion can change its mind.<br/><br/>From the sound track, I like the title song. The rest of it is too average to save the movie. All in all, a boring and uninteresting movie, not good for anything higher than 3/10."
"crappydoo","2","14","38","5 March 2008"," What's so good about it?
","Finally watched the movie last night after listening to all the hype and rave reviews by almost all Indians I met. I was afraid the movie may be yet another 'masala' film but with a difference. I was also afraid that I'll come across as a movie with bad direction, a bad script and stereotypes; and unfortunately everything came true.<br/><br/>To be fair, the things going for the movie are:<br/><br/>* Fairly realistic acting, unlike other Hindi movies * Movie ends on a high note * Not a musical, also unlike other Hindi movies * Good casting and locations<br/><br/>However on the flip side:<br/><br/>* Not a great directorial achievement. * Average and predictable story. * Too preachy. * Shahrukh's character displays bad coaching skills. * Plays on stereotypes.<br/><br/>Sports films, if well made, are the ultimate feel good movies because they capitalise on the adrenalin rush that is provided by the sporting encounter. However 'Chak de India' is unable to recreate that. This effect was far better realised in Lagaan.<br/><br/>The movie provided a great opportunities that the director could have worked on:<br/><br/>* The dissimilarity of the various Indian cultures and the breaking down of interpersonal barriers when the players interacted on a one-on-one basis with each other. * Lesser focus on Shahrukh who is projected as a super hero rather than a human being with frailties. * A statement could have been made on the fickle mindedness of the sports mad Indian people and their constantly fluctuating loyalty and hatred. * The manipulative nature of the Indian media which focuses on 'creating' issues from non-events. * More focus on team building and combined team achievement.<br/><br/>However the director has relegated all of this to the background and focused more on the achievement of the main protagonist (like any other Hindi film) and his rise from the ditch to stardom. The movie felt inspired from Remember The Titans and plays out like that film too; however the quality of this one is so bad that its embarrassing.<br/><br/>2 stars for being different from other Bollywood movies."

I've seen quite a few of the latter, like ""Teen Wolf"" (1985), ""Major League"" (1989), ""Any Given Sunday"" (1999), ""Miracle"" (2004), ""Friday Night Lights"" (2004), and ""Bend It Like Beckham"" (2002), though the last one is not Hollywood. And not all of the above are pure sports movies and not really comparable. <br/><br/>Whatever, I've watched a lot of the kind, where you're really rooted to your seat and go for the team, wishing sooo hard that they'll win in the end. It's build up very much like one of those American films, with all these very different characters and the one or two players (bullies) who refuse to fit in at first. <br/><br/>But it's just so good and it pulls you in. Of course not all of the sixteen players (characters) get their due, but you find yourself going for them, hanging at the edge of your seat, crossing your fingers and hoping the director will have mercy with you and the team. <br/><br/>All the actors where overwhelming, I do love seeing Shah Rukh Khan-movies, but I just appreciated how he stood back in this one, being ""just"" the coach, having no love story for himself, he's just one of the team, really. It's just all about the sport. <br/><br/>I'm so looking forward to see all of the new faces in more movies. There wasn't one character/actress I didn't like. Even if they had somewhat negative roles, they were just awesome. I do hope they'll succeed in ""Bollywood"". <br/><br/>I can't say anything about the music as my computer broke down and I had to watch the movie on another one without any sound, but even so, I got totally sucked into the story and that means something, considering how much music/sound adds to a movie. <br/><br/>All in all I can just recommend this movie to anyone. I didn't know a thing about hockey, don't really care for the game, not hockey, not ice-hockey. But it's just like with ""Lagaan""; I didn't know anything about cricket (still don't know much), but you find you don't have to, you get pulled into the story nonetheless. Thanks to the director and the scriptwriter/screenwriter. <br/><br/>If you get the chance, go and watch it. You won't regret it."

(being a sports movie), I rushed for the evening show. Chak De!, one of the least publicized King Khan's movie, stands out among his love dramas. Based on a true story, Chak De! is one of SRK's best performances along with Swades. SRK even grew a beard to bring true Muslim look, which he personally dislikes to keep.<br/><br/>However, its not the SRK but the hockey team of 16 young girls which wins your heart. Each of them being state champions, merges slowly with each other to produce a true Indian Team with no differences. Movie depicts beautifully that how Indians survive and evolve with such high diversity in languages, food habits etc across boundaries. Though none of them are professional actors, they look very natural on screen.<br/><br/>Even if you are not fan of SRK or Hockey, run for the next show as this movie has already been a phenomenon in India.

","Indian movies are exploring new grounds and the talent is surely getting noticed in the new corporate Bollywood world, which is trying to implement the Hollywood studio system in this country. Director Shamit(Ab Tak 56) surely was the most talented from the Ram Gopal Verma lot and writer Jaideep Sahni also showed his intelligence in Khosla ka Ghosla, hence this movie sure was going to be properly executed product. And with corporate Bollywood's best production company Yashraj studios behind them, they were in good hands. But with the implementation of Hollywood style film making system we also implement the Hollywood clichés rather than the bollywood one.<br/><br/>Chak De India has explored new grounds for Indian cinema that is of the full blooded contemporary sports movie, which is completely new thing for Indian audiences, so surprises for them were stored in abundance. With the present patriotic flavor added in full jingoism, chakde surely was a good business and the creative team of the writer and director has taken its complete advantage. With a dash of many American sports movies for a start like ' miracle' , ' a league of their own' and ' remember the titans' to name a few, the duo added a good mix of Indian stereotypes over the American stereotypes used in those movies. So in Indian version we have the Punjabi power girl, a short stature, foul mouthed village girl, the arrogant senior players, mix of Jharkhand village girls and northeast girls and my favorite, for a bit sexed image a fair skinned, financially stable Punjabi girl( always looking hot, for thirsty male eyes) from Chandigarh university with a ignorant cricket star boyfriend to put into the mêlée. With them is the patriotic to the hilt coach( Shahrukh 'Kabir khan' ) who is the usual sports movie coach a 'baazigar' ( 'haar kar jitney wale ko baazigar kehte hai' ), who has to give loads of morality speeches to the girls like in jerry McGuire. This mixture surely creates a highly charged up drama which is well directed by shamit along with the CGI generated atmospheric hockey matches. Shahrukh and the 'all girls gang' have also delivered well to suit the flow of the story. And just like Hollywood, to give credibility to the contemporary storyline, the writer has based the story on the real events of Indian women's hockey commonwealth gold winning triumph in 2002, whose coach was a ex-player (apparently a Muslim) with a tarnished image due to a blundered goal-keeping performance against Pakistan twenty years ago, which led to match fixing speculations against him. While this real story was used to market the film, the storyline of the movie is completely different and has no apparent connections to the real issues affecting Indian hockey.<br/><br/>With the studio generously deciding not to give much pressure to the patrons mind, the movie ends up being a polished entertaining stereotyped product summed with jingoism aplenty, with no room for real women's hockey players who have went into the dark quickly after their commonwealth triumph. Go enjoy."

","***Spoiler's Alert***<br/><br/>Storyline: The story of the movie mostly revolves around how a former Indian hockey player who performed badly during his last tournament, finally lead Indian women's hockey team to world cup victory as a coach. He previously in his life failed to score during world cup final which ultimately resulted in Pakistan winning the world cup. He was mostly blamed for the defeat of Indian hockey team and people thought that he was more inclined towards the opponent team mostly because of his religion.The thing to watch is that how he unites an average looking Indian women's hockey team, and instills the feeling of true sportsman spirit and patriotism.<br/><br/>Music: Intensity of the music perfectly suited the movie. It was energetic and good to listen to. <br/><br/>Cinematography: It's slightly above average, but moments during the match were nicely captured. <br/><br/>Acting: Shahrukh Khan was amazing and truly justified his character of Kabir Khan as coach. Other actors who played the roles several players in the Indian women's hockey team also did a fantastic job. It was a consistent performance throughout.<br/><br/>Overall it's a must watch movie for both Shahrukh lovers and movie lovers. This movie would definitely lift the Bollywood standards."

","An underdog sports team in need of a serious makeover attempts to win a world championship--you've seen it before, and you can probably guess how it ends, but the production qualities are excellent, Bollywood idol Shahrukh Khan plays the coach with immense sensitivity and charm, and the group of young women who make up the team are a wonderful cross-section of the vast country that is India.<br/><br/>This is a national pride film, a film that makes the viewer cheer more than once, and perhaps will even bring some tears; like most Bollywood films, it is inordinately long for those accustomed to two hour movies, but unlike many Bollywood romances, there are no curious musical numbers that to Western eyes often interrupt the logical progression of plot. If you are into sports films with a Boffo Finish, looking for a perfect film for most young women with ambition, or merely a cross-cultural adventure, this is great fun."

","""The next 70 minutes are yours. Not even God can take it away from you. Go get them"". As Kabir Khan (Shah Rukh Khan) gives the speech to its hockey team, you feel the moment with him. As if you are standing in that locker room and you are going to play that hockey match with the rest of the crew. This feeling will follow you on a fantastic ride called as Chak De-India. This is not a story of champions. This is not a story of freedom. This is not a story of strength to win. This is not a story of extraordinary people who fight against out numbered enemies. But this is a story of gaining high spirits among individuals who come together and achieve something they never knew how to.<br/><br/>Kabir Khan is a newly appointed coach of Indian women's hockey team who are preparing themselves for upcoming World Cup championship. The hurdles for the coach are not just to bring the team together and train and teach what they exactly need to, but also to answer to the criticism from his fans about his missed stroke when he played in Men's hockey finals. Not to mention his fight against himself about that lost game. As the team is introduced at the signup desk, the women from every corner of India make you laugh and curious. They can be wearing a bully's attitude, I-am-so-hot attitude or just plain simple girls lived under the shadow of the family. But they have one thing in common. The passion and talent for the game. They can make friends or enemies among themselves, even though they are in the same team, but the journey ahead towards the final glory is extraordinary.<br/><br/>There was a movie. Ab Tak Chhappan, (2004) that shook so many audiences and critics. Shimit Amin, the same director, now handled Chak De, and surprisingly his knife feels as sharp as his last cut in 2004. The whole tone and attitude of excitement, pain, zyst and glory is so unbelievable that it feels as if Bollywood is waking up and breathing. The expressions on each player's face are captured magnificently and straight to the core. Jaideep Sahani, the writer who previously wrote Ram Gopal Verma's gangster thriller Company (2002) does a memorable comeback with Chak De. I mean the MacDonald's scene, the coach's speech, the final goal and the diligence of keeping away from any cheesy dialogues just makes me say one word. WOW!Thank You Aditya Chopra for bringing this team together.<br/><br/>Now definitely Shah Rukh Khan has to be mentioned here. He is not the usual, mindless college boy who whines over some troubled relationships just to shake those faint hearted who worship him. He is a tough and determined hockey player who knows what he is talking about. With a rough stubble and Ray Ban aviator sunglasses he makes his appearance felt. No clichés, just passion.<br/><br/>Well, the hockey team is rather something to watch, than to read right here. So just go ahead and walk in to this locker room and listen to the coach and chat with these passionate women.<br/><br/>My rating: 9/10."

","I am not what you would call a sports fan. I do not get any vicarious thrill watching someone else do what I can't. I appreciate great sportsmen/women like Tiger Woods or Lorena Ochoa or Danica Patrick, but I generally avoid watching unless it is a national event like the World Cup or the Olympics.<br/><br/>Having said that, I am a huge fan of sports movies. They are a source of excitement and inspiration if they are done well. This one is one of the best that I have seen.<br/><br/>It has so many good points, that it is hard to list them all. The obsession with national pride and the fact that a star player is scapegoated for a loss is first and foremost in this film. We are all allowed to make one mistake, aren't we? Not if your mistake costs the country to lose a title and lose face to a huge enemy. Kabir Khan (Shahrukh Khan) made such a mistake and it caused him to leave his home and go into exile for seven years.<br/><br/>He returned to take a job that no one wanted. He would coach a women's hockey team to the World Championships. No one wanted it because it was a women's team, and we all know that is usually just a Title IX requirement and not to be taken seriously. In fact, they didn't even want to fund the trip to the World Championships after he trained the team. Money was to be used for a men's team. Women belong barefoot and pregnant and in the kitchen, as one Arkansas politician put it some years ago.<br/><br/>To watch 150+ minutes of women's hockey, you have to have one hell of a story and some very interesting characters. The challenge of Khan transforming sixteen championship players from all over India into a team that puts India first, was mesmerizing. You know how the story will end. It ends as all sports movies do, but it is the journey that is fascinating. To see the neanderthal attitudes of the country transformed through excellence in sport is both exciting and sad. (Don't be so smug, America, your record on women isn't too much better.) If you are looking for an exciting movie that will thrill you beyond belief, then this is the one. Do not miss it."

SRK has been severely criticised for his recent movies, but that doesn't take away the fact that he is an outstanding actor, and that is clearly evident in this movie. Every word that he said made you feel like he meant it, it was one of the best performances by him, or if not the best.
Honestly, if some other actor, say Aamir Khan, Salman Khan, Ajay Devgan, Kamal Hasan or Mammooty played this role, it wouldn't have the rating it has now. No one else could play the role better than he can. I'm not saying this because I'm a huge fan, it's because it's the truth that has to be accepted.
This isn't the first time he has produced some top notch performances. He has delivered them as the romantic Aman in Kal Ho Naa Ho, and of course, Mohan Bhargava, the NASA engineer in the National Award winning movie Swades..."

","Chuck De India is a sports film based on real life incidence. Mir Ranjan Negi, Indian hokey player of inspired Shah Rukh Khan's role in ""Chak De! India"". Mir Ranjan Negi returned to be the coach of the India women's national field hockey team. The team won the Gold at the 2002 Commonwealth Games. He was also the assistant coach for the Women's team when it won the Gold at the 2004 Hockey Asia Cup.After reading news in press, screenwriter Jaideep Sahani got inspired to write a script of this film. The script focuses on hokey as a game, cultural diversity, women empowerment, new age family system and national integrity. Jaideep Sahani also stated in another interview with NDTV.com that, ""the script was conceived before he met Negi, after reading the script he started crying. He said it had happened to me also.""Uniqueness of this film is Mir Ranjan Negi personally trained these girls for this film. This film is beyond the documentary of Mir Ranjan Negi. It helped to handle the aspect of sports psychology. Journalist Anand Philar stated, ""He had covered Asian Games final. The game tossed goalkeeper Negi's life upside down. Negi was criticized by media; headlines cried: he is a 'traitor."" Anand Philar took Negi's interview, Negi's stated, ""Everywhere I went, I was abused by the public. Nothing matters to me more than playing for my country. I am a proud Indian and will always be so. Former captain Zafar Iqbal expressed, ""The entire team was to blame; we forwards missed chances, the defense had huge gaps that the Pakistanis exploited. After many years Negi returned to train Indian women hokey team. His India women's national field hockey team won the 2002 Commonwealth Games.<br/><br/>According to sports psychology, 'self and identity' are pivotal parts of personality over 'the body self'. The self is based on felt experiences of the environment. We find different girls form different background, and are reluctant to change. We find the answer in sports psychology, 'the body self' evolves from this constant flow of experience. The body self is defined in unity with the self-concept or the self as personal construction. There are three strategies need to be followed for the social construction of the self image.<br/><br/>In country like India, sports like hokey or cricket are attached with national identity. We find the schoolboy jingoism replaces the patriotism. George Orwell called the ""lunatic habit of identifying with larger power units, and seeing everything in terms of competitive prestige"". Journalist Somini Sengupta wrote an article in The New York Times ""Bollywood have been keen observer and welder of the national mood. Journalist Shiv Visvanathan, wrote an article in The Hindu, which explains this sub continental rivalry between India and Pakistan. People from both countries take sports as their national pride. We find more chauvinism than patriotism in their support. Shiv Visvanathan aptly notes, ""Chauvinism and patriotism are different terminologies. Chauvinism is a belief that the nation can do no wrong. Patriotism is open-ended; it allows error or vulnerability, it is diversified. It does not condemn. A patriot is loyal to the nation and cosmopolitan in outlook. Patriotic individual need not to wears uniform or get involved in any ritual. As social psychology offer two dominant theory of identity – identity theory (Stryker, 1977; Burke, 1980) and social identity theory (Turner, 1979). George J. McCall, Jerry Laird Simmons explained the roll-identity theory. ""It suggests that individuals will base their actions on how they like to see themselves and how they like to be seen by others. Therefore, the role-identity requires two components, specifically, the role itself and the identity to be associated with that role. Identity theory is rooted in the concept of roles and role-identities. All players who are selected do have their own identity, it may the identity of India, how is neglected as a good player. Komal Chautala displays her 'self identity 'as a daredevil girl from Hariyana. Vidya Sharma who is married, she plays the role of wife, hokey player and daughter in law. <br/><br/>Chuck De India is a film made on sports and sports psychology. What is self and what is identity? These are the basic question every player face. Chuck De India offers the answer in simplest manner. Film also deals with social identity theory, social comparison theory. Apart from Mir Ranjan Negi's real life incidence, we<br/><br/>This is an exemplary film made on sports and the psychological issues faced by every player. <br/><br/>This film passes the strong message of national integrity, team spirit, self identity and social identity."

","""Chak De India!"" is a sports film, and like MOST other sports films, it's nearly 100% predictable. However, while it very closely follows the expected formula and has many of the usual sports films clichés, it manages to be enjoyable and worth while.<br/><br/>The film begins with a world championship match between the Indian and Pakistani field hockey teams. Kabir misses what seems like a sure goal and then he is treated abominably by the Indian press and his community--as if he WANTED his team to lose! Seven years pass. Now Kabir wants to redeem himself but not as a player but as a coach for a new Indian WOMEN'S field hockey team. His odds look pretty much impossible except for one important thing--it's a sports film and you pretty much know how it's all going to occur! But, as I said above, the plot does offer a bit more. Some nice performances and a few tiny plot twists help it to be a good film.<br/><br/>By the way, although you might expect the usual song and dance numbers like you usually see in Bollywood films, this one has none.

"Chrysanthepop","Null","5","12","25 August 2007"," Go for it girls, make your country proud
","In my opinion 'Chak De India' is a better film than director Shimit Amin's previous effort. Even though this film is predictable, it offers something new (to Indian cinema). It starts off very well, with Kabir Khan (Shahrukh Khan) losing the match, then being branded as a traitor and eventually he is ostracized. Years later, he comes back for a second chance and coaches the girl's national hockey team.<br/><br/>I liked Amin's way of storytelling. He shows the interaction between the girls with a touch of humour and lightness that make it stand out. Though he does focus on some of the players, unfortunately, as a consequence the rest are left only to fill space. I found the two girls Molly and Mary and the girl with the language barrier very interesting and it would have been nice if Amin also gave them more substance. It would have been interesting to learn a little bit more about the rest of players too. But maybe Amin wanted to keep the length of the film shorter.<br/><br/>The girls (those who got the meaty roles) all do well with their part. It is as much their film as it is Kabir Khan's film. Shahrukh plays his part with ease and delivers a wonderful performance (after years). It's great to see him back with substantial roles in substantial movies. I think it's good of Amin to not revolve the screenplay only around Shahrukh's character.<br/><br/>'Chak De India' is not only a sports-film. It also demonstrates the importance of hockey that is overshadowed by the popularity of cricket. We see that no one, except for Kabir, thought these girls would make it because they are 'just girls' and because hockey itself is 'no big deal' in India. It is Kabir who teaches these girls to have faith in themselves and go for it (Chak De). To him, it is much more than a second chance.<br/><br/>The ending is predictable (but isn't that the case with most sports movie?) but that doesn't stop one from enjoying the film. Amit could have probably made use of some editing especially during the tour scenes (which slow down the pace). Indeed one of the better Indian films of the year."

","Chakde India is not just about reviving India's national sport hockey, but also about women rights, unity among Indian states, and last but not least, Shah Rukh Khan's versatility in roles other than the typical candy floss films. It is amazing how the screenplay is able to capture the social issues, as well as bring patriotism message, which in fact, works as good as Lagaan, if not better.<br/><br/>Majority of Hindi cinema are banking on semi-clad women to pull in the crowds, but the kind of women power you will see here is totally different and very much appreciated, and hopefully something that we will get to see more of in the future of Indian cinema.<br/><br/>The hockey matches are portrayed exceptionally good, and various tactics put into the choreography of the match, is totally amazing. Despite being a sports based movie, there is no single dull moment, and the absence of typical song dance routines is not missed at all.<br/><br/>Watching the movie in a Singaporean cinema hall, the audience anticipation into the hockey matches and each goal scored truly shows the spirit and essence of patriotism among the locals and NRIs alike. Hats off to director Shimit Amin, for making the Indians proud with his effort."

","If someone was to tell you that there is a film which deals with issues like gender bias, nationalism, patriotism, regional discrimination, sports politics and sportsman spirit. You'll say ""Naah..!! Sounds like director has bit more than he can chew. This would be a mess with none of the issues being catered adequately."" But don't pass the judgment till you have seen Chak De India. <br/><br/>Here is one film which is bound to give you your money's worth no matter with what expectation you entered the theater. Chak De India is not only a sports film. It is film on feminine equality, against regional inequality. It's a film depicting the politics in sports, about the pity state of national sport in the nation, total disinterest, bureaucracy involved in sports authorities. Lack of funds, media support, facilities and about unfettering determination to win despite all these. <br/><br/>Despite dealing with so many issues, the film is never over the top. So you don't have loud patriotic dialogs to infuse sense of patriotism. A coach showing players the way out who introduce themselves as state players and not national players is enough. The film scores both as a hardcore entertainer and a hard hitting social drama. The message is there, loud can clear and so is fun. This will make you smile (at places laugh); make you emotionally charged (at places cry). Film's excitement is sure to give you goosebumps, be the match sequences, the training sessions or any simple confrontations between coach and players. <br/><br/>Shah Rukh Khan as Kabir Khan, the coach who doesn't stop his girls to beat the hell out of eve teasers to inculcate the sense of team, is rock solid. This is easily amongst best performances of his career if not the best. He is never too loud, never too vulnerable. Just made to order for the role. You can not imagine any other actor playing the role. And with him are bunch of 16 unknown faces who surprise with their acting caliber and spontaneity. Apart from being top quality cinema, what Chak De India does is raise hopes for future of Indian Hockey. Now isn't that a winner in itself. Go watch it. They don't make such films often. It's a MUST WATCH."

","When I first Saw the poster of movie on Web or promo on TV, for me it was just an another flick on movie + Sport. The only change was that this time instead of Cricket, they have chosen even more sounding bore 'Hockey'. So, truly speaking, I had no interest in movie despite it has Shahrukh Khan in it (which also doesn't attract me anymore because of his portrayal of same old emotion in same old manner). But suddenly on Saturday morning, there is huge BUZZ on television channels about movie, creating some feel good factor, so for a movie buff like me, it enough to give me a kick to go and watch the movie.<br/><br/>The movie start with introduction of Kabir Khan (Shahrukh) as one great hockey player and how he miss one final and important penalty against Arch rival Pakistan which kills his entire career; and being Muslim, add more misery in his life as people start treating him like a Pakistani residing in India and still playing for Pakistan. He has to left his home as well as Hockey for some 7 year before he return back as Coach of Women Hockey Team, who is looking for coach to lead team to world cup, just to prove that his is still hard-core Hindustani from heart and the best player in hockey. What he get is bunch of 16 gals, who all hale from diff part of India and have lots of ego. They all lend up to play for themselves and have no respect for country or team. Then start the grooming of Gals by coach Shahrukh and how he get involved with each players in order to improve them as better player. He finally able to manage to take women team to Australia for Women Hockey world cup final and how he make them to win against all odds. Don't think that I have kill the excitement of Story as pleasure of this movie doesn't lie in Story but in character development and screenplay.<br/><br/>The cast of movie is just so Amazing. After years, I have seen such a good cast especially these bunch of gals who before doing movie neither was Hockey players nor actresses except one or two odds. Chitrashi Rawat as Komal Chautala, Shilpa Shukla as Bindia Naik, Vidya Malavade as Vidya Sharma and Tanya Abrol as Balbir Kaur are just better then any existing actresses. Other gals too have worked wonderfully and especially Sagarika Ghatge (Preeti Sabarwal) who would definitely go very far as she has a face of actress but need more polishing in terms of acting. Now Shahrukh. What I can say. Speechless is what I become as he really dominate all the scenes and looks so convincing as coach of Indian women hockey team. After few minutes in movies, you really start looking him more as hockey coach rather then Star Shahrukh Khan.<br/><br/>Shimin Amin as director already proved himself with Ab tak chappan and this attempt is even better then earlier. He really have grasp on trade and not a single moment come in movie where you will feel to move out of chair. The pace is kept at quite a good speed i.e. neither fast nor slow, and you will cherish every moment which is been lived up on screen. They best part is that it has no routine songs or useless romance exist between coach or any player. Songs are played in background and especially Chak de India number by Salim - Sulaiman duo will pushed you so much that you really want to jump in movie theater and want to say aloud...Chak de India.<br/><br/>Finally, A MUST DEKHO movie for everyone along with your whole family. Be prepared to paint you face with tricolour as you will experience same kind of thrills, voices, buckups and clapping which you mostly found in cricket stadium between India and Pakistan matches during movie. Excellent attempt to lift some hope for our dying national game ""HOCKEY"".<br/><br/>Rating (out of 5): ****"

So overall, such a movie is a boring and dull Indian melodrama that is disappointing.<br/><br/>Chak de India is a completely predictable, and let me ask if it is not a true event then why it would be even made, and isn't every true event is predictable after it has took place. The reason this film is predictable is that it is made so. It is over patriotic movie and too preachy. It is made to trigger more then 17.4% of world population that only exist in India, now patriotism is not a sin or boring and who says that preaching howsoever it is can't be done in movies and is reserved for preachers in churches, temples or God's jails. It is not just for one nation but for our own life. The zeal and luster of our life can be sharpened through patriotism. Now when this patriotism did worked on about 20% of world population...why not i accept this over patriotism. This is a simple and plain movie. Honestly i don't understand how this movie is plain and simple in front of Oscar nominated 'moneyball' which was so called very original direction. This movie is a copy of Miracle movie. Now the entire crew of Miracle must be congratulated for making a great movie that inspired many other movies which even went ahead of it. So no disgrace to Miracle but Chakde India is far more better to watch and assimilate. It is a typical Indian melodrama with nothing at all realistic. I would suggest to watch this movie as an animation where anything is possible and justified. One will be lucky to grasp the message that the movie preach and teach. This melodrama does its helping work on a huge amount of population, if you can't be helped in this way, you are free to find your own way. This film has its own way, you find yours and try to help others too.<br/><br/>Now i will talk to human beings. A lot can be said about the movie but on its simplest and rough form, this movie is about unity and originality of intentions. Lot of people in the world thinks that they will do this and that, all noble works and hard works. But none of them have true intentions deep inside their brain and soul. Unity here indicates one world, one nation, one city, one family, oneself, now how often one is united with himself (yoga) and work together, the so called wish/desire of heart and brain, and many others. So Chakde India is not just a movie but its a water to the man in the desert to gain his all hopes and move on. A lot of preaching can be made but I find these two points significant about movie."

Music of the movie is good including the title song which is quite inspirational.It has to be said that good level of effort has been put into every part of the movie whether it is casting or hockey(matches)choreography (which is acceptable).<br/><br/>Although the winning streak of the team at the world cup may seem to an extent unrealistic but overall Chak De India can be said as an entertaining and inspirational movie and is a must watch for every Shah Rukh Khan fan and critic for his brilliant performance."

","Chak De India is India's first full fledged sports movie. Whoever has followed Indian movies for long would not have seen a sports movie like this which has everything which is not so regular in India. For instance Hockey (although it's India's national sport, very few are interested in this game) and to make the expectations even lower,a film on hockey with a team of women in it. So, the expectations are very low when you enter the theater but after the story unfolds you get so involved in it that you forget everything else and want the women team of India to win the world cup and cheer for them.<br/><br/>The performance of each of the girls needs applause particularly the Chitrashi Rawat, Shilpa Shukla and Sagarika Gatge. Shah Rukh Khan has given one of his best performances. He gets into the skin of the character and all you see is Kabir Khan."
"shreejithindia","10","3","6","18 October 2010"," NO DOUBT....... the best sport film ever made.....
","Hockey is the national game of India....most of the people know that. But the condition of this sport is not so good in our country nor much motivation is present for girls to give their best in life. Attitude of the public, the government,the training staff and the players themselves are somehow equally responsible for the pathetic condition of hockey in our country.<br/><br/>The era of Major Dhyan Chand was a golden period for hockey in India. We won several medals including gold in Olympics. but the condition of hockey started deteriorating after that.<br/><br/>Chak De India! is a perfect blend of inspiration, wit and entertainment. The direction of Shimit Amin was pretty good and Shahrukh Khan gave one of the best performances of his life. It is definitely one of the best movies by Yash Raj films and from my personal viewpoint the best sport film ever made since Rocky (1976)..."

","Kabir Khan (Shah Rukh Khan) is a Hockey Player and the captain for Indian Hockey Team. The team is playing final against Pakistan Hockey Team. The Indian Team loses the match and Kabir Khan is mis-understood for this by Press and Media. Kabir Khan is stated as the Traitor and is expelled from the team.<br/><br/>Seven years later Kabir Khan again gets an opportunity to be a part of Indian Sports. But this time, He has to Coach and take the Indian Hockey Women Team to the World Cup which is next to impossible. But Kabir Khan takes on this mission for two reasons. The first reason is to prove everyone wrong who thought him to be the Traitor, And the second reason is that Kabir Khan wants to make the impossible into possible.<br/><br/>The story telling and direction of the film is just simply superb. The cinematography is awesome. Music of the film is again very motivating and moves with the script. The editing part is very crispy and does not make a bore view. This shows that if a film is being made with decent intentions, It is widely appreciated.<br/><br/>Performance wise it is Shah Rukh Khan who steals the show and dominates the film. Being a Super Star Shah Rukh could have easily asked for a small Flash Back with an actress opposite him. But he did not, He knows that the script is the real hero of the film and he goes on and blends with the character that he plays. Model Vidya Malwade proves in this film that she is also a better actress. She has performed her part very well. Shilpa Shukla who plays Bindiya Naik was earlier seen in Khamosh Pani. Shilpa plays the villain in the movie. The best villain is the villain whom you hate to see. And Shilpa has fully lived up to this fact. There's a line in the film where Shah Rukh says to Shilpa ""Is Team Mien Sirf Ek Hi Gunda Reh Sakta Hai, Aur Is Team ka Gunda Main Hoon"".<br/><br/>The film entertains and as well as Provocates you in every aspect. This one is a Sure Winner!!"

","Like other sporting movie such as Apne, I find bollywood always rush things to accommodate different stories in one film along with unnecessary songs.<br/><br/>Shimit Amin must have read my mind; CDI has everything you look for in a sporting movie. The whole film is based around the love for the game of hockey. The time provided in the build up, SRK missing the penalty in a world cup final and being branded a traitor to his country, only for him to come back to the game he loves so much, even if it meant to become the coach of a bunch of undisciplined girls branded hopeless by their families and the hockey board.<br/><br/>He challenges himself to instill patriotism and team spirit even if it means making unpopular decisions against individuals who think they are a one man team.<br/><br/>The time given to the actual competition is very good as the audience gets to feel the emotions of the players as if they were right there on the pitch as a member of the team.<br/><br/>Performances were fantastic all the way through and hats off to the direction of the film.<br/><br/>All in all a great entertainer, don't miss it.<br/><br/>9/10 from me."

","After a streak of bad comedies, so called love stories and pathetic ' murder mysteries', finally a film has arrived that has entertained everyone. Bollywood if famous or rather infamous for producing the most number of films per year, ninety five percent of which fail. But this sports movie is one that shouldn't be missed at any chance. Even though the movie is predictable all the way, its strong plot, wonderful acting, brilliant message and highlighting the reality of Indian society without hurting anyone's sentiments makers it another movie in the list of ' true classics'. Shah Rukh Khan has done a wonderful job but my attention went to the girls of the team. The girl who comes as Komal Chautala does a brilliant job as a loud mouth. I even loved the hefty girl who always got furious at small, small thing and Priyanka Ghatke. Though the movie slowed down at parts, it still kept us holding our seats all the way. 9 out of 10."

","This is the film in which you will feel engrossed fully without any aloofness even though it is sports film based on Hockey and also not any romantic angle in the film. Here director succeeds in conveying message to its target audience by taking sports background of Hockey. The strong part of the film is its script and its perfect execution. Shahrukh khan made justice to the role of Coach and girl actresses are also very good and they acted very well. So over all impact of the film is very good. Many prevalent issues have been focused here such as country feeling, problem of state feeling overshadowing country feeling, unity, women rights, caste system, language problem, gender bias etc. Though two major issues focused in the film are about women rights and prevalent problem of state feeling overshadowing country feeling. <br/><br/>There were days when women were forced to marry at early age by leaving their study. Afterwards they were used to be puppet of men who want them to be inside kitchen and expect them to serve the family and borne and brought up child. And so there was no way to participate in any sport. The days are gone where women were restricted from going outside and work. Today in urban society women are more liberal but still today this is not the case for women of rural India.<br/><br/>I saw in abroad that people of different states of India are reckoning themselves by state name in spite of country name and fighting and arguing with each other by making belittle to other state. They used to say pompously to their countrymen that they are from particular state. This is really sad. Actually they must not indulge in such pity instead they must happily greet their countrymen. Country feeling is must and we must not divide ourselves between states. Country is always first and than state comes. This is always true for any sport team of any country to succeed and also people of any country need to be united to make progress of any country commercially. <br/><br/>So be united and not divided to make developed India from developing India."
"anshul2001anshul","9","3","6","21 August 2007"," refreshing
","Refreshing because girls are shown to be fighting for themselves no one else and Shahrukh has resisted temptation of overacting. Shilpa Shukla was terrific as Bindiya while kamal chautala was also good. Preeti sabarwal had stony face. Hockey officials were quite realistic and i was amazed to see girls playing decent hockey as normally in Indian sports movie they never show front shot of the players. No doubt Australian location was used to its best. Editing is good but at some places screenplay leaves a lot to be desired. One puzzling thing was girls are not shown practicing on AstroTurf. Secondly Indian hockey team now a days is only Jharkhand-orissa and Punjab-Chandigarh with one or two from manipur. Tribal girls of orissa and Jharkhand have come up like anything in this sport and credit goes to tata academy."

I am not against any star cast or against Bollywood. And most of the review people has only commented about Sagarika and still rated 8-9. I have rated it with the only intention that the film is a total copycat of the Hollywood flick ""The Miracle"", (they call it inspired), but I found some of the screenplay and even dialogues very similar... Was it too coincidental. To be very honest, It wasn't that very inspiring...

You still have those edge of the seat moments, and you will be giving your nails a workout! Finally bollywood has produced a world class sports movie. The acting by the hockey players and especially SRK is simply real. The hockey scenes are well taken too, there is the atmosphere of a world tournament. The film also treats you with some clever humour, there are moments which make you think!!

","Chak De brings out a new Shahrukh Khan or probably the brings back the one we saw in Swades. He is the actor here, though his being the biggest star of the times ensured a full house when I saw Chak De this morning.<br/><br/>Chak De is a sports film. That itself makes it a very rare film to come out of Bollywood. The director Shimit Amin and writer Jaideep Sahni venture out where very few dare in Mumbai. And, they have come out trumps.<br/><br/>The film does many things which probably should inspire many in the film industry. First and foremost is the need to do original and innovative work. The film leaps out of the routine run-of-the-mill productions of Hindi film industry, with class. Second, give their due to the character roles. Write them out with focus and intention. It is not only the lead roles that need to be chiseled well. The girls in the film carry it forward as much as Shahrukh Khan.<br/><br/>The film is edited very well. It has pace and flow.<br/><br/>Finally, Shahrukh Khan. This film may well be the start of his second innings. Earlier stars (Amitabh Bachchan, Dilip Kumar, etc) never knew what to do during their middle-ages. Bachchan did trash films like Toofan, Jadugar, etc. Script-writers did not know what to do with such stars. Shahrukh Khan is fast approaching that phase of his career, if not already there. He has opened doors for himself. From what I saw in Chak De, I'm waiting in anticipation for things to come. This, in spite of the fact that I'm not a Shahrukh Khan fan as yet.<br/><br/>Chak De is the best film that has come out this summer. A must watch !<br/><br/>P.S: Hoping Chak De does its bit to revive sporting spirit in the country and makes us see beyond cricket."
"phaneendrakumar","10","3","7","14 August 2007"," Chak De... Bollywood
","As many of us, Indians, thought at first, I too ruled out this movie as just another Hollywood copy. But, I am just back from the theater after watching Chak De.. The movie is far high than expected. Even though, the coach-player formula is very old and a sure shot success in the west, bollywood technicians are also catching up.<br/><br/>The cinematography and the story telling are very refreshing for bollywood standards. Shah Rukh is exceptional in the role. If you want to see Shah Rukh Khan acting, this movie is the best along with Swades. In my opinion, you will be seeing only King Khan in other movies, but not a genuine actor.<br/><br/>The story is simple and always predictable. But, the director made sure that you will not get bored at any point in the movie. The music is very good in the background. The actor's performance is very convincing in their roles. They all are too good for debutantes.<br/><br/>On the whole, Chak de Bollywood. Good movie at last...<br/><br/>A must watch from Indian cinema."

But my expectation was not fulfilled when i saw this movie.<br/><br/>The movie gives a total Indian movie feel where you'll find typical drama that you have seen in many films. I have never liked SRK and this movie proves it why?. You can easily put this movie in the category of ""Main Hoo Naa"" where you see a movie which was nothing but providing moviegoers a simple time pass with some comedy and songs.<br/><br/>There only few instances where i liked the movie but on the whole is was not what i was expecting."

"maliks0","10","2","4","22 March 2015"," SRK, sports equality and gender equality and team work Brilliant in so many aspects.
","The first thing this movie shows us is over excited and unreliable media all around the world. The way they accuse one for match fixing for just shaking hands with the opponent. Another thing this movie tells us is that women are a lot more than we think they are, they are not shadows of men, they are they themselves. In the subcontinent, cricket is given more attention than hockey and football, despite the fact that Pakistan and India have excelled in hockey and ruled the world in this sport for a long long time. This movie is not only an inspiration for players but also for coaches, tells the players that to win something, you first have to work as a team, then comes your technique and all. The movie tells the coaches how to make your team play like a team. ""To make a team, you need intentions, not power."" This dialog from SRK says it all. And for all hockey/football players, ""Don't play against the goalkeeper, play against his mind, the goal will happen itself."" The best thing about this movie is that it does not bore you at all, after every 10 minutes or so, there is always some sort of twist. Shah Rukh Khan won Filmfare for best actor for his performance in this film, and deserving as well. The actors playing the characters of the players did brilliant in terms of acting, especially the actor playing Komal. For a huge Hockey fan like me, this is an inspirational story of how to come back strong even after your career is over.."

","Shahrukh Khan stars in ""ChakDe! India"" as a former Indian national hockey player and someone, in his own words, who wants to defeat the reason why he lost out in his own career by this time coaching the Indian women's hockey team to world cup glory. For him, it's all about believing that you can win, and he makes this clear quite often.<br/><br/>Equal opportunities in sport (something we all take for granted), religion, self-belief and teamwork are themes central to ""ChakDe! India"" have been cleverly handled by director Shimit Amin.<br/><br/>Shahrukh's performance is brilliant; one can totally understand why he won filmfare best actor for this. Out of the team of girls, the performances that stand out are those by Shilpa Shukla (as Bindia), Sagarika Ghatge (as Preeti), Chitrashi Rawal (as Komal) and Tanya Abrol (as Balbir). <br/><br/>Director Shimit Amin has done a good job with this. He clearly is a very talented director and this is evident in every frame of the movie.<br/><br/>The screenplay works great and the cinematography is brilliant. <br/><br/>From the soundtrack, ""Chak De India"" is the most memorable song and is probably the best song from the list.<br/><br/>Verdict: A national award winning sports masterpiece from Yash Raj Films that should not be missed!! I give it 9/10."
"manoj-ransing","9","2","4","10 January 2008"," A rare combination of Inspiration, Patriotism, Sport and Bollywood Movies
","If someone take a look at all Yashraj films in past 2-3 years, it is really hard to believe that Chak De has came from there. It's good that finally Yashrak banner has came up with something really excellent and extraordinary. I hope they will continue with this and bring back their success era again.<br/><br/>The movie is marvelous for many reason. First it touches the topic of Hockey in India where sport means Cricket. Then it also tells the story of a girl team, which I think is done first time in Indian cinema. It also interact with the different peoples from different parts of India, and how they achieve success when combined together. And finally it also got the touch of little thriller at the end. The most important is even after having all these things in it, it didn't leave its rhythm anywhere. A special hats off to the script writer and the director for achieving this.<br/><br/>Off course I haven't forgotten the King Khan. He certainly plays a major role in the success on this, but not all. SRK has done an excellent, no doubt award winning job in this movie. I personally will like him to do such on the ground roles rather than Raj, Rahul and Om Kapur, where he uses his style talent more that acting talent. SRK, you really rocks in this movie. There is no greater pleasure than watching you as Kabir Khan.<br/><br/>The movie has its own pace. Nowhere the audience feel bored, no unnecessary songs, unnecessary dramatic scenes, romantic scenes, and patriotic dialogs. The movie from start is sticked to its basic theme that is to tell the story of the Women Hockey team and their coach.<br/><br/>What else can I say? If I start writing all the good things, I will have to spend entire night for this. Hence I will say that ""Just watch it and you will know"".<br/><br/>But having said that there are some technical drawbacks in the movie. At the end, specially when the result is clear it just feels that its has been stretched. But that is understandable as it has made to add some thriller in it.<br/><br/>But some of the things are just can not be digested. After India loosed against Australia by 7-0, the team goes on winning each of the other match. This seems far stretched. Again Indian team after loosing to Australia by 7-0, England team saying that they will win by even greater margin is something unrealistic. No team will make such statement. Have ever heard Australia saying that ""We will easily win this match.""? This doesn't happen. Every team just says that they will play their best. No one underestimate other team like this.<br/><br/>And the thing that hurt me most is the characters of Cricketers. There is no need to show cricketers like this. In fact, all sport persons have equal respect to other sport. They know how much effort one has to give for becoming specialist in each sport. With this Indian Cricket team wise captain showing no respect for Hockey is something not acceptable. This is just like in Bhagat Singh movies Gandhi's character is shown gray. Shortening the image of other to make your thing high is something should not be done. It has been shown that the cricketer is having no respect for other game. Instead it would have been better if he has shown not caring about women sports specially. Again at the end, when the team arrives at airport people are cheering them. A real end would have been there is no one at airport as the people are watching one day match on TV. Something like that.<br/><br/>But these are very small points which can be neglected. This movie is a special milestone in Hindi Cinema. A hearty congratulations to the entire crew of the movie. I just hope Hindi cinema will come up with more and more of such intelligent movies."

","What happens when the reigning actor in India joins a small banner film about sports, and not just any sport but specifically hockey. Not India's cup of tea, you might think, but surprising enough it works ! Shahrukh Khan is Kabir Khan, a washed out center forward of the former great Indian hockey squad. After a mishap in the world-cup final, where he misses a penalty-shot and gets blamed by the media for betraying his country, he makes a comeback. But as a coach not as a player and his goal is, to lead the women of the national Indian hockey squad to their first world-cup. As you can guess coach Kabir faces his lot of troubles; the hockey board who doesn't approve, the girls who wouldn't play under him. At first his goal seems not only far fetched but impossible at that. And what happens next is... magic. Not the best sports movie I have seen in my life, but Chak de is surely the most inspiring one and most surprisingly it comes out the land of love, love and love India. India is infamous for it's bad traffic, high pollution and romantic movies, so Chak de India comes as a breath of fresh air in the land where sports is a untampered subject. Don't get me wrong it shows, the script is not an original one, it's not the best written movie I've seen, the dialogues just don't come across naturally. The movie utilises before seen underplays, like the rivalry in the team between the two main strikers, the complete impossible goal, the failure of the main character (Kabir), ... The acting isn't the best piece of acting I've seen in a while, it's quite the contrary, this movie has a list of newcomers and a seasoned veteran to guide them, Shahrukh plays his role convincingly but yet he is not the star, for me this is Chitrashi Rawat who plays Komal, the tiny striker I think this girl has played her role to a ""T"" and together with Shilpa Shukla who plays Bindia Naik they keep their ground pretty well against King Khan. But the rest of the cast is just not up to the task and this shows. But enough of the negatives lets get to the points where this movie just stands out let's begin with the overall feel, because of the way the hockey matches are shot the movie lifts up 10 notches, the other is the perfect use of background music in comparison with slick editing, I think at this point I think the movie is easily comparable to Hollywood 'A-listers'. You know what's gonna happen but still because of the sheer craftsmanship the movie pulls you to the edge of the seat and just for that I give Chak De India 4 stars out of 5. If you're in need of something else than that sobby bollywood romance, go watch this and feel proud to be an Indian. Chak De India!!!"

I try to watch SRK films mainly because they are usually well made and I grew up watching his flicks thru the 90's.<br/><br/>So this film performance by SRK is on par with one of his best performances from Swades. It is an understated performance and shows that the man can be a very good ""actor"" when the role is suitable. Another first for SRK was there was no heroine in the film for him to sing songs to. I was quite surprised that the producers decided to put artistic merit over sticking out of place songs thru out the film.<br/><br/>The performances by all of the girls playing on the team were effective. Although the outcome is predictable, it is still an exciting finish to the movie and should stand as one of the best sports movies to come out of India since Lagaan.<br/><br/>Here is hoping that the Indian film industry begins to take notice that unique cinema can still reap huge financial benefits while enlightening the audience.<br/><br/>And SRK should continue to strive for more demanding roles that test his skills as an actor.

You have an underdog team of misfits. You have a tough, but fair coach with unconventional methods. You have the cool kids. You have the odd kids. You have the big kid. You have the small kid. Well, they're all adults in this case, but this might as well be a teenage flick.<br/><br/>That being said, I do like what the film does with its clichés. Like the cliché where the players don't initially get along at all and have to learn to play with each other. Well, India is such a huge country and these women have been gathered from all over, so it makes sense that they don't necessarily understand one another right from the start. They barely even speak the same language, after all. And when they do start to become a team, it's a good message for India as a whole.<br/><br/>Still, if there's one thing I'd wish, it's that the film had dodged at least some of the clichés. Now it seems set on collecting them all. And I mean all. Every single sports film cliché you can think of, it's in this film. Sure, they're done well and they're fun for the most part, but they're still clichés.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, I had fun with Chak de! India. Not the best sports film I've seen, but it has passion. And that's often enough."
"JakeBrinkman","3","0","0","6 January 2020"," Good story, subpar movie
","Chak De! India is a good sports story that's told in a mediocre fashion. The story is definitely inspiring, even with the obvious cliches included to increase tension. Unfortunately it's not portrayed as well as it could have been. The later film Dangal goes on to deliver the same message while correcting every mistake Chak De! India made, so I highly recommend skipping this movie to watch Dangal instead.<br/><br/>The cinematography was the worst part. It's fairly obvious that the Indian girls are actresses and not athletes, especially when they show the goalies doing anything. The director tries to cover it up by excessively shaking the camera and/or pointing in very bad angles. You can't even tell what's happening on the field, so almost everything shown that isn't a shot on goal just feels like a waste of film and runtime. The music was also chosen poorly, generically underwhelming and occasionally not fitting for the scene.<br/><br/>*Potential spoilers below*<br/><br/>There are tons of details that didn't make sense to me. As a Western viewer, the intro seems completely alien to me that the main character could be considered a traitor for being the only teammate that has any sense of sportsmanship, especially in an international league where the bare minimum expected is exactly what he did. Moving on, man-to-man defense is one of the, if not the, most common defense tactic in nearly every major sport where both teams share a field, so I think it's insane that the India team would not have prepared for that, but the movie goes so far to claim that most of the girls have never even heard of it before. If you take out the man-to-man debacle, then there's no reason at all for the one jerk to even still be on the team after the first week of training. And why does it take 5 entire games (350 minutes of game time) for the enemy coaches to realize the forwards never pass? That should be obvious in the first half of game 1, and that should have been a plot point that resolves in game 2, especially when the highest scoring girl definitely belongs to Australia after that killer first game and their undefeated streak (or at least any semifinal team other than India) while India gets crushed and then wins every game by only scoring 1 point.<br/><br/>A couple of the minor messages are also bad. Sports films are usually focused on personal growth and becoming a better person. The only thing the jerk girl learned was that if you're stubborn long enough, you'll eventually get your way. Also, the Argentina game was horrible. The team plays physically, but only 1 or 2 of the events looked like a foul, and they all looked arguably unintentional. In retaliation, the entire India team, coach included, decides to blatantly foul for the rest of the game with the intention to seriously injure the opponents. The entire message of that game was horrible and appalling, and they should have been kicked out of the tournament for it."

","It's an amazing Bollywood Movie,, SRK Sir Love You"
"abhijith-alpha","7","0","0","29 August 2019"," This is the blueprint for Indian sports movies.
","Chak de! India is a different beast. It is a Bollywood sports movie, and hence contains the usual trope of underdogs v the world. It contains enough moments of dramatic tension. Unexpected pitfalls, sports heroism and ultimate redemption are themes that pervade the movie. Yet it is well-made, in the sense that the characters seem real, situations believable and the song-dance-routine is benched for thoroughly enjoyable training montages.<br/><br/>The Indian Women's National Hockey team which won the Gold medal in 2002 Commonwealth Games inspires the movie. This was a monumental event in Women's hockey in India because it was the first Championship win of any kind after the 1982 Delhi Asian Games. On the way to the gold the Indian Women also defeated the mighty Australia in the semifinals, which contained three of the greatest ever hockey players among them, who were also the reigning World Cup champions, Olympic, Commonwealth and Oceania cup winners. The Commonwealth Gold was such an inspirational event that it sparked a revival of Women's Hockey in India, as they followed it with medals in the ensuing Asian Games, Afro-Asian Games, Asia Cup Commonwealth Games, and plenty of other tournaments. At the present, the Women's Hockey team is a medal contender in the tournaments it features in, with a world ranking of 10.<br/><br/>To add to the rags-to-winners story, the goalkeeping coach of the women's team was a former men's hockey player Mir Ranjan Negi, who was unfairly blamed by many Indians and hounded for decades after a particularly humiliating loss to eternal rivals Pakistan, in 1982 Asian games. It didn't help that the tournament was held in Delhi, the capital. He had sought his own redemption and had somewhat achieved it with this victory. The wounds on his soul had healed, even if the scars would never go.<br/><br/>One would think such an extremely inspiring story would prove to be a profitable cinema effort at the Box Office, and would have studios wrangling over movie rights. Yet it took half a decade for the story to finally release as a cinema because of many challenges. For one, it was doubtful if Indians would be interested to watch a movie where the main cast was a bunch of girls who played sports, and had no central love story or song-dance routines. The casting of Shah Rukh Khan, in the middle of a mid-career resurgence, gave the film the fillip it needed, and the production moved quickly. The casting of actual hockey players helped to keep things realistic, and even watching the match and practice session montages would never give one the doubt that these girls aren't hockey players.<br/><br/>Coming to the story, it deals with many issues such as calling out toxic patriotism and eschewing a compassionate one, misogyny in Indian society in general and sports, meagre resource allocation to sports other than cricket, regional and linguistic differences, and assorted issues that I wondered if the movie might be enjoyable at all. Instead, I was pleasantly surprised at how seamlessly the director had fit everything into a linear yet compelling narrative, getting out great performances from not just Khan but also the young actresses and the supporting cast. It still focuses a lot on Khan's coach. It is his story of redemption told through this wonderful sporting achievement by Indian women, but I didn't mind it for once. Shah Rukh, all intense and quiet yet fiercely determined, doesn't take over the movie and lets his costars shine around him, and the movie does pay tribute to women in the credits.<br/><br/>Definite watch.<br/><br/>STRAY OBSERVATIONS<br/><br/>Watch out for: Vidya Malvade as the captain, Sagharika Ghatke as fiercely independent forward, Chitrashi Rawat as the pint-sized dynamo, and Shilpa Shukla as the irate senior and Tanya Abrol as the angry Punjabi girl are simply marvelous."

","While watching, I didn't know if this story was based on real events or not but the question was answered once I came to this board. That's okay, I think any film that can inspire to achieve one's best and shoot for an impossible goal is always worthwhile. Not knowing the Indian culture, I was kind of shocked by the attitude of the members of the 'Association' sponsoring the women's hockey team. You would think this was 1807 or 1907 instead of 2007 when the movie was made. That alone would have been enough to fire up the ragtag team of players from India's far flung states, but first, Coach Kabir Khan (Shah Rukh Khan) would have to see his way through an entire gamut of individual dynamics in order for his players to come together as a team. The McDonald's incident was the catalyst, and from there, Khan's deft handling of each player's personal issues was the key to making his team gel as winners. Other reviewers making comments here point to ""The Miracle"" as the basis for this film's story line. Oddly, I've never seen that movie yet, which is something I'll have to correct in due course. Given that this picture is quite formulaic in execution, there's still something to be said for it's positive message and pride in a national identity."

","With Chak De India, director Shimit Amin has made a paint-by-numbers sports film, hitting every predictable checkpoint as it races along. And that's a compliment to what is easily the best Hindi film of the year so far, because we go to sports-flicks for predictability, to see Bhuvan's XI kick Brit ass, to see The Replacements come from behind. This time out, it's Shah Rukh Khan's Gordon Bombay trying to coach a bunch of ragtag Mighty Desi Ducks to self-belief, glory, and a cabinet full of silver. Seven years after a blunder stopped his career cold in its tracks, hockey hero-gone-zero Kabir Khan is raring to get back onto the hockey field. He'll do whatever it takes, even if it means taking a gig coaching the Indian Women's Hockey team. He's up against history and a hockey association whose step-motherly apathy towards the team makes Cinderella's folks look like Norman Rockwell creations. And then there's the actual team, the sort of bunch polite people would call a ""work in progress"" and most people in the movie call a ""Rakshas Sena."" They come from all over India (of course), and they come carrying some stereotypical cultural baggage. The North-Eastern girls, for example, are hooted at everywhere they go because, you know, they're *supposed* to be easy. Take a bow writer Jaideep Sahni because the beauty of it is, of course, the fact that this automatically gives each character an arc, a responsibility even, to take cheerful digs at these stereotypes and hypocrisy (watch for a rousing bar-brawl brought on as a result of some serious stereotyping). But none of these characters would have mattered without the women playing them; they're a casting marvel, a dirty dozen with more spark, sass and oomph than a truckload of Spice Girls on crack. They're an absolute joy to watch, carrying this movie effortlessly. As is the case with any team movie, you warm up to some of the ensemble, and others leave you cold. Vidya Malvade holds her own as goalie/captain/home-maker Vidya and Segarika Ghatge (playing arrogant striker Preeti Sabharwal) seems to have the male vote (mine included maybe). Shah Rukh Khan is excellent here, surprisingly restrained and resisting the urge to SRK it up even when the opportunity presents itself. He's good, but even he can only stand around and watch as Chitrashi Rawat, playing Jersey #1, Komal Chautala steals the ball out from under him, shoots and sccccoorrrrressssss. She's pint-sized dynamite, the sort of person I wouldn't want to be on the bad side of, on the field or off it. Speaking of the field, hats off to director Amin for sticking with the game throughout the film, and doing it well. He and his cinematography team find coherence in the chaos, their camera gliding through the mess of feet and sticks to give us a sports film that looks like a sports film instead of looking like, well, Awwal Number. This is his second film (his first was slow-burn cop thriller Ab Tak Chappan), and as far as I'm concerned, he's one of the best Bollywood's got. Chak De India is masala-pop patriotism done right, and I'm twice as glad that it focuses on hockey and not cricket. Hockey is something Indian men used to be good at. Pity then that today, the only ones who can get it right in this country are a bunch of fictitious, cinematic women."

The original movie 'Miracle' is based on true event where America's won against Russia in ice hockey. Instead this movie, chak de isn't based on reality but i still thought it will encourage India in other sports just like cricket. The problem was that the director copied the whole movie, even the dialogues.

","Once again it is proved that patriotism is the weak point for Indians.<br/><br/>Indians want to see movies with patriotism thrust in it. This actually proves the thing that the movie has left the box office ticking. The Director and the Production house has capitalized on this theory and of course the rivalry between India and Australia. If it would have been a movie released a few years back the final would have been between India and Pakistan.<br/><br/>Okay lets see what we can say about the movie, storyline not a new one (except for the hockey), though some say it is. Screenplay is quite predictable. Now what , let's take the acting, it is not good though we didn't expected much from the new comers but some scenes needed retake.<br/><br/>Let's talk about Preeti Sabarwal (some Ghatge), her expression is not more than a log of wood and in spite of that she is given a role that stands apart from the crowd (bad choice of actress for this role).<br/><br/>Chautala and Naik are good from the point of acting fro their respective parts. Few dialogues are weak and somewhat stretched.<br/><br/>I think I am being a bit harsh on the movie but of course some thums up are there like the cinematography which is I think the primary thing that may attract the crowd to the theatres as it can be best appreciated on a big screen. Of course the sound effect is terrific eg. nice sound with ball striking the stick or the board of the goal and the background score.<br/><br/>One thing is not predictable in the movie is the Mc Donald scene which is good I think.<br/><br/>All in all okie tokie types."

","Any Shah Rukh Khan movie creates a general interest in movie-goer crazy public of India, so with Chak De India releasing during the Independence day week with Shah Rukh playing the lead surely was a big draw for the crowds in India.<br/><br/>The story is about Kabir Khan (Shah Rukh Khan) who faces humiliation after unable to score a penalty goal in a World Cup Final match against Pakistan and comes back after 7 years to coach the India Girls' Hockey Team that has good players from 16 Indian states  but the team is fragmented with Regional biases, language difference, player egos, senior and juniors, north and south, rich and poor etc. On top of that nobody has any expectations from the Indian Girls' Hockey Team. From a side that is considered down and out from the beginning, Kabir Khan  takes it as his personal challenge to take that team to the World Cup Final and win the match against Australia.<br/><br/>Director Shimit Amin (Ab Tak Chappan) joins hands with Yash-Raj Productions to deliver this patriotic movie on the down and under team and sports. I think he has done a very good job in making the movie.<br/><br/>Shah Rukh Khan pumps all the iron and grit into the role of Kabir Khan, and one feels the pains of his subdued but powerful acting. His body language, his words, his eyes  I think this is one of his best delivered performances. Why I say this is because the role does not have the regular stamp of what Shah Rukh can do and thus he is so good in this role.<br/><br/>From the team of 16 girls  three girls stand out and capture your imagination. First a senior egoist Maharashtrian player Bindya Naik (Shilpa Shukla) who does all to break the team  but in the end crunch game against South Korea delivers the goods for India, second the small Haryana tomboyish girl Komal (Chitrashi Rawat) who is a brilliant Right In player who sacrifices her goal ambition to another player in the finals for India and third the Punjabi puttar girl Balbir (Tanya Abrol) who is fearless, with a heart of gold and a body of ruthless destroyers  whatever she speaks strikes your heart chords.<br/><br/>Seemingly I need to mention 3 brilliant scenes in the movie that brings applaud for the sheer strength of emotions it draws  first, the McDonal scene where the girls get-to-gather and bash up eve-teasers; second, the match against Indian men's hockey team when the girls score their first goal; and third is the scene when in the finals against Australia when tomboyish Komal forgets her rivalry with another Indian girl and passes the ball to help India score a goal.<br/><br/>How can I not forget to mention the 3 dialogues that remain with you - all are spoken by Shah Rukh. First, I can only hear one sound  India (and not regional states); second, the only villain of this team is the coach; and third, if you play well God also will not be able to take the 70 minutes of your life (the finals!).<br/><br/>Surely the movie is too predictable and clichéd. I was expecting a more innovative direction and screenplay from Shimit Amin. Except a few characters other characters are not well developed. There is no STYLE in the movie. The regional angle though touched remains in the sidelines and as token representation. The same with the religious secularism that India boasts off  such movies are breaking grounds to highlight them, but Shimit ignores this opportunity. So does he does not give a brighter scene to the Muslim protagonist in the team  Iqbal. With Indian audiences a cursory angle to such themes would create much more patriotic feel.<br/><br/>A good entertainer. I loved it.<br/><br/>(Stars 7.0 out of 10)"
"from_christmas_past","7","2","8","4 September 2007"," Not 'Miracle'ous
","There would be people who will call this a blatant copy. Although the movie reminds a lot of 'Miracle', it is not a copy. For, in addition to being inspired by real events, this movie faithfully follows the set rules of the underdog flick. Almost every underdog movie follows the same story pattern and will keep doing so. So, we see a team fighting all possible odds and, guess what, overcome them. The film goes about delivering its message in a classic over-the-top way trying excessively to appeal to Indian sensibilities. The problem with Chak De is it adds nothing to the genre. The underdog theme is not new to Indian cinema (Lagaan), the emphasis on hockey is incidental and in fact, gives the writers with ammunition to place hockey's popularity as a deterrent to the determined team's success. The scenes where one of the player's cricket-star boyfriend trashes hockey is one of the examples how the film-makers have gone out of the way to add to the existing obstacles facing the hockey team. Similarly, the battle of sexes to send the team to the world cup is melodramatic and subtracts from the believability of the movie. Chak De is annoying because it invents problems in the form of blatant prejudice and red-tapism in hockey associations to make the task of winning look impossible. While these may be real problems in Indian sports, I am sure no sporting association discriminates only and so much on the basis of gender. People understand the problems in winning a world cup as it is, it is an overkill to stuff the content with road-blocks for glorifying the achievement. The lack of subtlety is where Chak De misses its mark. In this aspect, i wish Chak De had borrowed from Miracle. While Miracle built-up the sense of achievement slowly, Chak De tries too hard to convince us of difficulties. Shahrukh as a coach lacks the understated elegance of Kurt Russell. Russell elevated Miracle with his icy performance of tough hockey coach. Shahrukh goes for an over-the-top, preachy coach that inspires irritation more than admiration. The scene where the coach makes the players say they play for India (than for their state) is a rip-off from the ""who do you play for?"" scene in Miracle, and it is an example of how Chak De brash approach contrasts to Miracle's subtlety. Despite its short comings, Chak De builds up a steady narrative. The dialogues are smart and the team-building efforts of the coach are engrossing. The hockey scenes are impressively framed and though you know how the movie ends, there is a sense of euphoria at the end that is so important in such movies. Chak De is an honest attempt at making a totally Indian underdog film, but if you want to experience the real emotions of watching such a film, try Miracle."

","What happens when the reigning actor in India joins a small banner film about sports, and not just any sport but specifically hockey. Not India's cup of tea, you might think, but surprising enough it works ! Shahrukh Khan is Kabir Khan, a washed out center forward of the former great Indian hockey squad. After a mishap in the world-cup final, where he misses a penalty-shot and gets blamed by the media for betraying his country, he makes a comeback. But as a coach not as a player and his goal is, to lead the women of the national Indian hockey squad to their first world-cup. As you can guess coach Kabir faces his lot of troubles; the hockey board who doesn't approve, the girls who wouldn't play under him. At first his goal seems not only far fetched but impossible at that. And what happens next is... magic. Not the best sports movie I have seen in my life, but Chak de is surely the most inspiring one and most surprisingly it comes out the land of love, love and love India. India is infamous for it's bad traffic, high pollution and romantic movies, so Chak de India comes as a breath of fresh air in the land where sports is a untampered subject. Don't get me wrong it shows, the script is not an original one, it's not the best written movie I've seen, the dialogues just don't come across naturally. The movie utilises before seen underplays, like the rivalry in the team between the two main strikers, the complete impossible goal, the failure of the main character (Kabir), ... The acting isn't the best piece of acting I've seen in a while, it's quite the contrary, this movie has a list of newcomers and a seasoned veteran to guide them, Shahrukh plays his role convincingly but yet he is not the star, for me this is Chitrashi Rawat who plays Komal, the tiny striker I think this girl has played her role to a ""T"" and together with Shilpa Shukla who plays Bindia Naik they keep their ground pretty well against King Khan. But the rest of the cast is just not up to the task and this shows. But enough of the negatives lets get to the points where this movie just stands out let's begin with the overall feel, because of the way the hockey matches are shot the movie lifts up 10 notches, the other is the perfect use of background music in comparison with slick editing, I think at this point I think the movie is easily comparable to Hollywood 'A-listers'. You know what's gonna happen but still because of the sheer craftsmanship the movie pulls you to the edge of the seat and just for that I give Chak De India 4 stars out of 5.

"dockbillin-2","8","1","4","10 September 2007"," Good underdog sports film by Bollywood standards
","There is a genre of films about the sports underdog. The list of those films is long, and mostly originate in Hollywood, but I guess it's time someone took a whack at it here. And they do.<br/><br/>The story: The final of the men's hockey world cup between India and Pakistan. Pakistan is leading by one goal with just seconds left to play, when India gets a penalty stroke. Kabir Khan (Shah Rukh Khan, in his first on-screen portrayal of a Muslim character), the Indian captain, decides to take the stroke himself. And fluffs it, losing the match in the process. As a Pakistani player, in a moment of camaraderie, hugs him in consolation, and the photo of him doing this is splashed all across the Indian papers calling him a traitor and worse. He is finally forced even to move out of his own house while a man scribbles ""Gaddar"" (""Traitor"") on the wall in charcoal. Cut to seven years later, when a women's hockey team is being put together. There is just one applicant for the job that no one wants, that of the coach of a team that is bound to lose.Kabir Khan. By default, he gets the job. What he gets is a team of scrapings from the bottom of the barrel, from all corners of the country,a team of no-hopers, misfits, egotists and drama queens. Now of course except for ""Rocky"" the underdog films always end with the victory of the underdog against all odds. So I knew what was coming; what I wanted to see was how they went about presenting it. The beginning is a disaster. The girls, on the field, are more intent on hitting out at each other than playing, and Khan is forced to bench several of them till they apologise to each other. In the end the anger against his training methods is so great that they sign a petition against him. It looks as if all's over for the team, till the player's suddenly and spectacularly bond at a MacDonald's when a group of louts tries to harass them. They beat the living hell out of those men. Maybe not realistic, but entertaining all the same. Meanwhile, the national selectors are fast losing interest in the team and are about to decide against sending it to the World Cup. Khan makes a desperate plea: he will have the girls play the national men's team. If they at least draw, they will go to the World Cup. Despite losing narrowly, the team is so impressive the entire men's team and the spectators salute the girls and the selectors are forced to let them go to the World Cup in Australia after all. As usual in this type of film, they lose heavily in the first match (against Australia) before Kabir Khan, with his coaching and his pep talks, motivates them to claw their way back, till they finally reach the final, gathering sponsors and new kit on the way. And, of course, in the final, meeting Australia again, they win - as you knew all along. And with the world cup in hand, they return to flowers and Kabir Khan returns to his old home, mother and all, in an absurdly maudlin scene. There is much more to it, of course. There is the time when the girls are being registered at the hockey camp, the man at the desk has never heard of places like Mizoram and thinks Tamil and Telugu people are the same. There is the moment when Kabir Khan tells super-egotist Bindya Naik (the eminently kissable Shilpa Shukla) ""There is room for just one bully in this team, and that's me"". There are the repeated and very enjoyable digs at that national obsession and fifth-rated pseudo-sport, cricket. There are the girls goggling at the training facilities the Australians enjoy. There is Kabir Khan fingering his old silver medal and seeking personal vindication from a win. There is the delicious touch of irony when the team returns  the players are seen bargaining for the autorickshaw fare, as before. The score is one jarring point  the music is loud and intrusive and more often than not unnecessary. At least there is no song and dance. Also, while the on-field hockey action is beautifully shot and excellently portrayed, there is a yammering commentary in Hindi that is all but unendurable. I'm giving this film 8, but really it deserves 8.5. I'm deducting a full point for the awful commentary and for the musical score. Another point goes for that ridiculous last scene, where people still  after all these years  remember the old rancour, albeit this time to wash it away; Kabir Khan arrives pushing the same old scooter, and his mother returns too, looking not a day older. And the charcoal ""traitor"" is still there to be crossed out  after seven years. Of course you'll understand that my rating is based on comparison to other Hindi films. Compared to Hollywood sports films it scores 4 out of 10. But the Bollywood standard is so low that anything better than mediocre makes one feel absurdly grateful. Kabir Khan's story, incidentally, is based on the real life story of Mir Ranjan Negi, Indian goalkeeper in the hockey final of the 1982 Asian Games against Pakistan in which India lost 7-1. Negi was hounded for years  and he ultimately returned as women's team coach. He was also technical adviser for this film. Chak De! also deserves praise for not shying away from a brutal truth in India  the fact that an Indian Muslim is always forced to keep proving himself an Indian, the fact that he is not even allowed to make an honest mistake on the sports field without suspicion. This should ideally be studied in depth in another movie. Chak De! is a sports film; one can't ask too much from it. A superb effort, still."
"l_ramesh","7","1","4","2 September 2007"," Great move and should be a great motivator
","Well a movie that doesn't have any romance and obscene scenes, a movie that when watched with clear mind can motivate every player(in all team sports), who have been ranking his/her personal ambitions, above his/her team's winning cause should be watching this movie, and if this could change the thought process of one player from promoting one's country's respect against his/her personal ambitions, Yashraj films would have made the best movie of there productions and also it emphasizes how a good coach or for the matter fact, one genuine hard working person, who would get every player out of there comfort zone and play for one cause, if this happens it would be a very ideal conditions for every team sport."
"zakali4u","8","1","5","16 August 2007"," Discrimination
","I watched this as a premiere opening in London with a special appearance from ShahRukh Khan or SK and so obviously we had a load of fans and the atmosphere was electric.<br/><br/>Some girl told SK that his fly was open and he announced it saying does your mom know your staring at my fly. he just did not want to get off the stage.<br/><br/>the film started and immediately the world cup hockey final between India and Pakistan was at an end and SK missed the penalty. Being a Muslim he was criticised and branded traitor and he quickly departed from the scene for 7 years. This opening reminded of what people said about M Azzhuradin when he played for India.<br/><br/>The films main subject is the discrimination of women in India especially in sports. The cast constantly remind us of stereotypical views 'a womens job is behind the stove at home.' No one has come forward to be the coach for the India women team for the world cup and in comes SK, he takes this as an opportunity to prove he is not a traitor and restore dignity to himself and family.<br/><br/>The females in the hockey team all acted superbly and their characters were wonderful and amazing too watch...<br/><br/>In places people may think a coach can not behave like this but in Asian subcontinent it can easily happen.<br/><br/>The film I would rate a 5 but because of the premiere it was enhanced for me in places..<br/><br/>In the film one of the leading ladies attempts to seduce SK and amongst the audience we hear cries for Chak de Kuri no which means Grab the girl and go for it and then we hear louder cries na Shahrukh na kari and this obviously means don't do it SK don't.<br/><br/>Throughout the film this addition of comments made it an amazing experience. SK did a good job in the film but he was not the main lead and he was just used to entice people to watch it.<br/><br/>Im not going to say more than that because it will spoil it but Well worth watching and in big groups preferably!"

","Female Indian hockey team fight hard with male Indian hockey team during a dream ending match and result was close that you can accept.Team coach order a senior player to shift her position from CF to midfielder because it's give stability in team balance,when she was not want to do that it's mean she must be step out from team and during penalty shootout goal keeper wait for coach order to make sure which side she going to jump. Is it a game going on or reality show running on ground? But this is India no one going to see how perfect your story telling and direction is. You can put big names in your movie paint unnecessary emotional color with it then you going to receive claps and money from any kind of crap."

"AvinashPatalay","Null","0","4","3 January 2008"," You cannot go back and make a new start, but you can start now to make a new ending
","So this is the movie which cleansed the sins of Yash Raj films and SRK. And the credit should solely go to Shimit Amin for his conviction (one of the rare RGV protégé who has got what it takes). <br/><br/>All the girls of the hockey teams have put up a fantastic performance. Individually the character is well sketched out. But will it bring forth future offers from the tinsel town? Your guess is as good as mine. The interplay and rivalry between the seniors and fresher's is crafted out well. The state of affairs for non-cricket games is shown in true light. Presumably a few more non-cricket based movies might help to break the monopoly of the national craze and clear the myth that sports-based movies are jinxed.<br/><br/>The hockey matches are captured well on the screen especially the last ones. Background score adds to the adrenaline rush. My only complaint that there were a lot more qualifying rounds with inadequate screen time. <br/><br/>Its good to see the mother of Hum Log after a long sabbatical. <br/><br/>It is one of those role where you get to see deglamourised SRK with no hamming and no OTT acting. Indeed commendable performance and career wise a good move. He should balance his body of work with roles like this. <br/><br/>And finally the production house should get back to the closed room and analyse what made this film work...for it sans possibly all the Yash Raj ingredients.<br/><br/>PS: Prior to ""Chak De India"", we had a disgraced sports player of ""Apne"" returning to the game with a vengeance to redeem himself. It is about time Bollywood does away with melodrama."
"punksareforever","7","0","4","18 August 2007"," Good story,decent presentation comes with a feel good factor
","Everyone has performed well.Well...actually there isn't much to perform in a movie based on sports but it is able to display the much required ""team spirit"" stuff that makes a real team. Still a bit much on emotional side (SRK should shun his rona dhona wali image). But all the girls have done a good job given the fact that many are actually hockey players. The best part I believe this film has done is 2 give hockey a style symbol which it has been thirsty for. Any Sport is sport & should be played with a spirit irrespective of your gender,region,religion,its commercial value. The film has been successful in presenting the same. It was good 2 see people applauding in the cinema theaters much like they had done during lagaan. Hats off 2 the coach who has given us a gold in hockey despite rotten sports minsters we have had. A good job by the overall film unit team. 7/10."
