"crity2re","10","164","184","29 June 2005"," It's about time there's a movie about morals.
","Honestly, I don't care about dates. I don't care about names, or stats, or if the writers got a bunch of stats confused. I mean did you actually watch the movie, or were you just looking at the screen for misprints on jerseys? To believe that some people can actually watch a movie and then complain that the time line is off with reality is beyond my comprehension. Who cares about the time line! It's not reality that you're watching, it's a movie. Movies, no matter how real the stories they are based on, are not real. They are altered. They are changed to make a better storyline.<br/><br/>If people can be dense enough to complain about names and numbers and dates, then they missed the big picture. They missed a great movie that actually conveys a real message. It's not about the sports, it's about the students. And it's not always about what you put in, it's about what you take out. It's about what you take away from the situation that you've walked into.<br/><br/>That's what this movie is about, not about basketball. It's about life, and how easily people give in and give up. It's about learning, and having faith that people will do the right thing. Yes, it's about public education, and a community on the edge of stupid, but there's more to it than that. You just have to stop looking, and watch.<br/><br/>This movie truly was excellent, right up there on the shelf next to ""With Honors."" But make sure you are really paying attention, otherwise, what's the point?"

","This movie was fantastic! I first saw it during the last day of Summer School (yes, I went to Summer School. Shut up) and I have to admit that I did NOT want to watch it at first because it was a sports movie. But upon viewing this movie, I found that I liked it and enjoyed it. I then swiped the movie from my father's house and watched it every night for 3 nights straight. Here are the things that caught my attention.<br/><br/>1) Samuel L. Jackson. One of the greatest actors ever was in this movie so I was instantly drawn in and thought that I'd give it a chance.<br/><br/>2) The Music. Loved the music even though the majority is rap. It fit the movie perfectly.<br/><br/>3) The storyline. I really loved the story and the plot devices. The drama sequences were REALLY good.<br/><br/>4) The truth. This movie was pretty much dead-on to Ken Carter's real life experience. I watched the bonus feature ""Coach Carter: The Man Behind The Movie"" and it compared the movie to real life. It was like a perfect match.<br/><br/>My favorite lines were at the end spoken by Samuel L. Jackson after the final game. I always watch that every night. It's become kind of like a tradition for me. I showed this to my mom and she instantly fell in love with it, too.<br/><br/>So, all in all, really good movie. If I could rate this higher than 10 stars, I would've."
"Gundersonm","Null","60","68","30 January 2005"," Good Movie
","""Coach Carter"" is a well-made movie, and from what I have heard it stays true to the actual story. If you're sick of inspirational-type movies, then don't go see it, but otherwise I highly recommend it. All of the performances are at least tolerable, and most are really good. Samuel L. Jackson is great. Most sports movies have terrible action scenes, but the basketball footage in the movie is actually quite believable (for example, no short white kids dunking and things like that). The movie is very realistic, and the director has gone to great lengths to make it seem as true-to-life as possible. I think it works very well."
"cstu11","Null","142","173","15 January 2005"," Not your average basketball movie
","While basketball is used as the backdrop for the movie, Coach Carter really isn't about basketball. The real heart of the movie is in the way Coach Carter begins to turn the lives around of the players on his basketball team by showing them that someone actually cares about what happens to them after high school.<br/><br/>At one point in the movie Carter (played perfectly by Samuel L. Jackson) asks a player why he plays basketball and he responds with ""to win the state title"" - which of course gets him high fives from the rest of the team. Carter then asks the team who won the state title last year and nobody knows the answer. Carter tries to show his players that high school basketball is not about winning but about discipline, respect and the confidence to accomplish any goal.<br/><br/>If you are thinking about going to see Coach Carter as a basketball movie, I suggest seeing another movie, but if you want to see a truly inspiring story go see Coach Carter."
"origbillygoat","Null","118","143","16 January 2005"," Coach Carter was a good portrayal of a true story
","I really enjoyed the movie and was actually inspired by the end of the film. The film was a little corny and syrupy from time to time but it was an overall good, positive film. I have read and heard so many comments about the morals and unacceptable behavior portrayed by some of the characters and in turn viewers bad-mouth the film simply because they do not agree with some of the behavior of the some of the characters in the film. But these people obviously missed the point of the film. Coach Carter was trying to instill values that he thought would help an entire community. The reality is that kids do have foul mouths, have unprotected sex, are faced with hard decisions (to have or not have a baby and selling drugs) everyday.<br/><br/>We should all be so fortunate to have the opportunity to see a movie that features a person that actually tries to deal with these issues without making judgment calls and instead offer resolutions to problems. He offered resolutions to his team's behavior and left it to them to make the right decisions. This was good because they were able to see the consequences of their actions. When they made the right decision, they were able to see the positive consequences. When they made the wrong decision the players were faced with negative consequences and had no one to blame but themselves.<br/><br/>The impact of a person of this magnitude is profound and if some viewers found fault with this movie simply because their reality is a little different at this moment then it was for the characters in this film is very unfortunate for the viewer. Because you never know when you might be faced with a person similar to that in the movie. You just might have to deal with this situation more personally than expected and if this happens what will you do? Because the consequences of your actions in a situation like this will be either positive or negative as well."

","I can honestly relate to this movie. I am a female athlete and all through my high school years i've seen athletes get passed because they play sports. It's mostly the guys though. We have a coach that made every boy failing a subject get a tutor. This movie reminded me a lot of him. Not many coaches put their jobs on the line for the benefit of the kids. I agree with what he did 100% and i know lots of others do too. The movie shows perfect detail of how students act in schools and out of school. I went and saw it two nights in a row and each time, i saw different things about the movie. It's a great movie and I think all coaches and teachers should see it. It shows that most athletes are passed because they are athletes, not because they have the grades."

","There are many movies similar in plot and theme to Coach Carter but this movie stands well on it's own. Most of the credit for that has to go to the star, Samuel L. Jackson. They could not have found a better man to play this role. I do not know much about the coach this movie is based on, but I can not imagine anything better or stronger than what Jackson has given us here.<br/><br/>The story is pretty much like any other. A former basketball star from the early 70's is asked to coach this year's team due to the fact that the old coach is not able to keep the kids focused on their grades, coming to class, etc. Where this movie differs, and what makes this better than most movies of this type, is the depth it goes into in most of the players on the team. The bigger stars have their own back stories and reasons for why they are the way they are.<br/><br/>Obviously, judging the acting, Samuel L. Jackson is head and shoulders above the rest but others who stand out here are Rick Gonzalez, Antwon Tanner and Robert Ri'chard. Each of these guys played their characters to a tee. Overall, if you want to see an inspiring movie and feel like it accomplished it's purpose at the end, I can recommend Coach Carter to you. 8/10"

Carter accepts a little over $1,000 to work four months as basketball coach for a team of uncooperative, but heady young men. Carter has the players sign a contract to keep their grades up or be suspended from the team. When it is known that his players are not making the grade average and/or just not showing up for class; community outrage erupts when Carter benches his undefeated team and locks them out of the gym. In storybook fashion, the players left on the team bring their grades up and continue their Cinderella season to the state playoffs.<br/><br/>Typical slam dunks, ally-oops and no-look passes. PG-13 violence, language and sexual content. COACH CARTER stands and delivers. Worth watching more than once.

","'Coach Carter' is based on a true story of Coach Ken Carter, a controversial high school basketball coach played by Samuel L. Jackson. Coach Carter took the coaching job under his rules. He believed that the players must maintain good grades and become a united team or they would not play. All the team players signed his contract to do just that. The team was undefeated and on it's way to the 1999 State Championship, when Coach Carter received the low grades of his players. Coach Carter received national attention when he locked the gym and benched the whole team for poor grades. Coach Carter received some praise and much more criticism for his decision. This is a good inspirational movie of what one must do to excel in sports and in life. Coach Carter taught his players that they must be committed and work hard to excel.

I was so impressed with this movie that i cant say enough good things about it. I think some of the professional ball players could take some lessons from this high school coach. We could all be so lucky to have a man like this in our kids lives that actually cares for each and every child. The show is based on the real coach carter, so i looked up some of his internet pages.

"bob-rutzel","8","4","4","25 June 2005"," Terrific
","Ken Carter (Jackson) takes over a losing California high school basketball team and employs extreme measures to turn things around.<br/><br/>Yes, we have seen this before: a hard-assed coach molds his players into the image he desires for them. Yes, Samuel L. Jackson pontificates a lot in here. But all coaches pontificate to a large degree and it is justified. And, yes, it is a little too long, but so what? The basketball scenes are truly something to behold. The acting all around is excellent. And, yes, this is a terrific movie.<br/><br/>Okay, now for the down side. Why does Carter wait until the team is 9-0 to find out his players are not living up the contract they signed with him? The players are falling behind academically and Carter locks them out of the gym until they turn things around. But, waiting until 9-0 doesn't seem to have bothered anyone. Something doesn't seem right here, but no one has questioned this aspect. Even Carter doesn't say he should have looked harder sooner. Why not? <br/><br/>Now, in real life Carter owned a sports store. That is probably the reason I kept seeing different uniforms for just about every different game. When some basketball game scenes opened I had to wait until Carter calls the team over to the bench to see what players were his team, and then I knew what color jerseys his team had on. Before that, the action was so fast and furious I couldn't really tell. It's not like the players' faces were widely recognizable to viewers.<br/><br/>This is must see movie."
"IndianaFord","7","32","53","24 January 2005"," Coach Carter Review.
","Coach Carter is the story of a basketball coach who was persistent and had his priorities straight. The positive message the movie conveyed was that lives can be changed for the better through self discipline, hard work and the building of character. I was thinking to myself that the whole story was pretty believable, but then I looked into it and found it to be a true to life story so I guess it really is believable.<br/><br/>Samuel L. Jackson put in a convincing performance as the strict Coach Carter, as did the rest of the cast members. The movie, itself, was reminiscent of Lean On Me. It was the same basic story with the disciplinary figure helping the distraught kids through life.<br/><br/>I found it disappointing that the parent of the basketball team emphasized a mere game over something vastly more important, education. I rated this movie 7 of 10"
"IMSandman","7","3","3","26 June 2005"," ""Lean on Me"" meets ""Miracle""
","I give this movie 7 stars.<br/><br/>All in all this is a good movie. As the title suggests, it is basically ""Lean on Me"" (Morgan Freeman) merged together with ""Miracle"" (Kurt Russell).<br/><br/>Of course the sport here is basketball instead of ice hockey, but the story is very good.<br/><br/>Jackson's performance was solid as expected and the supporting cast made the story believable. While it certainly was not the best sports movie ever made, it is based on a true story and is worth a rental if you like Samuel Jackson and/or if are into sports movies.<br/><br/>Happy Viewing!"
"jpintar","8","3","3","21 June 2005"," a terrific movie
","Coach Carter is one of the best movies of the year and one of the best movies I have seen. Samuel L. Jackson gives one of his best performances as the new head basketball coach at his high school alma mater. Carter makes his team do sprints, pass, and play as winners not just as individual players. Plus he makes the team keep at least a C+ average in school and that they attend classes. When they fail to keep that average, he cancels practices and some games until they keep their grades up. I personally like what Coach Carter teaches them. Basketball will not always be there for them. If they get an education, they can have a life after high school and even go on to college. Coach Carter makes his team winners both on and off the court. I wish there were more coaches like Coach Carter in both high school and college to prepare young people for life as adults."
"the_usual_suspect","6","13","20","28 May 2005"," Points awarded for drama NOT for depth
","From the same school of plot development that Dangerous Minds attended, Coach Carter tells the story of the Richmond basketball team who learn that 'student' comes first in 'student athlete'. Cliché philosophy and lines such as ""I met you as boys and now you're men"" are given pride of place is this film, but for entertainment value and moral fortitude, you can't go far wrong with this effort from the director of Save the Last Dance.<br/><br/>The problem with the film as a media text is that it does not stand up to deconstruction. Behind the camera is a director who has no distinctive style. The action packed basketball scenes spice up this drama but never excel beyond music video quality, which is not an insult. The editing is snappy and mixed with the basketball beat of hip hop, the energy of the matches being truly communicated, but no effort is made to do something new with the camera angles. The way to enjoy this film is not to look beneath the surface, instead just allowing yourself to be carried away by the innocent excitement of simplicity.<br/><br/>Coach Carter was always going to need a strong lead to gain the substance that is has done. The no nonsense and iron willed demeanour that Samuel L. Jackson brings to the role makes him ideal for putting across the image of a man who can hold court in front of these hard life ghetto teens. What Jackson also brings is an amusing aggressive streak that make the audience glad they are not in the gym with this psycho who, despite pounding his players with endless 'submissions', still locks the gym when their grades don't come through.<br/><br/>Carter is a difficult character to understand. He seems ready to refuse entry to hard nut bad boy Timo Cruz (Rick Gonzalez), but caves in when Junior Battle (Nana Gbewonyo) turns up at his shop with his mother and begs forgiveness. As the film progresses however, we learn that Carter is doing everything he can to get his players into college and gain a life worth living, presumably to become what Carter himself has.<br/><br/>The players Carter strives to impact upon succumb easily to Carter's will. Occasional outbursts punctuate what is mostly a submissive relationship between coach and team and director Thomas Carter seems focused on delivering a realistic ensemble rather than the typical teen comedy entourage of weird and outrageous characters. It is a little unnerving being thrown into a gym with an unbreakable coach and a group of muscular teenagers who need to work to get average grades and can't roll off witty one-liners like the teenagers in other films in the genre. This decision to communicate realism is brave, but gives the film an enhanced depth that makes the lesson learned at the end more heart warming and honest. The ending is one of the film's three pointers, going against not only the conventions of the genre, but of Hollywood.<br/><br/>What lacks is subplot development. Timo Cruz's drug running is given screen time between matches but ends abruptly. Cruz shoots from being a hard case to being a shivering wreck on Carter's doorstep, in need of a strong father figure which I suppose we are to assume Cruz does not have. A little background here would not have been amiss. Cruz's doorstep tears also bring to attention the relationship between Carter and his son Damien (Robert Ri'chard), which appears very son-and-sir in nature. There is a hint of tension beneath the surface that we glimpse at when Damien arrives late at practise, and there may also have been an undertone of jealousy when Carter hugs Cruz, but this is not elaborated upon and there is a slight emptiness in their bond.<br/><br/>However, Coach Carter remains entertaining throughout. Realism and drama team-up to hit home hard the lessons that the team learn. Their struggle to overcome the stigma of their stereotypes is captured patiently, yet there is never a dull moment. Samuel L. Jackson brings a mountainous presence to his role that allows the audience to feel the film's extremes of pride and disappointment to a great extent. Involving emotionally and arresting dramatically, but superficial textually (although points awarded for fearlessness in parts of the subject matter).<br/><br/>Rating: 3/5 By Joshua Morrall"

","Let me repeat that: Samuel L. Jackson never disappoints. That is exactly the kind of performance I expect. Of course, being directed by the individual you're portraying helps tremendously. No director/actor pair could work better. I typically don't like sports movies because they are too predictable: the team always wins!! How predictable!! On this movie, however, the team actually loses! Imagine my surprise! But by that point I realized that that was not the point of the movie.

Unless, of course, a crop of even more fetid films crawls out from under a rock between now and then. For all our Coach Carter is plenty bad enough to tide us all over until next year.

Sport won't get you far unless your a great but study and hard work in school will get you everywhere. Enter, a town that is quite poor and a basketball team who just want to win. Once Ken Carter accepts the job, the whole team changes and it is for the better. Another message this film teaches is respect, at the beginning just after meeting the boys, Ken expresses a need for the boys to show respect not only for themselves but for their friends and elders. He does this by explaining how the word 'nigger' can be used as a degrading term and how by dressing themselves with respect, behaving respectfully isn't bad at all.<br/><br/>As soon as I saw this film, I knew that I wanted to see it. It has everything that makes a great movie, action, great dialog and most importantly, a good moral message and in a time where morally corrupt movies are on the rise, a great movie like this is a rare find.<br/><br/>Intiallly, my friends didn't want to see this movie with me as they thought it was boring, and too intense but after months and months of waiting, I finally hired it out on DVD and watched it.<br/><br/>You can actually take things away from this movie and it has a very good morals which can be applicable to everyone."
"christian123","4","13","28","15 July 2005"," The Only Highlight Here Is Samuel L. Jackson
","Based on a real life story that made national news in 1999, Samuel Jackson plays Coach Ken Carter, the controversial high school basketball coach who benched his entire undefeated team due to their poor performance in their classes.<br/><br/>I admire the message from Coach Carter but I did not actually like the movie. The story is your typical sports movie with all the clichés. The film is also based on a true story though I wonder how much of that truth was put into the movie. The film was very unrealistic at times and this brought down the quality. For example, the number of push-ups and suicides he makes them do every day is flat out ridiculous. There were a few other annoying parts but they didn't bring down the film too much. I also didn't like the way this movie handled abortion. Kyra (Ashanti) is pregnant and she is really excited about having the baby. Until, she breaks up with her boyfriend and she gets an abortion. She tells him this and all he says is, ""aw man you should have told me, so I could have been there with you"". This response was really stupid as was the whole subplot. This whole thing felt like MTV's approach to the problem, like it doesn't really matter.<br/><br/>The acting is quite strong and it is the only thing Coach Carter has going for it. Samuel L Jackson was great as Coach Carter and he made the film. If it wasn't for his presence, than the film would have been worse. Everyone on the basketball team also gave good performances though no one really stands out. Also, none of the characters were very interesting. Ashanti proves she can act with a decent performance here. However, she doesn't get a lot of screen time.<br/><br/>Sport clichés are pretty much unavoidable. It doesn't mean that the film is bad, it just means that there really isn't anything new. Miracle and Friday Night Lights were both clichéd yet both were good films. I can't really say the same for Coach Carter though. The film was just too long for a predictable story and it also lacked compelling characters. Miracle was also 134 minutes long yet it had interesting characters and it wasn't as dull. Even the basketball games in Coach Carter weren't very interesting and this hurt the film for me.<br/><br/>The movie also pounds it's message into the viewer's head without really giving a good argument. Yes, school should come first but it would be different in this case because most of the players only have basketball to rely on. They come from a poor neighborhood and even if they do get their grades up, most will still not go to college. The end of the film kind of proved that as only six of the players actually went to college. Even if they didn't go to college, the fact that they still tried to make something of themselves is still a nice message. Though I think the players should have focused more on basketball if that was their stronger point. In the end, I would still recommend Coach Carter but it really didn't do anything for me. Rating 4/10"

","I was hyped and caught the sneak preview show. It was awful. It reminded me of the movie Hoosiers on crack. It's way to long and unnecessarily drawn out. Poor presentation aside, there really is nothing special about this film. Everything, including the excessive basketball, is very average. Did we really need to see the same kid quit multiple times? Even the excessive ghetto flavor didn't sit right with me. The resolution of this story and every plot device in it crests the horizon like a flying cow. The story may have been a great idea on paper but in execution, it fails. I came, I saw, I wished I had waited for it to be released on DVD.<br/><br/>3/10 at best."

It is a classic old school battle between students (players) and teacher (in this case coach), but it really hits home on some of the major obstacles facing our youth today. It is a wonderful film that offers an array of solutions, extreme as they may be.<br/><br/>Early on the film begins with coach Carter slamming one of his belligerent new players into the gym wall only to hear the player whine ""teachers aren't supposed to touch students."" The rest of the film proves how teachers and coaches can touch students in other than physical ways to effect positive growth and change.<br/><br/>Ever wanted to know what goes on at the high school dance? This movie holds no punches in showing what is hot and what is not when it comes to todays dances and parties. This might jar some memories! <br/><br/>In the end, this film is a lot more than the typical ""you can succeed when things are really tough"" film. In fact, the ending is not exactly what I anticipated. Although the film is built around some very good basketball action, the center focus is on the growing up process, accountability, parent involvement, and the idea that ones actions really do have consequences that effect not only themselves, but those they hold dear.

This movie goes way beyond the scenes of high school life and it has to do with not being inferior and having desire to persevere in life. The question is do we want to be average or do we want better for ourselves. Going to college will not only enhance our chances of being better educated, but it will also enable us to have the ability of having a higher standard of living. Without an education, there is very little that we can accomplish in life and we are nothing without it."

","This film is just another entirely ponderous exercise in star power fizzling and prestige film-making gone pretentious. I didn't care for this movie in the least. If this crud makes $1 over its budget, The studio would be wise to declare victory, round up all available copies, store them deep within the nuclear waste repository under Yucca Mountain, and then never make another movie like it again. Coach Carter is a prime example of what happens when there's too little source material for a movie screenplay.

Samuel L. Jackson of course did excellent as usual. There were many new actors in the film as well that made there presence known.

","I guess this movie is a tragedy, but not in the sense it was intended. The real tragedy in this movie is not losing in the playoffs but the abortion of the child.

What message is that trying to send? <br/><br/>I know it's just a movie, but there were several supposedly ""tense"" scenes that I had to restrain myself from bursting into laughter. <br/><br/>Scene #1-The drug dealer dies. And this is a tragedy why? I'm supposed to feel sorry for this person that get's gunned down when he's only been on the screen for five minutes and has made the impression of a very disreputable and unlikeable person. I guess I should feel sorry for worm or whatever his name is...but doesn't his cousin's death remove that unhealthy element in worm's life?<br/><br/>Scene #2- Worm's supposedly heartwarming monologue that was never really developed in the movie. I get the fact the he had inner conflict throughout the movie, I just never really seemed to care. And during his little diatribe in the gym (with the desks, etc.) I kept wondering: When did this solid F student, ex-drug dealer become a philosopher? Did he look up every word he's saying in the dictionary 5 minutes before coach Carter enters the gym? why doesn't the audience see that so it makes more sense?<br/><br/>Basically the movie boils down to this-it has a good message, Samuel L.

","""Coach Carter"" tells the story of a basketball coach who refuses to give up on a bunch of failing high school students in a deprived area of the city. The way Ken Carter insists and persists to help the students using his unconventional ways, being the call of his duty, is truly remarkable. There are so many thought provoking lines from Carter, such as saying ""That's exactly the problem"" when responding to the principal's accusation of him taking the highlight of the students life away. How Carter motivated the students to be champions, not just in the basketball court, but in life as well, is truly inspiring and emotional. I really enjoyed this film."
"callanvass","8","1","1","29 August 2013"," Excellent sports biopic; Jackson is absolutely terrific!
","Coach Carter made for quite the riveting watch. Whilst it's not quite as good as Gene Hackman's Hoosiers, it's pretty damn good in its own right. The story itself is nothing all that spectacular, despite being based on true events. You've seen this type of stuff before, but the way they managed to pull it off is what really made this movie. You may question Carter's tactics at first, but you'll soon rally behind him, and that's the powerfulness of Samuel L. Jackson's performance. The fact that he would go on strike and hold up games, simply so his players would improve academically; It's brazen, but it really got to me. His intensity was off the charts and the man was often magnetic to watch. It's a memorable performance which I rank as one of Jackson's best. Rob Brown is best known for his great performance in The Express, and he was solid as a rock here. Ashanti actually does decent here, whilst Channing Tatum makes an appearance in one of his early roles.The character that I related to the most was Junior. I empathized with his plight, and I give credit to Nana Gbewonyo for his awesome performance. It also helps that the Basketball action is very exciting to watch. It felt like I was watching a real basketball game at times, and that's one of the biggest compliments I can give it<br/><br/>Final Thoughts: This is an excellent film. If you love basketball, true stories, and Samuel L. Jackson, I can guarantee you will find things to like about this one. At least I hope you do<br/><br/>8/10"
"da_chachas","8","1","1","19 February 2013"," Not your typical sports film
","In deciding to watch this movie, I am not going to lie, I expected to be watching another predictable inspirational sports movie. I expected to see the typical predictable underdog movie where a bunch of misfits end up coming out on top and afterward feel like I just wasted over two hours of my life. I could not have been more wrong. Coach Carter was more than just an inspirational movie; it had many deeper meanings within it and definitely has the potential to leave the viewer with a renewed sense of gratitude towards their life and their opportunities. <br/><br/>The storyline was very marketable and fundamental. This movie was based on a true story where a California high school basketball coach named Ken Carter put a lock on his gym until all his students met the necessary academic requirements needed to have a chance to go for a secondary education. As simple as this storyline sounds, director Thomas Carter did a fair job at keeping the audience intrigued with multiple conflicts and preventing them from being able to predict what would happen. The script was satisfactory for the most part. Samuel L. Jackson did an excellent job in relaying his funny and strict retorts to his disrespectful players, and overall the script allowed him to stay in character the whole entire movie. The side plots throughout were very intriguing considering it was based off of a true story. The script did a decent job of portraying these stories without straying too far off of what actually happened in real life.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie was sub-par at best. Samuel L. Jackson did a fantastic job as the lead role of Ken Carter, however he definitely stole the show and beyond that the acting was a bit too theatrical for my taste. It was noticeable that the supporting actors seemed disinterested when it was not their turn to act, and many conversations did not seem realistic or fluent. <br/><br/>While the acting was not particularly impressive, the production value in this film was excellent. In most sports films today, it seems that the action scenes are unrealistic and the viewer can typically realize that it is not what true basketball actually feels like. Besides some exaggerated, animated calls from the referees, and childish reactions from the fans and bench players, they did an outstanding job of portraying what an actual high school basketball game atmosphere would be like. Most of the scenes in the entire movie had great production value and always had a very realistic feel to it. Director Thomas Carter did an excellent job with the story he was given. There was no scene in the entire movie that I felt was unnecessary and there were no noticeable blunders within the film. He kept it very professional and the mood of the film transitioned phenomenally as the players began to mature under their new coach. <br/><br/>Lastly, although there are hundreds of inspirational movies on the market, this movie excels in originality. This film is not the typical underdog movie, however it teaches morals and life lessons to all the viewers. Ken Carter's players never lacked talent, but lacked the discipline and academic strength in order to succeed in not only basketball, but also life itself. By way of harsh punishments and requirements, he gets his players on the right track to being successful. It is definitely a unique film and overall, it is an outstanding film to watch."
"hearsz","9","1","1","15 October 2010"," Great movie, and I don't even like Basketball!
","Can Samuel L. Jackson do a thing wrong? His portrayal of Coach Carter was top notch and I found he believably instilled confidence in the Oilers Basketball team, in the same way the real Coach Carter most likely would have. <br/><br/>This movie can certainly be enjoyed by people who have no interest in basketball, or even sports for that matter. He teaches the players not only to win and be humble about it, but also to become more knowledgeable through education, learning respect and discipline were all just as vitally important. <br/><br/>Coach Carter had a set plan on how to not only make the team of players he had better athletes, but also to give them a fighting chance of surviving the outside world once or if they were accepted into college. Despite percentages showing that kids from the Richmond area were more likely to end up in jail than to succeed, he took his chances by making even the most unthinkable dreams for some of the players a reality. <br/><br/>For the few of you who are knocking this film (or intend to), saying things like ""it was a snore fest"" or ""Samuel's worst role"", you are by far in the minority and your pointless comments are quite simply falling on deaf ears. <br/><br/>This movie is inspiring, moving and certainly one of Samuel L. Jacksons best. 9/10"
"hitchcockthelegend","8","1","1","30 December 2009"," You said we're a team. One person struggles, we all struggle. One person triumphs, we all triumph.
","Coach Carter is based on a true story, in which Richmond High School head basketball coach Ken Carter made the headlines in 1999 for locking out his undefeated team due to their poor academic results. This, at a time when the team was excelling out on the court, caused a furious reaction from the parents, the town and principals alike.<br/><br/>You have seen one uplifting sport movie then you have seen them all it would seem. From the likes of comedy fluff such as Major League, to the more serious approach in productions like Remember the Titans et al, the formula is prescribed to leave a warming glow come the inevitable finale. What helps these types of movies succeed of course, is if the film is based around a true story, such as this one is, and more crucially, if the main actor is able to fully grab the viewers attention and hold it as formulae and ennui threaten to take control. Enter Samuel L. Jackson as Ken Carter.<br/><br/>Jackson, the work-horse that he is, has a CV that is as up and down as an automated Big-Dipper. What isn't in question is that he is always value for money, even in garbage like The Man. Here, he elevates Coach Carter above the yarn status that it looks on the page. Ken Carter was a rich character, a man who wanted to keep his charges out of prison and the morgue. To get them to be all they can be as they move from being boys to becoming men, both on the court and in the classroom. Basketball is merely one slice of the pie, Ken Carter wants them to be fully formed young men. And Jackson plays it absolutely perfect. Blending sophisticated hard-assery with steely determination, Jackson excels and makes the overlong running time well worth sitting thru.<br/><br/>Yes it's a bit paint by numbers, how could it not be really? But any film that has the gumption to put academia on the same playing court as hoop shooting deserves an extra plaudit. Aided by the exciting, and authentic looking on-court action {well done director Thomas Carter} Coach Carter, and especially Sammy Jackson, manages to deliver more than enough interest to make this one of the better sports movies of the last decade. 7.5/10"

","Impressed by a clip of this film showing Carter's hardened approach to training his players on Film4's daily preview, I decided to sit down and watch this film.<br/><br/>As the opening credits took place, two features stood out: (1) the MTV Films logo; and (2) 'Based on the life of Ken Carter'. As the film started, I admittedly began to dread attempting to watch this film, but I hoped that by viewing all the events portrayed in the film as being true, the film would surpass my initial prejudice.<br/><br/>All I can say is that this is a good film, and a cut above everything else of its nature. Its message of determination and success is clear and welcomed, and its actors (young and old) prove to be convincingly genuine. As far as the plot goes, although it does slow down a bit after the end of the tournament, it eventually picks up and proves to be a great story overall. This film certainly showed me.<br/><br/>Okay, the film isn't exactly a masterpiece. It's not the most thought-provoking of films, nor is it an emotional roller-coaster like the best films are. However, the film succeeds at achieving what it set out to do - to tell the true story of a man determined to never deny his beliefs, and by doing so, give hopeless kids a better future. I can't help but respect the characters in what they achieve through the course of the film, and I hope that if you watch the film that you do too."

"artemis_5","7","1","1","2 May 2006"," Violence, Poverty, and Basketball
","I grew up 3 blocks from the Richmond border, and am all too familiar with the poverty, violence, and desperation that plagues its residents. In Richmond, like in many parts of this country, young men cope with the rough environment in which they grew up by playing basketball (jerseys are sported by just about any boy under 22).<br/><br/>Having gone to high school with these kids (or rather with the Richmond kids who were bussed to my local high school), I became familiar with their subculture. What struck me most about the movie was just how well it captured the boys that I knew from Richmond. Maybe urban culture is the same around the country, but having grown up near Richmond and San Pablo (another neighboring city), they were the only urban youth with whom I was familiar.<br/><br/>By the way, in case anyone was wondering about the party in the wealthy neighborhood to which the Richmond basketball team was invited, here in the San Francisco Bay Area, the communities are so close together that it is not uncommon for kids from poorer areas to hang out in areas that are more affluent, or to go to parties in those areas. However, I have heard that in other parts of the country, the ""borders"" between urban areas and the suburbs are not as fluid.<br/><br/>I do not remember reading about the dramatic victories of the Richmond High basketball team in the local paper, but I did take a community college class taught by an instructor who my mother told me once had Coach Carter in his class, and many of my clients have kids who were or are students at Richmond High.<br/><br/>After seeing so many films about events that took place years ago and far away, it was refreshing to see an interesting film about a community with which I am somewhat familiar. This film is worth at least a rental, particularly if you are from the East Bay.<br/><br/>On another note: Go, CAL Bears....."

"jdesando","Null","5","12","12 January 2005"," The excitement is infectious.
","I enjoy glory stories about young athletes beating the odds because of their talent and the tidal force of a strong-headed coach. The 1999 Richmond High School (California) Oilers are celebrated in Coach Carter, and with Samuel L. Jackson (Who else?) as the no nonsense coach with the revolutionary idea that his underprivileged team should carry a 2.3 average, wear ties to games, and adhere to a contract about all these conditions. The carrot, besides playing ball, is that they might go to college because of the student-athlete profile. The reality is that such an arc will lead to the NCAA and maybe the NBA.<br/><br/>As in last year's Miracle about Olympic hockey and Friday Night Lights about high school football, the coach is charismatic, uncompromising, and based on a real person. His confession that he failed because he came to teach boys how to play basketball and ended with students who became men is close to the ameliorative spirit of the entire film.<br/><br/>Although the formula is secure in the land of sports clichÃ©s, having attractive young people and a bankable tough guy actor play the lead parts results in an enjoyable experience. The excitement is infectious, the values about hard work and integrity far more convincing than all the bromides thrown at us by neocons in the last election.<br/><br/>Coach Carter has been played countless times in films but is a pleasant experience if the hackneyed hokum such as the crusty coach and stereotyped players (the surly white Eminem look-a-like, the African American with the pregnant girlfriend, the Latino with drug connections and attitude, to name a few) is handled with care, as it is here.

Jackson is never quite sympathetic enough, quite human enough, for the viewer to care about, and the boys on the team come off like a gang of thug wannabees.<br/><br/>The movie seems to play fast and loose with time. Grades are brought up in, apparently, a day or so, thousands of push-ups are done in brief hours. There is a tawdry back-story about the inevitable pregnancy of a player's girlfriend, idiotic and unreasonable parents and school officials (Carter bears a lot of resemblance to Joe Clark, ""Lean On Me""). There was (for me) a lot of difficulty telling the boys apart or connecting them with their names.<br/><br/>An irritating undercurrent in this movie is the understanding that one one either goes to college or to prison. There is apparently no room in this society for plumbers, electricians, chefs, soldiers, ... just grads and inmates.<br/><br/>All in all, this is not a terrible movie.

Coach Carter allows the audience to examine the lives of these kids and keeps it real. The direction of this movie allows you to be there rather than just watching it.

","I had never heard of this movie before, and I did watch it only because my sister had to watch to do an essay from school, so my expectations were somewhat low. But man, it is really good!<br/><br/>It tells a truly emotional story, that touches on extremely sensitive issues, and the fact that it is based on a true story makes it even more powerful. Everything that surrounds the kids that lived in that neighborhood, their families, their social influences, their money problems, and so many other factors would have led to... unfortunate outcomes. And that is something even people who aren't necessarily on situations similar to the characters in the movie can learn from, and try to be more grateful for what they have, and also try to help others as much as they can.<br/><br/>Talking about the movie itself, I found it really well written, the acting was great, and it doesn't necessarily feel almost 2 hours and 20 minutes long, which is a plus. Half way through the movie, I checked the time, and saw that we still had more than an hour to go, and... I was glad! I didn't wanna leave those characters yet, and I wanted to see them succeeding.<br/><br/>I think tho, that after the first big win (their championship) the pace, that was going so smoothly, kind of struggled a bit, and only after a good 20, 25 minutes it started to pick up again, which is still, fine, I was invested in the characters and entertained. But it can be said as one problem.<br/><br/>To sum up, Coach Carter is a great movie, with a touching story, that may make you re-think some important aspects of your own life. You may start think more about inequality, and privileges you didn't realized you had before, which is fine, what counts, is what you do moving forward, the way you approach life, and, if you happen to have any number of privileges, just always be grateful for it, and try to make the best of it, and luckily, in any kind of way, shape or form, you might actually do something that will give another person new opportunities, and so on. In times like this, that's something truly important to keep in mind, and think about on a day to day basis. Let's be grateful for what we have, and help others as much as we can."

He takes over as head basketball coach, makes his presence known, and makes them sign a contract with certain expectations. When they fail to live up to them, he locks them out of practice and games.<br/><br/>This isn't so much a sports story as it is about life and respecting authority and working as a team.

","It was gratifying to watch a picture in which a black man takes a group of young teens to task for their casual use of the 'N' word, and instruct them in the value of an education to escape their poverty and unfulfilling family lives. This was made over a decade ago and things weren't as turbulent yet, but if Samuel L. Jackson came out with the same sentiments today, he'd be raked over the coals by the political correctness police. Sad, because speaking the truth about something causes an uproar in the media and gets the Twitter gang going full force, and Jackson would have to defend himself against being an Uncle Tom, or be forced to walk it back under the pretense of being sorry he offended anyone. You know the drill.<br/><br/>Regarding the story, it's pretty formulaic as most sports themed movies are, so the value is in the messaging mentioned earlier. I didn't know going in that the picture was based on a true story, so that makes it's lessons more accessible for viewers accustomed to feel good sports films that have no connection to reality. Just like the earlier movie ""Hoosiers"", this one places value on relationships, discipline, teamwork, finding the good in somebody, and ultimately, redemption. The fact that the Richmond Oilers missed out on a Cinderella, story book ending shouldn't diminish it's impact as a valuable life lesson for those in unfortunate circumstances. The team may have lost that final championship game, but they emerged winners in life."

","I know I'm very late in leaving a review, but I first saw this movie about 6 years ago (I was in 8th grade). My dad handed it to me and told me to watch it because I love sports movies, and oh man did this movie captivate what I love about sports. Sports aren't just a collision of sweaty bodies for the entertainment of others, it's about teamwork and being successful in and off the court. This is what ""coach carter"" does so well, it's a basketball movie but it's not about basketball. ""Coach carter"" instead focuses on the integrity of a basketball coach and how he refuses to let his players be just another statistic in a failing educational system. This story spoke to me from the first viewing and shows everyone who watches it that sports does not make you who you are, and that we as people are above the game. Overall this is a beautiful movie about the hardships of those who only have the game of basketball left in their lives. Every performance is amazing (specifically Jackson as coach carter and Rick Gonzalez as Timo Cruz). Please watch this movie especially if you love basketball, it will leave tears in your eyes."
"spookyrat1","6","0","0","21 November 2018"," Rims Out!
","It's a sports movie that presses all the normal sports movie buttons, right through to the emotive climax. Down and out underperforming school basketball team from a poor socio-economic area, is led to salvation (in more ways than one) through the concerted efforts of a charismatic coach, who once attended the same school.<br/><br/>Oddly what we don't get in a two and a quarter hour ""biographical"" movie called Coach Carter, is to learn much about the man himself ... Ken Carter. We find out he is a passionate advocate for educational achievement and the chances and choices it can offer those with a will to succeed. We discover a few of the strategies he uses to develop the Richmond Oilers from a position as a lowly rung team to one that can challenge for a schools state championship. In achieving his own goals, unsurprisingly we uncover the fact that he doesn't mind treading on administrative, player and parental toes to attain his ambitions.<br/><br/>But that's about it. Yes he has a son called Damien who was also a very skilful player and played for the Oilers. He has some sort of retail business in Richmond and he has a loving wife whose name I'm not sure we even learn by the end of the film, she gets such little screen time. He is wonderfully played by the always distinguished Samuel L Jackson, but we find out little of his background, what makes him tick and why he seemingly, so suddenly wants to make a difference with the team and the team's school. His story is sketched so lightly that he just appears to come from nowhere.<br/><br/>Instead much of the running time of this long film explores the lives of some of the team's players and (ironically enough) their families. Apparently (based on the end credits) most are real people, but their stories are similar to what we've seen in any number of similar school/sports/urban teenage films where characters strive to overcome a variety of disadvantages and adversities.<br/><br/>The film has solid production values and the basketball choreography is first rate. But I was personally disappointed that by film's conclusion, the title character standing on the sidelines, calling all the shots and making all the big moves, was himself not fleshed out much past the cipher stage."

","This was on my watch later for almost a year, before I was looking for a sports movie after finishing a sports reality series, I figured why not.<br/><br/>Samuel L. Jackson is Ken Carter, the owner of a successful sporting goods store and a former college basketball player. He is approached by his former high school coach to take the coaching job at inner-city Richmond H.S., where Carter was a 2 time All-American nearly 20 years prior. The team won just 4 games the previous season, but he decides to take on the job regardless, mostly as a favour. <br/><br/>A mostly predictable sports underdog story ensues. The team is run ragged in practice, sign contracts relating to academics and soon enough, the team is on a lengthy undefeated streak. Numerous side plots include Carter's son transferring to Richmond to play for him, a player and girlfriend deciding what to do about a potential baby and a player leaving the team multiple times to sell drugs.<br/><br/>Unexpectedly, Samuel L. Jackson is fantastic and in the end, the only thing keeping this from being rated a fair bit lower. A young Channing Tatum is literally just another player and not particularly memorable and besides Ashanti as a player's girlfriend, I couldn't tell you one other person casted in this movie. <br/><br/>The inevitable middle of the movie conflict erupts, the baby angle is abruptly and clumsily ended and the drug dealing player's supplier is the only person shot to death in two hours. <br/><br/>On the whole, Samuel L. Jackson is fantastic in this movie, more or less playing himself as a basketball coach. But, the whole script is not great, there's no real supporting performances that lead to a good scene and I thought the film ran way too long. <br/><br/>You may shout at the TV when Carter is about to admonish his team ""I need winners off the court!"", but it's not a total waste of your life either. 6/10."

"sddavis63","7","0","0","6 July 2017"," My Favourite Samuel L. Jackson Movie
","I'm not saying that this is the best film Samuel L. Jackson ever made, or that it's his finest performance. He's been a busy actor with a huge body of work, after all. But I will say that ""Coach Carter"" is probably my favourite Samuel L. Jackson movie. And his performance as Coach Ken Carter is very good, and the overall story is quite inspiring. It's a hopeful movie to watch; one that promises that things and people can turn around, and that those who could be expected to fall by the wayside can rise to the top - not just in basketball (which is the setting of this movie) but also in life. As Carter, Jackson is playing the coach of the Richmond High School basketball team. It's an inner city school that graduates only 50% of its students, few of whom actually go on to college. The basketball team is made up of a bunch of boys who couldn't care less about school, who get into trouble outside school and who lose over and over on the court. Carter comes in and lays down the law, expecting student athletes to be students first and athletes second - trying to teach them how to be winners, not only on the court but off. Along the way he faces opposition from the players themselves, their parents, their teachers, the principal and the school board - but he stands up straight, stares his detractors down and shuts down the basketball program (after having led the team to 16 straight wins) because not enough of the players are keeping up their academic end of the bargain. Ultimately he takes this group of boys - who could have just been written off as losers - to the state championship tournament, and sees many of them go to college and progress into successful lives.<br/><br/>That's the story. It's inspiring. It's also (to be honest) entirely formulaic. It's a formula that works - which is why it's been used repeatedly for decades - but it's still a formula: Principal/Teacher/Coach takes over troubled School/Classroom/Team, gets tough and turns everything around. Usually (as here) the story is based on true events - making it even more inspiring. But it is still a formula - there's a predictability to this. You've seen it before, even if you haven't seen the movie before. But the performances from Jackson and the young actors who played the members of the team (and from Ashanti, who played Kyra, the girlfriend of one of the players) does manage to keep it seeming fresh and alive at the same time.<br/><br/>Sure you can quibble about the timeline being off (for example, Carter took over the team in 1997 and the year of the lockout was 1999, not just a few weeks after he became coach) but chalk those things up to dramatic license. The basics are accurate enough, and the movie's an inspiring, feel-good story about a man who made a difference in a lot of young lives. Who can really argue with that? (7/10)"
"Floated2","7","0","0","16 February 2017"," Underrated true story based sports drama
","Coach Carter (2005) appears to be one of Samuel L. Jackson's more overlooked leading roles. This is a film with a firm message which is to take responsibility for yourself and your actions. It's a good message and it's delivered by a solid cast. The main subject is about basketball, but at a run time of over 2 hours, this film dwells into deeper subjects regarding the students of the team. <br/><br/>Here we see Sam Jackson star in the titular role as a sporting goods store owner who accepts a job as high school basketball coach at the school where he still holds several basketball records. This film is based on a true story where we are understood that Jackson is portraying a real life figure. The team at the school is filled with raw talent, but no discipline. Carter begins his reign as coach by requiring all of the boys on the team to sign a contract stating that they will maintain a 2.3 GPA, that they will sit in the front row of every class, and that they must wear a coat and tie to school on game days. In return, he promises to guide them to a winning season. After much grumbling, the boys fall in line and begin to accept the Coach, especially after his training methods soon put them on an undefeated winning streak.<br/><br/>One thing which is quite hard to grasp at is how quickly Coach Carter was able to turn the team around. It is mentioned early in the film that they were a terrible team the previous year (winning 4 games, with 22 losses), and once Carter comes along, he is instantly able to turn them into a great team (mentioned as winning 16 straight at one point in the film). The challenge seemed quite easier than it should have, where we did not see much struggle. Though in the end, is where the film takes a turn and since it is based on a true story, not everything is a happy ending. The team unfortunately lose their championship game by a very close game. Had this been a fiction film, that most likely would not have happened. Overall, this film is quite interesting though outdated with many of the references and the overall outlook of the film. A great entertaining watch for fans of sports dramas."

","The film is based on the true story of Coach Ken Carter who benched his undefeated high school basketball team in 1999, because of their poor academic standings. While the film may not be an exact replica of what took place, it definitely is an inspiring story. It is good to know that some teachers care about where their students are headed in life, and want to put them in a position where they can better succeed.<br/><br/>The basketball action is quite exciting - especially the alley oops. The practice sessions, and teamwork are all well played out as well. There were quite a few plays that made me go 'wow, that was good'. Apparently, Channing Tatum had not played basketball before the movie, so I guess it's a good thing we don't see him with the ball much. On the other hand, the players on the court the most: Brown, Gbewonyo, Ri'chard, and Tanner are all great handlers and shooters. <br/><br/>Jackson as the coach acts his part well. He brings the intensity and sincereness of the character across the screen. The other actors also do well at playing teenagers wanting to appear cool. However, the narrative about the more grown up character Kenyon, and his girlfriend Kyra was a nice side story. Their struggles exemplified why Coach Carter fights so hard to keep them from failing their classes.<br/><br/>Overall, a nicely made film that was both engaging and motivating. Having said that, I'm sure some parents or teachers would have supported Carter more vocally. The film basically showed Coach Carter against the world."

","This is the story of a coach who bucks the system to ensure that the players on his basketball team not only become a stellar team, but attain a good education to boot. It's another one of those paint-by-number sports movies with a tough-as-nails coach and a rebellious team that he has to whip into shape. The film puts the spotlight on an education system that places more emphasis on producing winning players than producing winning students with lots of opportunities in life.<br/><br/>It's not a bad movie, but it's not a great movie. It's predictable. You know the ending from the start of the movie. That's not a terrible thing, considering that in movies like this, often it's the journey that counts more than the end product. It's a movie full of life lessons and messages about teamwork, fulfilling your personal destiny and ambitiously pursuing goals without being complacent. The film has a good moral backbone.<br/><br/>There are more than enough syrupy, cringe-inducing moments to choke a horse. The movie relies heavily on sentiment and cliché to drive its point home. Every movie has the potential of really being a piece of art, but when a film relies on overused tropes, it satisfies the audience without challenging them. Therefore, the movie never feels like it's doing something new. <br/><br/>The movie is filmed well. It looks great. It's crisp and full lof fluid camera movements.. From the lighting to the sets, the movie is made well. <br/><br/>The training Carter puts his team through is rough. You feel the pain of the team when they constantly have to endure suicide runs and pushups, but you also see the benefits of really striving to be your best. You see the benefits of practice, repetition and training. The sports scenes are well-choreographed and filmed. The characters are mostly likable. The contrast between Coach Carter and the principal is a strong element of the movie (she cares less about the kids' educations and more about having a winning team). At one point, the principal says something to the effect of ""Playing on this team could be the best time of their lives"". At this point, it hits you that these kids really don't have a chance to become anything with a school system that sees them as simply members of a winning team as opposed to young people full of potential.<br/><br/>This is what sets Coach Carter apart from other sports movies. The Coach has a goal that is bigger and nobler than simply having a winning team. He cares about the kids and their futures. <br/><br/>The scenes with Samuel Jackson are strong, for the most part. He's a good actor; convincing, solid and a force to be reckoned with. However, a number of the other younger actors aren't good enough to carry a scene, which leaves the movie feeling patchy. A lot of the dialogue feels recycled and trite. For example, there is a scene with a needy basketball player trying to convince his ""pregnant"" girlfriend to work things out with him. The dialogue feels like it's lifted straight from a soap opera. It doesn't ring true. <br/><br/>It's an okay movie. It's not amazing. It's not a great piece of art. It's capable filmmaking, decent acting and a worthwhile, if predictable story. It offers food for thought about the state of education in America today and Jackson's performance makes it worth watching. I'd give it a 6/10."
"mmellenberger","9","0","0","7 October 2015"," Basketball and Heart: Coach Carter Has It All!
","Richmond High School's basketball team is a joke. The players can't work together and hardly ever show up for school on a regular basis. Enter Ken Carter, the owner of a local sporting goods store, and alumni of Richmond. Ken is offered the basketball coaching job at his alma mater. Immediately upon accepting the offer, Coach Carter lays down the law and requires all of his players to sign a contract stating that they will attend every class and maintain at least a 2.3 GPA. After conditioning his team into shape, they go on to enjoy an undefeated season. However, the season is cut short after several members of the team fail their classes and Coach Carter locks up the gym and cancels all further practices and games. <br/><br/>Coach Carter is not your average cliché tale of the underdog team beating the odds and going on to win the state championship. This film, based on a true story, tells of a basketball coach who makes it his mission to not only help the team win games, but also give them the opportunity to attend college by forcing them to focus on their grades as well. Besides just focusing on the aspect of basketball in the movie, it also shows us the individual struggles in the lives of the young men. These problems range from teen pregnancy to drug dealing and gang-related activity. These are very real problems in some societies today, and this helps make the movie more relatable. It is the ability to relate to some aspects of this movie that contributes to the overall emotion of the film. Coach Carter is an inspiring story about perseverance and it conveys the message that even what seems impossible can ultimately be achieved.<br/><br/>Samuel L. Jackson portrays Coach Carter in the movie. As per usual when it comes to Jackson's performances, he maintains a serious tone and a steely resolve. This was a crucial element in Jackson's role as Coach Carter because he had to be a strict and disciplinary authority figure. There were also some of Jackson's lines in the film that were comical, which, while still being somewhat serious, he delivered perfectly. A job well done, Samuel L. Jackson.<br/><br/>Furthermore, in my opinion, Rick Gonzalez delivered the most memorable performance in the film, other than Jackson's Coach Carter. Gonzalez's character, Timo Cruz, is a troubled kid mixed up in his cousin's gang activity. After initially quitting, he wants to return to the team and will do whatever it takes to get back on – including doing 2,500 push ups and 1,000 ""suicides"". Let's not forget his moving speech near the end of the film. Gonzalez played the role of Timo Cruz with plenty of emotion and attitude and it was incredible. <br/><br/>Overall, this film has a great plot, great casting, and a great amount of emotion and character complexity. In the end, I would recommend Coach Carter to everyone. I am not always a huge fan of sports movies, but even if you feel like I do you should still check it out. It is a heart-warming, inspirational film with a great message."

","Thomas Carter's 2005 film, Coach Carter, is not only a movie about basketball and ""winning the big game"", it is a movie about perseverance. Based on a true story about Coach Ken Carter and the Richmond basketball team, Coach Carter (Samuel L. Jackson) is hired to coach for four months in hopes of improving the game that these troubled boys play. Samuel L. Jackson provides a performance that keeps the audience engaged and affected by many of the movie scenes, as well as the message brought about by Coach Carter that separates Coach Carter from many other cliché sports movies.<br/><br/>The performance of Samuel L. Jackson as Coach Carter is extremely well done. Jackson performs in a way that is greatly effective to an audience and his performance is what made Coach Carter great. Yes, there are many other sports movies out there that have remotely the same plot, but it is the acting that makes these movies differ from one another. One of the very first scenes of the movie is when the team first meets their new coach. Coach Carter makes them sign contracts saying that in order to play basketball they must keep their grades up and attend all classes, as well as sit in the first row. Here one of the players, Cruz (Rick Gonzalez), talks back and disrespects Coach Carter and Coach Carter puts him in place with his ""no tolerance"" attitude that he portrays throughout the movie. This scene really sets the mood for the way Coach Carter carries himself and he does so in an extremely believable manner which sets his performance apart from many other sports movies.<br/><br/>The camera work in Coach Carter is also very beneficial to the audience. There was a scene where the camera work really stood out to me and it was during one of the many basketball scenes in the movie. Richmond was down by two points in the biggest and most important game of the season. The entire last 9 seconds of the game was in slow motion which increasingly built up suspense. This trick is very effective because it helps keep the audience engaged and anxious about what is going to happen. Aside from the camera work, the plot and story behind the team helps Coach Carter receive the recognition it deserves.<br/><br/>The boys on the basketball team are very troubled boys and they believe basketball is all they have. Many people go to Richmond high school to only end up in prison, not get an education, and many don't even graduate high school. Coach Carter, an alumni of this school and the basketball team, is not only there to coach, he is there to change these statistics. With the contract he gave the team, he is supposed to receive progress reports with these boys' grades. Well, the first time he receives them he realizes that half of the team doesn't show up for classes, while others don't finish their homework, or they are simply failing. Once he finds this out, he locks the gym and brings the boy straight to the library. This creates riots within the town and it is a huge controversy with the school, especially when he goes as far as canceling the biggest game of the season. Coach Carter is trying to fight against the broken education system at Richmond high school. This movie is not solely about basketball, it is much more complex than that.<br/><br/>Coach Carter is a movie very well worth seeing. Coach Carter does not only excel as a basketball coach, but also as a mentor to these troubled boys that are seen as people that only have basketball as a success in their lives. Coach Carter shows them that they are able to go against the odds and be successful after their basketball career is over and he is very successful in doing so. Coach Carter is not trying to teach these boys how to be good players, he is teaching them that if they want something, they have to work for it; nothing in life is handed to you. Coach Carter's coaching style goes way beyond basketball itself and that is what makes this movie unique. Coach Carter did not only change the teams winning record, he changed their perspective on life."
"dwinkert","9","0","0","30 September 2015"," Coach Carter is unique
","Coach Carter is one of most notable sports films to ever be released. When Coach Ken Carter of the Richmond High School basketball team accepts his new job to coach and mentor a group of reckless and bashful individuals, he has no idea what the future holds. The emotional aspect of this movie leaves student athletes on the edge of their seats. Even if one is not a student athlete, it leaves a message that can have a true impact on their life and future. The true story of Coach Carter is easily a must-see movie because of its eventful plot, exciting climax, and the connection it makes to its targeted audience.<br/><br/>Coach Ken Carter decides to return to his high school in Richmond, California to take up a head coaching position for the Richmond Oilers. He knows that this isn't the easiest task for anyone as the dysfunctional and rough bunch of players only went on to win four games total in the previous season. Even with these setbacks, Carter believes that with his discipline he can enforce on his new team both on the court and in the classroom, they can be one of the best teams in the area. In many ways, Coach Carter is portrayed as an overall inspirational and at times heart-felt movie. The first thing that comes to mind when discussing this film, is the work done by main actors like Samuel L. Jackson, Rick Gonzalez, Rob Brown, Channing Tatum, and others apart of the Richmond High School basketball team. There are many excellent things to note when regarding this. As the head coaching role, Ken Carter (Jackson), encounters many situations where his role needs to be very strict with a serious attitude towards his players. Jackson does a fantastic job doing this and making it very believable and life-like to the audience. Another actor who does a great work in the acting aspect is Rick Gonzalez. Gonzalez plays the role as Timo Cruz, one of the stubborn players of the ball team. Cruz's character has an important role played throughout the film that causes him to go from the ignorant and bashful basketball player, to one of the key players the team needs both on and off of the basketball court. He goes through challenges that requires heavy emotion which is exactly what Rick Gonzalez brings to the table when he portrays his role. The impact that these actors have on the outcome of the movie helps the main message and purpose be given to the audience.<br/><br/>The main message is meant to be inspirational and emotional to any audience watching this movie. The director, Thomas Carter, purposefully tries to get the audience involved by leaving them in question and guessing what exactly will happen next. This emotional aspect is what leads the movie to build a personal connection to its viewers. A prime example of this comes when Coach Carter takes action when the players' grades start to slip. He tries time and time again to get the understanding in their heads that students become before athletes when considering ""student athletes."" At first, this doesn't go over well with the players, but in time it goes to show how powerful a person can be with school work, basketball, and other areas or difficulties in life.<br/><br/>The work done by the actors, the director, and the writers have led to this movie being one of the biggest successes in sports films of this era. If you haven't ever experienced this movie, I suggest that you get on it and watch it. I guarantee you will not be disappointed with the work done by director Thomas Carter and by the actors. Coach Carter has had an impact on my personal life that sometimes cannot be put into words. If, however, it had to be put in words, it would be what Rick Gonzalez's character says near the peak of the movie; ""Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate, but that we are powerful beyond measure."""

","Successful sporting goods store owner Ken Carter (Samuel L. Jackson) accepts the basketball coach job from his mentor at his old high school. It's a poor underachieving school. He forces his kids to sign a contract to maintain academics. He calls the kids 'sir' as a sign of respect. It's a struggle with the kids, but it's even more of a struggle with the adults. It climaxes to a point where coach Carter locks out the players when they don't maintain their academics.<br/><br/>This is all a very earnest after school special. Coach Carter is a saint beyond reproach. The thing that I wish for is an early ally for Carter. It seems that everybody especially the adults are piling on. Even if true, it doesn't make for a compelling story. It's overkill. An ally could create more complex relationships in the adults of the movie.<br/><br/>The other thing I noticed is that the movie reaches its climax around the lockout. The games after the lockout don't have much drama. The movie is about the lockout, not about any championships or game winners."

","""Coach Carter"" is a heart-warming story that is based on actual events, but what stands out from the other true story movies is that it refrains itself from any kind of ""artistic licencing"" from being a Hollywood movie. And that is simply because it really doesn't need to. The inspirational story of Coach Ken Carter and the Richmond Oilers is molded as an uplifting to one's spirits and it tells us that there really is a ray of hope and that we can achievement if we all believe in ourselves.<br/><br/>Sure it sounds lame and preachy, but the movie is constantly fixated on telling us that academics must come before athletics. The main focus is centred around Coach Carter and the gripping sports scenes is enough to satisfy any sports fan especially those who love basketball.<br/><br/>Samuel L. Jackson is flawless as the no-nonsense Coach Carter and he does without putting much effort into the role but the dedication to his coaching and his encouragement towards his team is just the natural way to prove how developed this character really is. The performance and the accuracy is so impressive you wouldn't think it was Samuel L. Jackson performing, but the real Coach Carter himself. But he's not the only thespian who melted our heart, but the performers who played the students; in fact they are the heart and soul to the movie as they keep this movie as real and effective as possible. Even singer Ashanti shows her acting chops are quite effective and not flashy at all.<br/><br/>Unlike most movies who cowardly take the easy way out by just rushing through the ending and going for the formulaic happy ending, ""Coach Carter"" ends the movie with a real ending where these athletes are not destined to just winning the school's championship but where their academic achievements became a top priority to them. I wish that Hollywood would have more stories on values like these than the garbage we've been fed to over the years.<br/><br/>The extras on the DVD are quite special as we are introduced to the real Ken Carter who seems to come across as being more but amusingly laid back and less intense than Jackson's portrayal. But i'm sure the real Ken Carter must have left a lasting impact toward the students and the kids as Richmond High. I just wish the documentary on Ken Carter was more in depth a much more longer and I wished we can get more insight on the students and compare the similarities between the actual students and the characters that were portrayed in the movie.<br/><br/>The second feature looks into the making behind the movie itself as we observe just how the choreographing and the skill the characters had to go through to make and maintain the realism of the movie. The actual sports scenes are such a joy to watch it sends shivers down my spine. It might be mundane in some people because not everyone has knowledge in all the technical terms that's in basketball so if you're watching the movie for the drama and inspiration, please bring along a manual called ""Basketball for Dummies"". <br/><br/>One of the weaknesses the movie has is that in the extras we don't get the opportunity focus on the mastermind behind the movie, director Thomas Carter. I don't know if he's just a humble individual or if he played a dominating role in the production, but he's never mentioned or talked about in the extras. I also wonder if the director is related to the titular character of the movie.<br/><br/>To summarize this movie is quite pleasing and very optimistic in it message. It was a very entertaining and never falls prey to continuously preach that academics is equally important if not better than athletics. I think those who come from working-class environments to get a better view to show that there is always a sign of hope. The statistics that Ken Carter reveals to his students that young African American men are more than likely will end up in jail than advanced education is quite staggering. And this should open the eyes to not just black Americans but to everyone that prison life is not the life you want to live in. It's also important that just because you are playing basketball in school, doesn't mean it's a one-way ticket to the NBA. But a good education is the key to life and after watching this movie, I'm sure it will open eyes to everyone who really cares about their education."

","Coach Carter is a very formulaic sports film that follows every rule in the rulebook for sports film. However, thanks to a very centralized, high-powered performance by Samuel L. Jackson, this film is able to stand on its own two feet. There are some emotional moments when you are rooting for the underdog, in this case the Richmond Oilers, to win it all. This film also showcases the tough time people have growing up in poor areas and the broken-down American education system.<br/><br/>Thomas Carter's film is about a legendary basketball player named Ken Carter who goes back to his old high school to coach a number of violent, uneducated people the true game of basketball and how the game will change their attitudes, and more importantly their lives.<br/><br/>Samuel L. Jackson does one heck of a job in his role. Thanks to his inspiring performance, this movie is worth watching. He is passionate about this role and despite acting as a bully to his players, you feel for him since you know that he cares for his players and will do anything to give them a better life and go to college.<br/><br/>Overall, this is an above-average sports film thanks to Jackson. Even without him, this film would have been good despite having almost every cliché in the book. But hey, this is quality filmmaking. I was able to enjoy the drama and all the games. I liked how they went from the bad news bears of basketball to playing like champions. I rate this film 9/10."

","Coach Carter was a brilliant film to me. The actors, the soundtrack, and the plot were all amazing in my eyes. First off, when you are making a film i take it that you need a leader and there are not much great leaders like Samuel L. Jackson. He was assigned the job of being a basketball coach and he used this privilege to not only teach them the right way to play basketball, but also the way to live life by reaching for your goals. He put his foot down in an area no one would attempt to and I commend him for it. Next, we have the soundtrack. This movie takes place in a town filled with gangs, drugs, and poverty. ""DMX"" is a rapper and he was on this soundtrack. His song ""Untouchable"" featured in Coach Carter and it fit in perfectly considering these players were trying to live about the influence and do something good with their lives. Finally, to say the plot was good would be an understatement. I say this due to the fact that the plot was difficult to guess. You never knew what was going to happen next and that kept it interesting. Overall this movie made me realize how hard some people have it and not to take anything for granted. It also taught me that its not always what you put into something, but what you learn from it."

","Coach Carter is one of the best sports films of all time, not only because it shows how a team came together and progressed with their season, but also how the coach helps each player develop into well rounded men. If you like Sports films that not only talk about the team but also make a story out of each players life then this is the movie for you. The Director Thomas Carter did an amazing job of showing how a team can rally together when they were at their lowest, to become a strong power house of a team. He also did an amazing job of introducing the audience to more of the player's lives.<br/><br/>Ken Carter, played by actor Samuel L. Jackson, returns to his old high school to turn the basketball program around. When Coach Carter took the job, he didn't realize how bad of shape his team really was. Samuel L. Jackson was a perfect choice for the role of the head coach Ken Carter, mainly because of the certain edge that he gives off as an actor. Samuel L. Jackson has always been an intimidating actor in most of the movies he has played in. Most have them have been action films but this was a new film for him. Instead of being the fearless hardcore hero, he played the role of a father and a coach that has inspired a group of men to be more than a basketball team.<br/><br/>Coach Carter soon sets many standards for the team that they have to abide by. These rules soon help develop the players into very well rounded men. With the help of these rules and a new coach the Richman High School Oilers soon became a community that not only was known for their basketball skills but the maturity of their players. The director of this movie did an amazing job of integrating the challenges of each player and having the coach help them through their troubles. The director really did a good job of controlling the young actors and giving the audience a good view of how the story really happened. Each player faced a huge wall that they had to overcome and Coach Carter influenced them through it all. <br/><br/>Another thing that made this movie stand out was the fact that this is a true story. It's hard to put together a movie that has the appeal of a great sports obstacle, but also the development of the players how went from never having a chance of going to college to become mature men who had a chance to go to college. It's hard to take a true story and put it into a big screen movie. Thomas Carter again did a wonderful job with this movie. <br/><br/>I would seriously recommend this movie to anyone who has a passion for films that are as deep and inspirational as this one. After watching this film I have found that anything is possible through hard work and dedication and an amazing mentor through it all. I have loved sports films ever since in started watching them and this film by far has been the greatest one yet."

","Ken Carter(Jackson, applying his voice to delivering more motivational, inspirational speeches than you'd think they could fit into one movie... even at an excessive 127 minute running time not counting credits; at least it does tend to keep to a good pace) talks with his wife about the position as coach(and how inconvenient it is for him), and even without him saying, she knows he'll take it - I guess there's some positives to marrying The Seer. He asks the students to sign an academic contract with him, and promises if they maintain a certain average, he'll take them to victory in the State championship. Sprinkle your stock conflicts, clichés and subplots(a few of which seem to only be there because it actually happened... points for accuracy, sure, however, you need to properly set up and resolve them as well, that, or cut them, call poetic license if you must) of sports flicks(and as someone who isn't actually a fan of them, let me say that I enjoyed this, without it being redefining or fresh), sanitize it to After School Special levels(well, what do you expect from MTV?) and you have this predictable mix. Dialog is very Hollywood, and gets exposition-happy a little too often. The vernacular and characterizations are somewhere between what's realistic and what the most whitebread adults on Earth think African-American and Latino teenagers behave and talk like. And this is very big on discipline, no problem that it can't solve... an attitude that one should at least keep in check. On the plus side, this does have plenty of exciting basketball action, and they usually really are shooting when we see them do so, it doesn't cut to cover for them. This is well-cast and the acting is at times as impressive as the material allows. There is a lot of moderate language(as much as they could do on a PG-13) and brief bloody violence in this. The DVD comes with the two well-done featurettes Coach Carter: The man behind the movie(20 minutes long, with interviews with many of the real people), the 11 and a half minute Fast break at Richmond High(about the actors training), 12 minute of decent deleted scenes and the 4 and a half minute music video ""Hope"". I recommend this to any fan of the sub-genre. 7/10"

","Coach Carter is an admirable giant of a man and I enjoyed this film tremendously! I love the way that he knew what his team of young men needed and then he stuck to his plan. In spite of phenomenal pressure to back down, he had them sign a contract that forced them to change their attitudes to the game and ultimately to life itself. The team were mainly ""lost"" young men whose lives were being dictated by their peers and circumstances, but CC had the solution. He helped them to learn respect for themselves and their community.<br/><br/>In the end, I felt that this film was about understanding and teaching life values to a group who had lost their way. Once the team realised that the reason he was doing these things was because he cared about them, they began to bond and then acted like a proper team.<br/><br/>In society today, we sadly see a breakdown in discipline and respect in the home and at school, it inevitably leads to unhappiness and misery for everyone concerned (read 2 Timothy 3:1-5).<br/><br/>Today, many parents want their kids to be their friend first and so rarely say no to them, what the youngster really needs is a loving parent and firm guidance! Firm, loving discipline and relevant encouragement always works out for the best; our youngsters feel safer and they thrive knowing that we care about them don't they? They then grow into much more rounded and productive members of society. Most people who have seen this film have felt the warmth that Ken Carter had for his team and the way that he helped them realise their potential as men.

","""Coach Carter"" may be based on a true story, but that doesn't make the movie original. Actually, Jackson has done this material before, sans the basketball. If you've seen ""One Eight Seven"", you'll know what I mean. The only difference is that the kids in this movie aren't as troubled as the ones in the earlier movie. Here, it's the basketball that makes these kids emotionally stronger (as well as physically, of course). But did we really need to see them play the big game, especially as a tacked-on ending? Besides, we know they're going to win, anyway. The film would have been enough ending before the game is played. Anyway, I enjoyed Coach Carter a lot more than I expected.<br/><br/>*** out of ****"

","I really enjoyed the movie and was actually inspired by the end of the film. The film was a little corny and syrupy from time to time but it was an overall good, positive film. I have read and heard so many comments about the morals and unacceptable behavior portrayed by some of the characters and in turn viewers bad-mouth the film simply because they do not agree with some of the behavior of the some of the characters in the film. But these people obviously missed the point of the film. Coach Carter was trying to instill values that he thought would help an entire community. The reality is that kids do have foul mouths, have unprotected sex, are faced with hard decisions (to have or not have a baby and selling drugs) everyday.<br/><br/>We should all be so fortunate to have the opportunity to see a movie that features a person that actually tries to deal with these issues without making judgment calls and instead offer resolutions to problems. He offered resolutions to his team's behavior and left it to them to make the right decisions. This was good because they were able to see the consequences of their actions. When they made the right decision, they were able to see the positive consequences. When they made the wrong decision the players were faced with negative consequences and had no one to blame but themselves.<br/><br/>The impact of a person of this magnitude is profound and if some viewers found fault with this movie simply because their reality is a little different at this moment then it was for the characters in this film is very unfortunate for the viewer. Because you never know when you might be faced with a person similar to that in the movie. You just might have to deal with this situation more personally than expected and if this happens what will you do? Because the consequences of your actions in a situation like this will be either positive or negative as well."

","What can I say, this film is brilliant, it isn't perfect but it's really good. Samuel L Jackson does a great job as Coach Carter, very strict and emotive coach, you can tell how he's feeling when training his team and how the team is feeling having to deal with his rules. You have that typical basketball cliché when the rival team is winning by only a few points, but they manage to win within the last couple seconds, then you expect that to be the end of the film. But no, it doesn't end there, you see the team gasp in there glory, but face problems with there education. But the end is very interesting, you'd imagine the basketball cliché would happen once again, but there's a big twist to it and they lose to the best team in the state.

","Have you ever considered watching a dramatic film and thought it would be similar to any other dramatic movie, so why bother watching it? That was my first thought. Coach Carter, directed by Thomas Carter, seemed as if it simply was about a boys' high school basketball team and boys dealing with difficult lives. However, with the help of Mr. Carter, the new basketball coach, the boys' lives are about to change. In the poor town of Richmond, California, the high school boys' basketball team is in need of a new basketball coach. Knowing the displeasing reputation of these young men, Mr. Carter knows he can handle the job as the new coach. Mr. Carter sets strict rules for the team, teaching the boys the definition of respect. With a previous season of losses, Mr. Carter improves the team's performance on the court and begins an undefeatable season. However, the team's performance in class is unsatisfactory. With many failing grades, Mr. Carter takes action by taking basketball away. Mr. Carter deals with much criticism, but explains that education is more important and that basketball is only a privilege. Not only was it exciting to witness action on the basketball court, but also exciting to witness the action Mr. Carter took to help better the boys' lives. Living in ""ghetto"" neighborhoods, these boys were not prepared for the lives ahead of them. However, Mr. Carter knew he could make a difference and help push them to achieve their goals. Overall, this film sends the message that anyone, given the background or socioeconomic status, can be successful if they have determination and a willingness to succeed. Several years ago, I watched Coach Carter for the first time, and from then on, it has been a favorite of mine. Being based on a true story made it an unbelievably inspirational film because the viewer truly understands what Mr. Carter went through. With Samuel L. Jackson as Mr. Carter, I believe he truly made this film meaningful. I would definitely recommend watching Coach Carter."

","The pupils of a Richmond, California high school have little in the way of academic potential and, in their basketball team, little to celebrate in way of sporting achievement. The team and the players get a shakeup when local sports store Ken Carter accepts the job of coach of the basketball team. Making the players focus on fitness and sign academic contracts, the team revolts but quickly comes round to the tough new regime. He technique works on some levels as the team goes on an undefeated run in the league, however when the players start falling down in other areas, Carter holds to his original promises no matter what others think.<br/><br/>The fact that FilmFour is playing this film at all times of the day on freeview should perhaps give an indication that this is not a ""special"" film that is worthy of great attention. It isn't and nor did it get any. This is not the same as saying it is a poor film though because it is certainly not. Although it is based on a true story, it is, at heart, a sports movie that sees the underdog team winning despite the odds. Along with this it does have the message of the importance of education and respect rather than arrogance and ""NBA or nothing"" attitude and for this it is hard to dislike it  and I suppose it isn't that heavily delivered. These elements work well together and make the film engaging enough without ever being anything particularly inventive or original. If the film is 50% accurate in regards Carter then certainly he deserves more  particularly within the sport of basketball in US, not a minor activity by any means.<br/><br/>The heavy soundtrack shows the target audience and is sadly another demonstration of the lack of invention in the delivery although everything is competently done  the direction didn't wow me but the sports action is well shot, which is not that easy to do. The cast are likewise solid and effective without ever excelling. Jackson goes into ""father-figure"" mode for this and it works well as his screen presence carries him a long way. He is well supported by the players themselves; OK some of them skate very close to being stereotypes but Gbewonyo, Brown, Gonzalez, Tatum and others all hold together well. Not sure about the casting of Ashanti. Yes she is sexy and adds appeal to this MTV film but she never feels the age of her character and instead just gets by being cute.<br/><br/>Coach Carter is a MTV film that offers sports and a ""message"" and it pretty much does what you would expect and is still good even though it is anything shockingly new or inventive. It is solid across the board and an easily enjoyable film based on quite an inspiring true story."

Everybody else just sort of blends into the background when he's around, which is quite appropriate really when you consider the generic nature of their characters.

Jackson superbly plays Coach ken Carter, a controversial high school basketball coach who locks his players out of the gym when they don't uphold contracts concerning their academics. Jackson is a revelation here, playing a really good guy and turning in one of the best performances of his career. Met with opposition even from the staff, he fights for the idea of a student-athlete for the first time. Calm, cool, and dominating the screen, the film is worth seeing for Jackson's performance alone.<br/><br/>Yet Coach Carter is something more. It's one of those rare sports movies that really hits home, avoiding most of the clichés that have messed up the genre. It's true, there's still the troubled athletes, the obligatory girlfriend-of-the-star; somehow Coach Carter isn't weighed down by it.

","This is a real story that shows us that in life you make choices that can change your whole future. Without having a proper education and guidance in life is hard to pull yourself together. Learn to fight for what's right, even if you struggle always give it your best! You will never be disappointed, even though the result might not have a 'fairy tale ending'! Samuel L. Jackson played one of his greatest roles, he's very expressive, with a positive attitude and the soundtrack 'Hope' emphasizes the meaning and the main idea that a viewer should get: Hope dies last, fight to achieve your goals in both your personal life and your professional career. I hope that this cultural film is an example of a success story to every young man who is out there on the streets and doesn't know which path to follow."

","What can I say about samuel L Jackson. He doesn't read scripts anymore when he picks roles it seems like. Until this movie he finally redeemed himself from movies like The Man and In My country. This was a great film.<br/><br/>Jackson plays a coach that is more interested in having kids do well in school and stay off the streets than playing some basketball. He doesn't care if he has to bench the best player for failing a subject and goes to extreme lengths to represent that. The basketball is the sub-plot while trying to get kids to college and not killed is the main plot.<br/><br/>Jackson did a great job while still showing off his attitude such as when he tied his shoes and says ""I tied that $hit!"" This to tell the team to stop mouthing off to the other team. Great movie."

","During a flight to Korea, I saw some quick ADD-like editing and knew immediately that I was in for an MTV film. And I was right. This film, apparently based on the true story of a real Coach Carter was one of the last films that I paid attention to on the flight.<br/><br/>I've seen good sports movies and I've seen bad sports movies. One thing that I can say about sports movies is that they're very similar to melodramas, living heavily on sentiment and total utter cheesiness. Coach Carter is very much a real sports movie. Combining after-school special drama with basketball, it weaves together the story of a coach that turned his team around and their lives in the process.<br/><br/>The problem with the film is that its portrayal of the characters is shallow. I think it's because it tries to follow too many dramatic arcs, too many characters that it tries to develop, but ultimately finds itself not developing any of the characters enough. Even though it possesses a Rocky-type ending, it still can't seem to avoid the shackle that's plagued most MTV films and after-school specials. It's too preachy. It's too sentimental. And it's too shallow.<br/><br/>However, the acting is adequate and the directing is sufficient. Generally, the film does end up coming together as a real film. Another sports film, like many other sports films, but a watchable one nonetheless. It helped the international flight go by easier, but I don't think that I'd want to watch it again. 6/10."

","COACH CARTER is an inspiring and richly entertaining film, based on a true story. This is the story of Ken Carter, a man who returns to his high school alma mater to become the new basketball coach. Carter creates priorities for the guys on the team by presenting them with a contract that they must sign and honor if they are to play on the team. The contract states that they are to maintain a 2.3 GPA, go to their classes every day, sit in the front row of their classes,and wear a tie on game day. As much as Carter loves the game of basketball, he still feels their education should be the guys' number one priority. The team, which had a 4-22 record the preceding season, racks up 15 victories in a row until Carter learns that a couple of the team members are not keeping up their GPA. He then puts a lock on the gym door and cancels all games until the guys get their grades up. The furor this causes in the small town is understandable, since basketball scholarships are probably the only way these inner city kids are going to be able to go to college, but Carter is determined to send the message that there is life after basketball. Samuel L. Jackson turns in a commanding performance, as always, in the title role, as the man who cares what happens to the guys after they hang up their sneakers. Jackson's performance and a screenplay that's a bit preachy but does offer surprises make this film more than worth your time."

I found this film totally absorbing and while it is a long film it was even longer for me as such was the emotional impact of some of the scenes I found myself watching them again and again. It is extremely satisfying to know that there are people like Coach Carter out there and even more uplifting that in this day and age, there are kids that are willing to listen and learn. The academic achievements of kids throughout the world would be changed for the better if there were more Coach Carters out there and without sounding too sugary, the world would be a better place. A very good film for adults (to take note, we can all be coach carters in our own way) and one all parents should encourage their children to see."

","I think, no, I know that this is greatest sports movie of all time. When i saw this movie i thought it was a bit slow, but it then started to speed up a lot. And obviously other people in the theater thought so because they started cheering in the theater. This movie targets every part of teenage life when you are growing up in a place like Richmond. Drug Dealing, alcohol, guns, and teenage pregnancies are all targeted in this film. I think this is a great inspirational movie for teenagers all over the world; train hard= Good things happen, study hard= Great things happen. The only flaw that I could find in this movie was that the character ""Kyra"" played by Ashanti says that she will get an abortion this will tell young pregnant girls that it is okay to have abortions (its not). All the actors performed spectacularly, Sammuel L. Jacksons never seizes to amaze me in his roles. All the basketball players performed amazingly, dunking and whatever.<br/><br/>So in the end, this is a GREAT film and I highly recommend that if you haven't seen it you better get your a*s to the video store and buy it, you will NOT be disappointed."

","Although I don't usually care for sports oriented movies, my daughter rented the DVD of Coach Carter and I watched it after she told me it was a good movie. I was fascinated by the movie from start to finish and greatly inspired by it. I admired the fantastic job Coach Carter did with the basketball team, not only on the courts but in the classroom, and how he kept the kids off the streets and gave them a positive direction in their lives. Also, his discipline seemed a bit harsh at times, but his heart was in the right place and his methods worked. His dedication, responsibility, and optimistic attitude were a tremendous example for his student players. Coach Carter's job must have been hard and often frustrating but he didn't give up until he had given his students tools to have better lives than their parents, other relatives, and friends had had.

","Too bad more people don't watch movies like this one. A true inspiration to those who have no hope. (At least that is my impression.) This movie reminded me of ""Lean on Me"" with Morgan Freeman. It leaves one with a hope that things could be better if the right people were in the right positions in schools. The movie really drives home the point that as a country our priorities are totally screwed up. The scene where Ken Carter asks the team who won last year's state tournament, and not one player could answer it proves the true value of sports in our society. It is yet another form of temporary gratification which is totally misplaced in the importance of human well being. Will we ever learn? This should be required viewing for all high school students."

"dweber34","8","0","0","24 January 2006"," Great movie, not completely based on fact
","I couldn't help but enjoy this movie, and it is still in heavy rotation on my 12-year old daughter's DVD selection. But, having lived 17 blocks from Richmond High in 1999 when the actual events were taking place, it's tough to ignore a lot of the differences between fact and fiction.<br/><br/>For starters, the Oilers school colors were changed from Red, White and Blue to suspiciously Hoosiers-like maroon and gold. While Richmond High is a rough school, its gym is hardly the bleak facility depicted in the movie. In reality, it is well-lit if shopworn version of a typical California suburban 1960s-era gym. Its as though director Thomas Carter wanted to out-ghetto the ""Carver High"" gym he grew up in as Hayward on ""The White Shadow."" Although the movie does touch on this with the ""hearing"" scene and the scene in which the players mock Carter's press conference, Kenny Carter and his antics were not universally appreciated. Nor was he, as shown, the sole positive force in these kids' lives. The true athletes' names, with the exception of little Carter, Damien, were changed in the movie. One actual player, Chris Dixon, played in the NFL later for the Oakland Raiders... makes you think there may have been an influential football coach somewhere in his life, don't you think? Also, the whole time line was screwy. As a long-time high school and college coach, I had difficulty with the old coach -- a pretty close depiction of one-time Oiler coach Roy Rogers by the way -- working the first game while Damien plays for ""St. Francis"" (another fiction, the only St. Francis in the Bay Area is down on the Peninsula in the Central Coast Section and would not have met RHS in the North Coast Section playoffs; nor for that matter would any of Richmond's playoff games have taken place in San Francisco. The NCS is all East and North Bay schools) only to see Carter step in in mid-season and his son transfer in mid-year and play for Richmond (illegal by California Interscholastic Federation rules). The movie shows a school dance held on campus. That is not something most inner-city schools in California attempt; they have the annual proms like everyone else... off campus in classy venues. Friday night school dances have become a casualty of the same crime-ridden social setting ""Coach Carter"" portrays. It was also irritating to have the singer Ashanti play Kenyon's girlfriend with a thick New York accent... and to have the entire movie shot in Long Beach and other LA-area locations rather than making the 350-mile trip up to Richmond to shoot it where it happened.<br/><br/>On an emotional level, the movie was awesome. When movies are portrayed as true stories, though, I wish more attention to detail was paid. Socially-conscious dramas seem particularly prone to poetic license. In ""Hurricane"" the white fighter who beats RUBEN Carter is depicting as getting a scandalous we-wuz-robbed decision. In Ruben Carter's autobiography, though, he bitterly blames his manager for putting him in that fight, one in which he knew he was over matched. Now, as I understand it, the new blockbuster ""Glory Road"" manipulates the facts of Don Haskins coaching career and the score at various points of the 1966 NCAA championship game.<br/><br/>Making ""true"" sports movies is a bit like fudging the facts of one's one playing career... those box scores are out there in black and white, waiting to disappoint those who believed you. The same for ""period"" pieces in which the ""period"" is less than a decade back and a lot of people who were there are still around.<br/><br/>Still, Coach Carter reaches a lot of people... We now live in a suburban neighborhood in another state, far from RHS and the kids my daughter plays AAU ball with like to do the ""Rich-WHAT? Rich-MOND!"" chant and are amazed that we lived near such a fabled place."

","There's a lot to say about ""Coach Carter"" leaving aside the simple fact that it is a very good film. Its director, Thomas Carter, is surely a very determined man and a dedicate worker. His camera moves like it knows the territory by heart; it moves with a lot of freedom and confidence. Sometimes, it seems to be in someone's hand, because it moves a lot; because there's a lot to see in this movie.<br/><br/>The same happened in ""Save the last dance"" a very well crafted piece directed by Carter, that dealt, among other things, with racial problems, as does ""Coach Carter"" in some ways. But Carter is no writer, he's a director that could seem like a writer because he really wants to direct. Anyway, here the writers are a mix of experts about what the movie needed to deal with.<br/><br/>Mark Schawn created ""One Tree Hill"", a TV show where the main characters play basketball, as the characters of this film do. He also wrote ""The Perfect Score"", a picture I haven't seen but I imagine covers a lot of young students personal issues, as ""Coach Carter"". The other writer was responsible for two sports movies; one about love (""Summer Catch"") and another one about dreams and inspiration (""Hardball""). It is a perfect team.<br/><br/>And a perfect result, too; because their screenplay is flawless, at least in the issues it presents. ""We're going to treat ourselves with respect"", Ken Carter (Samuel L. Jackson) says during his first training at Richmond School. He must be a good coach, because his son (solid Robert Ri'chard) moved from an esteemed high school, to one that graduates the 50% of its students just to train with his dad.<br/><br/>Ken Carter is a good coach, but in his own ways. The year before he arrived, the school's team the Oilers won only four games; now they're undefeated. The man is accomplishing his job, but not the totality of it. The other part relies in a contract every student signed before being in the team. It includes attending all of the classes in front row, maintaining a 2.3 average and wearing tie on the game's day. Technically, by not following the rules, the students are failing.<br/><br/>But for Coach Carter they are all failing, because they are team, and this among other things is what he intends to teach them, indirectly. ""What is your deepest fear?"", he asks Timo Cruz (impressive Rick Gonzalez), when he has to complete an impossible task to be back on the teamWhat does that mean? ""What does your father do?"", he asks Jason Lyle (debutant Channing Tatum). ""My father's in prison"", the boy answers. ""Ask yourself if you wanna end like him"", Carter finishes.<br/><br/>His methods will generate controversy, he will be questioned by everyone, but what really matters isn't what the parents think, or what the school principals think; what really matters is what the kids think is best for them, and what they want for their future.<br/><br/>The whole young cast is adequate. Nana Gbewonyo, Antwon Tanner. They're all talented, especially Rob Brown (that boy from Finding Forrester) as Kenyon Stone, an intelligent young man with a pregnant girlfriend (young pregnancy is dealt with, as in the director's previous film) played naturally by Ashanti. I would like to see a lot more of Brown, because he's got a lot to give.<br/><br/>However, the generator of the environment and the head of the project is Mister Samuel L. Jackson, with a bald head and an ambiguous look. Used to play ""the man"" (ironically that's the name of his last film), as he did in ""S.W.A.T"", ""Shaft"" or going back in ""One Eight Seven"", puts the soberness away and creates a humanly defined character, in what's his best performance in three years; since his dedicate father in ""Changing Lanes"".<br/><br/>I will make no commentaries about the cheesy music I despise so much and forgot to mention in ""The Longest Yard""; but I'll say it works, no matter how hard we try to reject itFinally, the fact that ""Coach Carter"" is based on a true story, leaves me even more amazed than how I already am of this film-making achievement."

","I've seen this movie a thousand times, but I've never gotten the time to write a review on it, but today, I'm able to, so, here goes.<br/><br/>With a ""Hardball"" spin off, Coach Carter takes the team into another dimension of high school basketball. Where in the world there's the perfect coach with the perfect team, this world, in Richmond High School, is an imperfect world. Teeangersare raised by unwanted parents. College is almost a distant cry on the radar screen, and the foreseeable future is a doormat that's already been stepped on thousands of times, there's nothing that's in sight for a team that can never seem to stop losing, until their's a job vacancy for the coaching job after the original coach for the team resigns (I would understand why).<br/><br/>Ken Carter (Samuel L. Jackson) steps up to the plate and is handpicked by the school to be the successor for the school basketball team, as their coach. He accepts the job, and almost immediately, his presence is felt by both the players and school, as the players are being treated by prisoners, worked like animals, and rode on like horses. With all the calamity going on, Carter turns the teams into winners, enabling an undefeated record, until he notices that his team has another problem. Grades.<br/><br/>After finding out that the majority of his students are barely passing (or even failing) their courses, Carter locks out the gym and practice, putting chains on the gym doors, forfeiting games, and locking his students in the school library until the grades start to show improvement. To insure that his players are to get better, and to put pressure on them to be better, Carter demands that all the players' teachers issue weekly progress reports on their grades. Could this all try and help the players become better students, or in Carter's case, men? Can he help get his players into a decent college without getting arrested (and hopefully not gunned down)? That's all up in the air as the parents get restless, and the district decides that to end the lockout, Carter must resign his coaching position to allow the students to play...<br/><br/>All of this may make this movie sound like its a dark, depressing teen movie, but its not. Its a movie that uplifts the courage of man, and shows that people need to try hard in order to succeed, to not throw in the towel just because they cannot do it. Life was not made like the yellow-brick road. Life was made with many challenges, and if you cannot leave up to them, you might as well end up sitting your tush in prison, because you're not willing to accept full responsibility.<br/><br/>Jackson delivers a stand-up performance in this movie (not surprising at all), and director Thomas Carter (no relation to the real coach), shows a potential director in him, as despite some well known clichés are used in the film, let's not get carried away with them, as the movie has more ups, than it does down. It focuses also on racial equality, as derogatory words are used as enemies, not as allies, and enable a more substantial taste and flavor to the movie that was based on a true story.<br/><br/>Stand up, cheer, do whatever you feel is right. It's just boys playing basketball, isn't it?"

I really wanted to see what would happen to all of the young men on the team, and the team itself. It was predictable at times, but it is a great movie. I was more than surprised. <br/><br/>A side note. This movie is really for all ages. It's rated PG-13 for the language, and maybe very brief drug dealing. No sexual content, certainly no nudity.

","Although this move's premise and message are not original, it should be required viewing for any teenage boy (and girl) who thinks the path to success is through pro sports. This movie and ""Hoop Dreams"" would be enough.<br/><br/>In short, this is a spot on movie, that has some language and teen situations which may make it too grown up for youngsters. Other than that, Samual Jackson continues a long tradition of commanding performances, which give the movie its backbone and structure.<br/><br/>The struggle to find one's way is punctuated by the life choices that we all make and it is here that Coach Carter sounds a clear bell, that the better path is to engage your mind and give yourself MORE choices as you reach adulthood.<br/><br/>Finding that your good on the basketball court and can win is a wonderful experience, but it does make for an easy or automatic path to success.<br/><br/>A movie like this needs to be made every generation because the message is always worth spreading.<br/><br/>My favorite line is when one of the boys answers Coach Carters question, ""what's you greatest fear?"" Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine as children do. It's not just in some of us; it is in everyone. And as we let our own lights shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others."

","I absolutely LOVE this movie. My town is nowhere close to being like that. But my AAU basketball team was going to the National tournament in Nashville, TN. And one day before practice we all met at the Asst. Coaches house and we all watched it. I think it really helped us and we now know how good we have it. And we all use to think that our coach ran us a lot, and we saw how much they ran and we don't even run half as much as they did! I loved this movie so much that I went and saw it in theaters 2 times then went out and bought the DVD and have always watched whenever I have noting to do or just feel like watching it. I think I have watched it about 11 times or so and it has helped me every time that I watch. I also find something new about. I also watched the behind the real Ken Carter and I know it is based on a true story but in real life they really did say those mean things to him. I also heard what the real athletes had to say and what they thought of him. In real life Coach Carter really did have 3 kids walk out on him and they said when he wanted to win to call him and he said he will but he never did call them. The real life athletes said that everything in that movie they really did feel until they got to know him. And now he is their idol and the man they look up to. Oh yea, there is one more thing that I saw about this movie that I couldn't believe. The schools got so bad and the government didn't want to support athletics so they now have no athletic teams in Richmond High or anywhere in Richmond because he government didn't want to pay for it. I am thankful that my government wants to pay for athletics because I am going to college on a full athletic scholarship to Duke...when I get that old and in high school...LOL"

","Samuel L. Jackson does a masterful job in portraying Coach Carter as do the other actors in their roles. This film should go a long way in helping correct our inner city problems especially if the real players watch the film. It should shock some reality into them. I was disappointed that Hollywood felt it had to add some tawdry sex scenes and use vulgarity and profanity to get their message across. I understand that these things are part of the real world but they don't need to go to the degree they do in making their point. For example I think Coach Carter's profaning the name of Diety took away from his character and the moral value the film was trying to teach. It should be just as important to show respect for Diety as it is to respect one's self, leaders, and own race. If Hollywood wanted us to see real-life portrayals of profanity it should have come from elsewhere in the movie not from Coach Carter. Otherwise, I would have rated this a 10."

","Coach Carter is another film in association with MTV. But instead of being a film on rap or wild parties, Coach Carter is a drama and sports film dealing with a true-story. Ken Carter (Samuel L. Jackson) is a local sports store owner and a basketball fan of local Richmond High School team. After a friend asks him to coach, Ken accepts the job.<br/><br/>The players are rebellious, they're crude, and they're violent. Coach Carter enacts a strict regime of strenuous workouts and requirements in the class room. The players are able to warm up to him and begin to have a great season before the class room reports come in. His players are failing miserably and it leads to the ultimate decision, benching every single one of them.<br/><br/>Carter does this in order to put the players school work first and the move is meet with hostility. Players quit and parents and fans become hostile enough to call for his removal. As the lockout continues, players begin to realize that coach is doing this for there benefit and that he still has hope for them in the poor community. Now the only questions is will the players follow along with his lockout or cry in unison for his removal?<br/><br/>As I said earlier this is based on a true story and is told beautifully. It brings back the old sense of sports movies such as Hossiers and Remember the Titans. Samuel L. Jackson is able to bring the Coach Carter to life with a loving personality but a near-brutal view to the game. The film influenced me greatly to work harder in school and did the same for many other people I know. <br/><br/>The film conveys a powerful message of hope and understanding. The film presents teenagers on how they actually are; not in a bad way just in the usual smart-ass way. Each actor portraying a player, especially Rick Gonzalez and Antwon Tanner, is excellent in there own way. The films plot goes over nicely and the story flows well. <br/><br/>The basketball scenes are filmed with great care and right on in accuracy. The film was very good. Just a notch below Hoosiers but conveys the same great message.<br/><br/>Coach Carter. Starring: Samuel L. Jackson, Rob Brown, Rick Gonzalez, Robert Ri'chard, and Antwon Tanner.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 Stars."

Jackson plays Coach Carter as a hard, but fair man, who expects more from his players than they(or their community) ever expected from them.

","* John Wooden wanted his players to be both 'morally and mentally conditioned' on and off the court, and this film had this as a prominent theme - especially with the Cruz rendition of Nelson Mandelas 1994 inaugural speech (""...our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure..."") I believe many teachers/coaches would experience, and have to adapt to the same emotions, especially if they work in the sort of context depicted. * The use of running and push-ups as a disciplinary measure is something that many coaches disagree with - whether the film endorses their use will provide some indication of the combined influence of sport and the media. * The abortion of Kyra's baby was treated too lightly. * The film produced several thoughts & feelings, mainly good, and the 2+ hours didn't seem to drag (ie., it was quite engaging)."

","Coach Carter is a MTV feature film production. This film stars Samuel L. Jackson, and tells the true story of Coach Ken Carter from Richmond High School in inner city Los Angeles, California.<br/><br/>Carter is a self-made man, a strict disciplinarian, and owner of his own Sporting Goods Store. As the film begins, Carter has returned to old alma mater to watch a basketball game against St. Joseph, the High School his son is attending. Prior to game, Coach Carter has already been approached by the school's current coach to take over the team.<br/><br/>Richmond is severely thrashed, their undisciplined, their cocky, and unruly. Carter accepts the coaching position; however, it has to be on his terms. Richmond had only won 4 total games the previously year, so Coach Carter was afforded his request.<br/><br/>Carter required all of his players to sign a contract before any of them could play ball. The contract required each player to maintain a 2.3 G.P.A., attend all scheduled classes, and to sit in the front row of all classes in which they attended. He required Progress Reports for all teachers documenting each player's academics. He also required each player to dress appropriately on Game Day, with Tie and Coat; this promoted respect in the team, and respect for oneself.<br/><br/>Prior to the season's start, no one even knew who or where Richmond High School was, but rigorous practices, forced discipline, and strict guidance from carter turned them into winners; however, that's where the trouble started.<br/><br/>Winning was easy, Carter had a plan; and the team executed it superbly. However, Carter wanted more for these players; he wanted hope, desire, and the ability to lift themselves above the life in which they were headed. He wanted his players to have the ability to attended college; and this could only happen if their grades were good enough.<br/><br/>However, Richmond H.S. only graduates 33% of their seniors and over 60% of those are female. Carter explained that his player stood a better chance going to Jail than college. Once the Progress Reports were published, six of his players were failing at least one or more of their classes. So Carter at 16-0, undefeated and headed to the state championships, locked the gym doors and started forfeiting games; turning basketball practice sessions into tutoring lessons for the players. This is when the sh@# hit the proverbial fan..<br/><br/>In the semblance of Stand and Deliver, Remember the Titans, and Hoosiers, Coach Carter is another story about one man against insurmountable odds, bound and determined to make a difference in someone else's life, even if that someone isn't seeking change (well, at first anyways). In doing so, he changes that person today, and for generations to come. Coach Carter is raw at times, and might not be as good as other that I've mention; however, it's a story well told, and I did enjoy it.<br/><br/>http://farisreel.com"

The other is that apart from race that sports has something to do with the life of the mind.

This will take longer because each movie that uses it encourages you to not think, and not thinking means you don't think about the thing that just instructed you to not think.<br/><br/>And it will take some time because sports is theater (and little less) and these kinds of movies are theater and they will support each other against our better interests.<br/><br/>The curious things about movies.

"TheMovieMark","Null","4","13","14 January 2005"," Samuel L. Jackson's depiction of the true story of Coach Ken Carter ensues.
","Immediately after being introduced as the new head coach, Coach Carter informs the players that respect and discipline will be required. Naturally, this doesn't sit well with some of the guys. After all, they were used to getting away with everything. But that's the attitude that resulted in only four wins the previous season. So instead of accepting disrespect, Carter forces a player to leave the gym. Two of his slacker friends follow him.<br/><br/>When one of the remaining players speaks up and complains that they just lost their two highest scorers from last season, Carter replies, ""Well then will have two new highest scorers this season."" That's Coach Carter. He took the reigns of a team of underachievers and pushed them to be better than average. But to be more than average, you have to accept the responsibility of a certain amount of work and effort. Don't want to accept your responsibilities? That's nothing that 1000 push-ups and 500 suicides won't cure.<br/><br/>There's no doubt that some people just don't have it in them to play for a coach like that. I've been there, and a lot of the time you absolutely hate the coach. ""Come on, coach, what do you mean we have to run stairs for 10 minutes?? We just had a 2 1/2 hour wrestling practice!"" We ended up running stairs for 20 minutes, and that was the last time any of us complained. We hated the coach at that moment, but he got our attention, and more importantly, he got his point across.<br/><br/>Achieving excellence is never easy, whether it be in the sports arena or in the classroom. Coach Carter's team was doing great on the basketball court, starting off the season on a huge win streak. But problems in the classroom brought everything to a halt. Bye bye sunshine.<br/><br/>Once Carter received progress reports from the teachers (he had to twist arms to do it), the bad news was several of his players were failing classes. They all signed contracts to maintain a 2.3 GPA. They didn't maintain the GPA. So what happened? Carter locked the gym, closed practice, and said all games would be forfeited until the conditions of the contracts were met.<br/><br/>Great! It's about time a coach took a stand like that! I guess parents, school board members, and the community all rallied around the coach and his brave stand, right? Nope. Parents and the rest of the community were only concerned with trying to win a state championship. In fact, the parents were in such an uproar that they demanded that Coach Carter be fired.<br/><br/>The school board cowardly voted to end the lockout, and Coach Carter said that he would quit. But the team rallied around him, and said they wouldn't play until everybody met his requirements.<br/><br/>Samuel L. Jackson is, no surprise, perfect as Coach Carter. You wanna scare a couple of players straight? Just have Samuel L. stare 'em straight in the eyes for about 5 minutes. Jackson is so convincing as a disciplinarian that I stood up at one point during the movie and started running suicides. The taunts of, ""Look at that idiot running in the theater"" and ""Sit down! Your stupid pants are ruffling and making too much noise"" didn't bother me. I knew Coach Carter would be proud.<br/><br/>By no means is this movie a masterpiece. The main drawback is that I wasn't enthralled with all the little subplots. The one side story with the player being involved with dealing drugs worked well because it made sense within the context of the movie. But I could've done without Ashanti and her basketball-playing boyfriend talking and whining and talking about her unplanned pregnancy. OK, fine, yeah, that stuff happens all the time in the ghetto, but that doesn't mean it makes for compelling viewing. I'd rather see 10 more minutes of Jackson threatening to break somebody's face than 10 minutes of a school dance.<br/><br/>As a result of the subplots, some people might get a little restless with the 136 minute running time. I'll probably watch this again one day on DVD, but when I do I'll fast forward through all the scenes dealing with Ashanti and her pregnancy. Yeah, yeah, human interest, blah blah blah. Unfortunately, it was of no interest to THIS human, so there you go.<br/><br/>Also, the ""I came to teach boys, and you became men"" inspirational clichés start to hit hyper drive as the movie winds down. You'll probably roll your eyes at least twice, and you might want to keep a plastic yellow bucket handy in case your gag reflex kicks in. But hey, it's forgivable.<br/><br/>This is a true story (with some poetic license exercised) that needs to be heard. Basketball is a privilege. Many amateur athletes think they can play professional sports, but Coach Carter knew differently. That's why he still believed in the STUDENT-athlete. In his own words, ""On the streets and public basketball courts in Richmond and any other city in America, you see the broken dreams of former high school legends who got left behind by life. And I was just not going to let that happen to these boys."" Now if you'll excuse me, I've got 50 more push-ups and 10 suicides to do.<br/><br/>Rating: 4 (out of 5)"

","Coach Carter may be afraid of what could happen to his students if they don't get a good education, but he certainly isn't afraid of fully embracing every inspirational-sports-movie- cliché in the book. Through a series of grueling montages and broad character strokes, Carter and his team overcome all obstacles. The script presents Carter as an all-knowing- oracle, who is never wrong and never doubts himself. In one sequence where the kids sneak off to a late night party, we feel more for them and their desire to have fun then we do Carter, though the movie puts us squarely on his side. He never doubts himself, never has feelings or thoughts besides external ones, never seems to think he may be doing something wrong."

He takes the job after the season has started, so he doesn't have much time to shape the team up. He gets to work putting the kids into shape physically, and then begins the challenge of getting them in shape academically. The conflict in the story comes from the latter challenge. He attempts to get the school to cooperate with him, but to little avail. He goes through numerous methods and channels trying to accomplish his ultimate goal (besides winning state), preparing his athletes for college. In the end...well if you haven't seen it, I'll let you find out for yourself.<br/><br/>Cast: Samuel L. Jackson is great, what else can be said? He can play such a wide range of roles, and yet he is totally believable in all of them. I never once thought ""Shaft"" or ""Changing Lanes"" or even ""Star Wars"" during his performance as a basketball coach. He played the part very well, without being phony. The young stars did quite well in their roles, and it was a credit to the writing and directing crew as well that they gave background to every character, so that the athletes didn't seem like ""rebels without a cause"", the weakest character was Kiera (played by Alliyah), but still wasn't bad, just didn't shine...and the film went on despite it.<br/><br/>Review: I loved this movie, this past year was my senior year, and my school basketball team went through a similar story of nobody thinking anything of us, and we showing up and winning our district and entering the playoffs (so the same plot, minus the ghetto and disrespect for the coach).

","The movie I reviewed was Coach Carter, starring Samuel L. Jackson and Channing Tatum; it was directed by Thomas Carter. I consider this movie a success because it captures the idea of what many schools face who's students come from struggling homes and poverty, with low graduation rates, and high incarnation rates. This movie also shows the power of standing for what you believe In.
The movie follows an intercity basketball team that struggles to win games. Until Coach Carter takes over and transforms the team into a winning team using strict discipline; However, to play on Coach Carter's team, the players are required to maintain a certain grade point average and attend class. During the midst of a perfect season, Coach Carter finds out that the team fails to meet his requirements. He shuts down the gym and puts a hold on their perfect season until their grades improve. Against the judgment of parents and the school board, Coach Carter maintains his idea that academics come before sports.
Coach Carter is more than just a movie about basketball. It covers the fact in which many people deal with today - school systems with low graduation rates and high rates of incarnation. Coach Carter views the players as students before athletes, and instils the power of an education. This is seen in the movie where Coach Carter is explaining to the players, and the school board about the power of education. Well let me tell you what I see, I see a system that is designed for you to fail...growing up here in Richmond you're 80% more likely to go to prison than college"" (Samuel L Jackson). Coach Carter is going against the anti-intellectual message that for African Americans to be successful, it won't be because of education.
Another reason I consider this movie a success because it shows the power of self perseverance. Coach Carter, know the full extent of the dangers that these young men face, as he once was one of them. Before coaching, he attended high school at Richmond being one of the most successful basketball players ever to attend there. He watched his former teammates get arrested, and some of them being killed. This is seen in the movie where he goes against the entire Richmond community to shut down the gym. The parents believe Coach Carter is betraying the boys because they view this season as the best years of their life ""I came to coach basketball players. And you became students. I came to teach boys and you became men"" (Samuel L. Jackson). Coach Carter is stating that for these young men to be successful, they must overcome the misconception that the only way to prosperity is not through education. Coach Carter resistance from every angle, and even putting his job on the line. He ultimately wins over the boys, and they begin to help each other improve their academics.
Coach Carter is a very successful movie because it goes much deeper than just a typical basketball movie; it shows a reality that many young men and women are facing. It also shows the importance of self-perseverance, and this is why this movie is a success."

No one needs another one of these, and will just added to the list of forgotten jockey movies and just be added to the bin. I'm not saying the acting was bad I'm saying the movie was bad as hell. At the end of the movie coach Ken Carter says not a fairytale ending but in the end it still is! With the BS we won real life people and credits roll over the screen of triumphant players. Based on a true story, slum kids, sports, is the perfect formula for any underdog sports movie and wow this had got it and was added to the bin in my opinion. Need a movie that's only good because just like the others, it has Samuel L Jackson? Well, just watch number 109. Yes, the sports movies have gotten so overwritten that they have numbers now. Can you say this is this is an exception because the coach cares about the boys? No – just filler while we have them almost beat the team in the finals but the lose? They have the cliché ending in the end as well. Morals in a sports movie? The perfect game was the only one that did it well. You enjoyed number 12 to 106 you'll enjoy this movie ."

The lockout could have been shorter and when some creative filming it could have still had impact on the audience. And I was unimpressed with the storyline involving Kenyon and his girlfriend.

","STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits <br/><br/>Ex military man Ken Carter (Samuel L Jackson) now owns a sports store but wants to dedicate his spare time to doing something else- being coach to the basketball team of Richmond High School, whose poor discipline and lack of direction has seen them lose nearly every game in the season. The tough-little-gangsta wannabe boys initially show their usual disrespect and un-cooperativeness to the coach, but they soon learn he will not take the cr*p they're used to giving other coaches before him and step into line a little. Despite their initial dislike, Carter comes to do something no other teacher in the system has done before him- respect the boys and actually push them to achieve in a system that ""is designed for them to fail"", but also to show them that that respect has to be earned and that if they abuse it, they will suffer. So when their academic performance fails to improve, he cancels the basketball games for a while. This incurs the wrath of the boys, their parents, other teachers and the community as a whole, but in time, Carter's decision will come to reward the boys and change their lives in ways they never imagined.<br/><br/>Coach Carter can hardly be described as original- the story has been done quite a few times before (Dangerous Minds, Mr Holland's Opus- right down to the true story part.) But this doesn't stop it from being any less effective as a film for what it is. It succeeds in being engaging, inspirational and uplifting. Perhaps not the greatest film of it's kind ever, but a pleasing effort certainly.<br/><br/>As Carter, the heavily working Jackson assumes a natural command and presence. He is pretty much the driving force of the film, but he couldn't have done it without a solid supporting cast, providing some emotive sub-plots and great depth to the story.<br/><br/>It's certainly been produced by MTV alright, as the soundtrack boasts a heap of current popular tracks that anyone over here familiar with the top 40 tracks will know. And it's a great vehicle to appeal to hip younger cinema-goers. ***"

","'Coach Carter' is based on a true story of Coach Ken Carter, a controversial high school basketball coach portrayed by Samuel L. Jackson. Coach Carter took the coaching job under his rules. He believed thatthe players must maintain good grades, attend all classes and sit in the front row and become a united team or they would not play. All the team players signed his contract to do just that. The team was undefeated and on it's way to the 1999 State Championship, when Coach Carter received the progress reports for his players, and discovered they have been ditching class and failing. Coach Carter received national attention when he locked the gym and benched the whole team for poor grades. Coach Carter received some praise and much more criticism for his decision. Supporting cast includes Rob Browne and Ashanti.<br/><br/>'Coach Carter' is an interesting, moving sports drama with a strong lead actor and a ""supportive"" supporting cast, to keep it simple. Samuel L. Jakcson holds the lead role smoothly until the final clip and portrays Coach Ken Carter with ease. Rising hit Rob Browne is a decent enough actor, and could become famous if he makes smart choices. Ashanti is an interesting character. She is introduced like a hip-hop sassy girl, then turns into something much deeper and more unexpected. Also, the subplot of her baby carries the movie when the basketball plot isn't focused on.<br/><br/>All in all, this film is very similar to, say ""Remember the Titans"". I know they are different sports, but they both have that 'moving' sense to them then engages the audience and gets you interested in this sports team, and their coach. The main thing I enjoied in this film was that he locked up the gym, which gave the common sports drama a little pizazz.<br/><br/>Coach Carter; 8 out of 10 PG13- language, thematic material, drug content and some sexual material.<br/><br/>Runtime- 2 hrs. 16 minutes"

","I saw this movie, and I think that Coach Carter is by far one of the worst films to come out so far this year. The reason being is that this film explores an all to much explored genre of basketball and failing athletes and the one person that can reach them. As far as this one goes, I felt throughout the whole thing that I had seen something like this before; which is probably true. The acting was mediocre, S.L Jackson acts the same as he does in all his now typecast roles. The predictability in the movie is astounding, which spoiled it for me for the most part. I think it succeeds as far as trying to entertain people, it does that on the level that most who went to see it can relate to, but as far as an original piece of art, this movie leaves little to the imagination."

Ghetto basketball players fighting and trying to win games. But there's a twist to this one. Coach Carter locked the gym after the players couldn't keep their grades up. If all basketball coaches behaved like this and put education first, there would be no Kobe Bryant or LeBron James. It was strange seeing Ashanti play the role of some one from the ghetto. This proves that she can act. In all other sports movies, the team that the movie is based on wins the championship. But in this movie, the Richmond Oilers LOSE the championship at the buzzer.

"kimberlyn","Null","1","3","13 February 2005"," Great movie!
",""" Coach Carter "" is a classic underdog sports-themed story. It is a truly inspiring movie based on a true story about Ken Carter that hit national news in 1999. It makes us, the audience, think about some of life's challenges that apply to our own lives and it allows us to find ways to overcome them. The film also impresses upon us that the first step to empowerment is education and that it is possible for students to escape from violence and poverty if raised in a poor neighborhood. Which in turn sets up for a great storyline.<br/><br/>The movie originated from a real incident in 1999 when a high school basketball coach, Ken Carter, benched his whole undefeated team for performing poorly academic wise. He pad locked the gym doors and sent his players to the library. He received both high praise and criticism nationally.<br/><br/>Being the story was very real the costumes were not. The setting of the movie is in Long Beach, California in a poor neighborhood. At the beginning of the movie the players were asked to sign a contract that stated: they must receive a minimum 2.3 grade point average, attend all classes, sit in front of those classes and wear a suit and tie on game day. In a meeting the parents were complaining that the student athletes simply don't own suits and ties and cannot afford them. Throughout the movie though, every character was wearing expensive name brand clothing. It totally contradicted the message they were trying to prove about being poor. Then there were the cheerleaders. They were dressed like hip-hop dancers that you would normally see in MTV music videos. No school would allow their students to wear shorts revealing half of their butt.<br/><br/>As hip-hop movie and mainly attracting the youth, the slang and language was not quite appropriate but very up to date. There was some profanity but it only made the movie that much more real. Whether we like it or not kids will curse.<br/><br/>It was also interesting to see how they brought up real life issues that many young teens can relate to. One of them being pregnancies. In the movie one girl got pregnant from her boyfriend that played on the basketball team. It showed the option of abortion. Sending out the message that it my not be morally right but it is up to the parents and what they believe is best for both them and the child. <br/><br/>In conclusion, the costumes were a little contradicting but the movie wasn't totally ruined from it. It had a get story line and sub stories that made us feel as if we were one of the characters. If you love heart touching inspirational movies then this one is highly recommended. It's a reality check."
"movieguy1021","8","1","3","9 February 2005"," Coach Carter: 8/10
","Samuel L. Jackson can do no wrong (unless it involves a movie with the number 51 in it). Whether it's Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown, or even XXX, Jackson always gives off an aura of ""cool""-anyone would want to know him or be him in any of those characters, no matter how wrong the character was. The same holds true for his titular role in Coach Carter. Although it's not one of his ""bad-ass"" roles, he comes off as a cool person with a moral core. Ken Carter is the only character audiences can identify with, and therefore we go along with his actions, and understand his motives. Not only that, but it's a refreshing break from these Disney-produced ""These people can do it, so so can you!"" sports movies. Instead, it's a hard-hitting, tiring adventure through the true story (what else) of a Northern California town and their trials and tribulations.<br/><br/>Ken Carter (Jackson) is hired as the coach of an inner-city basketball team. They're a great team, but lack discipline and academic skills. Carter instigates a vigorous lateness policy (thousands upon thousands of warm-up exercises), and then locks down the gym when the team fails to maintain a 2.3 GPA. Carter handles all controversy handed to him in the typical Samuel L. Jackson manner.<br/><br/>Although unfairly compared to Remember the Titans, the two movies couldn't be any more different. Titans had Denzel Washington (who's nowhere near as cool as Jackson) in a sugar-coated movie about racism. Coach Carter IS racist (about a dozen or so n-words...where's Spike Lee on this one?), and there's no real message, except that knowledge is power (somewhat). Being that Carter's PG-13, unlike Titans's PG, it can get away with much more, with a more developed story. There's a lot of subplots, including drug deals and teen pregnancy. It's great to see such adult topics dealt with in a teen movie (well, it's somewhat like a teen movie). And it's not slammed down our throats, either. It's presented, and we take what we want out of it.<br/><br/>Not only that, but we're able to identify with Carter and his actions. Although they seem (and are) extreme, we can understand where he's coming from. It's like Kurt Russell's insistence in that one (the only good) scene of Miracle. Plus, there's Samuel L. Jackson, who can make everything except Formula 51 a gem. Plus, there's the fact that I saw the movie over a month ago, and don't really remember much from it. But it's surprisingly great for a January release, and one you should at least pick up on DVD.<br/><br/>My rating: 8/10<br/><br/>Rated PG-13 for violence, sexual content, language, teen partying and some drug material."
"Buddy-51","Null","1","3","4 February 2005"," letting a thousand clichés bloom
","How is it that a film based on a true story can wind up seeming more like other movies than like real life? That is the question you may well find yourself asking during ""Coach Carter,"" a two-for-the-price-of-one social drama that combines the clichés of the super teacher saga with those of the underdog sports story.<br/><br/>Ken Carter was a small business owner who agreed to coach a losing high school basketball team in a rundown section of Richmond, California. What Carter discovered when he arrived on the scene was that the team was little more than an undisciplined rabble, its troubled players as unserious about life off the court as on. Through a tough-love regimen of high scholastic standards and grueling training, Carter managed to turn a motley group of antisocial delinquents into not only a championship team, but upstanding citizens and college-bound students as well. Despite initial opposition from both the players and the community, Carter eventually earned the respect and admiration of all. And if this plot synopsis doesn't conjure up memories of ""The Blackboard Jungle,"" ""To Sir, With Love,"" ""Up the Down Staircase,"" ""The Bad News Bears,"" ""Dead Poets' Society,"" ""Stand and Deliver,"" ""The Mighty Ducks,"" ""Dangerous Minds,"" ""Mona Lisa Smiles"" and ""Miracle,"" then you really haven't spent much time at the movies.<br/><br/>Although there isn't a single unpredictable moment in the entire film, excellent performances from Samuel L. Jackson and a cast of gifted young actors elevate the film to a level higher than one could reasonably expect. Jackson provides such a strong, solid center for the story that it's hard not to be uplifted by all his inspirational words of wisdom even though we know that we are being shamelessly manipulated every step of the way. The film makes the pertinent, if not exactly earth shattering, point that low expectations in the academic arena lead only to substandard results. The opposition Carter receives from the community to his unconventional, though highly effective methods, provides some of the true drama of the piece.<br/><br/>""Coach Carter"" is way too long and doesn't show us much that we haven't seen countless times before, yet it's hard to get mad at any film whose intentions are as upstanding and noble as they are here. Don't go in expecting too much and you might get more out of it."
"mjswooosh","5","1","3","24 January 2005"," Feel-Good movie that never quite gives you that warm and fuzzy feeling...
","This is a story that deserves to be told and a movie that tries hard to be above average and probably could have been in the hands of a better director. Ultimately, however, it gets dragged down by a sub-par and cliché' ridden script, boring pacing, average-at-best character development, below average acting (except Sam Jackson who turns in a pretty good performance and makes it at least watchable), extremely poor basketball choreography, and choppy editing. <br/><br/>This is, on the one hand, a movie about life. But the story as portrayed isn't as gripping as it should be and comes off like a melodramatic after-school special (stay in school kids, don't get your girlfriend pregnant, don't deal drugs, etc...). It has the right message, to be sure, but we've seen it done before a hundred and one times...and far better. Perhaps most telling was the fact that during scenes when Sam Jackson wasn't on screen I (and all 3 of the people I went to see the movie with) became extremely bored, extremely fast. To say Sam Jackson carried this movie is a huge understatement. The film tries to show us how the coach reaches these kids, but in the end it just doesn't have much of an impact. Why would we feel sorry for a drug-dealer who has been given so little screen time and is otherwise shown to be little more than a petty thug? Why would I care if Worm makes it? Short of his ridiculous and ultimately unbelievable Shakesperean soliloquy towards the end of the film, we're not really given any hint there is a single brain-cell in his head. A big part of the problem is that other than Sam Jackson the acting is extremely weak, and you absolutely need a strong ensemble cast to get a powerful emotional message across to an audience. Unfortunately, this film fails on almost all counts to help us relate to and care for these characters. In the end, the story just doesn't ""grab"" you like it should and that can only be chalked up to a whole host of things that went wrong to make this movie into another coulda, woulda, shoulda exercise in frustration.<br/><br/>This is also a film about basketball, and had this portion of the film been exciting then perhaps it could have made up for the glaring weaknesses in the story-telling department. Ironically, I have a feeling the film-makers felt this way too so they decided to edit the basketball scenes into what they thought would be ""exciting"" in order to hold the audience's interest. Unfortunately, the result is that Coach Carter is an even bigger failure on the court than it is in the classroom: the on-court scenes themselves are choreographed amateurishly and obviously edited for today's PS2 crowd with the attention spans of gnats. Real basketball? You won't find much here. What you will find are plenty of dunks. Every basketball scene in this movie goes something like this: DUNK, DUNK, DUNK...3-pointer...DUNK, DUNK, DUNK...{show a couple seconds of Sam Jackson yelling something unintelligible on the sidelines}...DUNK, DUNK, DUNK. Rinse, repeat. YAWN. <br/><br/>It doesn't help that virtually none of the actors on the team actually move like real basketball players on the court (especially ""Worm"" who is absolutely NOT an athlete). Perhaps this is why they edited it so much with quick cutaway shots...to cover for the athletic weaknesses of their actors. Is it that hard to find actors in Hollywood who have actually played a sport before and can look reasonably athletic doing it on film? <br/><br/>I played 4 years of college basketball and have coached at various levels over the past 5 years since. While I am no John Wooden, I know a thing or two about the game and trust me...you won't find one nugget of actual basketball knowledge or wisdom, one ounce of reality with regards to how high school basketball is truly played. You won't find that magic moment when a coach is able to drag out perfect performances from a flawed team. What you will find is a steady dose of rim-rattling rams interspersed with shots of rump shaking cheerleaders banging out their dance-grooves to the latest hip-hop that altogether makes high-school basketball look like a Sportscenter dunk-a-th on-slash-music-video. The cheerleader shots were for some reason especially cheesy and bordered on camp, almost as if the film-makers knew they weren't producing a film that accurately portrayed basketball so they collectively figured, ""hey, screw it...let's just go whole-hog and turn high-school basketball into the XFL."" If the cheerleaders all had huge implants and rolled in mud during the games it wouldn't have been much more ridiculous. <br/><br/>During the shoe-ad commercial gone insane basketball scenes, Coach Carter himself was given short shrift and constantly plays second-fiddle to the goings-on around him. In short, he never has a chance to really COACH. This is probably the film's biggest weakness on the court considering it IS supposed to be about COACH CARTER, after all.<br/><br/>From what I have heard through the grape-vine Ken Carter is a wonderful man and the story of his exploits at Richmond high-school are indeed something special, so it's all-the-more sad that his impact on the lives of these children wasn't given a better realization on the big screen. <br/><br/>Ultimately, Coach Carter has a below-average script that poorly realizes the real-life story combined with sub-par direction, a poor ensemble cast, and extremely unrealistic basketball choreography. In short, if you want to watch a movie about how basketball is really played then watch Hoosiers (or even Blue Chips...*shudder*). If you want to watch a movie about inner city kids succeeding against all odds watch Stand and Deliver. Despite the fact that I went into this movie with high hopes, it is really average at best and certainly not worth full admission price. Thank God I only paid to see a matinée. 5/10."

I thought it was going to be your classic happy ending movie, it's got an awesome ending but its not what you would expect. The fact that it is based on a real story makes it even deeper. If you love your game, you will love this movie. The acting is great and the story even greater. Definitely worth my 10 bucks. I would go see it again in a second. One person can make a difference. It's a movie that really gets you thinking and makes me wanna go be the best I can be."

","Overall Coach Carter is a very impressive movie. I've read reviews that talk about how the real coach carter story is much better, but i think Hollywood did well on this movie. For one thing, they didn't alter anything important. i was impressed that they lost the final game, because that's what happened in real life. Hollywood has problems with that sometimes. I like how finally there's a movie that upholds education over all else. Hollywood has problems with that too, sometimes. They say that the real Ken Carter was a much deeper, fun guy, but Hollywood has to make the character more dramatic. That was fine with me. Plus, the soundtrack is great. Hope by Twista ft. Faith Evans is a great song."

Flashes of ""Hoosiers"" here, but actually much more like Richard Brooks' ""Blackboard Jungle"" as Jackson proves to be a tough cookie that can handle his team when few others would even try.

An outstanding movie in almost every way.<br/><br/>The only drawback for me is its persistent profanity.

","I like Samuel Jackson, he is one of my favorite actors. And, I like inspiring true stories. Put both of those together, in a movie like ""Coach Carter"", and you have a great movie. Jackson is Coach Ken Carter who, 30 years earlier, had been the star basketball player at this very same California high school, and now had a profitable sporting goods business. He took the job reluctantly, for 4 months and $1500, because he wanted a little extra spending money to take his wife on vacation. But he took it only on one condition -- he would be allowed to do it his way. In his years since high school he knew the statistics -- only 50% of the students would graduate, only one in 6 would go to college, and 1 in 3 boys would end up in prison or dead. He wanted to make a difference, to change the statistics for these basketball players who only wanted to play ball and win.<br/><br/>Coach Carter, on his first day, requires all who want to play, to sign a contract. Maintain a 2.3 GPA, attend all classes, sit in the front row, and wear a coat and tie on game days. And -- learn to refer to each other and the coach as ""sir."" All quite a change in culture for these borderline ghetto students. Carter figured that unless they could develop a better self-discipline, and follow good rules, then they had no hope of following the rules of society and set personal goals to make something of themselves.<br/><br/>Rob Brown of ""Finding Forrester"" fame is one of the star players, Kenyon Stone, who has a side issue with his pregnant girlfriend Kyra (Ashanti). The DVD has an interesting extra featuring the real Coach Carter.<br/><br/>SPOILERS. Carter through pushups, ""suicides"" drills, and lots of outside running makes them the best conditioned team in the area, and uses a running offense to wear down the opponents. They go from poor losers the season before to almost unbeatable. But when Carter finds out that many of them were violating their contracts, skipping class, getting failing or incomplete grades, he locked the gym and canceled games. The parents and town rebeled, wanted Carter to quit, mandated unlocking the gym, but the team held together, refused to practice until all grades were in order, then they were invited to the championship tournament. A low seed, they were forced to play the best team in the state, almost winning, but losing in the final seconds by one point, still they had bonded as a team and understood the priorities in life better."

","For its genre - the high school uplifting turnaround - this is a good example. Samuel L. Jackson delivers a solid and believable performance. The members of the team are also believable, and the story is definitely uplifting. There are no major surprises.<br/><br/>One of the things I look for most, especially with big name actors like Jackson, is whether I believe that they are the character while I'm watching the movie, or whether I'm seeing the actor portraying the character. Jackson is totally believable as Coach Carter.<br/><br/>This movie includes enough drama, including vignettes focusing on the lives of some of the players, to keep it interesting throughout."

","Coach Carter is based on a true story of Richmond High School basketball coach Ken Carter (Samuel L Jackson) who made headlines in 1999 for benching his high school basketball team due to poor academic results.<br/><br/>The film is not really about basketball that is just a backdrop. It is more about Ken Carter who becomes head coach of his old high school, where the players are rude, disrespectful and ill disciplined.<br/><br/>Carter makes them each sign a personal contract regarding training, discipline, attendance and school grades. Although a disciplinarian the team has an unbeaten run and turns around the lives of their players even though some in the school and many of the parents are unhappy with his methods.<br/><br/>I guess I would loath to have Ken Carter as my coach but in this movie with its assortment of High school misfits that are straight out of ghetto casting, it works.<br/><br/>Samuel L Jackson has enough charisma and likability for you to invest in his character.

"DemiRonin","5","0","1","16 April 2011"," A fairly mediocre film. Can't really say much besides that.
","The film centers around Richmond High school which is underfunded and has only a 50% graduation rate. Coach Carter played by Samuel L Jackson is a former alumni to the school comes in to take over the coaching position in his first season. The film doesn't have a central character but goes with an ensemble cast. The characters include the coach's son, a student drug dealer, a illiterate student, a teen pregnancy and etc etc. <br/><br/>I guess what separates this film from a normal basketball film is that Coach is very stringent on the grades his students must keep. Coach Carter sends the message that basketball is not the only trophy worthy of chasing for these at risk teenagers. <br/><br/>The acting is alright, no breakthrough performances. Some people have said that Samuel Jackson is great and.... he's okay, but we've seen better in other films. <br/><br/>Unless you're in a basketball mood, it's not really worth watching. I has good messages and good lessons to be learned but the drama is just not there. It's not gut wrenching and your not going to be at the edge of your seat to see what happens next.

","Based on a true story, I knew the theme and leading actor, so that was enough to get me interested, from director Thomas Carter (Save the Last Dance). Set in 1999, this is the story of Ken Carter (Samuel L. Jackson), a sporting goods store owner who accepts the job of basketball coach at his old high school in Richmond, California, where he was a champion athlete. He is not only brought in to teach his male students basketball, but to help them improve their attitudes and results in school life. He is only going to let them be in ""the team"" when they have got good results for their classes, if they behave respectfully and ultimately get the attitude to win the game. Of course Carter learns they are still doing poorly in class, and while they are successful on the court, he is not afraid to stop them playing and having everyone go against him, which does happen. Eventually his students do improve academically, and they do get to play in the big game of the time, and even though they lose, their spirits are not broken, and they all went on to have worthwhile lives. Also starring Robert Ri'chard as Damien Carter, Rob Brown as Kenyon Stone, singer Ashanti as Kyra, Debbi Morgan as Tonya, Rick Gonzalez as Timo Cruz, Antwon Tanner as Worm, Nana Gbewonyo as Junior Battle, Channing Tatum as Jason Lyle, Texas Battle as Maddux and Denise Dowse as Principal Garrison. Jackson as always gives a good performance that seems the best reason to see the film, and it may have many clichés that you may see in other sports drama films, but it wouldn't hurt to try it.

Coach Carter is yet another in an endless line of movies with underdog teams proving everyone wrong and winning (or in this case . . . ) the big game. The only thing that stands out in CC is Samuel L. Jackson (who does a great Samuel L. Jackson impression in everything he does). Even when he's sleepwalking through a movie, he has the command presence that keeps you watching even when you have something better to do--like changing the air in your basketball.<br/><br/>What I found most distressing about this 135 minute cliché is the whole inner-city, gangsta culture. At every level, there's something for adults to cringe at and kids to try to emulate. You know knuckleheads all across the country are watching the movie, not for the freedom-comes-from-academics theme, but for the Ebonics and the baggy clothes and the trash talk and the ""bitches."" It's the sight of kids running up and down a court playing a game.

It shows how having sex and boozing and school are three things that are most important in life. Most important because if you take sex for granted one day things will process to a baby being produced the film shows how to high schoolers have issues when it comes to her being pregnant, boozing because you could say the wrong thing and end up in a ditch after being brutualised or anything, and school because without the high about of s.a.t. scores, the film shows what you could end up doing, selling drugs or being in jail.

","Coach Carter is a good sports movie. The fact that it is based upon a true story makes it more compelling. It revolves around tough love and the idea that if you do thousands of push-ups and thousands of suicides (wind sprints) then you will develop the necessary respect for yourself and your fellow man. Ahh if everyone would just go to boot camp then wouldn't the world be a better place? <br/><br/>I liked that this movie asked the question, ""what really is a student athlete?"" The answer is that in today's schools ""student athlete"" is an oxymoron unless a contract is signed and enforced. And it is the enforcing of this contract that made this an unique sports movie.<br/><br/>Samuel L. Jackson is well cast and gives an excellent performance although in some scenes I was wondering if he was still training Jedi Knights.<br/><br/>During the filming of the ""big"" basketball games it appeared several of the cameramen were having seizuresthe equivalent of my wife operating our camcorderor maybe it was just the editor who was seizing? <br/><br/>Although Ashanti is really nice to look at I wasn't sure why her character was necessary to tell the story. Either her influence on the team (not just an individual) and the plot needed to be integrated better or her character should have been scaled down or cut.<br/><br/>I would have liked to have seen more about what made Coach Carter take the job (he was only paid $1,500 a season) and more on why he didn't have his son enroll in Richmond in the first place instead of sending him to a private school. I already know about drugs on the street and teenage pregnancy through many other films. What I don't know enough about is what motivates a Coach Carter type personality and in turn why there are so few like him.<br/><br/>The objective of life is not to try to reach one's peak during high school sports but rather to be prepared for the long haul. This movie conveys this message well but I still would have liked to see more of Coach Carter off the court and less of the basketball players off the court."

Most importantly it delivers a message, a few actually: education is a number one priority in every society, lead by example, rise above the odds, never give up and so on.

However people can take away your sporting career, but they can't do so with what you have learnt, in this case education can work as a contingency, something you can fall back on.

","How do you top the career of Sam Jackson, a classic actor who has been in many superb films all around for years. ""Pulp Fiction"" ""Jackie Brown"" and the ""Negotiator"" were all excellent, but in recent years it seemed as if he had simply scrapped all of that, and taken any offer that came his way, no matter how poor the material. ""Swat"" and ""Basic"" are perfect examples. So how does good old Sam get on top of his game again? He signs up for a fresh new film like ""Coach Carter"". <br/><br/>Targeting the career of ""Ken"" and his quest to make the ""hood"" peaceful again and giving all the ""hardcore"" gangsters goals, you can tell this is a pro-education film just dripping with sentimentality. The only problem is: these guys just ain't gangster enough. OK, there is no denying, Coach Carter targeted the market; a smart move, fair enough. But in doing so they created a relatively pretentious view of a ""rough"" neighbourhood, with teens who don't act hard and don't speak hard. Bad language may not be completely necessary, but it certainly would of added to the realism here. That aside, this film is very entertaining, and, for a short while, almost really good; but here and there the corny side creeps up, particularly in a horribly clichéd, unnecessary scene where young hood member ""Cruz"" proves his worth to the team. It is literally cringe-worthy. <br/><br/>So all in all, Coach Carter is not great film. Had I reviewed this on the basis of how well and how realistically this film was done, I'd probably give it about a 1, but this was a fun, popcorn flick that is good for a short period but drags on eventually.

","Coach Carter is not new. We saw it with Dangerous Minds, we've seen it with numerous other films...the teacher who touches the lives of all his difficult students with his unique style. But this format doesn't make a film bad, on the contrary, it's a heart felt concept that could work very well and Coach Carter is no exception.<br/><br/>Coach Carter is the story of Ken Carter, a man who takes a job coaching an inner city basketball team that he played for in his youth, who's academic records barely exist. The kids are in trouble, they come from hard backgrounds and are into drug dealing, and fighting and basically they only come to school to play Ball. Carter is tough right from the beginning, having come from the school himself, he knows what must be done. The students have never had this kind of control over them and they gradually begin to see Carter's rules and style is going to help them win Basketball but more importantly save their lives.<br/><br/>Samuel L. Jackson shows an amazing amount of heart in this movie, something he doesn't usually show. I thought he was much too rough around the edges to perform in a film like this but I was wrong. His rough around the edges style is broken through with heart and passion which is perfect for this role. The best part of the film in my opinion was the detachment from one key part of this teacher helping the students formula and that was that nothing horribly bad happened to any of the students. They had rough lives but there was nothing horrible that shakes them all up ie. Death, drug overdose etc etc. Perhaps this being based on a true story assisted in that. Instead the film keeps it's high moral message and gives us a glimpse into what was truly accomplished. Jackson as Carter never falters on his morals or what he wants to do and he fights the system for these kids and that's the most touching part of the film. He teaches them that win or lose their lives will never be worth losing because of a lack of self respect. This film is touching and gritty and a definite keeper.<br/><br/>8/10"

","Although too long this inspiring story shows what one man can do when he believes in kids that the school system gives up on. This is a must-see movie not only for inner city kids and their parents but for everyone. It shows that when athletes are challenged intellectually as well as athletically they can surprise beyond expectations. Samuel L Jackson is excellent as Coach Carter. The principal athletes are very believable. The basketball scenes are good just not great. Carter's speeches to the players are believable and inspirational. The only disappointing thing about the movie is the one dimensional roles given to the girls, especially the over concentration on the cheerleaders. Well worth seeing."

","Coach Carter ***/*****<br/><br/>There have been a slew of sports stories to hit the multiplex in the last few years. They all have enough in common that we get tired of them yet they each have their own ""thing"" that makes them unique enough that we go to see them just to see what this story has that the others didn't. The inspirational, uplifting, based on a true story sports tales are a dime a dozen because, essentially, every athlete is one of these stories. What makes the boys of Friday Nigh Lights any different that your local high school football team? What makes coach Carter's players any different than any other teenage boys?<br/><br/>In the latest version of 'talented players with bad coach get good coach and start winning', Samuel L. Jackson plays coach Cater who comes to coach at his old high school where more kids end up in prison that end up with college diplomas. He is on a mission not only to improve the game record for the basketball team but to also improve the academic standing of his players. The boys live in a predominantly poor black neighborhood and all the stereotypes of this lifestyle show up to bat. Boy who's girlfriend is pregnant, the tough guy who hangs with his older cousin and gets into trouble although the camera makes it painfully obvious that he will be ""saved"" in the end and the one who tries to be that ""savior"". <br/><br/>Perhaps the movie shouldn't be ridiculed for following formula. After all, that is what sells and if movies didn't make back their costs, we'd have to find new ways to spend Friday nights. But the problem with formula is that we get tired of it when it's over used and man oh man is this formula getting old. It's almost akin to watching the day in life of anybody played before your eyes over and over and over again. You know who is going to say what, when and why and after a while you stop caring. The inspirational speeches coaches give at halftime of the pivotal game don't actually exist, you know.<br/><br/>But, like romantic comedies, horror and thriller films, when formula is twisted in some way or another, the movies are better than those that never had a pattern to work with in. The Sixth Sense is the classic horror film with a twist. It just happened to be such a good twist that it essentially became its own sub-genre of thriller films. A film like Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is just a romantic comedy. It's justbackwardsand sideways. Whatever. The point is that it's a distorted version of what we're used to and, as a result, it has become a film with a growing fan base that is loyal to the extent that they might as well be called a cult. <br/><br/>Coach Carter, although not exactly revolutionary in the ways these two films are, had a chance to be. There is an entire sub-plot devoted to the academic progress of the basketball players. ""They're student athletes. Student comes first."" The point where this story is wrapped up also coincides with an ending of sorts to the athlete story. If, at this point, the filmmakers had chosen to end the film, they would have created a story more about the student than the athlete, making them not just another based on a true story sports film."

Even though the team does not go into the state playoffs, Coach Carter is very proud that he was able to change most of the players lives.

POSSIBLE SPOILER****The newly hired basketball coach, Ken Carter, wants that jocks excel not only athletically but academically as well. He wants to change the ages-old way of educating youngsters whose primary interest is other than academic realm. And his mindset and his peculiar way of trying to accomplish his goal are radically opposed by the predominantly low-class community. Carter is an open-minded man. He's caring, willing to take risks, he behaves himself and is well-accepted at first. But at his workplace his strictness, his rigid set of rules and the severity of his punishments are simply incomprehensible to the community's level of understanding. And this is the point when the jarring effect of misunderstandings and objection leads to condemnation, attack, trial and finally closes up with regret and submission to the Carter's rules. He wanted smart kids and smart athletes. And he got them only when the parents and adults questioned their own selves if they wanted to live with smart kids & athletes and be proud of them or be surrounded by rascals and delinquents who could only help the rate of crime rise and jeopardize their own lives.

And it works. Samuel L Jackson plays this role easily and his witty one liners have the same effect on the audience as they did on his players; they make us laugh and sort of respect the guy. It is a movie that shows you can do anything you want to do with hard work, discipline and respect (for others and yourself). It seems that a lot of teens today either don't know this or don't care. I don't think seeing this movie will change things for those teens, but perhaps they will listen to their own ""Coach Carter"" and make different life choices.<br/><br/>But Coach Carter doesn't go over the top to preach these morals. It doesn't try to shock you with what could happen if you don't do what coach tells you. It simply shows you a story where a group of kids did listen and how that works for them.<br/><br/>I would see this movie again. I will buy it when it comes out.

"LaurenWebster7","Null","0","1","3 February 2005"," Coach Carter review
","""Coach Carter"" is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It embodies all components of an entertaining and attention-grabbing movie. The messages sent through the movie were very serious and moving, yet entertaining. It deals with all issues facing teens today; from gang violence, to drug use, to teen pregnancy, to excellence in athletics and in school. The movie is set in an inner city California neighborhood where gang violence and drug use is a way of life. When Ken Carter (Samuel L. Jackson) accepts the position of head basketball coach, he knows exactly what obstacles are ahead of him and what needs to be done to achieve his goals for the team. Coach Carter not only wants his team to excel on the basketball court but in the classroom as well. When the boys' grades start slipping, he proceeds to bench his entire team and lock the gym until all grades are up to par. One of the most emotional and inspirational moments of the movie is when all boys say they refuse to play for anyone but Coach Carter and decide to get their grades up. The movie is a bit long, yet there's always something going on so it never gets boring. The life lessons learned in the movie are unbelievable and nothing short of amazing. The impact that Coach Carter has on these young boys' lives is incredible. For someone to have that much influence on people's lives is a great attribute. After you see this movie, it will leave you with a sense of motivation to inspire and touch people's lives the way Coach Carter did."
"zardoz-13","Null","0","1","2 February 2005"," ""Coach Carter"" makes the grade!!!
","Every conscientious high school educator ought to watch the new hoops movie ""Coach Carter,"" (*** out of ****) an inspirational but formulaic, true-life sports saga about a messianic basketball coach that recycles elements from the 1987 Gene Hackman netter ""Hoosiers"" and the 1989 Morgan Freeman classic ""Lean On Me."" Not only does Samuel L. Jackson deliver a powerful performance, but also Coach Ken Carter's real-life exploits provide him with his most charismatic role since the 1995 Bruce Willis police thriller ""Die Hard With a Vengeance."" Moreover, Jackson doesn't have to shoot, stab, or slay anybody to hold our attention. Okay, he roughs up a haughty high school student, but Jackson's suit & tie clad character restraints his temper. After all, he serves as their role model, rather like Denzel Washington in ""Remember the Titans."" The biggest difference between ""Coach Carter"" and the aforementioned films is Carter demands that his team sign a contract that pledges them to maintain a 2.3 grade point average. When our hero discovers that several players are flunking out, Carter padlocks the gym and forfeits the next game, even though he has transformed the Oilers into an undefeated Cinderella phenomenon. Suddenly, stunned parents and teachers who've grown accustomed to their team winning contend that Carter is unreasonably depriving their students of a golden opportunity obtain scholarships from scouts to attend nearby colleges.<br/><br/>""Coach Carter"" preaches its loud, obvious but admirable message without short-changing the audience when it comes time to entertain them. The disciplinary scenes where Carter whips his students into shape recall the 1967 Lee Marvin World War II blockbuster ""The Dirty Dozen."" Interestingly, too, another message emerges from this fast-paced, often exciting, but flawed feel-good saga. Even more controversial than Carter's decision to bench the team is a young female character's (the big-screen debut of singer Ashanti) decision to terminate her pregnancy when her boyfriend, Kenyon (Rob Brown of ""Finding Forrester""), and she both realize they cannot raise a family and attend college at the same time. Incredibly, the academic excellence message overshadows the abortion subplot. Sometimes, what people pay attention to reveals as much about themselves as an audience than the movie itself. Moreover, critics have either overlooked or bypassed this incendiary issue. Nobody gets really upset with the abortion subplot. Instead, the parents, teachers, and administrators howl about Carter's audacious scheme to bench the team until they can hike their Q.P.A. to a level acceptable for acceptance at a junior college.<br/><br/>Biographies like ""Coach Carter"" tend to degenerate into saintly hero-worship, because--unless the person is dead--the studio doesn't want to worry about a lawsuit for character assassination. Despite this ever-present fear, director Thomas Carter, who helmed ""Save The Last Dance For Me,"" wrings convincing performances out of a largely unknown cast. There's chemistry between Jackson and his twentysomething co-stars, and the Mark (""The Perfect Score) Schwahn and John (""Varsity Blues"") Gatins screenplay provides us with many suspenseful moments off court as well as on the court. Sure, the subplots surrounding the team building scenes are riddled with clichés, but the persuasive performances give you a reason to overlook these staples.<br/><br/>""Coach Carter"" is pretty straightforward and takes places over a span of four months back in 1998. The action occurs at Richmond High School in California where the basketball teamthe Oilerscompiled a losing record of 4 wins and 22 losses. In frustration, the coach convinces Carter to take on the coaching job without pay. As it turns out, Carter attended Richmond as a teen and set All-American basketball records that nobody has topped. At first, the students balk at the rigid conditions that he sets down for them to follow if they want to play. Not only must they wear suits and ties to school, but also they must sit on the front row of their classes. One arrogant student, Timo Cruz (Rick Gonzales of ""Biker Boyz"") storms out in a rage. Later, after he sees Carter work his magic and convert the team into contenders, he begs his way back into the fold. Purists will argue that the film presents all the usual stereotypes of inner-city, at-risk minority youths. Essentially, this is an accurate way of looking at ""Coach Carter."" Samuel L. Jackson dominates the film with his bossy character, and the movie sizzles when he appears on screen. Meanwhile, all the subplots except the abortion date back 1970's blaxploitation thrillers.<br/><br/>The worst thing about ""Coach Carter"" is director Thomas Carter's (no relation to the protagonist) strategy to downplay academics. Understandably, the visual dynamics of taking tests and attaining high grades present few photogenic possibilities compared with adrenalin-laced action on the basketball court. Indeed, Carter stages the on-court action with skill, and you get caught up in the team's determination to win against long odds, especially in the final championship showdown. Aside from its commendable message, ""Coach Carter"" succeeds where other recent sports dramas, like the lackluster ""Friday Night Lights,"" flounder. Samuel L. Jackson's memorable performance, the white-knuckled tension during the basketball games, and a sturdy supporting cast overcoming their stereotypical roles helps ""Coach Carter"" make the grade."

","On the field, rink or court, the team that does the most unexpected thing or who tries the newest strategy doesn't necessarily define the game being played. More often, it is about the rigorous execution of practiced skills and knowing how to keep your weaknesses from getting in your way. This straightforward and almost military approach that identify both the character of Coach Ken Carter (Samuel L. Jackson) and the movie about him and the underprivileged basketball team. The solid performances from the cast make this movie a good addition to the genre of inspirational teacher fables.<br/><br/>The Richmond High basketball team is facing the very real possibility of another season in the dumps as they look back at their previous record of 4 wins and 22 losses. Their very tired coach has been working for several years and has sought out alumnus and state record-holder Ken Carter to be his replacement. Carter takes the job in spite of the small money and large time commitment because of his love of the game and discipline. More details are revealed later in the movie, but giving them away here would only undermine Jackson's strong performance. The new Coach moves in; kicks out the trouble-makers (who, coincidentally, are also the team's highest scorers); offers the remaining team an athletic and academic contract; and begins practice with the rigor and tenacity of a Marine. Soon, there is insight into the off-court lives of the players. From its introduction, the Richmond School is obviously one of the poorer of California's school districts even though it is part of the city of San Francisco. <br/><br/>There are dates, dances, and hot bodies at parties (which, as part of an MTV Films production, are edited in flashy fashion), but the looming realities of poverty, crime, drugs and family are faced here. For Cruz (Rick Gonzales), drugs are an easy payday, but he wants something more after he gets kicked off of the team. Damien Carter (Robert Ri'chard), the coach's son, wants to play for his father, but must survive the social shock of transferring from an expensive college prep school to the rough halls of Richmond. Although Kenyon (Rob Brown) has won both the heart and bed of Kyra (Ashanti), her unplanned pregnancy threatens to overwhelm them. Director Thomas Carter, who is said to have no relation to the real-life Coach Carter, does an excellent job of balancing all the subplots while showing the boys growing as players and as a team under Coach Carter's direction. <br/><br/>He does train and lead the team to a 16-and-0 record before the house comes tumbling down from its rickety academic pilings. The Coach confronts parental dissent and faces faculty resistance when he tries to follow up on his players' grades, which must be higher than school requirements for the sake of athletic scholarships. When the Coach gets the reports only to learn that the players are falling far short of their goal, he locks the gym, cancels games and sets up tutoring in lieu of practice. The ensuing conflict is the true climax of the film, and it smartly avoids making any single character a villain. The students' choice ultimately makes the difference, and the movie continues to a second court-side climax which feels more like an epilogue. However, could you really make a Hollywood film about high school basketball end anywhere except at a big game? <br/><br/>The cast of ""Coach Carter"" is the film's real strength over its director. Thomas Carter is an able film maker, but he sticks to the basics and uses slow motion shots to create emotional emphasis a bit too often. No real ground is broken in the genre here. Of course Samuel L. Jackson brings tremendous weight, strength and passion to Ken Carter. Those characteristics are the backbone most of the movie's events, and it is easy to see how he was chosen and why he accepted the role. Without a team about whom the audience can care, Coach Carter would just be a loud and frustrated man wasting his time with a bunch of teenagers. They are all allowed to give their characters definition and range. The moments they take to shrug, joke, glance all enhance each performance, and illustrate how small choices define each of them. The whole group interacts organically. This is not just about how to win the championship and get the popular girl to go to the dance. These players are people who are faced with uncomfortably limited choices that will doubtlessly affect the course of their lives. <br/><br/>Having a release date early in the year is typically a sign of ""no confidence"" from a studio to a film, but ""Coach carter"" seems stronger than the typical January film. The director may not be the most artistic or risky, but he opens all the right doors for the story and the cast. It is a strong story that succeeds in illustrating hard won inspiration. <br/><br/>7 out of 10"

","Parts Hoosiers, part Dead Poet's Society and part Lean on Me, Samuel L. Jackson stars as high school basketball coach Ken Carter in the new MTV/Paramount release, Coach Carter.<br/><br/>Inspired by a true story, Ken Carter was responsible for turning around the basketball athletic program at Richmond High School by less than conventional methods. Carters' philosophy was that education was far more important than any athletic achievement and he had each of the team members sign a contract that agrees to some significant terms. Included in the personal agreements were to maintain a 2.3 grade point average, to attend every class and sit in the front row and to wear a jacket and tie on game days. In return, the players get the benefit of his coaching tutelage and the use of a gym facility for their training regiment.<br/><br/>Getting the lowly Richmond team to work as a team would be a tougher job than expected. With a 4-20 something record the year previous, there was much room for improvement and the teenage kids were acting like, well, teenagers when given their first dose of authority. But things do get off to a rousing start until coach gets their progress reports from the teaching faculty and shuts down the gym forfeiting two matches 16 games into the successful season.<br/><br/>This caused quite an uproar in the community and gave Carter some media attention back in 1999. Perceived as taking away the highlight of an adolescent's school memory while striking a blow to an incredible turnaround in achievement, parents convened in a town-hall type meeting to vote on the future of the imposed lockout and ultimately the future of coach Carter. The result can all be determined if you have seen any of the three movies I listed in the opening paragraph, and the team does get to play at least one more memorable game towards their legacy.<br/><br/>Coach Carter comes from a very short line of good basketball films. In fact, this side of professional hockey, there is not much other than 1986's Hoosiers and Spike Lee's He Got Game there is not much to cheer about (sorry Blue Chips). However, Coach Carter does prove to be inspirational and the basketball game footage and camera angles are maybe the best ever filmed to represent the fast paced sport.<br/><br/>Samuel L. Jackson does his best Samuel L. Jackson impression and is believable as a coach that would put in the time and energy into a thankless ($1,500/year thankless) coaching position. The kids too also pull off just enough to make the strong glide down court without feeling as if we are traveling towards an expected conclusion.<br/><br/>There were some liberties taken that are truly evident. The fact that two high school teams can score 14 points between them with less than two minutes left in the game yet only get 70-odds for the entire contest was a bit hard to believe (but not impossible so I am told).<br/><br/>But the major problem with Coach Carter was the running time. Clocking in at an unnecessary 136 minutes, there are far too many musical montages of Carter thinking alone in the gym or the team walking through the school halls. It was as if MTV films was trying to squeeze a double disc CD complication out of the experience, and I quite frankly could have cared less for these non-story moving moments.<br/><br/>So too could the team members quitting the team ended up on the cutting room floor. They walk away only to come back only to walk away again. Surely, some amalgamation of the events could have been conjured to keep things on a forwards progress.<br/><br/>But these are small nitpicks for what is overall a very enjoyable and moving experience. Coach Carter does deliver the goods and even though your bum might take time to forgive you for shuffling in your seat for two plus hours, at least the final result is a film that kids and parents alike can enjoy and hopefully draw inspiration from. And that my friends is a slam dunk.<br/><br/>www.gregsrants.com"

","I thought this movie was amazing. This movie represents a lot more than just another typical basketball movie and reveals a majority of the true story of Coach Ken Carter. His story is so uplifting in its content and how it came to be a formality that I could guarantee anyone would at least smile after seeing this movie. It makes you think about where our priorities lie, both as individuals and as a society.<br/><br/>Having met Ken Carter after seeing this movie, it only solidifies that this man is the real deal. His love, compassion, and respect for everyone is refreshing in today's world. In meeting this man, I realize that we should all be so fortunate as to have a mentor like him. And I'd be wrong if I didn't add he's a lot funnier in real life than Mr. Jackson portrays in the movie (and rightfully so, with consideration to the story). I also have to assure you that Samuel L. Jackson is the PERFECT FIT for Ken Carter's role. Not only is there a resemblance in looks, but the voice similarity was downright eerie at times during his speech.<br/><br/>Anyways... good movie, great story, amazing man. Enjoy!"

","I was wondering if anyone has seen the previews for the movie and the song they play towards the end of the commercial. Some of the words are ""I've been waiting for this moment for all my life"" I figured it a Phil Collins remix but I don't know the name or who sings it and I am having so much trouble finding it so if anyone can help me i'd really appreciate it.

"OriginalMovieBuff21","6","0","3","22 January 2005"," Just like any other sport movie and very predictable but well played role by Samuel L. Jackson
","I saw Coach Carter about a week ago and I knew from beginning to end that the movie was not going to be very good. I wasted about 6 dollars to see a movie that I was invited too which I shouldn't of gone and should've seen The Aviator. In my opinion, Coach Carter is just like any other sport movie. In almost every sport movie it's always a person who cheers the team up that was bad into a good team who cares for each other. I mean that's fine, it's just way to predictable. Besides from the negatives, I thought that Samuel L. Jackson who played Coach Carter was fantastic. I mean he really played a good role just like all the other good films he has done such as Pulp Fiction. Overall, a fair film with some good scenes and good acting but to predictable and sometimes less interesting.<br/><br/>Hedeen's outlook: 5.5/10 *+ D+"
"beethoven76","7","0","2","22 January 2005"," Coach Carter kicks some butt
","The film Coach Carter is based on the real life events of Coach Ken Carter in Richmond, CA. Carter takes over a struggling high school basketball program and uses strict, authoritarian methods to instill discipline on the team and (hopefully) produce a winning season. The team members rebel at first, but most of them soon go along with his request to sign a contract that involves getting good grades and not getting into trouble.<br/><br/>The basketball starts winning big time and the whole town is excited about the new attitude and confidence they see in the players. But most of the players are doing a lot of bad stuff anyway, and are floundering in their school work. Carter decides to put the season on hold and risk missing the state high school basketball playoffs until the team shapes up. Everyone is up in arms and the the big question is, will they get rid of the too-strict coach, or make the kids go along with their original agreement.<br/><br/>Samuel L. Jackson is the lead actor portraying Coach Carter, and he does a great job. I thought he was believable in the role since he projects a disciplinarian-type authority. Although his character is somewhat ""infallible"", Jackson plays it about right.<br/><br/>The other characters all play their parts well, but they're pretty one-dimensional. I thought that Robert Ri'chard actually underplayed his part as Carters son, Damien, He was a little too low key.<br/><br/>The cinematography captured the gritty reality of urban Richmond and also was good at showing the tough, physical reality of basketball.<br/><br/>On the downside, there was quite a bit of profanity which may turn off some viewers, especially those who have younger children. And the characters could have used some more depth. But overall I think that Coach Carter is a god sports-themed movie and I enjoyed it."
"disneygirl-2","10","0","2","22 January 2005"," Amazing
","I've been proud of MTV films, even though I hate the channel-and this movie proves once again that they're amazing.<br/><br/>Samuel L. Jackson is so amazing as Coach Carter, and the fact that this is based off a true story makes it all the more fabulous.<br/><br/>The story and casting was amazing, and maybe everyone doesn't understand the ghetto lifestyle, 'cause I don't either. But this movie makes you understand a bit more on their odds.<br/><br/>It's a great movie, and it's enjoyable for ALL ages. I went with my grandfather, whose 65 and I'm 15 and we both loved it, and we both understood it in our own ways. It's a great family film."
"pinkflamingo1102","8","0","3","22 January 2005"," It was great......
","Well this movie was excellent in my opinion, even though I am not a basketball player, i still enjoyed this movie for many reasons. First, All of the guys were fine!!!!, and they had their shirts off for a lot of the movie, so of course i enjoyed it. This movie is good, but a lot of people probably won't like it (because of there age), it is more for teenage girls or basketball players. This movie is sad at times and ultimately hilarious,and a good movie. I do recommend this movie to any teenager who is looking for a funny entertaining movie to see with friends. I was surprised by the outcome of the movie, I wasn't expecting it to be sad and even slightly heart warming at times and it was (which is good) I loved this movie. I rate it a 8 out of 10"
"cjbarnette","9","0","2","21 January 2005"," Coach Carter is so good!!!!
","Samuel Jackson pulls off another incredible performance as the basketball coach of the Richmond HS team. Wonderful story of a man who stands for principles unlike many of the coaches of this day. Who choose to either win at all cost, and promote themselves as the one and only guru of basketball. The ladies game shows that pure basketball is pass, catch, shoot, defend. Not dunks all the time. And its great. Coach Carter shows that there is even more, educating and teaching his players as they pursue W's on the court. It can be done and this movie shows gives blueprint. Cruz's quotes in the gym scene near the end speak profound words of wisdom. ""Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate, our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness, that most frightens us; yet playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking, so that other people want feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine as children do. Its not just in some of us, its in everyone, and as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automaticlly liberates others."" That blew me away. So much so that I had to see the movie twice to get all that. Go see this one. Its a wonderful movie with all types of lessons for the young and the old. And the cast is beautiful. Ashanti whoa! I'll have this one for the library when it comes out----the first day! Peace to you, Cj"
"Balthazar-5","6","0","2","21 January 2005"," 'Hoosiers' meets 'Stand and Deliver'
","Sports films always at least have the advantage that artificial drama can always be conjured up from the uncertainty of the outcome of a particular sporting event. Films set in under-privileged neighbourhoods have the advantage that they are able to show us that there is good in all of us and we can overcome adversity, if only we try hard enough.<br/><br/>Films that are both set in the ghetto and about sporting endeavour have, thus, two advantages. 'Coach Carter' milks its two advantages and turns out to be a highly entertaining, if unoriginal, pot-boiler. Jackson is fine as the tough-nut 'made good' former street kid given the job of beating a bunch of apparent no-hoper school basketball players into shape. We get all of the social stuff... drugs, unwanted pregnancies, academic under-achievement. That's par for the course.<br/><br/>We also get some excellent sidebar characters, like a realist head-mistress who turns idealist, and a massively over-weight mother who dominates her tough-nut son.<br/><br/>The film is, finally, just an amalgam of 'Hoosiers' (1986) and 'Stand and Deliver' (1988) - both substantially superior films. It is, however, worth the price of admission for the ride."
"aeo","6","0","2","21 January 2005"," good movie.
","I give this a 6 out of 10 stars.<br/><br/>It is a good movie but nothing outstanding. The story is based on a true event where a California high school basketball coach cancels practice and games due to the team's academic performance.<br/><br/>Samuel Jackson plays a reluctant-just-hired basketball coach of a high school that is in an inner city area where crime and poverty is the norm. He makes them care about their academic as well as their basketball performance. Through this process, the students learn about team work and personal accountability.<br/><br/>If you have seen the movie ""Lean on Me,"" then this is that except a light version."
"djd4598","Null","0","2","18 January 2005"," Jackson carried this movie
","I thought that the movie was pretty good. Mainly because I love Samuel L. Jacson. One reason that I think that this movie will do well is the fact that this is one of the first serious basketball movies made (Lord knows how many football movies there have been over the years). The one thing that I liked about it being based on a true story is that it didn't end like your normal fairy tale sports story...they lost. However I think parts of it were slow and that Jacson's role carried it through some parts, not all, were boring. His performance, however, was powerful and he tried to give a powerful message to the ghetto public schools of this country."
