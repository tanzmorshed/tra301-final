","Kimberly Corman has a terrifying vision that a highway pile up will claim her life and that of her friends. Blocking the entrance with her car, Kimberly watches in horror as the crash unfolds, thus saving her life and that of the people in the queue behind her. But the grim reaper is not impressed and he's coming to claim the deaths of all those who should have died in the crash.<br/><br/>For a sequel to truly work well it has to come up with something fresh, otherwise why do a sequel eh? Well the makers of Final Destination 2 choose to use the basic same formula of the hugely enjoyable first film, only adding more black humour into the crazy death design broth. Opening with a quite horrific highway pile up, FD 2 then takes us on a journey that sees an assortment of folk offed in various and gruesome ways. The story remains the same as the first film, even though writers Bress and Gruber think they are being intricate by weaving this plot into the original story, but ultimately it's just a devilishly nonsense fun picture. Ali Larter returns for a second helping, and she in turn is joined by a bunch of no mark actors waiting for death, which is perfectly fine for the genre discerning fan.<br/><br/>This is a riot, and as long as you don't look too deep into it (why would you really?) you may just find yourself having a real good time. 7/10"
"Theo Robertson","7","17","20","8 August 2010"," Clever And Entertaining Sequel
","The original FINAL DESTINATION was a smart reworking of the teen horror film . Instead of horny teenagers getting their heads lopped off by a mad axeman in a mask , the protagonists , who are composed of a cross section of society , are stalked by the worst monster in the world - death itself . FINAL DESTINATION 2 follows the same formula <br/><br/>Kevin Williamson pointed out in one of his screenplays for SCREAM that sequels up the ante , everything has to be that little bit bigger with a higher body count and the sequel gets off to a great start with a premonition of an explosive car crash . The film's heroine Kimberly knows what's coming next so holds up the traffic saving numerous drivers from a fiery death . Unfortunately destiny doesn't like being cheated and no one will be appearing on WHO WANTS TO BE A MILLIONAIRE , the bad things that are going to happen to the protagonists will indeed be final <br/><br/>There's a term used by film critics called "" Hierarchy of image "" which , if the director lingers on an object then it has meaning to the plot . Ironically perhaps the best example of this is the television series CASUALTY where if the camera shows a chip pan then you can be sure it'll burst in to flames later in the sequence . In some ways this is a film employing the anti- hierarchy of image since it toys with the audience in to thinking they're going to see an object kill the hapless victim only for the rug to be pulled from under their feet . It's a different take on the horror film and it probably doesn't stand up to a second viewing since all the surprises are gone but it's highly entertaining the first time you see it"

","If you loved the original Final Destination, then you will almost certainly enjoy the sequel, a virtual carbon-copy of the first film, except that everything is bigger and much, much bloodier.<br/><br/>This time around, a group of travellers narrowly avoid being involved in a spectacular freeway pile-up thanks to an eerie premonition experienced by driver Kimberly Corman (A.J. Cook) as she waits on the on-ramp. Feeling cheated once again, Death alters his grand design to try and claim the lives of those who escaped his clutches. As the survivors of the accident begin to die in the order witnessed in her vision, Kimberley realises what is happening, and tracks down the sole survivor of flight 180, Clear Rivers (Ali Larter), for help.<br/><br/>Despite working with material that rarely explores new territory, director David R. Ellis directs with gusto: his freeway pile-up is an absolutely jaw-dropping piece of cinema—a brutal, bloody and disturbing set-piece—and the subsequent death scenes are masterfully orchestrated pieces of mayhem that tease the audience with several possible bloody conclusions, before delivering their always impressive pay-off (gory fatalities are caused by a falling ladder, a sheet of glass, a faulty elevator, an air-bag, a flying wire fence, and a barbecue!!!).<br/><br/>In amongst the graphic bloodletting, Ellis also finds time to throw in some very nice visual touches (such as the tree shadows which resemble clutching skeletal hands) and lots of delightfully dark humour (gotta love that final shot!). A thoroughly entertaining piece of OTT popcorn horror, Final Destination 2 gets a very respectable 7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb."

","You know that feeling you get when you're watching America's Funniest  Home Videos and the oblivious son hits his hapless father in the crotch  with an aluminum bat? It gets a quick reaction, like, ooh, I feel your  pain man.  FINAL DESTINATION 2 is a 90 minute or so string of those painful shots,  as each character one by one meets an unfortunate death by household  appliance. Bodies are slammed by trucks, heads are impaled, and limbs  fly through the air. When one of the characters dies when her car's  airbag explodes out of nowhere, I blurted ""Yeah! Wow, did they do  that??? Yeah, they DID do that. Right on!""  Although the film has a very serious atmosphere about it, what with the  creepy score and people sincerely freaking out and everything, it still  retains a campy humor about it buried beneath its high-budget exterior.  Many movies would shy away from smashing up plastic ketchup-filled  dummies, opting instead to avoid the gore. Not FINAL DESTINATION 2!  This movie is an honest approach to movie-making, hearkening back to  the day when you got together with friends and said, ""Okay, in this  scene we cut to the dummy falling off the building, it's run over by a  Mack truck, and it splatters chunks of blood all over that Oldsmobile  over there.""  As for the premise behind FINAL DESTINATION 2, how do I put it into  words? A.J. Cook has premonitions that people died in a nasty pileup on  the highway. Thing is, this never happened. And ... she continues to  have premonitions that those same people will die in due time. Those  people eventually die. Did I get that right? The universal law of  nature is that, well, Death sometimes misses its mark and has to fix  its mistakes (which usually involves electrical equipment getting wet  and other freak accidents of home improvement). If this all sounds  convoluted, watch the movie. You'll see what I mean.  The premise of FINAL DESTINATION 2, as much potential as it might have,  doesn't make much sense and is pretty hokey, but if you medicate your  inquisitive mind with heavy sedatives, you'll be able to look past the  flimsy premise and enjoy the movie. I'm definitely looking forward to a  Final Destination 3."

","I was apprehensive when I didn't Devon Sawa in the credits or this movie, but then again, this film didn't really need him. This wasn't a sequel in the purest sense, but the film makers created methods to link all of the new characters to the old ones, creating a flow which wasn't too jarring. Unfortunately, the dialogue was the only real stinker in this film. The pretentiousness, the obviousness and the downright hokiness that came out of the mouths of the characters really detracted from the tension, turning their performances into a bunch of acting class rejects. But I digress. The only thing people are looking for is how Death will get the new set of escape artists. The sheer surprise and execution of the executions made me jump and crawl. In such a desensitized world we live in, being able to jump out of my seat means this film is a winner."

","If you liked ""Final Destination"" you'll really like ""Final Destination 2"". I remember the commercials for this one and was afraid they were ruining the thrill of this sequel.  So I didn't see it in the theaters.  I was wrong. If anything the commercials used the film footage to mislead you, so that the surprises were even greater.<br/><br/>For what ""Final Destination 2"" is trying to do, they do it perfectly.  From the script, to the acting to the directing.  This was a tough score for me. While it doesn't rate up there with the the best films of all time.  In every aspect, they perfectly accomplished what they set out to do.  It's a Thriller, full of a lot of unpredictable turns and surprises, and with great action.  They wasted no time, the movie starts, they get right into it, and it keeps on at pretty much full pace until it's done."
"Stevieheuge","5","38","64","30 July 2004"," Horror makes way for humour and gore
","Final Destination was a decent film. Original idea, pretty suspenseful directing, and some death scenes that while inventive, were creepy to boot.<br/><br/>This time around, with a new director and a new approach, we get a very different film. The first movie was a horror - this is'nt. In fact its not even a thriller, its basically a load of silly dialogue acted out badly by very silly actors, with some dead people in-between. <br/><br/>The thing is, that doesn't make the movie all that bad - The deaths and the gore are the pay-offs, and great care has been taken to ensure that all of them would get a great reaction from a packed cinema theatre.<br/><br/>The car pile up at the start is bone crunchingly violent, with buckets of blood being splattered everywhere - and its very entertaining stuff.<br/><br/>
Various methods have been used here for the subsequent death scenes (CG, green screens, puppets, models) but it all cuts together very well, and most of the deaths would have your average cinema audience whooping with crimson tainted delight...<br/><br/>The impressive trickery used in killing off each character, intertwining supsense and surprise, is so effective, that many people will come away from this film forgetting that there wasn't actually anything else good about it - apart from the eye candy of course.<br/><br/>Worth a watch - you'll recoil in disgust and laugh more than you would watching most movies of this genre. try to catch it before you die."
"christian123","5","48","85","17 May 2005"," Very entertaining and better than the original
","Final Destination 2 is a very entertaining sequel and while the story is weaker then the first, the deaths are better. Kimberly (A.J. Cook) is a normal teen who is taking a road trip to Daytona with her 3 friends. She has a vision of a horrific traffic accident and so she blocks some of the cars from entering the highway. Sure enough they vision comes true and they have all just escaped death. Kim visits Clear Rivers (Ali Larter), the only survivor of Flight 180 who is convinced to help out the survivors of Route 23. Alex, who died between films, had been hit in the head with a falling brick. Kim, Clear and other strangers that are left must try to stick together and cheat Death again. The plot may sound stupid but its actually not all that bad. The story may not make sense at some scenes and the story is filled with holes. Its hard though to write a good story for something like this and I think they gave a good effort. The first film was very good and a lot of fun to watch. The sequel is even more fun to watch, even if it does get silly at times. Its better to watch the original before watching this so it would be easier to follow the story. Most horror films today are to silly to take serious and that's why you shouldn't really approach this one expecting an Oscar quality film. The acting was decent with the best being Ali Larter. She and Tony Todd are the only stars returning from the original film. A.J. Cook plays Kimberly and she does an okay job. The rest of the cast are mostly unknowns and aren't worth mentioning. David R. Ellis directs and he does really good job. He also directed the fast paced and exciting Cellular. The film is very gory and also very fun. Final Destination 2 was very creative when it came to killing off the characters. A couple of the death scenes do go over the top though the film delivers the goods for the most part. The film is only 90 minutes long so it's a quick film to watch. The movie also never gets boring as its always entertaining. I wouldn't say the film is to scary but there are some moments that may leave with fear. In the end, this is a very good sequel, that's better then the original and worth checking out. I just hope Final Destination 3 is just as good or even better then this film. Rating 7.8/10, check this film out as its very entertaining."

","A teenage girl has a premonition of a horrific traffic accident and blocks an entry road with her car. The accident happens, but all the people she prevented from entering the road, including herself, seem cursed to die to by violent freak accidents.<br/><br/>This is a very stupid movie whose only purpose is to set the characters up to get smooshed in bizarre and icky circumstances. We have people impaled in the head by ladders, beheaded by elevators, blown up at barbecues, sliced up by netting, and so on. Call me old-fashioned, but I like a movie to have a plot and characters I can get interested in. The cast of catalogue-models are uniformly wooden, except for the ever-reliable Todd, who provides a few minutes' sinister grace. The digital effects for the short-and-sudden deaths are quite imaginative but not really very interesting or plausible - people just liquefy into computer goo and they're over in about ten frames. I much prefer the good old prosthetic latex approach, which is gorier and more realistic (see Scanners, The Fury, Day Of The Dead, Robocop, etc). There is a nice score by Shirley Walker which creates some suspense, the opening highway pile-up has some great stuntwork and most of the characters have horror-film director names. However, this indicates the golden rule of film-making - if what's on the page is lame, the movie will always be a turkey."

Back when I was trying to be an actor this was the kind of movie I fantasized about being in - what could be more of a blast. I don't find movies scary generally so I can't say that I thought it was scary, but it was fun. I could watch that car crash over and over - how cool it would have been editing that. I always detested slasher horror movies - tedious and lame. As a horror movie I thought this was much more enjoyable. My Best, BDK"

","The director obviously thought that when making a sequel, everything has to be bigger and heavier. But bigger doesn't equal better, and it definitely isn't the case here. The death scenes are unnecessary gory, and only that; practically no build-up to the scenes, and little to no excitement. Unless you enjoy watching extremely bloody, gory death scenes, you won't like this movie. In fact, you will most likely hate it, unless you're a big fan of the genre, or of the first Final Destination. It's a huge gore fest, and probably made for(and maybe even by) fans of the old ""body-count"" movies, from the 1980's. It has very little realism; whereas the first Final Destination had some realism in the death scenes, this had little to none at all. As many other slasher movies, it has the little ""twist-in-the-end"" at the very end, but it is very weak, considering what it could have been. The first movie is a lot better, but if you *need* to watch a gory movie where you pretty much sit around and wait for people to die, this isn't the worst you can watch. But if the choice is between this and the first, I would definitely choose the first. 7/10"

A good cast, particularly the lead A.J. Cook. I like Ali Larter, but the film's better when the characters aren't trying to solve the puzzle, so it could of done without her. The explanation that everyone involved is suppose to be already dead, because things were altered to kill the survivors of flight 180, superb and validates the sequel's existence. That scene drags a little though, more carnage please! Those logs falling off the back of the truck and the lottery winner stuck in the garbage disposal, the finest moments. Are you not entertained!! Disagree with most of the reviews on here, this film far exceeds what the first had to offer and it isn't just a repeat. The characters aren't one-dimensional for a start.

It sort of continues from the first one, using the first movies experiences and characters.<br/><br/>In this movie, we have another disaster. This time, instead of a plane crash, it's a freeway pile- up. Kimberly and her friends are all going away for the weekend. They're driving down the highway and see all of these ironic things. Like a man driving a ""drink responsibly"" truck, whilst drinking alcohol. That's smart. We see all of these seemingly insignificant characters, and then they all die horribly and vividly in a highway crash. Then Kimberly wakes up from what just happened. She's confused, understandably, and notices everything that happened in her vision is coming true. Like the songs on the radio and other drivers. Then, before she pulls onto the highway, she stops. And doesn't get on. The people behind her, who were destined to die, also couldn't get on, with her blocking them. The the pile-up happens. And sadly, Kimberly's friends die. She tries to explain to survivors that she had a vision and of course, no one believes her. Then she goes to see Clear Rivers from Final Destination. She had checked herself into an insane asylum, for her own protection. We hear how Alex had died recently, and that's why she's in there. So she won't get hurt. She explains to Kimberly that her friends died the exact same order, as they would've on the flight. They realize that Kimberly's friends died last in her vision, but first in real life. Death is working backwards. She gathers the other survivors and she explains. Everyone is trying to keep safe, but sadly, Death doesn't give up that easily.<br/><br/>Overall, I give this movie a 10 out of 10."
"Bonehead-XL","7","2","2","7 November 2013"," Sick Kills and Gruesome Humor
","I never would have thought that ""Final Destination"" would have become one of the most enduring millennial horror franchises. The original wasn't a bad movie. It was a fairly clever update of the slasher formula which owed more then a little to ""The Omen."" (Both series dispatch their victims through convoluted Rube Goldberg-style accidental death traps.) However, it was horribly earnest and, beyond the wacky death scenes, it had little else to offer. I think the only reason the ""Final Destination"" series has had the longevity it has is because, unlike the ""Saws"" and ""Paranormal Activities,"" the series hasn't burnt itself out with yearly installment. The movies are elaborate enough to force a few years between each installment. The reason I say this is because none of the movies are all that good. Except for this one. (And part five but I'm not talking about that one right now.) And it's good the same way a ""Friday the 13th"" sequel is good. From a writing perspective, these movies are Dumb. The entire premise is kind of dumb. Lots of people survive near death experiences every year and most of them aren't brutally killed afterwards in ridiculous, contrived manners. There's a reason that, despite five films being made, none of these movies have ever attempt to build up any kind of mythology, aside from throwing out more ways to escape ""Death's design"" that most certainly do not work. It's never been said but can certainly be assumed that the psychic visions that open each film are provided by Death. So why does Death give people these vision just with the intention of then brutally murdering them afterwards? Why does Death brutally murder people anyway? It's Death! He can off you in any way! Why make such a show of it? The only real thing we can gleam from all of this is that the Grim Reaper has an utterly brutal sense of irony and is also a passive aggressive jerk hole. Tony Todd's character shows up every couple of movies to sinisterly hiss some bit of vague misinformation, as if he really knows what's going on.<br/><br/>So the story is utter nonsense. Like a ""Friday the 13th"" film, each entry in the series has the same blueprint. Character has vision of horrific accident that gorily kills loads of people, some how manages to avoid said accident, himself and his friend proceed to suffer horrible accidental deaths Or deaths that seem accidental anyway. Part two is no different. The characters aren't great. They roughly break down into stereotypes: Final girl, an initially skeptical love interest, stoner guy, snarky chick, Mom, Son, Angry Black Man. Some of the characters get a smidge of personality. Angry Black Man panics nicely. My favorite moment is when Stoner Guy knows he's the next in line to die. He tells Final Girl to, after he dies, go into his apartment and remove all his drugs and porn, anything that will ""break his mom's heart."" It is a surprisingly touching moment in a movie that otherwise dispenses with any character moments. None of the actors are bad, with one exception: Ali Larter, the returning survivor from the first movie. Holy spit, how did this lady become a star? She's wooden, wears one slightly constipated expression throughout, and can never make a single line sound convincing. The ""Resident Evil"" movies clearly deserve her.<br/><br/>None of that matters anyway because the entire movie is built around the death scenes. And, holy cow, they are incredible. The opening freeway pile-up is hugely intense. The motorcyclist sliding across the glass is uncomfortably realistic to anyone who has survived a bike crash. The entire sequence will make you nervous every time you pass a truck hauling logs. It's a heck of way to open the movie. The kitchen sequence is the first sign of the movie's darkly humorous wit. It's an over-the-top, extended game of misdirection that has an amazingly nasty, unpleasant payoff. Characters explode into ludicrous giblets with little provocation. A battering log smears a man to splattering meat and blood. In the best kill in the movie, a teenage kid is squashed by a falling plate of glass, dissipating into an explosion of blood and gore. Person one second, puddle the next. Even for a seasoned gore fan like myself, it's almost too much. The dark humor shows up again when the Jaws of Life have the opposite effect. My second favorite kills involves a flying barb-wire fence dissecting a guy into four parts. The stunted look on the guy's face is almost hilarious, even if the globs of intestine are nasty. The movie never quite tops those moments even if the hospital set last act rolls along at a decent pace. The gore comedy mentality continues into the final scene.<br/><br/>And that's why ""Final Destination 2"" is awesome. The death scenes are some of the wettest ever put to film and any mean spirit intentions are grinned away by the movie's dark wit. That's one of the reasons why three and four disappointed me so much. They returned to the dead serious tone of the first entry. Only five featured the same sick kills and gruesome humor. Hopefully the inevitable part six will continue that tradition."
"Tony-from-Austin","9","2","2","30 March 2013"," *** Spoiler *** ---> The first 20 minutes is classic film.
","** All Spoiler ** This movie all in all is maybe above average. But the first 15 - 20 minutes where we lead up to and then witness the initial car pile up is IMHO one of the most entertaining pieces of film ever. It's hard to put words to it but the wrenching up of the nerves by the filmmakers took a lot of thought and effort. Each vehicle has a little inter-related ""something-or-other"" going on that is causing anxiety in the viewer (for me anyway). And the other factors. The heavy holiday traffic. The wet pavement. Inconsiderate drivers. Teenagers not taking any of it very seriously. Then IT starts! The pile up from HELL. Oh my gosh, I can watch it over and over again. If you are a film buff and even if you hate this genre, DO NOT MISS ""the pile up""."

"acidburn-10","8","2","2","7 June 2012"," Awesome follow up
","I remember when I saw the first Final Destination movie at the cinema, and I really enjoyed it, it was something fresh new original and exciting, and when I heard that they were making a 2nd one, well at first I was a bit sceptical, but when I saw the trailers, I was excited.<br/><br/>Well the plot to this one, not all that different from the previous movie, only instead of an aeroplane, this time we get a traffic accident and the central character Kimberley (AJ Cook) has a vision much like Devon Sawa did in the first one. Only with a slight difference, this time the deaths work backwards.<br/><br/>Sequels are often associated with disappointment, as many often only manage to be pale imitations of their predecessors. The second Final Destination is anything but, as it's bigger, slicker, and altogether more fun than the original. Overall this one has a different tone to the first one, this one's more blood and a lot more gore, which is always a bonus in my eyes, another aspect is that the deaths are way over the top, which is awesome and something that was missing from the first movie.<br/><br/>The performances again doesn't fail to deliver, with yet again another group of interesting characters, AJ Cook is this time the main character and she hits all the right notes, she's resourceful and likable. Michael Landes plays it cool and low key but also comes across as likable and has great chemistry with AJ Cook. Ali Larter I enjoyed her in the first movie and I was glad they brought her back she gave a very credible performance and Jonathan Cherry plays the comic relief drug addict really well and came off as very natural.<br/><br/>All in all a brilliant follow up and companion to the first movie and them both even each other out really well."
"hnt_dnl","8","2","2","14 April 2012"," FD2 is my favorite FD sequel!
","Film franchises have become a sort of curiosity for me. Like how a new film concept comes out with an original idea and somehow it blossoms into a popular series. The Saw movies are the first ones I noticed this happening with, where the first movie was so beloved and such a surprise hit that it demanded a flurry of sequels. Harry Potter and Twilight seemed more like ""planned"" franchises, while Saw was a surprise. In the vein of Saw is the FINAL DESTINATION series of movies, of which I find a major guilty pleasure! While I still think the first one is the best, I really enjoyed this 2nd film in the series FINAL DESTINATION 2 (2003), which ironically seems to be overlooked amongst the sequels, but favor it over 3, 4, or 5, actually.<br/><br/>The first FD had a creepy horror movie gravitas that still to this day makes it the best of the series that really none of the sequels have been able to emulate. I felt like FD3 was a bit too serious and except for the leads, none of the other characters involved me like in FD1. FD4 was pure parody and juvenile, but still oddly entertaining in it's awfulness! FD5 was actually very good and I might put that one right behind FD2. I like FD2 mainly because I think it does the best job of capturing the spirit of the original FD, while having a welcome sense of humor and a wonderful ensemble cast with a lot of personality! I think of all the FD movies, I actually like the FD2 ensemble the best!<br/><br/>The leads A.J. Cook, Michael Landes, and Ali Larter (from FD1) are engaging, with Larter's presence tying things together nicely between FD1 and FD2. Cook and Larter are very personable (and extremely attractive!), while Landes is stalwart and reliable. The supporting cast steals the show, though! Jonathan Cherry (as dimwitted dope addict Rory), Keegan Connor Tracy (as vain, vampy businesswoman Kat), T.C. Carson (as wisecracking non-believer Eugene), James Kirk (as teenager Tim), Lynda Boyd (as Tim's mom) are all likable characters that I find myself rooting for even though I know what's in store for them! <br/><br/>FD2 kind of sets the stage for all other sequels being more action-oriented than the original. The series became more about characters trying to beat death than accepting their fate or just generally being creeped out, like they were in FD1. Of course, the iconic Tony Todd makes another appearance as the caretaker from hell! The first half sets the stage, while the second half really gets going when the ensemble must converge to beat death. Highly entertaining sequel!"
"david-5226","8","2","2","7 April 2011"," Worth watching for the opening scene
","Honestly. <br/><br/>The best part of this movie is the highway pileup at the beginning. I like all-types of movies, but one of my favorite things when it comes to movies that I like is a powerful, incredible, inventive action scene. How can a pileup be inventive? I can't explain it--it just is.<br/><br/>Like that bridge pileup on Mission Impossible III: incredible. <br/><br/>The rest of the movie is pretty good. But, the intro scene, though very gory and over-the-top, is very entertaining and leaves you saying ""...wow!""<br/><br/>Good stuff."

","FD 2 gets new director David Ellis and the story is literally the same as the first one where a teenage girl called Kimberly is on a road-trip to Daytona with 3 friends but on the highway she has a premonition of a massive pile up. Cue comes she freaks out and everyone who cheats death is put on a new list.<br/><br/>Ali Larter's character Clear Rivers is revived from the first one and is first found at the Stony Brook institution as the only survivor as Alex from the first dies between films (a brick dislodged itself from a building and hit him in the head) Kimberley asks for Clears help as she is still on death's list.<br/><br/>The story is nothing new though there is a connection with the people on the new list to the first one, which I liked. The deaths are still inventive and gruesome and the acting is still to a good standard. Ali Larter is the best actress of the film whilst Tony Todd the mortician from the first one reprises his role in one scene which he makes the most of and Kimberly played by A.J Cook isn't bad either.<br/><br/>This isn't a patch on the original as it's not really scary but you do feel for the characters still to some extent particularly Clear. The music is also good.<br/><br/>It's a very enjoyable hour and a half and is a very good sequel to it's predecessor. I recommend a watch if you liked the first one or are a horror fan."

","FINAL DESTINATION 2 was a pleasant surprise. Needless to say, I had no expectations for a Hollywood sequel to be any good. However, this second installment of FD franchise nearly measured up to the first movie, and is at any rate, a decent follow up.<br/><br/>A.J. Cook does a pretty good job as Kimberly, who foresees the awful destruction in a multi-car pile-up. She has just the right mix of attractiveness and believability in the main character. As others have mentioned, the death ""accidents"" are fairly inventive (I won't spoil them by listing them) and this was the best surprise in the sequel. Even if the total final movie doesn't come across as anything ""amazing"", it's still a very fun watch, and much better than most sequels in every way."
"happyendingrocks","8","2","2","16 June 2009"," ""As Good"" isn't bad
","In many ways this Final Destination installment one-ups its stylish and original predecessor. However, while the best elements are improved to dramatic effect, the returning presence of the wretchedly-named Clear Rivers brings some un-needed hokum to an otherwise feverish and thrilling dance with death.<br/><br/>The original Final Destination used benign everyday terrors to make every bit of supernatural indulgence seem utterly believable, and it is in this respect that the second chapter exceeds the original. While the plane crash in the first FD tapped into the fears of all rational people who understand that multi-ton pieces of metal shouldn't sensibly be able to fly, by setting this film in the aftermath of a disaster borne from the routine car rides we tempt death with every single day, this sequel bases its horror in roots that apply universally. After all, most of us CHOOSE to get on an airplane, but very few of us have any say in the roles that automobiles play in our everyday lives. We don't have any choice but to commute to our jobs or schools, and if a car is needed for these important functions, we have to simply accept the fact that there is a possibility that we will not make our destination due to circumstances on the road beyond our control. This is a balance we tempt every time we drive, and cars crash far more often than planes do, so the scenario in this film trumps the original sort of by default.<br/><br/>The horrific pileup that sparks this chapter's conflict with Death is by far the most harrowing and genuinely scary car accident ever seen in a film. As in the original, the details preface the carnage with sadistic glee, and the intricacies within the crash itself are as believable as they are devastating.<br/><br/>By topping the dramatic and terrifying catalyst in the first film, this sequel starts off on a promising note, and its a promise that is almost maintained throughout. After the set-up, which basically mimics the first FD, the film-makers are savvy enough to know that since there is a formula in place, the shock of the kills is going to be diluted by the sense of the familiar. Of course, the only way to counterbalance this is to make the kills themselves as spectacular and superior as the crash. This, they offer whole-heartedly.<br/><br/>While employing the same Rube Goldberg chains found in the original film, the death scenes in Final Destination 2 floor anything we've previously seen in the franchise. Both the tension and gore are amped up to grisly and boisterous effect, and the elevator and fire-escape set-pieces not only rival anything in the franchise, they are on par with the best in the horror genre. Again, by using things we see every day as tools of death, the realism the series is rooted in is kept very much intact.<br/><br/>It would be a shame to give away any particulars for anyone who hasn't seen the film, so I'll keep the grisly details in my head and off the page. But, it's a safe bet that anyone seeing this film for the first time will have fresh insight about the banality of barbed wire and car safety features when the film is finished.<br/><br/>If the film was just a series of gory and over-the-top executions, it could have easily surpassed the original in terms of sheer thrill factor. However, when the film delves too deeply into the unnecessary mythology, things get a bit silly, and the sharp tension generated through the underlying premise is diluted by the screenwriters trying to make sense out of the senseless. Don't they realize that it's scary enough that Death is stalking these ""lucky"" survivors one by one? That idea is sufficient to carry this film, but for some reason, the film-makers saw fit to muddy up this effective premise with endless postulating about why Death is chasing our cast. Death is going in reverse, and ""tying up all the loose ends""? Really? Is Death really that organized? Are we all just Power Point pie charts on Death's laptop? Somehow, it seems a bit scarier if Death is just as senseless as the brutal and heinous bits of life-ending generated in the initial car accident.<br/><br/>And why, oh, why did they bring back Clear Rivers? In addition to inducing eye-rolling every time someone says that ridiculous name, Ali Larter's character in this film is an annoying and gibbering caricature with all the credibility of a bag-lady carrying a ""The End Is Near"" sign. In the first film, she was an understated and well-played normal person dealing with extraordinary events. Somehow these events have transformed her into a raving prophet of doom who knows all of death's secrets and passes on her sage-like madness to this new batch of future victims. The dialogue fed to her is atrocious, as is her broken-soul delivery. And being introduced to her in a mental institution where she is lent so much authority you'd think she built the joint certainly doesn't help matters. (Really? Mental patients have closed-circuit television monitors in their padded rooms that allow them a view of the hallway outside their cell?). Larter's screen time is mercifully short, but in the second act, when she's allowed to run free with her ramblings, the movie slows to a mediocre crawl.<br/><br/>If the film were able to sustain the adrenalized surge it captures from the opening pileup on, Final Destination 2 would have easily outpaced the original. The deaths are certainly magnificently rendered and shocking, and the ""gotcha"" ending is a grimly hilarious, if predicable, curtain call. But, given the areas where it exceeds the first FD, I suppose it's a great accomplishment for a sequel to even be as good as the film that spawned it. At least in that sense, Final Destination 2 has to be viewed as a success."

","This was almost like a flashback to a few weeks ago when the exact same thing happened for real on Interstate 4. It wasn't a log truck, but fog and a controlled burn that caused an 80-car pileup and much burning of trucks and bodies. I could not help but think of that when I saw the incredible accident scene in this film. It could have been used as news footage.<br/><br/>This is probably only the second film in which I have seen A.J. Cook (JJ from ""Criminal Minds"") and Ali Larter (""Heroes""), but they did a credible job in a film where the story was far more important than the individual characters, none of whom rose to any significance. In fact. most were probably former WB stars. The only one I remember with any interest was Odessa Munroe.<br/><br/>But the story and the special effects and the gore and, certainly, the suspense, made this film worth watching and peaked my interest in the prequel and the sequel, although not having seen the first one does not take anything away from this one.<br/><br/>Check it out."

The result, aided by an ingenious script, was a highly entertaining film - sometimes funny, sometimes scary, sometimes just good. But it was a concept that could only really stand one examination.<br/><br/>The second film is a step too far. Once again, we see an interesting cast playing characters who are slaughtered in various imaginative ways. But at least two of the death scenarios really labor the point to the extent that, by an hour into the film, I was laughing too hard to have any energy left to suspend disbelief.<br/><br/>Not wholly unentertaining for all that, but only see this if you've nothing else to watch.

","Who ever says that a sequel can't be better or improve in the original should watch this. The original was filled with surprises and edge of the seat tension. I have never been in the cinema and have every one watching react so intently as the original. Until I saw the sequel. We all knew what to expect, but when it came it was still shocking. But this time there was the added gore factor. I like to pride myself as not being squeamish, but I was shocked by the graphic scenes of death in this film. The opening car crash is amazing. So shocking and realistic it makes you think you are in the middle of the carnage. The film makers should be congratulated for some scenes that should shock you beyond belief but are twisted to make you laugh instead of throw up. Even if you haven't seen the first one, you must go and see this. Try and close your mind to reality and immerse yourself in this amazing, shocking and often laugh out loud film."
"mattshaw","10","2","2","14 February 2003"," Rube Goldberg Killing Machines
","Any really good Horror movie walks the line between horror and comedy.  The better it does this - the better the movie.  An example would be Romero's ""Night of the Living Dead"".  FD2 does this extremely well - between the writing and the editing it creates tension and suspense very effectively. The Horror is graphic and disturbing.<br/><br/>The problem when you successfully straddle that horror/comedy line is the possibility of falling off the other side.  For the first 30 minutes the movie is really successful at connecting chains of events that seem almost independently sentient.  A coffee cup becomes a potential accomplice in Death's plan.  <br/><br/>After 30 minutes one begins to see humor in mayhem.  By the end of the movie and the not surprising ""denouement"", my wife and I (and the theater)were rolling in the aisles with laughter.  ""Scary Movie"" wanted this response but settled for sight gags and in-jokes.  I did not expect much from this movie, but was very impressed with the unintentional effect.  I will now see the first movie in the series, just to see more work by this team.  It is true that some did not laugh, but most were holding their sides.  It would not be fair to suggest that they rerelease this as a comedy since it is also effective as horror.  I also do not want to belittle the talents of David R. Ellis or the writers of the story and screenplay, J. Mackye Gruber, Eric Bress and also Reddick.  These guys are masters of the genre! <br/><br/>

"blueazures","Null","2","2","4 February 2003"," I was actually impressed
","Note, this is only my opinion; and the first movie (Final Destination) is one of my two favorite movies. I was setting myself up for disappointment with this sequal. as anybody should do with any sequal. Especially if the directing is being done by someone else. But I was in fact surprisingly impressed with this one for a few good reasons.<br/><br/>1) It had the same tone as the first movie; death was still a presence of fate and destiny, instead of some super natural force<br/><br/>2) You wernt cheated out of any death- note: do not see this movie if you dont like blood. It isnt gory like guts, slime, or Evil Dead kinda gross. However, it is realistically bloody, which would explain people leaving after the second person dies.<br/><br/>3) The opening scene is amazing!- I can't drive without being a little concerned about getting into an accident. (Im convinced im going to die in a car accident anyways, but thats another story) Its just so realistic and you never think of it being like that when you see one on the news.<br/><br/>4) This Movie had no mercy! - So much emotional attatchment to the charecters. You like most of them and really want them to live. You can relate to them.<br/><br/>5) I dont think the acting was bad at all - Sure it was a bunch of no name actors and actresses in it, but so was the first. They all did a very decent job and how can anyone complain about these people after seeing Keanu Reeves in any of his movies. I was especially impressed with Nora's charecter and the job she did performing it. I think they were all done well and I'm in love with Ali Larter. (She's gonna marry me)<br/><br/>6)I was shocked over and over - remember Terry Chaney getting hit by the bus in the first one? Okay they're all like that. Through the whole movie I sat there with my mouth open saying ""oh my god"". And I wasnt the only one. Again though, be prepared, most horror movies have comic relief so the audience isnt totally traumatized; this doesnt. Well it has a few subtle and tactfully done things but its not enough to lessen the impact of the shock factor this movie gives you. I am forever desensitezed to violence now. This movie is anything but predictable. My friends would say, ""Oh I know whats gonna happen next"", which would shortly be followed by, ""oh my God!""<br/><br/>7) There was a good story to it - of course its gonna follow the same idea as the first. But it does add more depth this time and an interesting point about flight 180's original survivors and how them getting off didnt necessarily only effect their lives, but other peoples as well. Though this could have been presented better in the movie (it was kinda cheesy at the time) it worked very well with the plot and tied the new cast with the original story very nicely. It wasnt just a new premonition, new poeple who have nothing to do with the original story, and no reason for dieing.<br/><br/>Now, I of course dont think this movie is perfect. As with any movie, if I had the chance to change a few things, I would. (Actually given the chance to change Tim Burton's 'Sleepy Hollow' I wouldnt because I think it's perfect the way it is.) But there are no more things with this sequal I would change then there are with the original it branched of off.<br/><br/>
-I think Shirley Walker did an awesome job on this score, but I liked the original better -There is one scene where things tended to happen for no reason, they should have taken the time to show causes for these things, instead of them just happening. But it only happened in one case. -Ali Larter's charecter is so different. But even this is justified after all she's been through alot. -They should have gone into a little more detail or emphasis on what happened to Devon Sawa's charecter, Alex. They made it seem like they were bitter that he didnt agree to do the movie and avoided having to explain him as much as possible. So they killed him with a brick. (Dont worry, that doesnt spoil anything) -The reactions of the cast when someone dies doesnt seem all that realistic. Sometimes it does, but the first had better reactions. (exmpl... Clear throwing up after Billy dies and Carter p***ing his pants when the train is about to hit him) But in this one they scream of course, but it usually only seems to be one person reacting. Even as a bystander, if I were to see any one of these poeple die I would throw up, curl into the fetal position, and cry. Let alone if I had any emotional attatchment to them.<br/><br/>So yeah, this movie is good. Thanks to anyone who actually made it to the end of this. And I dont think they left it open for another movie to be made any more then the first did. Which Im sure it didnt intend to otherwise they wouldve signed Devon onto a contract to come back instead of killing him with a brick and telling us about it in a news article. This movie is good and worth seeing. Im sure it exist for the sole purpose of making money off the tail of the first, but at least it doesnt come off that way.<br/><br/>-Mike-"

The storyline of FD2 closely ties in with the first, as if the people in the first one hadn't gotten off that plane, the people in part 2 would already be dead in the first place.  This movie takes place one year after the first, even though it has been almost three years after the original. Things happen in reverse as a way to tie up the ""loose knots"" that the first Final Destination opened up, sort of like an outward ripple in Death's design.

Larter returns from the first film in a supporting role and Tony Tood also return for this sequel in a cameo.<br/><br/>DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer (also in Pan & Scan) and an strong-Dolby Digital 5.1 Expanded Surround Sound (Also in DTS 6.1 ES Digital Audio). DVD has an commentary track by the filmmakers, an amusing behind the scenes featurette, deleted scenes and more. This film is from a story by J. Mackye Gruber, Eric Bress & Jeffery Reddick. The Screenplay is written by Gruber & Bress, which they are best known for directing their film ""The Butterfly Effect"". This is one of the best fantasy/horror/thriller/sequel out there. Do not miss this guilty pleasure sequel. (****/*****)."
"KingLouie","6","12","23","15 July 2005"," Carnage. Although predictable and a bit campy.
","The dialogue seems to make this movie a little cheesy, but it is still surprisingly entertaining. I have not seen the the first ""Destination 1"", so I can't comment on comparison's between the two at this point. I had seen this movie by chance and knew nothing about it. It started off okay, then quickly got into to the main ""substance"" of the movie, which I can fairly accurately describe as ""carnage"". This is definitely a movie for fans of gore. It's not particularly scary, but has a type of ""tale of the crypt"" feel to it. I found it not particularly funny, but still amusing. There was one scene that had me reminiscing about a scene from the movie ""Cube"". It's not for you if you're looking for romantic comedy or something like that. Also not for you if you're expecting elaborate plot twist thriller. Also, there is no ""skin"" in this flick, but they do throw in the customary blonde chick. Anyway, I definitely put this as above average on my list of ""B"" movie ""sleepers"" (meaning under-rated and surprisingly good). So, my rating is based on that."
"krissikrissa","3","6","10","24 July 2010"," Is it wrong to like death scenes?
","I am going to get straight to the point because we all know where this is going. Final Destination 2 is a really bad movie in most areas and she doesn't really try to hide it. Acting, direction, script, just name it, it's all bad in the words strongest meaning. In some places she is like the earlier film, innocent fun and pretty cool death scenes even though the quality is a bit low.<br/><br/>Final Destination 2 Is just the most pointless sequel to a movie ever! She connects to the first one a little bit but not a lot happens with the plot they just keep picking them off, one at a time and most of it repetitive. Sometimes you even feel you're watching the first one again -- only with funnier (yes I said funnier) death scenes This film is not as entertainingly dark as the first one (Not like that's a surprise -- former X-files guys behind that one). Rather boringly bright and that dragged the movie a little down in the ratings for me. But most of the work goes into the disgustingly awesome kill scenes and nothing else unfortunately. Maybe that doesn't sound appropriate but it's all apart of the Final Destination ride and if you don't like it, get of it! The accidents scenes are a lot better here then in the earlier film but over all this is a mild disappointment with a couple of laughs.<br/><br/>But how can you not laugh at the final death scene? Had to mention it! 3/10"

","I really liked the first Final Destination movie and I think this one blew it out of the water. I have to say some of actors are pretty bad but the idea is fun and they always think of new crazy ways to kill people.<br/><br/>This movie is about a young girl who has a vision on a highway that ultamitly ends up saving a few peoples lives. They are all grateful to be alive but soon end up dieing one by one as they think something didn't want them to survive in the first place.<br/><br/>This was a very solid sequel, really entertaining and fun to watch. It had you sitting on the edge of your seat and the deaths were hilariously gruesome."
"thesar-2","8","3","4","19 February 2011"," Death on the Highway
","In one of the best openings, or scenes I've watched, Final Destination 2 takes the lead immediately. Typically, this is where I generally say: ""And then it went south from there"" or ""It got progressively worse.""<br/><br/>Thankfully, noit didn't. For horror franchise fans, this was comparably to how Scream 1 and 2 panned out, in regards to quality, intelligence, surprises, keeping it fresh and making a film as equal, if not superior to the original.<br/><br/>There's a new girl in town, and she's lookingat Death. Kimberly's (Cook) about to start a fun weekend with her clichéd friends when all-of-a-sudden (not really, if you've seen part 1) she has a vision of a massive pileup on the forthcoming highway killing her and scores of others. When she comes to, she blocks the cars behind her from entering the highway and this draws attention of police officer Thomas (Landes, one-time Jimmy Olsen).<br/><br/>As stated/spoiled by mentioning the series original film, the crash does take place, though there are several ""survivors"" thanks to Kimberly's quick thinking. While they're a bit and reasonably shaken up, Kimberly puts the pieces together knowing that this exact thing happened one year prior.<br/><br/>And again, as the ""survivors"" die in incredibly new and creative ways, the new cast uses the old to help through this mess: Clear Rivers (Larter) and Bludworth (Todd.)<br/><br/>I'm really making this out to be a rehash, and for the most part it is. But, the ""new"" explanation/revolution is not only thoroughly thought out, but kept the series (ONLY TO THIS SEQUEL) fresh and inventive. Also, Larter up'd the ante, much like what Linda Hamilton did for Sarah Connor in Terminator 2: Judgment Day. So it was nice to not only see her again, but see how much she's grown as an actress by this point.<br/><br/>I've said it before, in regards to Part One, the rest of the case did what was required of them and the movie was well-made and highly creative, though – again – hokey at times. It's recommended to make it a double feature with the first one, even though it even works as a stand-alone film. And finally, as I mentioned, the extremely detailed opening wreck scene is worth the entire viewing."
"cutie_mcpretty","7","3","4","22 March 2008"," In death there are no escapes... Well this film proves that
","I am a huge fan of the final destination movies and had seen the first and the third and thought I better fill in the gap and watch this one. I enjoyed it a lot. The car pile up that happens at the beginning was amazing to watch, because it was explosion after explosion and crash after crash, it was just non stop. After that it seemed to slow down a bit though, until we got to Evan Lewis' death. His death is definitely the most tense, which is a shame because it would've been a nice ending death, but it was the first. With his death you just never know when he's going to die, because there are so many things he can die from and then he dies in the way you least expect. His death is so tense, every move he made and every little thing he did I was almost screaming at the screen telling him not to. Most deaths as well you never see coming and if you do see them coming you don't think they're going to turn out the way they do. It's great stuff to watch for the first time, because you're looking for the clues and almost talking to the characters. For me the actors could've been cast a bit better. Bringing back Clear Rivers was definitely the best thing they could've done. If she wasn't in it, the acting would've let the film down. Sadly the character worst cast was the main girl, Kimberly. Her reactions to some of the deaths was way to unemotional. A person on deaths list gave a long moving speech to her about her throwing away anything of his that would break his mothers heart after he died, then she witnesses him getting sliced into three or four parts by a wire fence and all she can do is raise her hand to her mouth for about two seconds and not look shocked at all. For me the acting wasn't great coming from her, but the film was still great. Overall a highly enjoyable film, and best of all was how largely it linked back to the first, mentioning all the past characters names and having pictures of them everywhere, I really liked that effect. This film is better than the first, but not as good as the third, but if you love the final destination series, there is nothing not to like about this film."
"poolandrews","8","3","4","20 January 2007"," Great sequel.
","Final Destination 2 starts as Kimberly Corman (A.J. Cook) & three of her friends set off for Denver, while on the highway Kimberly foresees an accident in which she, her friends & several other people die. Kimberly is shook up by the vision & refuses to carry on, as she is spoken to by officer Thomas Burke (Michael Landes) on the side of the road the huge accident she foresaw happens. She is saved although her friends still get killed while several other people who were supposed to die in the accident are also prevented from death by being held up behind Kimberly's car. Everyone just assumes that they were extremely lucky & that's that, but later that day Evan Lewis (David Paetkau) who was supposed to die in the highway pile-up is killed in a freak accident. Kimberly starts to have more visions as she foresees the death's of the people she saved, the people who were supposed to die & the people who seemingly cheated death. But death won't be cheated & if your time is up, your time is up...<br/><br/>Directed by David R. Ellis I thought Final Destination 2 was a throughly entertaining film & a worthy sequel. The script by J. Mackye Gruber & Eric Bress does what every good sequel should, it takes the original premise, elaborates on it, makes everything more spectacular & cranks things up a notch while being a fine film in it's own right. The basic Final Destination (2000) story is here, in fact in some ways you could call it as much a remake as a sequel as the two films are virtually the same but I found it great to watch as things get off to a spectacular start with a terrific highway pile-up & then the rest of the film as death catches up with the protagonists, I liked the way the accidents happen & the intricate build-ups to them with all manner of coincidences that lead to the unfortunate victims demise. Having said that things do turn a little silly at the end as it becomes too supernatural with things moving on their own, doors being jammed & these scenes felt too deliberate & not down to random chance or coincidence. There are some clever references to the original, the character's are good & pretty likable & as a whole I thought it was a throughly entertaining & watchable film that moves along at a great pace.<br/><br/>Director Ellis does a great job & he builds the tension up in the run up to the kills very effectively. There are plenty of other fun film references including some of he character's being named after various horror directors. The kills are cool & quite graphic, the pile-up has someone lose their head via a huge log, someone is squashed to a bloody pulp, there's a decapitation, someone gets a spike through their head, someone is sliced up by barb wire, someone gets a ladder impaled in their eye & there's a pleasing amount of blood. The special effects are very good with the initial pile-up being particularly impressive.<br/><br/>With a supposed budget of about $26,000,000 Final Destination 2 is extremely well made & has that Hollywood polish about it. The acting is OK & a special mention goes to Keegan Connor Tracy as Kat whom I rather fancied...<br/><br/>Final Destination 2 is a top film that I enjoyed immensely & it's as simple & straight forward as that. Definitely recommend, another sequel Final Destination 3 (2006) has been made."
"Boba_Fett1138","7","3","4","8 June 2006"," More of the same creatively put together.
","In this case, more of the same, is not a bad thing. Basically the movie its plot is just the same as in ""Final Destination"", only with different characters and settings this time. I however feel that the Final Destination franchise is one of the few horror-movie franchises that can have multiple sequels, without loosing any of its power or originality. The concept of the movie can be used over and over again; a person has a vision of an upcoming accident which will lead to the death of several people. Thanks to that vision the person prevents himself/herself and others from dying. They cheat death but the death eventually catches up with them again, as every person that should had died during the accident, dies one by one.<br/><br/>""Final Destination"" had a plane crash, ""Final Destination 2"" has a highway pileup. Sounds smaller and less impressive but it really isn't. The car crashes are massive and awesomely choreographed and filmed. It truly honestly is one of the very best and certainly most spectacular car crashes out of cinema history. You have to see it to believe it. <br/><br/>It's one of the things in the movie that makes it obvious that this time they had a far bigger budget to spend, compared to the first movie. Not only the beginning is more spectacular, also the deaths later on in the movie are better constructed and especially better looking and more graphic. The story and concept of the movie might not be original anymore but the death certainly are. It makes ""Final Destination 2"" a wonderful sequel that still can be original and surprising, even when you've already seen the first movie.<br/><br/>The movie however makes a crucial mistake. Basically the movie has a fresh story with new characters and settings but yet it feels the need to constantly refer to the events in the first movie and even bring back a character from the first movie. A quick reference to the events in the first movie would have sufficed but instead the movie heavily relies on the events of the first movie. It makes the movie a bit hard and less understandable to watch for persons who haven't seen the first movie. Basically every Final Destination movie should be a movie on its own, with new characters and settings every time. I haven't seen part 3 yet but I hope they haven't made the same mistake there.<br/><br/>But really, who cares about the story in a movie like this. Basically all that makes this movie good and original are the deaths that are featured in it. They are extremely graphic and quite brilliantly put together. You just never know what is going to happen, which helps to make the sequences tense as well as scary. It doesn't really matter that the characters aren't really interesting and the story is quite unlikely and far fetched at certain moments.<br/><br/>An highly recommendable horror sequel but perhaps only if you've also seen the first movie.<br/><br/>7/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"joshwalt2","1","8","16","29 January 2006"," simply depressing
","I enjoyed the first final destination, and went to see this one in the theater. The idea was no longer novel, so they had to go with a lot more gore in order to attempt to keep it fresh. It didn't work, and I honestly was saddened that anyone would consider what I was watching to be entertainment. Fr'instance, a boy being crushed to death by a giant glass plate while his mother watched. Yeah. That's just not funny. And with the scene where all the main characters are supposed to die, where a log-carrying semi truck accidentally dumps its load, I'm now pretty paranoid when I drive near any trucks on the highway. Especially if they are carrying logs. Does that make it legitimately scary? I'd say more disturbing than scary. This was the worst movie experience I've had this side of Freddie Got Fingered."
"shark-43","6","5","9","20 August 2005"," Silly Sequel, Impressive Gore
","Again, another surprise hit at the box office so Hollywood tries to squeeze a sequel out of it. Well, given that that isn't a very good idea and that this movie will pretty much be a retread of the first one (which I enjoyed - especially the beginning but ""Death"" became absolutely ridiculous at the end - going through these preposterous ways to try and kill these teenagers)BUT this movie KNOWSthat it is a sequel and that it is silly so yes, the movie and the script are pretty lame BUT what this movie has is some of the most impressive gore and special effects I have seen in a big studio film in a long time. In fact, the opening highway accident is incredibly well shot and set up and the actually violence and trauma of the collisions are breathtaking. Plus once the doddering plot gets going and you are just waiting for the ""survivors"" to bite it, well, the actual deaths are, again, very well done. Now does good gore make a good movie - no. But it certainly makes for a hoot to watch with some of your buddies. Nuff said."
"pilsjov","1","7","15","6 July 2005"," Bad story scares viewers with blood
","Well, I've expected a lot more from final destination sequel, at least some really scary scenes. When I say Scary, I don't think of tons of blood and flesh flying around. Whole horror part is based on flesh & blood, so it looks like sitting in a butcher shop. At least final destination had some quite good story, this time story isn't so bad, but acting, effects, twists are silly.<br/><br/>And beside director's fixation with blood and body parts, things that irritated me the most are sound effects, which are some 30-40 decibels louder than the normal tone, so if you watch movie with some stronger speakers keep remote control close.<br/><br/>After this sequel, I'm not so interested in watching the next sequel."
"landslide078","Null","7","15","2 February 2003"," Better then the first? Hardly!
","Were you people even watching the same movie?<br/><br/>The original was way creepy.  The forshadowing to the deaths was much more effective.  Yes, the death scenes in the second one were pretty gruesome, but that doesn't make it better.<br/><br/>Actually, I didn't mind it that much.  It was pretty bad though.  I thought the idea that everyone from the 2nd was somehow tied to the deaths of the first was lame.  They really didn't need to make those connections to make a sequel.  They could have simply made all the people in the second have some kind of brush with death without it being connected.  It's called a concept sequel, but, like Blair Witch 2, it's obvious people don't understand concept sequels that well.<br/><br/>I don't like how the second one was such a comedy of errors, as a friend pointed out in the theatre.  Everything in the second one seemed just thrown together instead of being well calculated like the first.<br/><br/>As I said, I enjoyed the second one for it's crap factor, as opposed to the first which I enjoyed because it was actually good.  The second film just lacked the polish the first one had."
"dbdumonteil","5","5","10","3 June 2006"," death like time's got her own plans 2
","Many horror movie fans were pleasantly surprised by the discovery in 2000 of ""Finale Destination"". Its author, James Wong who cut his teeth on the X-Files saga (I'm not a fan at all of this series) had made a killing with this classy B movie which encompassed teenage, slasher, fantastic and horror movie in the same package. The viewer remembered of the invisible but omnipresence of death which was adamant about her plans and desperately tried to kill one after the other, this bunch of students led by Alex who tried to thwart her plans. It paid off well since this mix met the public's approval. So, in the wake of this little triumph, the nearly inevitable follow-up was De Rigueur.<br/><br/>At first sight, ""Final Destination 2"" seems to have the essential elements to have thumbs up from the audience. First, the multiple crash is impressively filmed. The director David R. Ellis who was a stunt-man and partly responsible for some action sequences in ""the Matrix Reloaded"" (2003) could show his expertise to film this vertiginous sequence. But his certain talent for directing can also be felt here and there throughout Kimberly's efforts to subvert death's plans. Then, there's a palpable, taut scenario. Many horror flicks today rely on special effects as the backbone of the film. Okay, there are rather flashy special effects here but used only when necessary. The moments during which death tries to take away the unfortunate victims are set with clockwork precision and announced with foreboding signs. Macabre humor is also more than acceptable but as the film is much more gore than the first chapter, it is not really for the faint-hearted. So, it's an enticing menu and one figures that one wouldn't want to shelve ""Final Destination 2"" in the messy department of useless sequels.<br/><br/>But if one takes a closer look, one realizes that Ellis' film is merely a photocopy of its first edition. The strengths of the film also constitute its weaknesses. Weaknesses because the qualities which contributed in cementing the first installment in its place of winner are rehashed here without novelties. The starting point and its development are identical as the thrust of the first film: to try at all costs to outsmart death's sinister intentions which isn't prepared to accept this and that's all. The surprise effect is absent and in short, you take the same old people with adequate replacements. So, the pile-up superseded the plane crash. Then, it seems that the authors tried to justify the making of this second chapter by linking the present story to a connection with the story of the first flick (check the sequence in the middle of the film when the ill-fated ones talk about the bunch of students in the first film). But in spite of these attempts and new tricks displayed by the scenarists to try to give the story substance, it's a run-on-the-mill fantastic film.<br/><br/>If you really enjoyed the first opus, then this may be your cup of tea. If you liked it without hailing it as a miracle, you can pass by. What's the point of watching the same story again with minor changes? And the end leaves the door open for a third episode which opened early this year. Is it any good?"
"jellyneckr","Null","4","8","19 January 2006"," One of the worst sequels ever!
","It is common knowledge that sequels are almost never as good as their originals. However, few look as bad when compared to their originals as FINAL DESTINATION 2 does. The first FINAL DESTINATION was an intelligent and well done horror flick that had an interesting premise, clever death sequences, and good performances. None of that is to be found in this sequel. This one is all about horrible acting, atrocious writing (listening to the dialog is painful to the ears), and lazy directing. *SPOILER* But my biggest beef with the flick comes with the fact that Clear is killed off towards the finale. I have often said that it is a clear indication (no pun intended) that a series is in desperate need of retooling when all or most the main characters from the original are dead. Hopefully FINAL DESTINATION 3 won't be as stale. 3/10"

It felt like it was bordering on making fun of itself at many points, which would've saved the film a bit, but it didn't take the extra step to cross into that territory. The dialogue is completely laughable, and when it is good, isn't held in the spotlight as it should be. The spotlight of this movie, instead, is its gruesome gore, which at most times was portrayed in such a way as to almost make you chuckle at its lunacy.<br/><br/>The actors who portray these poorly developed characters are faces you will forget as soon as you leave the theater. They are so bland and fit into such generalities that every actor will remind you of a friend or neighbor.

The cast is one of the worst assembled in any wide release film in recent memory.  Sure, the death special effects are top of the line, but who cares?

FD2 packs more ferocious,spooky atmosphere into an exciting rollercoaster ride that is pure Horror-thriller entertainment.<br/><br/>The cast of survivors is a better & more interesting bunch of characters this time around & none of them are too annoying & all give fine little performances for a fun-Thriller like this.

That sequence is terrifying & probably the most iconic & memorable scene in the entire franchise.<br/><br/>Final Destination 2 is basically just good gory-fun,a good night's entertainment especially if your a Horror genre fan like myself!!!
The kills are creative & brutal & the film itself feels better made than the others in the franchise & I'm fine only owning this film from the series because it's easily the best one.

","The makers of FD obviously realized they had a great gimmick on their hands, so along came FD 2 with its spectacular opening scene involving a multiple car pileup on the interstate. The rest of the movie is just more deaths, done in various clever ways. One, involving a boy and a piece of plate glass, is the film's best killing. Ali Larter is back from the first movie, as that film's sole survivor. While she has little to do, her presence allows for a direct connection to the first film. The main reason for seeing this movie is the car pileup. It is amazing, and I haven't the slightest idea how they filmed some of it, other than to assume it must have taken a week to shoot. Gorehounds may enjoy some of the killings in this bloody flick, but it doesn't begin to approach the SAW series for true gore. It is more in keeping with THE OMEN in that sense. Recommended primarily for the opening scene."

Where the original had endearing characters, here we have shallow and unintresting characters.<br/><br/>The film is rife with musical cues that foreshadow exactly what will happen. When the horror occurs in the movie it feels just plain silly. It seems the filmmakers didn't take themselves seriously. Basically the film is a cheap attempt to cash in on the original.

"Han-10","Null","1","1","28 October 2003"," A Lame Sequel to a Lame Original
","*Spoilers, discusses plot points*<br/><br/>After the initial car crash scene, I understood what I was in for.  Pure ridiculous mayhem, completely hilarious because it's so over-the-top and unrealistic.  Also clear, this movie wouldn't scare me at all.  Terrible dialogue and generic characters.  There's also no genuine sense of dread that follows the characters around.  They just move from one plot point to the next seeming to forget all about the young boy (for example) they saw splattered into an oblivion by a falling sheet of glass (and by the way, after the said young boy had been under debilitating gas and almost choked to death in the dentist's office moments before, he sure goes after those pigeons with clear-headed gusto).  These characters are so one-dimensional that it's hard to imagine any of them existing beyond their scenes in the film.  The only fun to be had is in the gruesome death scenes - so overboard and gory, and half the fun is pointing out all the stupidity leading up to them.  The deaths occur in such absurd ways that it's impossible to be frightened - it reminds me of the violence in South Park.<br/><br/>Overall, there's no successfully created mood or atmosphere.  It's just plot and deaths.  The characters arrive upon illogical conclusions to move to the next plot point.  You can't feel anything for the characters or get behind them emotionally, so you are unaffected by the deaths (except for laughter).<br/><br/>So when you don't believe in any of the characters, or the situations presented, you can't place the intended themes into any Real Life context, and you're watching a movie that's not scary.  You don't feel like Death is following the characters - Death would be more subtle.  Hey! Subtly! That may have made this scarier.<br/><br/>The movie is humorous, but I'm still debating whether it's intentional.  It has to be.  It looks like they had too much fun making the death scenes. They are the best parts of the film, while at the same time they take away from it.  It's horrible overall, but there are some parts you gotta see.  I recognize the entertainment value here, but my grade is based on the movie's (lack of) success in achieving any suspense or horror.<br/><br/>Grade: D-"

","At first I was very positive about this movie. Since the first part was pretty good, I thought I could expect a nice movie from this one too. But, as I should have known, this was a bad sequel as well. Bad dialogs, a lot of errors in the story, and even more stupid gore. Come on, a barbed wired fence that just flies trough a guy's body? Are you serious :S After watching it for an hour and somewhat minutes they find the ultimate solution to get death of their back and be happy forever. Even I could have thought up a better story. The cast wasn't very good either, a lot of inexperienced actors who just didn't know how to act in a situation like this, it looked like a really low budget film (don't know if it actually is :P) I hope they did better in FD3, and did not just made a clone of the other parts (only worse :P) and linked it to Final Destination 1 a bit."

","This movie is a far cry from the original. The first movie was willing to give us ways for people to die that were at least plausible. Apparently, we can only assume that death has gotten lazy in the second movie, and has become a huge fan of gore. Any decent acting and writing give way to the utterly absurd ways of people getting killed, not to mention the failed circular logic of how the little boy is ""destined"" to die at the end, considering he would never be in trouble if the people who survived would not have survived to begin with.<br/><br/>Also... ground electrical plugs do NOT spark like that, AND pure oxygen, while flammable, would NOT explode in such an absurd fashion. I mean, dang writers... were you just too lazy?

","To put this out in the open, I have seen the first Final Destination and thoroughly enjoyed it. It had a great plot that made you worry about your own life and made you realize how everything could kill you. The deaths in the first 'Destination' were easily possible and had just the right amount of violence to scare you. Overall, a good film. Now, Final Destination 2 is absolute crap with a rehashed plot where the directors throw in the baby-being-born addition which ruins the plot to a horrific extent but that is the least of this movie's problems. I agree that the deaths were quite imaginative in this movie but some were just too improbable to be believable and many of the deaths were so gory that you had to turn away (when a man gets his eyes gouged out by a ladder: yuck!; a boy is flattened by a pane of glass and blood sprays everywhere as his head is smashed down into him: what the @$#&!; and lastly, a women freaks out in an elevator and gets her head caught in the door (we all know what happens next) so the elevator ascends up and proceeds to smash her neck while she is spewing blood from her mouth, screaming that she doesn't want to die: totally uncalled for) and other parts where the gore is so over-the-top that you cannot help but laugh (such as when a man has a barbed wire fence launched through him and he is diced into multiple pieces that tumble to the ground, with entrails flailing in his stomach area: it is like an NC-17 Looney Tunes show!). There were only two deaths that were genuinely scary or at least weren't so gory as to be psychotic and those were: when the women has a pipe driven through her seat and it misses her but minutes later the airbag activates and slams her head onto the spike (makes you wonder why we have those), and the beginning scene with the pileup is truly breathtaking. If you are coming to the movie for plot, script, or good characters, DO NOT see this movie because it may very well kill you. If you want a movie to show the kids, for the love of God: DO NOT show them this movie! (Maybe try a PG movie, but if you must see an R movie:(assuming it is now in 2004-05) go see the original Passion of the Christ, it is nowhere near as grotesquely violent as this and it has a point to the violence) But if you are looking for an extremely violent and pointless movie and think impalement and decapitation are cool, you might be pleasantly surprised by how much this will fulfill your needs. NOTE: after enjoying this movie, please report to your local Psych Ward for examination."

The first scene plays out very well, but I hated the guy on tv talking about death (only the kids should know, nobody believed them in the first). The car crash is excellent, creepy and atmospheric, and after that it goes downhill. The frequent prominations are annoying (what happened to the signs?) and most deaths are way too stupid and gory (The fence part, The kids death..) and the when Claire opens the door and gets charred, the fx they put in looks horrible! This has none of the original FD goodness (whats with all the prominations? Is she psychotic?). It does tie up some lose ends, but really creates more than that.

","There are some movies, such as Saving Private Ryan and Schindler's List, in which violence is used appropriately as part of the plot to add to the tone of the movie. Not so for this corny flick.

The best scary movies (such as The Shining) don't rely on dumb disgusting special effects like this one does.<br/><br/>You might enjoy this movie if you're sadistic or a fan of cheesy horror movies, but otherwise I would recommend avoiding it.

","Throughout the entire movie, I kept thinking: Death comes in all forms. Why must it kill so violently and abnormally? Come on, a sheet of glass crushing someone to death? Electrical wires from a fence slicing you into pieces? The shower cord strangling you to death? You're alcoholic beverage leaving condensation and setting your place on fire and allowing for a butcher knife to kill you? Come on! They could've gotten cancer, heart attacks, sickle-cell anemia. I mean there are plenty of ways to die. Death is not this psycho that has to kill you violently in order to maintain its ""grand"" design. Now, someone might say, QueenMakeda84, there's no point to the movie if they all died like that. Exactly my point! There shouldn't have even been a movie because the way Death is presented is super-de-duper whack.<br/><br/>And what was with the eerie black mortician? Who really gets into it like that? I like Tony Todd too, but this is not the way to go after being on Hercules and Xena. I mean, the guy was like a Shakespearean actor in a kindergarten play. Take it down a notch. And furthermore, his character was severely unnecessary. They could've googled for all that information. He seemed more like someone from Conan than of the 20th century along with the rest of the cast. And A.J. Cook, I loved you in ""Higher Ground"", but you're slipping with this movie. Don't get me wrong, you played the insecure girl with freaky death premonitions well, but you're better than this. I guess times are hard. Ali didn't even seem to wanna be there and I don't blame her. I think she was just waiting to be blown to pieces at the end of the movie and was hurrying it along as much as possible to get out of this disaster of an idea.<br/><br/>The movie honestly tried, but it couldn't bite the cheese. Maybe it was supposed to be stupid, but for my money, I better get a moral to the story or some laughs along the way. I got neither.

Even if I don't like a film and I say so, I try my hardest to write at least something positive about it.<br/><br/>For me even though this film wasn't too bad it really shouldn't have been made. Granted it was pretty obvious that a sequel was going to be made given the cliffhanger ending of the previous movie but I didn't expect this. I thought it would concentrate more on Clear and Alex rather than just bringing in a whole new cast and list of people to kill. Should have known.<br/><br/>The cast was not bad but unfortunately they were given very little to do with their characters. Aside from Kimberly and the police officer none of the new additions were developed properly. I couldn't feel sorry for them when they got killed off.<br/><br/>Now that I'm done criticizing I can discuss the good parts. Overall this film is still good. It lost some of the creepiness that the first one possessed but regained a bit with the appearance of the mortician. He was great the first time around and was just as good here.<br/><br/>Kimberly was also a nice addition. She was done very well having been portrayed wonderfully by A.J. Cook and I enjoyed watching her. I would have felt bad if she died.<br/><br/>I can say as well that the way death was working backwards was interesting. Certainly not something that I saw coming.<br/><br/>I didn't however approve of them killing Alex and Clear. They were my favorites and needn't have died.<br/><br/>Despite that though it's not that bad of a film. The acting is mostly good and the deaths while a bit over the top are creative and interesting.

What they did with 'Final Destination 2' reminded me a little of what they did with 'Hannibal'. Just more blood and gore. I must say, especially in the first half hour, it works. The opening sequence looks great and bloody and when the first survivor finds his death you heard a lot of 'aaargh' in the theater. Probably what the makers had in mind. After this it gets a little boring and very much the same and of course totally stupid, but I was entertained, sort of.<br/><br/>There are some terrific scenes here. Not because they are that great but because they work exactly the way she should. One in particular that involves a dentist made the theater pretty noisy.

","Death is already showing to be unbearably formulaic and we're only two movies into this franchise. It looks, unfortunately, like the established formula is going to be the same for every single film: premonition, prevention, and consequences. Yawn.<br/><br/>At the very least, this sequel acknowledges the film that came before it, taking what was started with the endlessly fun and suspenseful Devon Sawa original and trying to continue the story, which most slasher sequels don't bother to do.<br/><br/>The kills in this one are just as inventive, fun and - in some cases - shocking as the original one, even if they are beginning to feel a little like more of the same already. This film can still entertain with its kills.<br/><br/>It's also interesting the way the filmmakers chose to end these films with shock-induced comedic moments surrounding Death.<br/><br/>This film will appeal to anyone who liked the first one; as a stand-alone, it really doesn't offer much.

","Ok, so now we're already familiar with the story and know what to expect. Unfortunately, this film offers nothing new to the plot. Instead, it plays like a remake of 'Final Destination'. So much so that there really was no need for this film, and it therefore serves to please those who haven't seen the first film.<br/><br/>The film actually follows on 'Final Destination'. Ali Larter reprises her role of Clear Rivers (seriously, that's the character's name!!). Hardly 20 minutes into the film, though, there are so many plot flaws. I must admit, the highway crash sequence was incredible. But why did the random drivers at the scene also go to the police station? Why were they involved? And why are only a handful involved then, and not everyone Kimberley blocked? They should have made it clearer that these people would have died in the crash had she not blocked them off. It would have made a lot more sense if her friends were involved. It's therefore not as good - or effective - a setup as the first film.<br/><br/>Whereas the first film was rather serious, here they added humor. There honestly is some humor - and dialogue - that doesn't belong. It completely ruined the film's potential suspense. Quite a number of scenes were unnecessarily comical.<br/><br/>The first victim dies much too soon after the incident - before we even got to know him. The killings are more brutal and more far-fetched than the first film, although it can essentially still happen in real life.<br/><br/>The acting was unfortunately nothing to write home about.

"Straker17","6","0","0","10 February 2019"," Somewhat Fun, but Can't Stand Up to the Original
","After the sleeper hit that was the original Final Destination, the studio was obviously anxious to deliver a follow up. However, the original crew involved in the making of the first, could not return. As a result, we have a whole new cast and crew. This was also done with the second Nightmare on Elm Street movie. And while this is not quite as bad of a movie as that one, it does still prove that sometimes the best way to do a sequel is to bring back the original crew.<br/><br/>
This new film ups the gore and humor of the original in an attempt to create a movie with more vigor and intensity. However, the end result is a mildly entertaining, but overall empty movie. It fails to deliver the tense atmosphere of the first movie, even if it does sharpen the humor of the first in some moments. These brief one liners delivered by the characters offer most of the entertainment of the movie, which is nit necessarily the best complement to give to what was a serious horror movie.<br/><br/>
This time around we have a more colorful group of characters. AJ Cook portrays what turns out to be a very compelling leading character. She manages to add a little more intrigue to the film, and is one of the main reasons the film is worth watching at all. The best character of the movie is probably Kat, who offers a does of effective dark humor to the film. Some of the other characters have a few clever moments. However, some are absolutely irritating. It was a great relief to find out that Kimberly's friends were not in that much of the movie as what screen time they did get, they proved to be insufferable. And the character of Eugene (the black motorcyclist) proved to be highly unlikeable as well.<br/><br/>
This films probably has the most convoluted plot of the whole series. The whole idea of new life is vague and baffling, but not in a way that creates intrigue for the future events of the movie. Death also works backwards in this movie for logic that takes a significant amount of thought to understand. And for a movie that is mainly supposed to be a fun romp, it seemed very out of place.<br/><br/>
The effects of the movie are a slight improvement on the original's, however the film is still dated by today's standards. It was no doubt a grand feast for horror fans as far as the visuals go back when he first came out, however, today's audiences who were either not alive or too young to remember the film's release won't be invigorated in the same way, nor will they be as compelled to re-watch the film due to a lack of nostalgia.<br/><br/>However, the film is not without it's great scenes. Two in particular stand out. It features what is quite possibly the best premonition scene of the whole movie. The car pile up is now iconic in the horror community, even if the rest of the film doesn't measure up. Regardless, it is still a well shot and edited scene. The elevator death is probably the most horrific of the series, remaining both horrifying and tragic as the victim proclaims, ""I don't want to die"" just before death claims them. IN the most effective moment of campy humor, the end scene, involving a teenager barbequing is top notch over the top horror.<br/><br/>A few stellar moments, scenes, and characters prevent the film from being unwatchable, and they may even serve as reason enough to watch the movie as some will definitely enjoy the experience, however, they do not save the movie from it's weaknesses. Some audiences, such as the crowds of people and fans who flocked to theaters after viewing the first one, and the most gore thirsty and least demanding horror fanatics will have a great time with the movie, and will be able to put it's flaws to the side. However, it does not escape the more critical eye unscathed."

","Even though the original was good, I think this movie is better. The fact that the deaths come ""backwards"" is a great idea, because usually in the premonitions, the main characters that you know the best die first. Now that it's backwards, we get to know the rest of the characters even better. It also returns a character. This makes it even better because we feel bad for the characters even worse, like a character who's son had died the same day (he was part of the premonition). I did feel extremely bad for the teacher in the first one, but I felt worse here. Especially for Clear, who was Alex's girlfriend in the first one. It also feels like Halloween 2, like it happened the day after (of course it takes place a year after in this movie) because there were some off screen deaths in the first one, like Terry's death and we finally see the body in this movie.

","Another premonition about a freak accident leads to a different group of 'death cheating' survivors fearing for their lives in this surprisingly decent sequel. While the crash/collision scenes are magnificently intense and very realistic, 'Final Destination 2' does not get off to the strongest start and the first half of the movie feels like more of a remake or rehash of the original, except with even more inventive and elaborate deaths. As the film progresses though, there are some chilling ""outward ripple"" connections made to the characters from the first movie, which makes the overall project more interesting as an extrapolation on the events of Part One. And yet, even if one does walk away feeling that this is more of a rehash than a sequel, there are several improvements here. The death scenes, for instance, always leaving one guessing as to just what will deliver the fatal blow, the characters are more varied and have more personality than in the first film, plus there is quite a bit of comic relief that actually works. The sequel does not, however, have the visual panache that James Wong brought to the first film and nothing compares to Devon Sawa's hyper-awareness scenes in Part One. The basic idea is also not quite so fresh while delivering the same unanswered questions. As alluded to though, this is still a more worthwhile film overall than one might expect."

At least they use a different setting like one year after the flight 180 crash and they use cars instead of using the same thing over and over again. I like the car crash scene yeah I know Micheal Bay would do something like that but at least we don't need explosion every 5 seconds. It's like a improvement to the first one but I like them both."
"Rickting","6","0","0","14 February 2015"," Simple but effective
","Most film reviewers probably have an anomaly; a film or film series which they shouldn't like but do. The Final Destination films are mine. While the acting and writing are painful at times, the premise is intelligent and they're more effective than they're given credit for. Final Destination 2 sees a wimpy young woman(Alex Browning she ain't) foresee a hideous car pile up. She stops various people who were meant to die from getting onto the road, but death is not happy and soon starts claiming their lives in gruesome, gory Rube Goldberg machine style freak accidents. Gore hounds, you've met your match. This is weaker than it's highly underrated predecessor and is the 2nd worst in the franchise, although it's certainly not a bad film. The FD flicks were my first horror films and I used to be a big fan. I'm not as big a fan now, but they still hold up. FD 2 is not a scary film, but with a scare tool box of a log truck, a ladder, a window, a lift, a pipe, barbed wire, hospital equipment and a barbecue it is a surprisingly effective film. With it's dark atmosphere and suspenseful tone, you will be on the edge of your seat throughout.<br/><br/>The thing which lets FD 2 down is the acting, which is awful. Ali Larter has improved a bit, Tony Todd is in full on creepy mode (In a good way) and 2 of the survivors, a stoner and a high school teacher, and reasonably well played. However, AJ Cook is a terrible lead, and most of the other acting performances are awful. Even though these people are seeing things which would traumatize a person for life, they look like they're watching Halloween cartoon for kids. The script is weak, with a lot of exposition and the characters in general aren't as likable as the survivors in the first film. The writing, acting and predictability of the plot weigh this down, but FD 2 is still a solid sequel. It's dark, creative and often genuinely tense. While it may lack a really good finale, there's still plenty of tension throughout. The car pile up is the best car crash scene in cinematic history as far as I'm concerned, and although this sequel makes no secret of the fact it's about the deaths rather than plot, it'll satisfy the gore thirsty fans and provide plenty of ghoulish thrills for many, myself included. They shouldn't have killed off Clear Rivers though.<br/><br/>6/10"

","After the financial success hit of the first Final Destination, a sequel had to be thought up. And seeing how the first movie creates potential for a sequel, it seems fitting that another one had to be made and we get Final Destination 2. Yep. Death is at it again. But the question is did they clean up their mistakes from the first film? Did they decide to make the deaths more serious? Are more things explained in this movie as a sequel should do? The answer to the last question. YES. More things are actually explained! That's right. I really liked this movie. I mean, okay yeah, it's not a masterpiece. Miles from it, in fact. But I think it's a very loyal sequel with more things to offer.<br/><br/>Here's the story. Kimberly, played by AJ Cook, is taking a road trip with her friends on the interstate. But an eighteen wheeler carrying a bunch of logs passes by. The logs fall off and crash into countless cars, causing a massive pileup, killing many innocents. But this turns out to be a vision of Kimberly's and she blocks the ramp to the interstate to stop several motorists from entering the interstate. The pileup ensues and Kimberly, along with those who were meant to die in the pileup survives. Kimberly believes that all of this is the same thing as the events of the first film in which Death is now after the lucky ones. Desperate to find answers, Kimberly goes to the only survivor of the first film, Clear Rivers, played by Ali Larter. Yeah, Alex died in between films due to offscreen syndrome. Clear Rivers decides to help Kimberly and the others to find a way to stop Death and find more information about why this is all happening.<br/><br/>As you can see, this movie has a very strong connection to the first film—as a sequel should. And more things are explained, like how Death is doing all this. I like how Kimberly goes to Clear Rivers for answers. I like how they demand answers from the mortician, who was very knowledgeable from the first film about how to defeat Death. I like how the survivors become more and more concerned as the deaths excess. Yeah, I think the characters are better in this movie. I mean, yeah, they're stupid in their own way, but I like how involved they get near the end, even the cop. Yeah! A cop actually gets involved in the horror movie and you know what? He believes Kimberly and immediately tries to find answers after the pileup and ends up helping the survivors early on. There's even a deleted scene where the mortician explains how Death works to bring balance in the universe. I just found that really fascinating.<br/><br/>Okay, so what's the not so good stuff? Well...like the first film, the deaths are still stupid. In fact, in retrospect, they're goofier in this one. Yeah, they're Loony Tunes territory and more far-fetched. Also, another big change in this film in contrast to the first one is that this movie seems to be leaning towards a little bit of comedy. I guess you can say that since the deaths were ludicrous in the first film, they decided ""why not? Make it somewhat comedic. Taking it too seriously would make it even goofier."" And the direction they take with the movie just makes itwell, fun. But they don't make it where it's completely a comedy; there's still some suspense in the mix when they try to find more information. Yeah, it's not scary. Just fun.<br/><br/>I guess I'm a big sucker for this movie, but seeing how they treat this movie, they really did try to make it a true sequel. Is it stupid at times? Oh yeah. Are the deaths any better? No. But as far as story and characters go, I think it's an advance from the first movie. I know this had a mixed reaction from people, so you can say I'm a fan of this movie. I liked it, despite its mistakes. Next time it's on TV, give it a shot and see for yourself. Justnot while driving."

","I was originally very harsh on this film. It is a sequel just for the sake of money, but after franchises such as Saw, it doesn't seem so bad. We came here for ridiculous deaths and that's certainly what we get. The biggest problem is the amount of characters. Like all horror films, it feels as though it must up the ante. Unfortunately with more and more deaths, each death has less impact. We don't know nor care for the characters, and there is less build up to each death. Here, the characters spend too long looking for clues with no real way of stopping the deaths thus making the whole vision thing rather redundant. AT least this film tried to be inventive with the kills, and expand on the story in some way."

","Well, the movie is clearly what everyone expects it to be. An entertaining thriller with some predictable scenes and filled with gore, just like the first one was. Fortunately, the writers were smart enough to change some things in this one. While in the first the deaths were only seen before the big accident, in this one there's a girl with premonitions of deaths even further, doing justice to it's Brazilian translation-- which is simply ""Premonition"". <br/><br/>I just have a big problem with these explosions; making things explode in real life isn't that easy... in this film, any minimum bug makes the whole thing explode, which makes it lose some plausibility. And I have to complain the fact that Brazilian DVD has this subtitles very slow and out of time... I was obligated to see it without subtitles and ended up losing some informations. Aside all that, good movie with ridiculous end, that's all."

","This movie basically has the same premise but it is still a decent sequel because of the creative direction it goes with it. This lacked the creepy factor the original had but the deaths and direction of it all was slightly more entertaining in my opinion. Maybe because it is faster paced even if it goes in a more ridiculous and stupid direction it has more action going on with this one. Movies about death or grim reaper has been done before in the past but I liked how it doesn't show death in this franchise so far. But since the build up and the set up of what is going on has been done before in the previous film, it makes this movie more predictable. The death scenes are creative in a way but seemed way too forced. They way the characters work with each other to survive wasn't crafted all that great or effectively but it's passable. Overall it isn't a great horror sequel but it's still decent. Lastly the main positive aspect about the plot though is how it cleverly connects to the previous movie.<br/><br/>7.2/10"

","This sequel to the mega-hit Final Destination isn't much worse (or better) than the original, but trust me, that is a rare thing to find in any sequel to any popular horror film and it's a great thing here. The atmosphere isn't the same for one, since this film doesn't have the same 'night' scenes that the first has, but it works well in contrast. I love how everything tied up together, and Ali Larter has definitely been changed by what she experienced in the first. I am gla dthat the same people aren't having premonitions over and over again as it adds up to the weirdness of it. Some of the deaths here are really shocking and tense, although the ending isn't as climactic as one hopes, although that final scene shows just where the franchise will go. All in all, I hope this trend continues."

","A year after the events in the previous film, Final Destination 2 picks up with a brand new band of characters. In place of the horrific plane crash premonition, it hits us with something more common in all our lives, an enormous pile up on the highway. Once again a lone girl sees this disaster before it occurs and saves a this time random group of strangers from dying a most hideous death. The characters are a bit more diverse in this sequel but some of them feel dull and unreal more of you can tell that these people are actors. The script is still strong though, keeping those clever death scenes and tricks that I loved from the first film. Duely noted this film contains much more gore then it's predecessor. Making the fancy dress up that the first film had and striping it a bit to seem more like a slasher. Also unlike it's predecessor this one moves quite fast with the story. At some points making it feel rushed and a bit far fetched. Ami Larter returns to play Clear from the first film but with a completely new Sigorny Weaver style (as I like to call it) attitude being an expert on death's little Bobbi traps it sets. It introduces a new idea of how to stop the cycle of death and begins to fill in unanswered questions taking away the mystery of the first film. It did seem at first that this film would follow the same patter as the last and it does but the new ideas keep it refreshing enough to watch. It stick precariously close to the first films script as in character's personality's and clever little puns. But now on to the part that pulls most of it's fans in and thats the gore, I mentioned before there is a lot, and the deaths to accompany them are a bit more far fetched taking the great this could happen to you out from most of the scenes, but I feel all that is made up for in the incredible opening sequence of her premonition.

","The saga continues with Final Destination 2, where Ali Larter returns as Clear Rivers (how can you take anyone seriously with a name like that?), in a sequel which rehashes the same premise of premonition and therefore death avoidance, and the survivors this time round getting picked off one by one in similar violent fashion fit only for the screens.<br/><br/>The one with the powers this time is Kimberly Corman (A.J. Cook), who along with her buddies are going on a road trip. However, she sees a violent accident along the highway they were supposed to travel on, and prevents herself, her mates and a whole host of drivers in other vehicles from going on that ill fated strip, so before you know it, they defeat death's design for them.<br/><br/>But Final Destination says death will return to get the souls already earmarked, and here, the same drill applies. Despite the filmmakers here being a totally different team from the original, there are bouts of acknowledgements all around that ties the second movie to the first. Like the setting of the film exactly a year after the first, the return of Ali Larter, and a realization that all the characters here have indirect ties to those in the original. It might sound like a bad case of coincidence, but this is movieland after all.<br/><br/>The highway pileup is interesting enough, though the jarring censored bits in this locally pressed DVD made the best bloody bits unavailable. And there were new rules and conditions shared in this sequel, which is probably a good thing to prevent it from being just an extension of the first. What made it a little more riveting was that the characters here experience that feeling that nothing is worse than having to know you have to die, and then waiting for it to happen. The first had most of them pretty much clueless, or much against the ridiculous idea, but here, the group had that set aside pretty quickly, and nothing is more fearful than waiting for your time to expire.<br/><br/>The finale suffered though from needing to meet its self-fulfilling prophecy, but made up for it with its totally wicked ending. It doesn't lead to the third movie (each can work as a stand alone), but for those who did not watch FD1, this one pretty much summarizes it all for you. <br/><br/>The Code 3 DVD by Alliance Entertainment comes with the widescreen edition with Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound. However, remind me not to get a locally pressed DVD when there's expected blood and gore. With movies like these, sadly the gory scenes get censored away, and all you get are frustrating cut scenes and jarring edits. Subtitles are available in English and Chinese, and scene selection is available over 15 chapters.<br/><br/>The bonus features are quite scanty, with the teaser trailer (1:33), 2 music videos - The Blank Theory's Middle of Nowhere (4:16) and The Sounds' Seven Days a Week (3:20), and a series of deleted scenes.<br/><br/>The deleted scenes were non-selectable, and instead of having split up the scenes, you can only view them all together. A total of 5 scenes are lumped into one 9:52 feature, featuring the initial interview at the police station, an extended scene with the mortician, looking for Isabella Hudson, a short scene where Nora was handed a cellphone at the elevator, and additional scenes in the truck en route to the hospital with an extended hospital scene.<br/><br/>Decent efforts in visual and audio transfers, but short on the extras. Gone are the audio commentaries from the filmmakers, would sure like to listen to how they did the highway scene."

","I was stunned when I saw FINAL DESTINATION. It was a shocking and horrifically tense film that has images in that i had never seen before. A plane blew up right in front of your eyes, some lost their heads and death, in this case a noun, was after everyone, and it was unstoppable. It was a perfectly crafted horror film that I didn't think could be topped.<br/><br/>I was wrong. Not only is FINAL DESTINATION 2 a scarier and more gory film, it is a better made film that it's predecessor. I commented that Final Destination had the scariest 15 minutes to open a film perhaps ever. And although that may still be true, the opening highway sequence is at least as scary. And it is also one of the best directed scenes in the history of film. You can put this up there with the truck chase in RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, the chase scene in BULLIT and the final lightsabre duel with Darth and Luke in RETURN OF THE JEDI. David R. ELLIS is a gifted director and perhaps that is why I enjoyed SNAKES ON A PLANE so much. He has an innate ability to milk a scene for everything it's worth and the opening 15 minutes of this film is the epitome of brilliance. It not only sets the tone for the rest of the film but by the time the last word is uttered in the scene, you're exhausted and exhilarated. I can't heap enough praise on this scene.<br/><br/>After you get past the opening sequence of the film, what must be marveled at is the story. Critics will tell you that the best sequels are films that further the story, not just retell it like the way a film like Friday THE 13TH PART 2 does. Final Destination 2 has one of the wildest stories and best continuations of any film ever. Excluding EMPIRE STRIKES BACK and perhaps ROCKY II, you won't find a better continuation of a story than you will here. This film connects the events from the first to the characters in the second. They are literally running from death because they should have and would have been affected by the chain of events in the original had the passengers not gotten off the plane. J. Gruber and Eric Hess devised a well thought out and brilliantly complex story line for this one that will send a chill through you.<br/><br/>And finally what must be mentioned is the creative deaths in the film. In today's horror climate where gore has made a successful comeback thanks to films like Saw and Final Destination, this one has some very strong and graphic images that will please all gore hounds. The special effects team and the CGI guys should be commended for their innovation. Watching someone get cut in two with wires is quite the thrill....as long as it's in the movies of course.<br/><br/>Finally, Ali Larter appears in here as well and it's great to see her character survive from the first. She is wonderful in here as well.<br/><br/>Final Destination 2 is a fantastic film and it surpasses the quality of the first. This is a great addition to the horror genre.<br/><br/>8.5/10"

","""Final Destination 2"" offers many things but only gives a few of them and in regular quality. The premise of the movie is pretty good and actually, the violent premonition sequence was great; a violent scene full of action. After the premise, I had my expectations raised from low to medium; but after some cheesy scenes and dialogs I understood that this sequel wasn't necessary and that I was watching a big budget ""Horror"" movie that looked like a direct for video b-flick. Also, ""Final Destination"" has voluntary and involuntary black humor. When you consider taking the movie seriously, some scenes make you change your mind quickly. Watch the ending and you will give me the reason.<br/><br/>Sure, the movie is very entertaining and manages somehow to get your attention but when you are really into the movie; it lets you down because it isn't as consistent as wanted. I mean, there aren't enough ""strong"" scenes to get you hooked on through the entire movie. <br/><br/>Most of the death scenes were really inventive and creative, but also some of them were truly ""unbelievable"" or not real enough. Still, I accept that as a movie, ""Final Destination 2"" tries to impress and shock the audience with fantasy scenes. <br/><br/>The acting is very good. A.J. Cook is extremely beautiful but manages to deliver a solid, believable performance. She was just too cute to be harmed. The same goes for Connor.. She was very fragile, beautiful, but delivered a fine performance. The rest of the clichèd characters are well portrayed. The though black guy, the junkie, the loving mother and her son, and the lottery winner were all likable characters. <br/><br/>The f/x are actually very, very good. The CGI is well used and not abused. That's something good for a movie like this. True; some scenes look very cheesy but the CGI is only used in regular amounts.<br/><br/>So I would recommend ""Final Destination 2"" for people who liked the original FD and for people who want to have mindless entertainment. This movie gave me the feeling of a B-flick and I can't say I didn't like it; because at least it entertained me for a while. <br/><br/>Watch it with low, low expectations."

But right before she gets on the main high way, she has a horrible vision that she is about to get into a horrible accident causing the biggest pile up in car accident history, when she comes too, a cop pulls her over and she gets out of the car telling him that there is going to be a crash. It happens, but her SUV with her friends get tragically hit and killed leaving Kim alive with an officer that was also supposed to be killed. Everyone who was supposed to be killed on that road is dying off one by one, so she looks to the help of a person who has been through this before, Clear.<br/><br/>Final Destination 2 was a great sequel and I would highly recommend it for any horror fans. Even though I knew what was going to be the last scene, it was so cool watching it. Although I'm questioning the plot somewhat, because now it seems like almost everyone is going to die, but I guess that's the whole scary point of the story.<br/><br/>8/10"

","""Final Destination 2"" is very similar to it's original counterpart, with the exact same concept, with some more creative deaths and new characters. The film is about a teenage girl named Kimbery (AJ Cook), who is your normal teenager. While driving with some friends on a highway, she has a premonition of a horrible pileup after a log truck loses it's lumber, killing her and many others. Quickly thinking, she blocks up the freeway, stopping a handful of strangers who would have died from cruising into death's arms. But when the people she miraculously saved from death begin to die in odd ways, it seems that Death is coming back for them. After seeking help from Clear Rivers (Ali Larter), who is now contained in a mental hospital, fearing that Death is still out to get her, it's up to Kimberly to keep all of those who she saved from dying. But is it really possible to cheat your way out of death? <br/><br/>Unfortunately, for this unlucky slew of people, it isn't. This film has the same premise as the original, this time the horrible event being a major highway accident (and our hero is a female) and introduces some new characters who are next to fall in Death's arms. There isn't a lot to say about the story really, since it is so similar to the original, so I'll focus on the deaths in the film. This time around, the inventive death sequences are even more clever and complicated, and much bloodier and shocking than the original film. The most memorable deaths would have to be the one at the dentist's office and the one at the farm field, the ideas the writers came up with were so creative it was surreal. The actors this time around were all good, and Ali Larter reprised her role as Clear, who sadly meets a grim fate near the film's conclusion (which this time was also left open for another sequel).<br/><br/>Overall, ""Final Destination 2"" is worth seeing just for it's extremely creative ways that it picks off the characters one by one. There are some extremely memorable moments throughout, and the movie was enjoyable for the most part. Definitely see it if you enjoyed the original, it's a good follow-up."

","What I love about the Final Destination movies is that they don't try to hide the fact that they are gory trash, but instead they are almost proud of it. This is more bloody than the first, but also has a more complex story. Unlike the other two Final Destination films and most horror films, it doesn't just revolve around a group of high school friends but takes people from all ages at random from society and puts them into this terrifying situation. The acting, direction and so on are of a high standard for a horror film, particularly a sequel. Don't begin this movie expecting anything but a 90 minutes of blood, gore and shocks which is strangely enjoyable. I'm not generally a fan of horror movies, but somehow the Final Destination series has me as a fan."

","This time, Kimberly Corman (A.J. Cook) has a dream of a horrible of a deadly car crash killing many, many people. So when she wakes up her and a few others get out of their car and witness the horror themselves. Now, of course, they start to die in the order of how they would have, or are they? The opener is not as fantastic as in the first one, but the rest of the movie is better, in my opinion. Just like the first, there's a lot of sagging moments. Also, just like the original, the first murder is just okay. But the next 3 or 4 murders make up for it. In the end, it's all confusing and plot twists and crap with an interesting ender."
"Robert_duder","7","0","0","22 July 2006"," Campy, poorly acted, and wickedly gory!!! Still a must see!!
","I'm kind of seeing this series again in reverse. I saw the terrific third installment and happened to catch the second recently. I remember always being impressed with this series but found this time around a little campy. Has it always been this campy?? I don't know but Final Destination still has a way of scaring the living daylights out of you and imagining EVERY worse case scenario. Whereas the first one made you scared to death to ever set foot on a place, this one makes you never want to see another car for the rest of your life. Within the first half hour you are treated to one of the goriest, horrendous, shocking death scene car crashes I have ever seen. Brilliantly directed, shockingly real and brutal...it's just horrifying. Following that we are given the usual Final Destination track down as Death systematically begins to murder each survivor in the most obscure, original, and horrifying ways imaginable. If anything Final Destination has breathed new life into original death scenes which is a must for the Horror/Slasher genre and Final Destination has it nailed. I don't know how the writers continue to come up with it. It's always a surprise and you never know what's going be the death of them.<br/><br/>A.J. Cook picks up the lead as Kimberly Corman, the psychic girl who envisions the car crash the saves a group from dying but sets them up in Death's path. Cook is a little bland and over acts in several scenes adding to the campy feel of the film. Campy is not bad, especially in the horror genre but Final Destination feels like it should be more intelligent than campy. Cook does an okay job but her emotions don't really match the situations. Within hours of three of her best friends dying in the most horrific way she appears to be fine. When discovering Death is stalking them, despite a few tense moments, she doesn't seem overly moved by it. They could have cast better but she is alright. Michael Landes (Jimmy Olsen from one of my favorite TV classic Series Lois and Clark) is Officer Thomas Burke, the male lead. He always looks like a deer caught in the headlights which I suppose is the proper look given the situation. He doesn't quite have the acting strength to carry off the lead role and all in all he doesn't get subjected to the same amount of torture as the rest of them. Still him and Cook have decent chemistry although no romance is ever implied and he does a decent job much as Cook does. Ali Larter returns as the only returning character from the original film as Clear Rivers. Disturbed and having herself locked away to protect herself she finally comes out to help the new batch of survivors beat Death (because she did so well the first time everyone but her being dead now.) She is good as the veteran of the team but she does come across as a bit of a raving mad woman at times. But I won't complain because I love cross overs from previous horror installments into new ones. I'm glad they brought her back especially since I usually can't stand Devon Sawa (who was the lead in the original.) The rest of the cast in their small roles as eventual victims all do a decent job of blatantly establishing their characters and thus becoming victims of circumstance to their personalities.<br/><br/>The problem with Final Destination 2 over the previous one and the latter one is the cast. It's not nearly as strong as it has been or is now and the cast over acts and comes across as cheesy which is never good given the horrifying original death scenes. But because of a strong script of horror and the establishment of a connection between this film and the previous one it's a must see. The Death scenes are infamous and classic and original and just shocking it's almost funny but you feel scared to death as you chuckle at them. The story line is a little difficult and it feels a little forced especially the connection to the original and the way they end things up in how they ""conquer"" Death. They try to be fresh and original but overall doesn't exactly work as far as the story line goes. It's more complex than it should be. Stunt man David R. Ellis who has a huge film coming out this summer ""Snakes On A Plane"" is obviously well versed in stunts and choreographing harrowing scenes but his direction of cast might need something to be desired. Still #2 in the series you must see just because as a whole the trilogy to date is one of the most unique horror thrillers to be made in recent years. Horror fans will love it!! 7/10"

","The movie opens by referencing the first film, Final Destination. We learn that this is the one year anniversary of the explosion of Flight 180 (the big event that triggered the events of Final Destination). A girl is sleeping in her room with the television on. The program is a news broadcast covering the anniversary. The guest on the show talks about how death has a design, a plan and if that plan is interrupted, people are more likely to die in strange ways just so that death's plan is not too messed up. This was also the plot of the first Final Destination movie and being a direct sequel, we know this will be a major part of Final Destination 2.<br/><br/>After the scene setting the stage for the movie, we move into the actual plot line of the movie. Kimberly Corman (A.J. Cook) and 3 of her friends are taking a road trip. They are stopped on an on-ramp to get onto the freeway. We see Kimberly merge onto the road and keep driving, and there is a huge accident, visually impressive. Even this multiple vehicle (and I do mean multiple) accident comes up with some creative way to kill folks. Everyone dies. The scene shifts and Kimberly is still on the on-ramp. It was only a vision and it freaked her out. She stops her van sideways on the on-ramp and nobody gets on the highway. The officer trying to get Kimberly to calm down is a witness to a horrible accident that happens just as Kimberly said it would. She saved the life of everyone on the on-ramp, except for her three friends who are still in the van as it gets run down by a semi.<br/><br/>Back at the police station, Kimberly is insisting that everyone who survived will die in a specific order and only the police officer on the scene believes her. It isn't until the first survivor dies that people start believing. To try to figure this out and find a way to beat it, Kimberly goes to get help from Clear Rivers (Ali Larter), the only survivor from Flight 180, and the only survivor from the aftermath. The rest of the movie follows Kimberly as she tries to save everyone from being randomly killed. She continues to have visions and picks up on signs of what may be coming.<br/><br/>The real joy of this movie is in the creative and inventive death scenes. Sure, some are a little gruesome and I cringed a couple of times, but they were so well thought out that I couldn't wait to see how the next person would be killed. Final Destination 2 is not any different from the first movie, but because of the creativity of the deaths, I didn't mind at all. I like how the movie teased me with one kind of death but turned it into something completely different but equally impressive. Anytime I thought I figured out a death, the movie turned it to something else. It kept me on edge waiting for the next kill and the movie had a perfect flow to it. I'm not sure if the movie is better than the first, but it is just as good. If you've seen the first movie, you know exactly what you are getting into. If you haven't, this is a fun movie with a lot of creative kills. The movie exceeds the quality of its subject matter and is actually a pretty good movie."

","Like the first, this movie is based on someone, namely Kimberly Corman (Cook) having a premonition of a major pileup on the road. She parks her SUV, blocking both lanes, saving the lives of many people. But then Death starts to kill them off in a gruesome fashion once more. This movie features Ali Larter as Clear Rivers again, who voluntarily had herself locked in an insane asylum where Death ""couldn't get her"". The director also managed to sneak in a creepy reference between the characters in this movie and the characters in the first.<br/><br/>I actually liked this movie, despite how the plot sounds dumb when you first hear it. This movie accomplished what the first tried so hard at, and came so close to. The death scenes are chains of events, not just a half second of someone getting their **** ruined by a bus. It has a lot of action, good special effects, a great tie in between the two movies, and more interesting deaths (like sliced by a barbed wire fence). The actors have an okay range of emotions, and deliver good performances. This movie's got some good gore too, but nothing someone who's seen a few slashers can't take."

","In Final Destination 2, when all the survivors of the crash along with Clear from Final Destination, Clear I believe says something about Alex had died in Paris when her, Carter, and Alex were there at the end of Final Destination. However, when Alex was about to be hit by the falling sign and was supposed to die, Carter intervened and pushed Alex out the way and then right after that Carter was like ""who's next,"" and then we see the sign appears in the background so I guess Carter was killed and then the movie ended with Alex and Clear still living. I'm just curious, does anyone know how Alex died and if you do, did they say it in FD2 cause I haven't seen FD2 in a while, but I saw Final Destination today on TV and Alex hadn't died.

If you do, you are going to die eventually. It will stock you. You are never safe. This story does have an overlapping connection to its predecessor. There are plenty of cool death scenes. Please anyone reading this I am not trying to glorify death and say its cool, but within the contexts of a horror movie it is exactly that. I saw the original when it first came out so the first premonition seemed foreign to me. I liked that feeling because it added to the overall mood of the movie; although some of the connections to the first movie were not connecting as easily for me.<br/><br/>This was a good horror flick.

","Kimberly and her friends are taking a road trip to Datona. The news reports that it is one year later from the airplane incident where Alex had a vision of a plane exploding. While waiting on an on-ramp to the freeway, Kimberly has a premonition of a massive highway crash. After she stops people for dying in the pile up, the 'survivors' have cheated death. Kimberly believes that the recurrence of this cheat to death, means that death is now coming to take them.<br/><br/>Final Destination 2 doesn't really deviate from the first movie. A group of people cheat death, then death comes after them one by one. Though screenwriters Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber have changed things around, changing death tactics and order in which people go, so this doesn't end up as a cut and copy; like so many sequels do.<br/><br/>Like Final Destination, Final Destination 2 isn't that great of a film. The acting again isn't great, nor is the dialog of the script. Taking over from James Wong, David R. Ellis direction is just a notch better; making the film look more slick and glossy; though Wong's grittier look help the suspense more. What made the first film so interesting were the elaborative death scenes. Ellis has increased the violence, and the death sequences are even more meticulously played out. The opening sequence of the car crashes is one of the most mind blowing, well crafted, orchestrated pile up crash I have seen in a movie.<br/><br/>Just like Final Destination, Final Destination 2 is a guilty pleasure of a watch."

","This film is about Kimberly and her friends going to take the time off and spend their time going on a vacation. She drives the car and sees disturbing things that hints as a car accident. A truck is carrying logs in which the logs slides on the street killing many people in a gruesome pile up. While Kimberly and her friends are on the ground, in the car, another big truck, filled with flames, goes to her and before it crashes, Kimberly wakes up in a vivid dream.<br/><br/>She blocks the road so the cars behind her wouldn't go. An officer spots this and questions why she's doing this. She tries to explain she had a dream that a pile up just happened. Then before long, the truck with the logs kill the other cars in the highway. She saves 10 people for that but three of her friends automatically dies at the beginning where another car crashes into them. Now 7, including Kimberly, are left. Suddenly, the survivors get killed one by one by gruesome accidents. Now Kimberly has to find a way to stop this before Death kills her.<br/><br/>If you haven't noticed, this film has the exact same concept and plot in this movie as its original. On the contrary, it doesn't take itself too seriously, much funnier, smarter, and more elaborate and gruesome deaths. It's much lighter. Well, yeah, there are a few weeping scenes but I think this film was made to entertain the audience and not tire them with the over dramatic scenes.<br/><br/>This film takes place one year from the original. The deaths, as stated above, are more elaborate and gruesome, which makes the film better. The clues that foreshadow each death are now more elaborate and I love the score in here, which is even more brooding and suspenseful than the one in the original that this film is even more thrilling. I acting by A.J. Cook is great.<br/><br/>Basically, this film puts everything up a notch: The death, the premonition sequence (which has probably the best car accident scenes you'll ever see in your entire life!), the much needed humor, the intelligence, more characters to love, etc. I would call this a guilty pleasure and I love it THAT much!

Therefore he dies and comes back to life - the new life the film insists is necessary for cheating death - but gets a brick to the head anyway. (The writer's revenge perhaps?) What remains is a plot hole the size of Texas - clearly they expected him to return and wrote the script accordingly. When he didn't they switched in the character Clear for Alex as the survivor of the first film and gave the rest of his part to Michael Landes. I've nothing against Landes but how exactly does that work?<br/><br/>The deaths are inventively gory (especially ""Don't throw your pasta out the window"" guy) if not always possible, but the plot is a nonsense.<br/><br/>Take my advice: Skip 2 and go straight for 3.

To be fair it is a crying wonder how final destination 2 merited anything less than an 18 certificate yet managed a 15. I am 16 years old and this is one of the most visually repulsive films i have EVER SEEN.The storyline to say the least is mediocre at best but this film is just pure entertainment. Despite the moments of grotesque gore such as people getting their heads decapitated by a lift and impaled by ladders and crushed into a thousand pieces by pained glass, it is great to watch. Final Destitation 2 really is a film of consistent foreboding in that whatever comes next, you have been expecting but not in the fashion that it does. The acting again is mediocre and far from special and overall this fails as a film to really frighten you, however in terms of shocking you with extreme violence FS2 excels. I think if you are looking for a scary horror film then Fs2 isn't really a recommended choice, however if you love films with ridiculous gore this should be top of the list.

","I may have written a review of this under my previous moniker. Watching FINAL DESTINATION 2 again the other day, I am again struck by the highway pileup, which appeared to have been largely physical gags and not a heck of a lot of CGI. It is probably the best highway accident scene I have ever seen in a movie, although a couple of others come close, including the ending of 2002's TRAPPED with Kevin Bacon and Charlize Theron. The second half of this so-called sequel sucks, plain and simple. There are a couple of very gory deaths that look as fake as they come, and appear to be right out of an OMEN movie. The most offensive is probably the plate glass falling onto the kid. Without even slowing down the action, you can plainly see the glass hitting what appears to be the bottom half of a dummy filled with stage blood. Ali Larter's cartoonish flaming, flying death near the end is almost as bad. I love gore in movies, but only when it is handled realistically. The very first death after the highway scene, involving the goofy guy who has just won the lottery, is actually the most interesting to watch as it plays out like a slapstick routine that Steve Martin or Jim Carrey or even Lou Costello might have performed. The director may have thought he was making a comedy because you certainly can't take this movie seriously. And to think a second sequel is about to come out. Heaven help us! Where's Damien when you need him? Couldn't they at least have Death from FAMILY GUY make a guest appearance?"

It is definitely a must-see, even if your not all that into horror flicks. My personal opinion is that the first movie outranks the second, mainly because they over-did the 'splatter-death' scenario from the original.<br/><br/>My favorite character in the movie was Alex, not because he was the kick-butt psychic, but because of the way his character was portrayed. No normal human being would be able to stand up to that amount of pressure without having their mentality snap like a twig. I know some people are stronger than others, but my personal belief is that if you could see your death coming, then you would go crazy. The rest of the cast was very believable excluding Clear, who appeared to have a back story too-far-fetched for my personal tastes; father dying when she was ten and then her mother having left her soon afterwards? Not possible. She would have had to have been carted off to some kind of foster home, and we saw her all by her lonesome."

","Of all the Scream clones, or more appropriately, teen horror movies to come from the nineties and beyond, Final Destination has always been the best. It seemed likely then that it would get a sequel, and deservedly so as the first was so effective, and we want to see what has become of the survivors. As with the majority of horror sequels, the gore is increased, the deaths are more elaborate, and the plot introduces something new. And of course it is not as good. However, the makers of Final Destination 2 clearly recognise this, and rather than trying to make a superior film, they try to out-do the first in shock value and death scenes, and at times succeed, as well as making the story involving and entertaining too. Much of the tension, thematic depth, and style of the first film is lost, but it more than makes up for this with buckets of blood which will satisfy all us gore hounds.<br/><br/>Kimberley and her friends are leaving for Spring Break. On the highway she has a premonition of a massive pile-up and her own death, as well as the deaths of several others. She stops her car, thereby preventing her involvement with the crash, and all the cars behind her whose passengers would have been killed. A cop intervenes and she tries to explain. The pile-up occurs anyway, and her friends are killed too. Soon it becomes apparent that they have cheated death, who is now coming to pick them off one by one. Some believe this, some don't, and Kimberley decides to find Clear rivers, the sole survivor of last year's similar phenomenon. Together they try to stop death from getting them, but it seems that death will not be fooled so easily this time.<br/><br/>Like the first film, an unusual amount of other story lines could have been conceived if a certain character had done a certain thing differently. Questions of fate though are largely avoided in favour of elaborate deaths and effects, though this is still an intelligent film. As all the survivors of the car crash are connected to those who died in the aftermath of the plane crash, it may be thought that death is doing this simply to pull Clear into the open. The ripple effect may be said to be ever expanding, that soon everyone will die, and of course this is true, but while death may be stalking us all, new life ensures that we will continue to exist. The deaths here are mostly more impressive, less subtle, as some of the original deaths were slow and seemingly could have been easily avoided. Here, heads are smashed off, people are burnt and cut apart and various implements are used to deadly, and funny effect. The film moves quickly, with less emphasis on characterisation than the first had, but there are still many laughs, shocks and excitement. While the first may have made you genuinely fear death, this is mainly about fun and gore, with the odd are of discussion such as...what if? 7.5 out of 10"

","Final Destination 2 was a very cutting edge thriller. I was most impressed with the performances of A.J. Cook and Ali Larter. I saw this one with a few friends at a party and I enjoyed it thoroghly. there was some nice gore in this one,a man getting his eyes gouged out by ladder spokes,a girl getting her head pulled off by an elevator, a man being massacred by barbwire, a boy who got an iron weight dropped on his head, and a girl who is stabbed thru the head with a pipe. (Gives you a different view on airbags!)The humor was more thin in this sequel then in the first, and the language was more pervasive and frequent. It wasn't as much a horror movie as it was a good, suspenseful thriller. The cremation part really creeped my out! All in all, I enjoyed this movie and its a good movie to watch with popcorn and time to kill. Rated R: Strong Violent Accidents/Gore, Language, And Use Of Drugs."

","Like the first Final Destination, this movie features a group of seven people who avoid a horrible accident only to later die in very elaborate, far fetched ways. Though some people may find this movie disturbing, I found it to be hilarious. Unlike the first which I found to be more of a suspenseful horror movie, this one was more of a dark comedy. Call me sick, but never before have I seen a 15 year old kid killed by a falling pane of glass; which is unfortunate because it was truly a sight to behold. <br/><br/>As far as movies go this one was pretty entertaining, and as far as sequels go it was on par with the first. The pros include: its a decent recycled plot, it has a fast pace, good CGI, with pretty likable characters, and lots of elaborate deaths(if thats your thing). The cons include: a fairly weak ending, with some 2 dimensional acting, and lots of product placement. Every character must have owned or purchased a friggin iMac, with their little colorful apples displayed everywhere... and I hate iMacs.<br/><br/>Final Summation 7.5/10"

If Death were so creative in reality people would be clamoring to die.<br/><br/>The Bad: Plot?  What plot?<br/><br/>Overall: In the realm of horror it is middle-of-the-pack at best and should only be watched as a close-to-last resort but in the arena of bad movies this flick shines like a freshly cut gem standing out from the rest of the crowd and begging to be watched."

","It has been a year since the terrifying disaster of flight 180 and the discussion of what caused the strange deaths of those that escaped the crash lingers on. On this anniversary of the flight, Kimberly Corman (A.J. Cook) and her friends are disembarking on a Spring Break road trip. However, Kimberly is about to experience the unthinkable. In a vision that is harrowing to watch, the audience is treated to the most gruesome and realistic highway pileup ever committed to film. Anyone who is already afraid of the dangers of being on the road would do well to cover their eyes during some of this scene.<br/><br/>As with Alex Browning in the first film, Kimberly is only experiencing a vision of what is about to happen. It is up to her to try to stop the lives of innocent people around her from coming to an end on that road. She decides to stop traffic from merging onto the highway and, in doing so, allows another group of people to cheat death. Among this colorful collection of characters is Office Thomas Burke (Michael Landes) who becomes the first to believe Kimberly and becomes her partner in crime (so to speak) as she begins the race to try to understand deaths design and how to bring the process to an end. As in the first movie, of course, those who cheated death begin to die in creative, unexpected and gruesome ways.<br/><br/>
The plot here is so very simple that it only works to the movie's benefit that it is not always the focus. The clear reason individuals go to see a Final Destination film is obviously the death sequences. I am happy to say this film delivers in spades. The deaths here are harrowing and gruesome and every bit as imaginative as the first. All the actors here are above decent and add a strange bit of credibility to the ridiculousness of the film. The direction in the film is great and is ingenious in the tactics used to make sure even those who want to turn away at the gruesome moments are forced to share in some of the gory glory.<br/><br/>Through the film we see the return of a single character from the first film. Clear Rivers (Ali Larter) has locked herself away in a padded room to keep herself safe from death. Kimberly convinces Clear to help stop this new chain of events. Along the way, we also learn about Alex Browning's (Devon Sawa in the first film) ultimate fate. All in all, this film does an admirable job of building some suspense while not taking itself too seriously. Final Destination 2 also comes up with a clever way to tie itself to the first. This is a decent, fun follow up that does not really add anything to the mix but should be an enjoyable viewing for any fan of the first."

This one is much the same. <br/><br/>The concept works, and it works not because you care for the characters, you won't. It's because the deaths are so violent and abrupt that you get nervous waiting for them to happen. <br/><br/>Although the dialogue and thoughts on death with everyone retelling stories got annoying. The characters only need to be scared sh*tless, (you don't need them spouting their philosophies on death). <br/><br/>I still think it works - the film acknowledges the audience is trying to work out how each person dies and tries to play with that expectation. That tension, and the fact the movie knows its limits means I'd watch a 3rd 'Final' Destination - although next time some more humor would help make it that much more tense.

On video, the whole point is to watch the gruesome grisly horrible scenes, and skip/avoid the nonsense talk about death's plan that the characters discuss exhaustingly throughout the movie, which is just plain silly and dull. I repeated and slow-motioned every silly death scene just to see which one's actually looked real, which some looked downright convincing and all with the computer special effects but of course some didn't, like the glass scene. I know this is simply a movie but come on, fake or not, can a plate glass actually pancake a human being into tomato sauce? That scene should have been cut immediately or at least find a more realistic approach like use a concrete cinder block.

","I liked the first Final Destination because it wasn't the typical teen horror movie, although it wasn't perfect (no movie is). It had a little bit of a story and had quite a few creepy moments. The deaths were sudden and violent, but for the most part they weren't excessive. I had hoped that Final Destination 2 would continue with these traits, but it seemed to be just an excuse to show people being constantly splattered, burned, smashed, ripped, crushed and impaled very graphically. This is not scary, it's just makes the movie hard to watch for some people. I was entertained by the movie because it was fairly fast-paced and because it's fun to pick out all the mistakes, illogic, stupid dialogue, continuity lapses, etc., but I really don't care to see guts and heads flying all over the place. I understand that this is sometimes necessary in horror films, but really, can't we leave SOMETHING to the imagination anymore? All the best horror films have a message or a moral that they are trying to get across to the audience, however crudely executed it is, and that message is the focus of the story. But in Final Destination 2, and similar movies that emphasize blood and guts over plot and atmosphere, there is no message to be taught. It exists for no other purpose than to glorify death and carnage. I don't understand why some people find graphic portrayals of people getting sliced and diced amusing. At least in a movie like, say, Evil Dead, people are taken over by evil spirits that are bent on murdering everything in sight, and they HAVE to be killed in gruesome ways. FD2 is just full of nice people, who have done nothing more evil than avoid a car accident, getting destroyed in the sickest and most painful ways possible. There's no satisfaction in that, it's just sick and mean-spirited. So while it is entertaining, FD2 is definitely not a must-see movie. If you like bad movies, there are plenty out there that are way more entertaining than this one, without all the senseless gore."

Scare where the killer jumps out of the shadows or there is a period of inactivity followed by someone jumping in through a window or some crap like that. To be honest I find that to be a cheap scare when done alone. In ""The Exorcist"" there was an absence of the BOOO! Scare because they knew that the audience would be scared by what was happening on screen, the horror of the situation.  This is what I believe this movie accomplishes an actual good mix of foreboding and the BOOO! Scare. The movie is set up so you think you know what's going to happen then it kind of tilts it on it's ear. Most of the deaths follow a system that worked for me... The Set-up - Foreboding - The Fake out - Relief - BOO! Or in some cases just plain old surprise.

","I didn't have great hopes for this film but I was mildly, and pleasantly surprised. I had expected the first movie, repeated. Admittedly, on the face of it, that is what you get. But FD2 takes things a step further by showing that the events of the second film take place because of the events of the first film. They are connected far more deeply than simply being ""another batch of people that escape death"".<br/><br/>The effects are well done and striking, as in the first movie, this time focusing on a road accident rather than an air crash. And, of course, death's efforts to ""put things right"" by offing those that escaped the road accident are the usual level of weird and seemingly impossible twists of chance that we grew used to in the first movie.<br/><br/>Although I welcomed the plot development, linking this movie to the first one, the whole movie was never scary, as such. It's plenty gruesome enough (see the barbed wire scene, for example), but not very frightening. After some thought, I think this is in part due to the fact that I have recently been watching the series ""Dead Like Me"". Every time in the movie that things seemed to take on a life of their own, I was imagining Gravelings prodding and tinkering. It kind of ruined any suspense that might have been in the moment.<br/><br/>However, the movie is a worthy sequel to the first. Not necessarily better, just worthy of the name. Again this is mostly due to the fact that it progressed the story a little, rather than simply cashing in on the first's success.<br/><br/>If you liked the first movie, this one won't disappoint."

While it isn't necessary, it's probably a good idea to watch the first installment before watching this one.<br/><br/>For all those writers out there who are trying to write a successful scary movie, take notes.  Admittedly, you might not jump out of your pants, but there's only a couple good scares in 'The Ring' and THAT worked.  Be forewarned, the deaths dance on the line of gruesome and good taste, but they're executed (pun intended) perfectly.  Always trying to guess what's gonna happen next, you'll find yourself half-hoping they'll cheat death, and half-hoping you've correctly guessed how the next person will buy the farm.<br/><br/>Now, there was the requisite malarky when it came time to ask the question, ""How do we beat Death?""; but don't worry it's rather brief.

","In a number of ways, the sequel to 2000's surprise hit is a better-made, not necessarily better film than the first one.  It takes the ideas from the first film and builds on them.  While the first movie actually scared you, this one is more in it for shock value.  Yet that doesn't make it bad because you admire the craft that's gone into it.  <br/><br/>""Final Destination 2"" is unique amongst horror films in being that it has a unique villain (or hero?)  Death.  The movies are philosophical in being that they ask an ages old question: Is there any way to beat death?  Of course there is no way to beat death but according to the movies, if you recognize the signs or patterns that Death is willing to show you, it can be beaten.  The real truth is that Death has a really sadistic sense of humor in that it likes to toy with its victims before finally taking them.  It likes to trick its victims into thinking that it can be beaten, but the truth is that in the end, no one escapes Death; the only thing you can do really is delay it.  I think the ""Final Destination"" films are not really horror movies, but really dark satires that show how people react under extreme distress. <br/><br/>""FD2"" is also unique in its portrayal of the characters.  In my opinion, Death is not the villain, but it's the characters themselves.  The characters go to these absurd lengths to try to cheat Death, knowing that they can't.  They and Death go to extreme lengths to outwit one another, but Death always comes out on top.  The people need to just learn you can't cheat Death, because when your number's up, it's up."

Damien was always knocking off his enemies in the most surprising and convoluted ways.  Remember the ""elevator cable"" scene?  FD and FD2 simply extend this a bit and build a different framework around the death scenes.  There's also more than a bit of the ""Dr. Phibes"" movies here.

Lots of gore( this film is so gory that Ireland made it an 18 cert), plenty of shocks to make you jump and although none of the acting was Oscar winning, it was more than adequate for the genre. The film was pacier than the first and  more graphic in the death scenes. My husband who I suspect is much older than your average reviewer was jumping out of his chair and said at the end ""where do they get these ideas from""? He prefered FDI merely because it was less gory.<br/><br/>FDII is for it's genre a very good movie. It does not set out to do anything other that what it intends to do and that is deliver the gore, make you sit up and be surprised and does it all with a big tongue in cheek. These type of films are not meant to be analysed and dissected because they are not intellectual nor intelligent films but rather they are 'sit on the sofa, leave your brains behind and have a good laugh'  I think the film's critics need to lighten up a little and see the film for what it is.

","wow...  so...  Sat down with my younger sister on July 22, because morbid curiosity got the better of me and we were bored.  Movie starts and we're both squirming because our little movie heroin had a very large spider in her room and was oblivious...  as we're sitting there complaining that the movie is starting slowly the pile-up scene finally begins and in mid-sentence we're both screamin like fools...  very distressing opening sequence that freaked me out even more than the airplane sequence in the first movie (and I'm scared to death of airplane's anyway)...  so we're shrieking and logs are flying everywhere and people are melting and sliding and stepping on water bottles and big Devil trucks are coming out of the rubble, whatever shall we do?  Then the little b*tch wakes up from her little dream and the movie comes to a complete halt...  for the most part... we got a little freaked out during Evan's excrutiatingly long death scene...  come on people...  I know that death is trying to get it's little design back, but it seemed like it was literally chasing people sometimes... but Evan's death teaches us an important lesson...  if you have an apartment like that, then win the lottery, the first thing you should do is either move into a better apartment (or house), or hire a cleaning crew... setting that dump on fire was the best thing that could have happened... I've read quite a few comments about the little pearl of great screen writing involving someone actually saying ""They'll be attacked by pigeons"" or something like that so I don't even need to touch that...  all throughout the dentist office scene I was very upset about young little Timmy's pending demise...  he was funny...  you know he had the potential to be quite a cutie when he hit 18...  and no one wants to die in a dentist's chair... so fortunately one of the movie's ""plot twists"" saved the day for him... until he got the idea in his head to run into a flock of pigeons that were merely rockin out on the floor...  I'm sorry but anyone who runs around when there is construction in progress and then causes a very large commotion deserves to be turned into oatmeal...  enough of the death scenes though...  i think just about everything else was ripped off of Resident Evil (and much creepier in that movie I might add)...  let's talk about Dr. Candyman the coroner...  I'm sure everyone remembers him pulling the embalming needle out of Billy in the first movie and making the orgasm face while doing it... remember where he was?  in a funeral home...  where that kind of thing generally happens...  SO WHY IS HE NOW IN SOME CREEPY UNDERGROUND LAIR? So he can talk in riddles and look sinister? give me a break...<br/><br/>alright but this movie was so boring that I'm getting bored reviewing so I'll speak plainly...  Check it out if you must...  but make sure you watch the first movie a couple times before...  there was really nothing wrong with the first one...  i saw the sequel as pointless and often frustrating...  if you happen to buy or rent the dvd however...  make sure you check out the special features in the inifinifilm portion of the dvd... some of the specials (like the terror gauge) were quite interesting and made me feel like I didn't waste $20 on my purchase..."

","I can only say that this film is a total waste of time and an insult to the Horror Genre.   It is so unrealistic that I even found it funny to  certain points.  The deaths are so fake and exaggerated.  The characters are lame and empty; nonetheless the actors, specially the state trooper... he beat everyone as the worst actor.<br/><br/>Anyway, the film lacks credibility, the way the people die is just not realistic:  pigeons, hooks, wires, stairs, trees?  Besides all these nonsense, the dialogue is very hollow and absurd.  What's even funnier is the way how everything fits into place and everything is so obvious to every character.  The gore in the film is not even that cool and the ending could definitely be ranked as one of the stupidiest endings in a horror film.  I know that it is only a film and it is only to entertain the audience, well I was entertained, but in a humoristic way.<br/><br/>I do not recommend this film to horror-buffs.

The deaths, though quite gruesome, have an ""Omen"" kind of style, and it's actually intriguing to watch the series of innocuous events that cleverly culminate in the death of each person. Also, the director and writer include fake-outs to keep you off guard. The story is also more involved and complex, subtly tying into the first movie.

","Truly original and darkly hilarious, FINAL DESTINATION 2 is a very worthy sequel to the landmark original. The effects are very well done and the suspense is pulled off perfectly. Death is hunting down a group of people that survive a freak car accident.<br/><br/>A.J. Cook pulls off a completely good acting job here (much better than the one she played in RIPPER: LETTER FROM HELL) and the others fit in with their roles well also. Michael Landes, Ali Larter, T.C. Carson, Jonathan Cherry, Tony Todd, and Keegan Connor Tracy are those bound for the grave. They all boast the top-notch acting talent of most neo-horror films today. Films today usually go for either stylish effects and impressive graphics or more psychological factors that could more effectively screw you in the head. FINAL DESTINATION 2 goes for both. And it actually works too, which is the thing most amazing about it.<br/><br/>Being a sequel (to the great FINAL DESTINATION, of course) sure it isn't as good as the original, but it comes pretty damn close. It lives up to the plot and story of the first one well enough and there is some creepiness present to give some audience members nightmares. The beginning accident sequence is truly chilling and some of the deaths are very disturbing. Most of all however, is that FINAL DESTINATION 2 can score on the level of being an effective and clever horror thriller but also be a fun movie to watch with friends or while you people are drunk or something. Being able to be both things at once is a rare feature in most films today.<br/><br/>Personally, I didn't think FINAL DESTINATION needed a sequel, but this sure as hell changed my mind.

Among the people on the highway are Kat, a business woman, Rory, a coke-addict, Evan, a lotto winner, Thomas Burke,a cop, Eugene, a substitute teacher, and Nora and Tim, a mother and son. Well, the various characters are driving down the highway when a logging truck in front of them accidentally drops its logs off the back of it. The first log crashes through the front window of the cop car, coming out the back with guts and blood all over it. Eugene's motorcycle spins out, flipping him off. He slides until he hits a log, but his motorcycle slides into him, splattering him. Suddenly, Rory's car flips out of control, flipping and turning until finally landing straight, only to be hit by an oncoming semi. Kat's SUV suddenly hits a log, flipping over and crushing her inside. Inside Nora and Tim's car, Tim's water bottles fall behind the break pedal, denying Nora the chance to break, eventually crashing them into a log. Suddenly, Evan's car spins out of control, slamming into a truck, exploding. Kim's SUV flips out of control and lands on it's side. She sees Evan burning alive in his car until the logging truck crashes through it, blowing it up completely. Then the truck crashes into Kimberly. Suddenly, Kimberly wakes up and sees all the signs of the crash. She parks her SUV across the on-ramp, keeping everyone off as the crash happens before their eyes. Suddenly, a semi crashes into Kim's SUV, killing all her friends. She survives because Burke pulls her out of the way. Afterwards, Evan is fixing himself dinner after throwing some spaghetti out the window, but his apartment starts on fire. He eventually gets out and falls off the escape ladder. He slips on the spaghetti and the ladder leg falls, stopping about 8 inches from his eye. He thinks he's safe, but then the ladder falls all the way, impaling him through the eye. Later, Tim is coming out of the dentist's office, but he goes and disturbs the pidgeons, which distract a construction worker, who drops a huge sheet of plate glass down which lands on Tim, squashing him to oblivion. Later, Nora gets her head caught in the elevator. As it goes up, her head gets chopped off. Later, Kat crashes her SUV, which sends a pole through her headrest. During this scene, Rory saves a farmer boy from getting hit by a news van. When the firemen are trying to get Kat out, they jam the jaws of life into the car, which deploys the airbag, impaling her head on the pole. She drops her cigarette, which ignites a trail of gas leading up to a news van, which explodes, propelling a barbed wire fence at Rory, which slices him into 3 parts which slide off each other. Later, Eugene's hospital room explodes when some oxygen leaks out and a plug sparks, killing him and Clear. At the end, the farmer boy dies when his barbecue explodes.<br/><br/>In my opinion, this movie was pretty damn good."

","Kind of a creepy story to go along with my viewing of this movie -- Yesterday, July 22nd, I bought this movie on DVD. Not 4 hours later, I was involved in a car accident. Watching this movie last night was probably enhanced by this experience. Certain things in the movie sent chills up my spine, which is unique for me, because not many movies can still do that. Yes, 'Final Destination' is an exercise in excess. The body-count is higher, the deaths are grislier and filled with an abundance of guts and gore. The shocks come one after another, and the 90 minutes breezes by. Kimberly and 3 of her friends are on a road-trip when, while stuck in a traffic jam, she has a vision of a massive pile-up, resulting in at least a dozen gruesome deaths -- all caused by a logging truck. Freaking out, she blocks off traffic. As she explains to a cop what happens, the truck she saw in her dream speeds by, causing a similar pile-up to what she envisioned and taking the lives of her 3 friends. Together, with the people who she helped save by blocking traffic, she discovers that death is after her and it is basically back to the same formula as the first. But there are plenty of twists and turns to keep you on your seat. You will be glued to the screen for the entire 90 minutes. The deaths are so unique and creative, you can't help but just laugh at how excessive some of it is (my favorite being the 15 year old crushed by a giant pane of glass). The movie does reach into some campy territory, but that's alright, because this is, afterall, a sequel. And very rarely do horror sequels match their predecessor in quality. If you liked the first one, you'll love this one, which is basically a horror roller-coaster ride. <br/><br/>P.S. I loved the touch of killing off Eric to the tune of Incubus' ""Vitamin."" Nicely done!<br/><br/>9/10"

","Final Destination is exactly the same idea as the first (obviously), and that's not bad.  But the execution, unlike the first one, leaves us with another bland horror film.  First off, this time the survivors are complete strangers, so there is no bond between characters, and we feel nothing for one based on the outcome of another.  They tried to fill it in with some hokey love story, but it just wasn't working.  And brining back Clear Rivers was a bad idea.  It made it way too simple for the people to understand what was going on, and was pretty much put in there to help speed up the writer's poor idea for cheating death.  It's also another movie in a long line since 6th Sense that just uselessly throws plot twist after plot twist at you in order to convince you it's really a smart and deftly crafted thriller.  It's not.  The ""big twists"" are anitclimatic.  The death scenes were much more far fetched than last time, but some are still fun to watch.  It's a little gore happy, but that's expected from a horror sequel.  They have to make up for the lack of story from the predecessor, so they just whip out the 'ol ultra violence.  The cast is nothing better than average.  The lead girl was pretty bad though. Sadly, Tony Todd is still gives the best performance, despite being the movie for about 5 minutes.  David R. Ellis is just a bland director.  Capable, sure, but bland.  <br/><br/>It's a throwaway sequel.  It takes a the good idea the first one had and throws it away in favor of violent death scenes, which are cool at times and a part of any good horror film, but should not be the main focus.  Sure to give teenie boppers a good scare, but any else should think twice about seeing this.<br/><br/>3.5/10<br/><br/>*/ * * * *"

It starts with a group of people, 4 friends on a trip to Daytona Beach, a business woman, a biker, a druggie, a mother and son, and a cop. The driver of the truck holding the 4 friends, Kimberly Coreman,then sees ""signs"" along the road that hint of disaster, then disaster strikes. This has to be the most horrific/realistic car accident I've ever seen in my entire life. Like waking up, Kimberly then sees and hears all the signs that point out that an accident is in the works. She parks at the end of the on-ramp of the highway, and keeps everyone on it from being in the accident that follows soon thereafter. Sadly, her friends die tragically and brutally. What follows is a story about the survivors trying to save the life of an unborn child, and the lives of themselves. This flick just goes to show that accidents happen all the time, and at anytime in the day or night. You don't need creepy settings and ominous music to bring out the horror in this movie, because it's already there. Scary as hell kills and lots of fun is included. Definetly a must for the big horror fans. Have fun"

","Despite all the bad reviews, I highly enjoyed this flick. If you're willing to just kick back and have a good time, this is one enjoyable movie. The acting is good, the special effects are incredible, and the plot is actually above average.<br/><br/>Like Final Destination before it, this is a more creative horror film. It's not a hack and slash, but more a dark comedy of sorts. The fun of this film comes not from the events leading to death, but death itself. Luckily there's a large cast and the inbetween time is quite enjoyable.<br/><br/>The scene that puts this movie over the top however, comes right at the start. Just like FD's plane explosion, it sets the pace for the entire movie. FD2's highway scene is simply an amazing event. It's jaw dropping, it's gruesome, and it's fun.<br/><br/>They thankfully went for a strong R rating, and didn't shy away from getting really gruesome. They also threw in biker babe who briefly flashes early in the film, which probably should have been left out. Otherwise though, the suspense to gore ratio is just about right.<br/><br/><ul><li>Rirath_com</li></ul>"

This is the kind of suspense that creeps up on you ever so slowly even though you know its coming, and then pounces on you suddenly with a big bang. I don't remember the last time I've seen a theater full of people jump at the same time so many times in one sitting.<br/><br/>The movie begins with Kimberly (A.J. Cook) and her friends heading out for a vacation when she suddenly has a premonition of a massive freeway pile-up in which she and everyone else around her are horrifically killed (this sequence will give you goosebumps). When she and the others avoid the accident, which takes place on the 1 year anniversary of the plane crash from the first movie, Death becomes determined to make sure that they all reach their ends one by one, in the same order they were supposed to die in the pile-up. And that's all I'm saying for fear of ruining the movie.<br/><br/>One thing is definitely for sure, I drove home very slowly and very carefully after watching this, avoiding the expressway and any other cars on the road for that matter.

About halfway through to the end of the movie the whole entire thing spirals downward into a campy, and cheesy stupid humor laden movie. What they started off with on the right foot they quickly lost and totally did not live up to the quality of the first one.

","The funniest thing in this movie is when a fence (barbed wire) with two posts flies trough a guy and he is sliced into three pieces. If nothing else in this movie will make a ""tic"" that it is just ""black humour"" then this certainly will. First of all, when things explode, biger parts, which have more energy loaded into them because of the explosion, get into flying, but a fence with two posts, this just is not possible. I have blown things up too and seen how it happens, in this move it is just a hollywood action, cars don't blow up when fuel ignites, they just burn, there is no explosive material, unless some guy just puts 2 big barrles of trotyle in a TV van!! So even when a car is loaded with explosives, fence just doesn't fly at that speed and slice a guy (posts are in the ground too, so the fence may just fall, not more). When you even now don't understand that this plot is crazy and just for entertainment, then you must be crazy :) It's a good black humour, but not a good movie though. 5/10 is my rating."

","Death is back with a vengeance in this new tale of escaping the inevitable, as director David R. Ellis takes the front with an attempt to fill in the shoes of the witty success `Final Destination' so cleverly brought us. `Final Destination 2' brings us a new story of it all, following a young women's pre-vision of a horrific car crash and her escape from the jaws of death along with other feeble characters who were conveniently at the right place at the wrong time. You can pretty much guess the rest if you've all seen the first movie that was so unique in delivering a fresh taste into the world of horror creating our perfect Friday night popcorn enjoyments. This is a predictable sequel that clearly decided to pawn off all the great elements that the first film had for us and polish the scenarios up tightly to create a film that is bloodier, cheesier and flat. Expect more original death scenes as death decides to off every character using everything from barbecue grills to falling objects. The cast unfortunately wasn't decent either; the story left us with a bunch of rejects from the first movie that obviously never made it to the audition. Their attempts to play characters whose fates were entwined by death along with their flaccid abilities to portray fear was insulting to the movie viewers eye. This film almost directly disregards everything the first film stood for by trying to resurrect the scenarios and attempting to continue the story of the first film that was clearly finished years ago. If you enjoyed the first film so much then clearly this film will ruin the affect of everything the first film gave you. `Final Destination 2' is a definitive example of why most sequels are regarded as trash. The film is nothing more than a semi- decent video rental that tried so hard to better the original."

"toshikk","Null","0","0","23 March 2003"," Oh... another teen thriller...
","I have to confess - I really enjoy watching ""regular American teenagers"" (pretty much like myself, although I'm not really ""American"") getting run over by cars, ripped to pieces, shot, stabbed, hung, drowned, thrown off high buildings and burned to ashes on the big screen. I have no idea why - maybe because I do not tolerate violence in real life. Anyway, in my personal opinion, if a movie is not thoughtful, if it does not have a message within, and if it is not a comedy/melodrama, it has to have violence in it. The more, the better (preferably, at random moments). And, yes, it has to have a happy ending (a little twist in the end, with a hint to a sequel, is allowed though).<br/><br/>The sequel to Final Destination falls under these conditions perfectly. Like in any other teen thriller (see Scream or I.K.W.Y.D.L.S.), there is really no plot - who needs it anyway? There is also no ""message"" behind it. Don't look for director's views on life, death and all that philosophical junk in it - it's just a bunch of people getting killed in very interesting ways at most random moments (the director should be give a credit for that). And, yes, there is a happy end (sort of), and there will be a sequel (most definitely).<br/><br/>One good thing about this movie that makes it so different from other teenager-oriented junk thrillers, is the absence of any kind of candyman in white mask/fiserman's outfit. People just get killed. Sometimes, in really odd and suprising ways. But - alas - this concept is (like any other thing in today's so-called ""blockbusters"") a rip-off too. Go see 1976 ""Omen"" and you'll understand what I mean.<br/><br/>Anyhow, if you like blood, gore and violence, it's a perfect one for you. It's a little better and smarter than all other ""teen thrillers"", but it is also not burdened by any kind of philosophical meaning (the latter is what I like it most in the movies - that's why I'm giving it a 4/10 on an overall movie scale and a 8.5/10 on a teen thriller scale)."

","Last night, after work, I decided to catch a late showing of FD2, a film I wasn't really sure if I wanted to see to begin with.  The first one boasted some pretty nifty death scenes and managed to keep me entertained for most of the running time.  Knowing that this was going to be more of the same, I went anyway, glad that Devon Sawa was now out of the picture.  Well, it was more of the same, but this time it was done much better, with a lighter (and sickly funny, I might add) tone.  True, this one had most of the stuff that has made me hate most of the so-called, half-assed, ""horror"" movies over the last ten years, but this time it really didn't bother me and I was surprised that I liked most of the characters.  What really made this one stand-out to me was the fact that we had a good director who's not afraid to show us some gore.  No fake outs or camera cut-a-aways here, nope.  This one shows it all and gleefully at that.  In short, it's not for the squeamish.<br/><br/>
Now, the plot paralells the first film to a tee, but what I really liked was how it tied each of the main characters to those poor souls in the original. It was a pretty cool idea and it was pulled off convincingly.  Tony Todd shows up again as the mortician and I'm not really sure what his purpose is supposed to be, other than to be ambiguous and aggravate the hell out of me. Now it may just be my feeble mind, but I have yet to figure out his character and how he's supposed to know all of this stuff about death.

The death scenes here are something to behold.  Yes, some may complain that they are too elaborate and blah blah.  Yes, they're elaborate, but that's what makes them fun.  I won't spoil anything for you.  Too many people have mentioned the opening highway scene already, so I'm not going there, but I will admit that it was pretty damn unsettling and it did cross my mind more than once on the way home.  brrr.<br/><br/>If you liked the first, you've probably already seen it.

","If the first film's highlight was Amanda Detmer's death scene, The second film's highlight was with the airbag, FD2's plot is much more faster. I wouldn't say that this is a teen-slasher horror film, It's just plain horror, And most characters involved here are adults.<br/><br/>I like the coincidence and the connections of each character cheating death it really worked. Ali Larter did a good job passing the baton to A.J. Cook and Michael Landes for the next one. I'm also glad Tony Todd is still there in the film, In closing, the series is one of the most original horror films of all time I wish the final chapter would be more dramatic yet horrific at the same time."

","This Movie was brilliant. The most of all things that I thought was brilliant about this movie was that you never saw death coming unless you were paying attention to it in every single detail. I for one have watched the first one several times. And The second was better than the first.<br/><br/>
Ali Larter- Played a good part in this movie. She explained to us a lot of the information on death and its design.<br/><br/>Tony Todd- Did a great job with also explaining death, But also kind of creepy. Of course he is the Candy Man. If they do make a part 3, Tony Todd should be the main lead.<br/><br/>A.J. Cook- Did a great Job on a first real major role on a Movie. The Lead was great she played it well. I like how she managed to feel for her character and other characters as if she was really Kimberly.<br/><br/>A lot of the information did make somewhat sense. I find this movie over all 9 out of 10. There are some great features, cool death scenes, and things you wouldn't imagine possibly.<br/><br/>I advise you not to watch this movie if you do not like blood.<br/><br/>I for one would pay money to see this movie over and over again.

People who feel like this:<br/><br/>""I found it offensive that someone felt I would want to spend 90 minutes watching people be cut up and killed in gory ways without having anything else to offer.

","You'd think, reading some of these comments, that this movie is the greatest thing since Yamila Diaz. It's not. This movie really isn't good. If you look at it as a whole, you'll find it's less than the sum of it's parts. It gets pretty annoying at times, what with all the ""Death's Design"" talk and blah blah blah. There's a point in the movie where you beg the people chattering away about Death's plan to shut up and go do something to get themselves killed already. Some of the acting sucks and the characters are all transparent and paper-thin. The first one is ten times better and achieves it's goal with a little more dignity and class. So, why then, after all I've said in regards to how schlocky this flick is, am I recommending it? I'll put it to you like this: PEOPLE GET IT IN THIS MOVIE. It's that simple. And it's not even that they get it, I mean they really get it. In extra bad ways, no less. For example, I'm sure that you've heard about the beginning of the film with the huge car crash/pile-up deal. It's the same setup as the first movie, where the kid dreams this whole airplane disaster only to wake up and find that it hasn't actually happened... yet. Small nuances of the premonition start to arise and he realizes that the plane he is about to fly on will actually explode. He freaks out, some of the passengers leave with him, plane blows up mid-flight, Death starts hunting the survivors down in the order they're supposed to die in, blah blah blah. If you're reading this review, you should already know the deal. Same thing here but with a twist. In the sequel, when the first person buys the farm in the sequence, you'll know that you're in completely different territory. I'll spare you the details cause I'd like you to be surprised but that moment shook me up real bad. Never before had I seen something so unsettlingly realistic. It reminded me of the test footage you see of those crash test dummies, it was that real. And then pretty much everyone else in the vicinity of that crash gets it, some worse than others. The movie is worth seeing just for the intro alone because it was pretty intense. Throughout the rest of the movie, everyone who was ""saved"" from being in the accident starts getting bumped off. And how! People get it, folks and I think you owe it to yourself to catch this in a theater if it's possible. One thing that made this movie even more enjoyable was the crowd's reaction to the death scenes. It was like applause for an awards ceremony. To make it short and end this, see the movie if you wanna see people get greased in horrible ways. Don't watch this looking for an Oscar winner. Watch it for the visceral thrill of seeing someone get their ticket punched! I'm definitely getting the DVD, at least for that. Rating: ***1/2 out of *****. P.S. You'll never look at a family BBQ the same way again."

","I expected Final Destination 2 to be practically a remake of Final Destination, a film which I enjoyed.  I was correct, as it happens, but it didn't matter - FD2 was nastier, gorier, and more fun than the original. I'll need to rewatch both on DVD some day, but I think the sequel is actually a better movie overall.<br/><br/>The humour actually works for the most part (though a few jokes fall flat), which turns FD2 into a seriously gruesome black comedy for most of its running time.  The elaborately constructed death sequences will make you cringe, cover your eyes, and laugh out oud all at once.  This may be the goriest horror movie Hollywood has produced in a decade or more.<br/><br/>If you have a weak stomach, stay far away from FD2.

","WHAT FOLLOWS IS THE REVIEW I WROTE FOR THE FIRST MOVIE:<br/><br/>""The strength of FINAL DESTINATION lies in its ability to keep audiences on (to use a cliche) the edge of their seats. Or rather, to convince audiences that something is about to happen, then do a complete turn-around and have something else inexplicably happen.<br/><br/>WHAT AM I TALKING ABOUT?<br/><br/>Well, for example the death scenes. A large build-up ensues, where the movie convinces the audience that a character is going to die in all sorts of horrible ways. Then an anticlimatical drop occurs. The audience sighs, the character will be ok they think. But then - WHAM! - the character is killed in a most unexpected way. This is the power of this movie. Otherwise, the acting isn't very good; the script unsurprising; and the direction often slack, surprisingly so for John Woo.<br/><br/>As for the core of the movie, the characters are hastily sketched with no depth and the storyline is rather old-hat fare. There is no denying it, this is a very silly film - but it will have you hooked till the end.<br/><br/>Also of note: FINAL DESTINATION is a slasher movie, and the first without an actual killer - death itself stalks the protaganists instead. Interesting too is the way the movie turns everyday objects and occurences into lethal weapons, and sometimes in rather original ways. There are also some neat in-jokes throughout.<br/><br/>Bottom-line: Silly but with style and an ability to grip even the most reluctant viewer.""<br/><br/>
THE ABOVE REVIEW IS PRETTY MUCH IDENTICAL FOR THIS - FINAL DESTINATION 2. WHY? BECAUSE THE MOVIES ARE ALMOST COMPLETELY IDENTICAL. THIS IS A FUN MOVIE WITH SOME GREAT SCARES AND GORY MOMENTS. BUT IT IS BASICALLY A REHASH OF THE ORIGINAL. NOT A SEQUEL SO MUCH AS A REMAKE."

I can't explain why this should be.  You just have to see the movie and decide if you love it or hate it.<br/><br/>A couple of comments.  First, Shirley Walker's music for the original Final Destination was so good I bought the DVD for that reason alone.  Her score for FD2 is nice, but not as moody or atmospheric.  Second, as I'm sure someone has already pointed out, the characters in both FD and FD2 are named after famous horror movie directors: Corman, Carpenter, Hitchcock, Browning, Lewton, and others.

A log ripping a persons head off, a barbed-wire fence flying through the air, a piece of glass falling onto someone?  I have one question to ask: how low have we sunk to be entertained by people being ripped apart or smashed? This movie was sick.  Why can we not go back to the real scary movies, with realistic villians (i have to admit death is as realistic as you can get) and the sense that intestines flying and bodies being bent are not scary. Its just sick.  The one good point in this movie is the end when the arm lands on the mothers plate.  It is hypocritical to say that I don't like gore and think that that is cool.

Thorough scene weaving with minimal plot holes, again, unlike Darkness Falls. 4.)  The characters that you want to die the most, do, and in heinous ways. 5.)

Jumbled dialogue between characters, sometimes leading to sloppy scene development. 2.)  Inappropriate and morose humor injected into scenes.  It so inappropriate, you almost could miss that humor was intended. 3.)  Not enough gore. 4.)  No sex. 5.)  Relatively predictable scenes. 6.)  Boring at times. 7.)  Dialogue when Kim Corman goes to visit Clear Rivers in sanitarium is stupid and unrealistic. 8.)  Throughout the film, lots of cliches, really infantile gestures, and crappy character development. 9.)  Mediocre acting. 10.) You actually hope for a violent demise of the main characters, instead of rooting for their safety. 11.) Horrible development of suspense.  Producers appeared to concentrate on gratuitous violence, thus sacrificing ample opportunities to develop true suspense and horror.  This is the primary flaw and downfall of the movie.

","First off, to enjoy this movie you have to take it for face value.  It is not attempting to be like THE RING or anything of that matter.  This movie is clearly made so the audience can watch people die in crazy ways (I know its a little twisted).  It really in a way is a comedic/horror picture.<br/><br/>Unlike its predecessor, this movie realized the farfetched plot and runs with it.  The first one was good, but it took its topic to seriously.  The deaths are overly creative and drawn out to great legths in some cases, all given for shock value.  Before long the audience finds itself, ""I wonder how the next person is going to die?""  It brings about a lot of fun anticipation.  This sequel is good in part due to the fact that is doesn't have much to live up to, I mean the first movie was about the same thing, except in the sequel ""Death"" becomes a little more creative. <br/><br/>
The acting talent is none to remember, but that is what makes it fun is the fact that you don't care to much about the characters as they get picked off.  The movie does throw a few plot twists in the mix just to make things more interesting, and it works.<br/><br/>Beware, this movie isn't for those with weak stomachs.  Along with the elaborate death scenes comes a very elaborate amount of blood.  Clearly the filmakers were hoping to win on shock value, and in this case they do.  The opening crash sequence is like none I have seen before.  IT is absolutely amazing and becomes very intense.<br/><br/>This movie is fun.  It is in no way a movie that will go down on the top 10 horror movies of all time, but for what the filmakers were trying to achieve, they did a great job.<br/><br/>For a great ""bloody"" time at the movies, I give FINAL DESTINATIOn 2 a 7/10."

","The first Final Destination was excellent. It was well-written, well-acted, well-executed. It focused more on the story than it did on the killings. Final Destination 2 was excellent in a different way. It was well-written, well-executed, and focused on the blood and guts. Notice I didn't mention the acting, which was for the most part, MST3K-worthy.<br/><br/>Story: 9/10. The story was very good. There were no inconsistencies from the first movie, and at least they had a very good reason for not using most of the original cast. Anyone who saw the first movie would know why. Kimberly Corman (A.J. Cook) has a premonition that there's going to be a major pile-up on the freeway. Like in the first movie, she stops her car in the middle of the street, preventing the people who were SUPPOSED to be involved in the pileup from being involved in the pileup. Her premonition comes true, and a rift is caused in death's design... again. Clear Rivers (Ali Larter), being the sole survivor of the first movie, becomes the experienced know-it-all who gives advice to the doomed people, who begin to die bizarre deaths, just like in the first movie (only bloodier)<br/><br/>Characters: 3/10. Many of them were unoriginal. One of them is a hardcore druggie. Really, where have we seen that before, besides almost every movie in the horror genre? <br/><br/>Acting: 4/10. A.J. Cook's performance was decent, as was Ali Larter's. The rest actually made the movie laughable, especially Terrance ""T.C.""

","Final Destination 2 is indeed a sequel worth seeing, if you have the stomach. This movie has to be by far one of the goriest films that I have ever seen. Walking into it, I thought this was going to be nothing but poor lame sequel. I was shocked how well done this film was. The up close deaths and constant suspense kept me interested. This film goes along with the old saying, ""Sequels are never as good as the Original."" But I think it's one that Final Destination 1 fans will enjoin."

","The plot is basically a rehash of the first, to me anyway. It could be almost interchangeable. However, the part they excelled on was the deaths. WAY better than the first.

","OKAY LET'S GET THE SHOW STARTED. Whenever I review a movie a set out to answer the one sole question that plagues all of our minds before we set out to go watch a new ""major motion picture"", IS THE MOVIE ENTERTAINING?  In the case of Final Destination 2, I say yes. There are really not many things wrong with this movie. Some say that the acting was terrible, come on now, I myself am something of an actor and know that an actor must become the character, I want to know if anyone that said the acting was bad has thought of how hard it would be to imagine yourself being stalked by death. Well for those that don't know it is very hard so I think the cast did a superb job for what they had to work with. There is also another thing I always like to comment on, the movie trailer. Not very many people like to comment on the trailer, well I do and if you have read this far amuse yourself and keep going. I thought that the trailer for FD2 did a great job in not giving away the movie, most movies today you can watch the trailer and know every climax, comedic element, horror moments, etc, before you even decide to go see the thing, but this one did not it, it left everything as a surprise. TO SUM UP MY RAMBLING Go see this movie if a)you liked the first one, b)you enjoy a good suspensful movie,  c)gore (oh yeah, gore baby) d)the superb opening scene e)one thing I haven't seen that many people comment on was the black humor throughout the film, i thought it was great OVERALL RATING-7/10"
"Gary Ballance","Null","0","0","10 February 2003"," Good sequel **Minor Spoilers**
","Good, faithful follow-up to the original Final Destination, released 2 years ago.<br/><br/>It starts off pretty much like the first one, with a girl [Kimberly-- A.J. Cook; Wishmaster 3] having a premonition of a huge road accident about to happen. She manages to survive, and save a few others doomed to die, but her friends aren't as lucky and she knows Death is coming back to get the survivors...<br/><br/>
The plot is basically the same, but it does pull out some interesting surprises: the tie between the new batch of potential victims and the victims of the original is, while a bit convenient, a cool tie-in to the original, one of many.<br/><br/>The death scenes are really well done, and the good thing about this film is that there's a lot more 'teasing' in this film from the director, showing a number of ways the victim could be 'offed' before following through with a brutal finish! Good work from David R Ellis. (The only thing missing from the death scenes in FD2 was the cool black shadow that accompanied the deaths in FD1).<br/><br/>The acting was good (Cook, Landes and Larter particularly) also, and I only have a few gripes about FD2: Tony Todd's cameo was even more pointless than the original, Michael Landes' character seemed to be a cop merely<br/><br/>for convenience purposes and the baby plot thread, while being the driving force of the second half, was a bit stupid. <br/><br/>Overall though it's well worth seeing- the premonition of the car crash at the start was intense, the death scenes are all great (the guy cut in 3 by the barbed wire was excellent!) and it delivers a few surprises along the way. Better than FD1? I'm not sure, but it's easily as entertaining as the original."

","Well judging from the trailer I thought this would be CRAP. Just a quick buck to make some more bling bling bling. But it's actually a 50/50 ride. Some of it is just amazing, and some other stuff is pretty crappy.<br/><br/>
First of all, I'm wondering why there is only ""one survivor"" from the first movie when there were obviously 2. But it turns out, from what I could tell, the GUY in the last movie was killed by a brick in the face? At least that's what I thought the newspaper said.<br/><br/>Anyway, same idea as the first, except the female lead, Kimberly (?) keeps having these ""visions"". I thought that was kinda lame since in FD1, there was only the 1 vision, but this chick keeps having several.<br/><br/>
I thought some of the death scenes were so well laid out it blew my mind, but others were just like ""ok, quick, time to kill someone!""<br/><br/>
They did a nice bit referring to the first movie, but overall I felt this one didn't quite measure up. The whole idea of how to ""thwart death's plan"" in this one was really really bad, and all the girls visions amounted to a pretty lame ending.<br/><br/>But, I did like it, just not as much as the first one. I'd say it gets a 6.5, the acting was actually not too bad. Some of the scenes were so intense I foudn myself just staring at the corner of the screen because I couldn't handle it anymore."

","* Crap * * Below Par * * * Worth Watching * * * * Good * * * * * Excellent WARNING *POSSIBLE SPOILERS* Having just viewed a preview screening of Final Destination 2 I have to say I was quite pleasently surprised. I quite liked the original yet failed to see the big fuss made over it. While the premise was indeed original and indeed clever the execution I fealt although not terrible could have been better. This however although not perfect is slightly better than it's predecessor. I had better warn those though who are screamish not to watch it as it's very gory. It's little wonder that it recieved a 15 certificate here in the UK. It makes you wonder about the judgement of those members of the BBFC who gave this movie the certificate it recieved. After all Scream which recieved an 18 certificate is not as graphic as what this was. As I was just about to go in the cinema I bumped into a group of friends who had just come out of a previous screening and to say one of them was shaken up was an understatemant. He had to get into a taxi as there was no way he was going to walk home. It could be argued that it's unnecessarily gory and should have left more to the imagination. That said however it does lend more impact to the deaths when they occur. Some deaths are actually quite amusing while at the samt time being horrific. The movie is also noteworthy of breaking one of the great tabbo's. The on screen deaths of a fifthteen year old boy. What makes it even more surprising or shocking is how ghastly his death is. The plot throws in a good few red herrings not only about how people are going to die but how to defeat Death itself. This is slightly lighter than the original and doesn't seem to take itself too seriously. The witty dialogue is carried off well by an able enough cast though I have to agree with one person commenting on the reactions to some of the deaths not being too convincing. Paticulary the mother who witnesses her son being crushed. I personally fealt she would have been even more hysterrical than what she was. The explanations to certian plot points could have better explained as well. Plus the premonitions as a plot device are used too much. It also leaves you wondering why the heroine has them in the first place. If they were all meant to die in the first place why was she given these visions. Devon Sawas character in the original after all only ever had the one after all. The writers though have to be complimented on how they tied in the movie with the original. They could have just done the easy thing and made a film with the same premise but was not linked at all to the previous movie. What I also liked about this and the original is the fact that from the start of the movie the characters are quite simply doomed. Like at the end of the first movie even though there are two of the characters still alive you know eventually that number is going to come up. Good doesn't win over in the end. Unlike Freddy, Jason and the like. You cannot stop this villain. It's a battlle where there can only be one winner. Final Rating: * * * *"

"flight_180","Null","0","0","8 February 2003"," A Falling Brick???? A falling brick?! What were they thinking???
","As a great fan of the original Final Destination and having seen it over 50 times (literally) I had nothing but the highest expectations for the long awaited sequel as I sat in the cinema this afternoon waiting for it to start. For two years I had wondered in vain whether Carter had really died and whether the sign had really hit him. For two years I wondered the fate of Alex and wondered where he'd be in the sequel. Except he wasn't in the sequel. Because....and this is a kinda minor spoiler- oh dear, he got hit by a falling brick to the head when he was walking along one day, and what's even better- Clear has a polaroid of his dead body on the sidewalk to prove it. The sequel could have been so much better, but instead it simply followed an identical structure to the original. Final Destination was unique, it had something that no film had ever had before, but Final Destination 2 was simply a copy of this structure which was why it ended up so predictable. The film literally is exactly the same. We have the girl and her friends going on a trip...except this time it's in a car instead of on a plane...Oooooh, that makes all the difference doesn't it? Then we have the premonition which you are supposed to believe is actually happening until she wakes up and realises 'Uh Oh...It's gonna come true.' She then proceeds to go crazy and blocks the road to stop any other cars entering the freeway..Sound familiar? Next comes the part where it actually happens before their very eyes, and the next thing, they're all at the police station being interviewed...Anyone else getting that strange sense of deja vu? What happens after that basically comprises of a load of people getting killed in even more ludicrous ways. At least the original Final Destination's deaths were slightly credible and realistic. This sequel just completely goes over the top, with such deaths as a boy running retardedly into a flock of pigeons to scare them only to end up completely disintegrated by a falling glass plate....And how could I forget the barbed wire fence being catapulted through the air, chopping off some poor guys arms and tearing his body in half...I mean for Christ's sake, at least give the audience some credit, we aren't that stupid. Kimberley tries so hard to be the new 'Alex' but fails miserably. There can never be any replacement for Alex, Alex was just Alex and nobody can ever replace him. Another thing is that Final Destination was so refreshing as none of the characters had a clue what was going on, they were all genuinely confused and scared and that's what made it so edgy and tense. In the sequel, they're all just like, ""Yeah yeah, so we've all gotta look out for the signs and we know it all already."" The most annoying thing about this sequel was that the characters took themselves far too seriously and couldn't even see how ridiculous and laughable the script had become. By the time they were all in the car and started going, ""Oh my god...I just remembered, I nearly died once, I was on a bus and a girl got killed by it."" I practically had my head in my hands from the sheer cringe worthyness of it all. I'm not saying this sequel is a bad movie. I guess I just felt cheated and let down by the fact that I had such high hopes for it, only for it to turn out to be nothing like I'd expected. The characters are nowhere near as likeable as those in the first and to be honest I didn't even care when they died...I was just like 'whatever'. So go and see this movie if you want a good laugh or if you haven't seen the first one. I think people who hadn't seen the original would find this a lot more interesting as they haven't seen the format before. However if like me you are a huge fan of the original be prepared to feel just a tad disappointed. I wish Alex had been in the sequel! Oh Devon Sawa, how could you? He really was the one that held the entire film together, and without him the sequel just isn't the same. Okay, so we have Clear, but this time around she just thinks shes ace and it's all a little tiresome. Oh well...."

I was hesitant at first with a new director and the absence of Devon Sawa, but I am pleased to report that the result is deserving of being a sequel to Final Destination; even though the title here doesn't fit as nicely without a plane crash - but what else would you call it?<br/><br/>A good sequel gives you more of what you liked from the first one and new twists to keep you from saying, ""been there, done that"" or, ""I should've stayed home and rented the first one.""  FD2 has wonderful new twists that help it to rise above the typical sequel.  Yes, it's got more twisted fun that made FD such a kick, and it's done in an even more playful fashion. Best of all is how FD2 relates itself to FD.  That is what ""made"" the movie for me.  Where FD2 lacks is in its overall sense of foreboding, which really gave FD its charm.  Still, it is a nice complement to FD and shouldn't be missed for fans of the original.<br/><br/>As for those who rip this movie to shreds based on acting/story, etc. This is not Oscar material here.

Now in Final Destination 2 A.J. Cook has premonitions but she's awake all the time she able to see them... and the fact that she gets them out of nowhere and can even look back on them, it's like she has a gift for predicting death.  I just think it's stupid because Devon Sawa saw signs of death happening like a reflection of a train and a bus in a window and the torn up piece of paper that said Todd.<br/><br/>Two more problems I had with the movie were you were never told what happened to Alex (Devon Sawa)and the opening premonition... hasn't anyone heard of breaks???"

","WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD<br/><br/>This movie is an OK sequel to the first film. Not nearly as good, and lacks the jolt-in-your-seat surprises such as the death-by-bus and the shrapnel decapitation from Part 1. The deaths are gorier, but not as effective. Oh, and the ending is silly and kind of a letdown. Plus the explanation for how to cheat death this time (something involving bringing new life to even things out) needs to be clearer. But other than that, I've seen much worse sequels to good movies, and the highway pileup at the beginning more than matches the last one's plane explosion.<br/><br/>The movie introduces a rather sad futility for the characters, if you think about it. Out of the characters in Part 1, only Clear (Ali Larter) is alive in this chapter. (It's revealed that Carter didn't survive the falling sign in Paris, and Alex, our hero who predicted the plane crash, was killed by a falling brick shortly thereafter.) Clear doesn't make it through this movie alive. Which means that no matter what Kimberly and Officer Burke managed to do to cheat death here, they have about as long to live as the last batch of victims!"

The story, although no longer original, came up with a nice twist to deaths antics and design as he tried to clear up his mess from flight 180 which occurred a year before.<br/><br/>The acting for the most part was ok, this is just a horror movie and not a beautiful mind®. W<br/><br/>The special effect were... well.... special! The gore, death scenes and destruction were just refreshing. To much are we cushioned from the real horror of blood splatter and entrails. Some directors think it is much more effective to ""suggest"" the horror rather than show it, but this has become very monotonous and now lacks any impact whatsoever. Kudos to FD for showing us what we have so long desired.<br/><br/>The directing looks pretty good and had a nice style. The pace of the movie runs very smoothly and quick, keeping us on the edge of our seats.<br/><br/>Camera work is very nice also. Good angles, lighting and mood presence all with a quality sound track.<br/><br/>Hope you enjoyed my review, now go enjoy the movie."

","Final Destination 2 was much more visually oriented than the original. The death scenes all to the hospital were magnificant.

I was surprised by the killing off of some main characters and the killing of a 15 yr old. A studio actually broke horror movie rules!<br/><br/>Don't go into this expecting Dead-Alive because it's not that gorey. This film deserves its R rating.

","Everything I write could be a spoiler,....read at your own risk. I would like to say that Final Destination 2 was extremely crazy. Everybody died and stuff, and that group of people were pretty much around death all the time. Be careful, you will laugh when the kid gets smashed by a window pane. Yeah and alot of people die and a specifically cool scene is in the very beginning when the main character chik sees the whole crash happening before it does. And the theme sidetracks into some of the characters doing drugs (like the crack head)."

","I just saw this movie, and I hated it. This movie was horrible and disgusting. The first one was much better. They leave nothing to the imagination, which makes it horrible. Another example of this is ""Hannibal"" and ""Silence of the Lambs."" ""Silence"" left everything to the imagination, and used a minimal amount of blood and gore, but ""Hannibal"" came with it's blood and guts and everything, and it ruined it. The same with Final Destination. They show EVERYTHING. I walked out of the theater about 10 minutes through the movie. It's such a shame they would make this type of movie."

"jaxstephens","7","0","0","2 February 2003"," Entertaining, but not as effective as the original.
","Okay, so sequels are rarely as good as the originals, and this is yet another case that confirms this. However, the film was still somewhat entertaining to watch, so it wasn't a total loss. The original was a very well-told story that simply creeped you out. It had a dark, foreboding feeling to it, which is exactly what this type of movie should have. Also, it didn't attempt to explain very much, instead leaving much to the viewer's imagination, which is often the most effective way to approach these topics.<br/><br/>Final Destination 2 lacks all of the characteristics I just mentioned. The acting is so absolutely horrible, and the dialogue is lame, too. While I enjoyed how the writers tried to tie this movie to the first, the overall story was simply idiotic and flawed, mainly due to explaining more than we need to know. (And what was that crap about ""a new life"" clearing the list? Please!) Most unforgivingly of all, though, this movie lacks that creepy feeling the first one had. Instead, Final Destination 2 is mainly concerned with delivering the strangest and goriest deaths possible. If that is fun enough for you, then this is the movie for you.<br/><br/>To sum things up, here are some helpful recommendations: * If you haven't seen the original, go see it first. * If you really, really liked the original, then see the sequel. * If you didn't like or only mildly enjoyed the original, then stay away from the sequel. * If you like gore flicks, see this one. It's a little more explicitly bloody than most mainstream American films."

"shilfiell","5","0","0","1 February 2003"," More gruesome but not as clever
","Mild spoilers will appear throughout!<br/><br/>I'm a big fan of the original movie, and took the day off from work to see the premiere of its sequel.  After the first premonition scene and the first real death (which reminded me of Val Lewton's in the first) I was optimistic about this version.  After the promising start, though, things go downhill - the deaths are rushed but become the sole focus of the rest of the movie.  The characters are completely flat.  Plot is negligible.  I never really got a feel for the sequence like I did in the original, and continuity between the two films was lousy.  Granted, the first film botched up the ""switched seats"" order, but that film had a sense to it that I found lacking in the sequel.  Consider:  in the first film, Alex was without a pulse before being revived, yet he didn't end the cycle.  Why would the same circumstance work for Kimberly?  And what was Eugene's tie-in to Val Lewton again?  Did it make any sense at all?  Why did Rory see the hook vision?  OK, and I felt really cheated that Alex from the original was killed by a stupid brick.<br/><br/>I enjoyed all the little tricks in the first movie - all the hidden 180's, the altered set and posters in the airport, the clever character names and in-jokes.  The sequel suffers from the departure of the original writing team, I think - they had a lot more fun with their film. The only thing that came close in this one was the magnetic refrigerator letters, but that was a bit too obvious for my tastes.<br/><br/>As far as the deaths, I give them a mixed review.  The deaths in the hospital weren't nearly gory enough, the elevator incident looked extremely fake, the slice-and-dice was cool but the body fell wrong. I liked the first, the last, the pile-up, and the second impalement.<br/><br/>In the first, I liked the fact that our character didn't die the way it LOOKED like he might - but it seemed like overkill when they used the same type of misdirection later, in the dentist's office and with the leaking gasoline.  There wasn't a single death that made me jump like Terry's in the first, in any case.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the movie and it had its redeeming moments.  The ending and Rory's speech to Kimberly after he handed her his keys, plus Tony Todd's disappointingly brief appearance, were all pluses.  Overall, though, I prefer the original.  If you haven't seen the DVD version with the director's commentary, watch it and see how much truly clever stuff you missed.  The first film left me wondering about fate and inevitability: the second film made me wonder, after each death, only ""OK, who's next and how?"""

It was hard to watch at times- due to the graffic nature of the deaths and I'm a horror fan but this film was a bit over the top. If they do make a third film I hope they spend a little more time on developing at least one of the characters so you care if they die or not, actually Michael Landes was pretty good and had to carry the film by himself. Just like the first they wasted a talented Tony Todd - who actually had more lines in this one. One thing I really missed were the cool sound effects from the first one whenever ""Death"" was coming - it sounded like a death rattle. And after watching FD2 I noticed the similarities in appearance between the gorgeous Ali Larter and the stunning Deborah Unger. It's weird how similar in appearance these two hotties are. Someone needs to write sister roles for these two!! Only 10 years difference in age! Anyway, Fatesmagician gives FD2 5 out of 10 and props for brining the gore back to horror films.<br/><br/>

I haven't felt an audience engaged with a flick like that in years. Sure, a lot of people were jeering teen Anakin in Episode 2, and those same people were cheering Yoda when he went off. FD2 elicited a sustained series of groans, laughs, and screams that was a beauty to behold.<br/><br/> Without giving anything away, those responses are well earned.<br/><br/> FD2 crosses the line over and over, making you cringe and squirm and laugh because you know it's going to happen all over again.<br/><br/> Anyone who has seen the trailer will not be surprised to find out that FD2 has one of the most over-the-top car crash sequences ever filmed. Having personally been in accidents numbering in the double-digits, I can say that this film made me more scared of automobiles than all of those accidents combined.<br/><br/> ""Final Destination 2"" may just be another stupid movie with a lot of blood and guts, but it seems to know that and it just wants to have a good time. It sees the potential in the great idea in the original and plays it out the way it should be played.<br/><br/> Go see it with a crowd on the weekend, and make sure you're in a rough hood where everyone is ready to see some of the grisliest deaths collected into one fast ride of a movie."

","The first ""Final Destination"" film was entertaining and creative as a group of students tried to outwit death... now comes the sequel.. is it as good as the original? No.. not even close. Is it entertaining in it's own right? Yes, to a point. The lead character this time is played by A.J. Cook, a young actress who seems to be popping up in many of these thriller films these days. She plays Kimberly, a girl who has a vision that forshadows a freeway crash that kills herself and many others. She blocks traffic and saves a handfull of people, while others die in the gruesome tragedy. And this movie does not skimp on the violence or gore like many other films these days do. The death scenes in this one are quite gruesome. Of course death starts picking off the survivors in freak accidents and Kimberly goes off to find the only survivivng character from the first film (Ali Larter, looking like she's phoning this one in after cashing what was probably a decent size check for a fairly small part). The film is entertaining on its own face, but does have problems. The conections to the first film are tenuous and seem forced and rather silly and the acting (with the exception of Cook, who does a servicable job) is bad, even by these films standards. The story has enough twists and turns and false scares to provide a decent ride, though understanding all the hookum about death and how to trick him is rather mind boggling, the ending is as silly as can be.  Still, its entertaining enough and has some cool effects and gore scenes so that the less discriminating horror fans should enjoy it. GRADE: C"

**WARNING MINOR SPOILERS** I will remember FDII more just because of the violence.  This is one of the most extremely violent movies I have ever seen.  The director obviously wants to go for the over the top semi-funny death scenes.  We get to see people decapitated, sliced, stabbed, and blown up.  The difference between this film and many of the same genre is the cameras never turn away.  You see the violence and they are very good special effects.  If you pay attention, you will know how the character is going to die.  I think this was intentional by the director in order to try and build tension.<br/><br/>The movie deserves credit for it's creativity but there but besides a spectacular freeway wreck scene, there is nothing that stands out about this film other than excess gore.  It is not scary, does not build tension, nor is it thought provoking.  The creativity in the death scenes makes it just above average.  This is probably a must see for horror fans but this will not bring new viewers to the horror genre.<br/><br/>Rating 6 out of 10."

What kind of movie did you think you'd be seeing? The fact is that when you sit through a movie like FD2, it should be with the understanding that these movies ARE about who gets it next and how. <br/><br/>There was zero character development. The music was less than spectacular. The editing was slightly amateurish. But the impact of the death scenes was so powerful that the rest of this becomes incidental. It's impossible not to leave this movie looking over your shoulder and feeling completely paranoid about a split second death you can't see coming. I for one did not want to drive home after that opening sequence (which was unbelievably well done!). This is a popcorn film. It had one goal. I think it accomplished it masterfully.

Even if u were able to predict who was gonna die, it aways managed to throw you off in terms of the way they got killed.  It was also very interesting how all of these characters were somehow linked to the bunch from the 1st Final Destination, whether it had somethin' to do w/ riding the bus that hit Terry Chaney or replacing Ms. Lewton @ Mt. Abraham HS, etc. etc. I will give u a hint that the past does catch up w/ a particular somebody in this movie too, but like I said there were some extremely gruesome death scenes like the elevator scene, the barbed wire slicing someone up and not to mention two people getting impaled pretty violently. Death pulls off an intense rebound in the beginning after the pile-up but I will leave it at a subliminal that!

","NOTE:  SPOILERS<br/><br/>I saw this movie after very much enjoying the first one, even though this second one was panned by critics.  I must say that it was one of the most suspenseful as well as disturbing movies I have seen.  Even though the beginning and end scenes are very grotesque, they are inventive, wonderful stunts/special effects, and again, a great ending.  Warning:  as said in the reason for the R rating, this is a very graphic and realistic movie and portrayal of death, more so than the first one.  It has all of the elements of the FD1, but more suspenseful, more gory, and generally much better. Plus, there is a link between both movies. In the opening accident sequence, in addition to wonderfully done stunts, there is A LOT of blood and gore.  A man is decapitated by a flying log, there are many explosions, a man is squashed by his motorcycle. Later on, a man is impaled by the leg of an escape ladder.  After chasing pigeons, a young boy is smashed by a heavy sheet of glass and you can see blood and body matter clearly.  Another man is chopped in half and after seeing his body fall apart, we see his intestines. Last, although it is a sad and disturbing scene (because it involves the graphics death of a young boy), the ending is beautifully done (the death is not beautiful, just the way it was executed) with a dash of humor.  I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone, especially those who are a fan of horror movies.  Just again, a note of warning, this is a very violent, graphics, gory, and realistic movie.

It kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time. I wouldn't say it's the best movie ever made or the worst movie ever made. It is kind of in between. If you are a horror movie fan or like blood and guts, see this movie! Grade: B-"

","Final Destination didn't need a sequel in the first place, but I guess all those gore-hungry teens and their wallets were too much to pass by. If you've seen Final Destination then you've seen part two already, they are exactly the same. Kimberly is on a road trip with her friends, foresees their deaths and many others' in a huge traffic accident, wakes from the premonition, saves several people from getting on the freeway, the survivors start to die...wow, how original, add in a plane and you've got the first movie again! Magic! The script is Final Destination with new characters and new deaths. The dialogue is very corny, I felt embarrassed to be watching a movie where every character goes ""What are you talking about?"" or ""What's going on?"" every other minute, as if that line hasn't been used in horror movies over and over to the point it's a cliche in itself. Plus, it just adds to the bad acting. The girl playing Kimberly is serviceable and of course Ali Larter is fine, but the other ""actors"" must have done this between their commercial shoots. It's bad. The body count is the only thing the movie is concerned with, and that's no surprise. Everything just leads up to another deathtrap in which someone dies in a horribly gory way. If you don't like blood, stay away. Really there's nothing much to look forward to except to see who's going to bite it and how. There's some bogus subplot about how only new life can defeat death, but it's very cheesy and uninteresting, just like the movie. The opening car pileup is neatly choreographed but brought down by the bad acting and amateur music, which should have been more impactful. Ali Larter should have stayed away just like Devon Sawa and made a real movie where she gets better lines and a chance to show she has talent. Her lines are bad, just like everyone elses'. The movie takes itself way too seriously at parts that it's embarrassing how corny it all is.<br/><br/>The first film was no masterpiece, but it was a serviceable thriller with a fine cast. There is no one in this sequel with a bit of acting talent observed from the first cast. I'm sure this movie will be an embarrassment to Kerr Smith, Devon Sawa, and surely Ali Larter since all it does is give the first one a bad name. Yep, they've turned Final Destination into a franchise. This one is not even half as good as the first and the direction, music, and acting minus Larter is rock bottom. If you like gore and no more, treat yourself. Otherwise, the creepiness and deft craft of the first film is absent and cheesiness takes over. Stay away if you can help it, death should have taken this film."

","I am a huge fan of the first Final Destination film. I would give it a rating of a 9/10. Needless to say I was looking forward to the sequel. So after talking about it for months with my friends, today was opening day and I went to see it. When it started out, I was like oh man this is going to suck because we had drug jokes, a flashing biker chick, and lots of bad acting by everyone in the movie except the main character Kimberly. Then two minutes later the movie got exciting with the best scene in the movie and from that scene on I was hooked. I watched it and enjoyed it. I was very entertained but the only thing that really bothered me was the acting. Ali Larter was still good as Clear Rivers, A. J.  Cook did a decent job in the role as Kimberly and Michael Landes as Officer Thomas Burke did a very good job, but everyone else should go back to acting class because their acting was incredibly poor. <br/><br/>Now what I did like about the movie was the deaths. They were just as good as the deaths in the first film. The deaths were a bit bloodier this time around and for some reason caused some laughs which really confused me. I think the bloodier deaths were supposed to make up for the bad acting =). The Deaths were cool, the plot was interesting, the acting from the 3 main characters was decent, but the acting from everyone else was horrible. So if you liked final destination 1 then see the sequel, it won't disappoint on following the same plot and pace as the first one,  as long as you can get over the bad acting from the supporting cast you will enjoy yourself. My rating for Final Destination 2 would be a 7/10."

","Back in 2000, Final Destination was kind of a surprise mini-hit at the U.S. box office, with a $53 million domestic gate. Critics didn't generally care for it, but I sort of enjoyed the youth-targeted entry in the horror/slasher genre. It had a modicum of ingenuity, maintained an ominous tone, and managed to pull off some creative deaths which seemed to come jarringly out of nowhere. Oh, sure, it used the same old formula, but at least it handled everything pretty well.<br/><br/>In that first film, a teenager pulled his friends off a plane based on a premonition that they would all die. The plane did blow up, but ol' Mr Death was mighty ticked off at being cheated, so he eventually caught up with them and killed them in the same order in which they would have died if they ha d stayed in their seats.<br/><br/>Death has always been a sore loser! He makes John McEnroe look as gracious and white-bread noble as Lou Gehrig. Hell, he's still hacked off about losing that chess game in The Seventh Seal.<br/><br/>This year's sequel takes place on the anniversary of that first plane crash. In the latest development, a young girl has a premonition of a massive pile-up on the interstate highway, so she uses her car to prevent her friends and some others from using the on-ramp. The pile-up does occur, so she saves many lives, but Mr Death is still being a poor sport in the sequel, and he starts immediately to kill off the people who were spared unduly.<br/><br/>Um ... assuming that makes sense to you so far, it pretty much stops making sense there. The girl with the premonition goes to a mental institution to visit the one girl who survived the airplane incident in the original movie. (Ali Larter, who appears in both films and has enough talent that she should have a better career than this.) Together, the girls go to visit that Candyman dude with the really low voice, who is apparently in this movie because his own horror series has run out of sequels. He's supposed to be an expert in death, and he mutters some profoundly spooky stuff which makes little sense but sounds important, so the survivors mull it over for the rest of the film. He tells them that ""only a new life can defeat death"".<br/><br/>
Before the survivors can figure out the precise meaning of Candyman's advice, they come up with several misinterpretations of the cryptic remarks, and most of them end up dying in nasty ways - their bowels chopped out and their nostrils raped and ... well, for the details, consult the Sir Robin song in Monty Python and the Holy Grail. Will any survive? You have to watch it to see.<br/><br/>The sequel does not have the talented Devon Sawa. It has none of the jarring surprise engendered by the Rube Goldberg deaths that marked the first film. It also has very little of the macabre wit that powered the original, the only real exception occurring in the very last ten seconds of the film. Mostly it just has scenes which depict the explicit dismemberment, piercing, decapitation, and fricasseeing of various humans, and the distribution of their remains in unpleasant places.<br/><br/>Although the original Final Destination was a popular film with young audiences at home and abroad, most critics hated it. I rather enjoyed that first one in a guilty pleasure sense, but I didn't consider the sequel worth watching at all."

","***WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SOME SPOILERS SO IF YOU DON'T WANT THIS MOVIE SPOILED FOR YOU, DON'T READ ON. JUST KNOW THAT I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU VIEWING IT BECAUSE IT IS ONE OF THE BETTER HORROR MOVIES AROUND*** <br/><br/>I still remember seeing this movie opening weekend on a cold night in 2003. It was one of the best movie-going experiences of my life. This is how you properly make a sequel. Final Destination 2 is my favorite movie in the franchise for many reasons: <br/><br/>1.) The Continuity from the first movie. Clear Rivers (played by the brilliant and beautiful Ali Larter)having survived the first movie, checked herself into a mental hospital so she could be safe from Death. One day she gets a visit from a woman named Kimberly who needs her advice since Clear ""beat"" Death in the first movie. Kimberly and the survivors of the pile-up need her help so they can stay alive. The essence of continuity is ever present in this movie and one aspect I appreciated was Clear's matured role. Her character really evolved and matured from a damsel in distress in the first movie to the smart, tough leading lady in this one.<br/><br/>2.) The Vision. I still get chills running up my spine thinking about this highway pile-up scene in the beginning. I didn't think they could beat the vision from the first movie but they did. I remember experiencing heart palpitations in the theater because it was so intense.<br/><br/>3.) The Characters. Normally in a horror movie, the audience doesn't care about the characters. They just want to see how gory their deaths are going to be. What sets this film apart is that I actually cared about these characters, so when they died, it was more upsetting and emotional. The only thing I didn't like was that they killed off Clear Rivers at the end. But in keeping with the movie's theme, I learned to accept this because it shows that when your time is up, no one can really cheat death.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie even if you're not a horror fan. The death scenes are very intense/gory and unexpected giving it a massive fear factor. This should serve as a model for great horror movie sequels right next to A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors. Final Destination 2 stayed with me long after I saw it and remains to this day one of my top 10 favorite horror movies.<br/><br/>BUT BEWARE: THIS MOVIE IS NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART."
"Anyoneatnowhere","2","2","5","2 January 2008"," Sucked
","Yeah this movie was about as lame as a teen-thriller flick can get. The accident at the start was cool because it was so ridiculously over the top but you soon realise that they're trying to be serious when they show you stuff like that. Just before it we see a series of signs that something bad is going to happen... like a kid banging together toy trucks. Whatever could that mean? Some of the deaths are so unbelievable that no amount of editing, camera shaking and screaming is going to convince me of what's about to happen. Like the lady that gets decapitated in the elevator. Her pony or plait gets caught on pile of prosthetic limbs?! If there were any good parts I might have missed them because I stopped paying attention about 20 mins into the movie. The plot is recycled Hollywood garbage and acting isn't any better. The only thing that kept me watching was the hope that the main characters would soon die in some agonising way and put me out of my misery.<br/><br/>I do like to give films a chance to impress me, which is why I watch them (even bad ones) all the way through. This, though, was utter s hite."

","when i found out that final destination 2 had come out i was so excited to see it i just thought wow but i also thought it cant be any better then the first final destination,no-way ,but when i watched it i couldn't chose which one was the best . with the big pile up on the motor way and how realistic the vision was ,and with the music it made you think oh whats going to happen here .The weirdest deaths were when the man got the ladder in his eye ,when the women was in the car and got the pole in her head and when the womens head was chopped of by the elevator.It sent a shiver down my spin .but what i also found great was when Eugene wanted to end his life so that he wouldn't die a horrible death,he went to shoot himself but none of the bullet's came out even though the gun was full.it was a fantastic carry on to final destination 1 the graphics of each persons death were brilliant especially when the man is cut up by the fence .and the clues that were shown e.g man with hooks ,birds and also bloody hands were great .altogether the film was just incredible to watch!!!!!!I've watched it that many times the DVD will probably brake loll!!!!!"
"luridlarry","1","2","5","4 September 2003"," Best laugh I've had in a loooong time...
","In a movie that goes out of its way to explain Death's reasoning through characters who have rootless epiphanies as the plot necessitates, I find it amazing that nobody questions the convoluted methods Death utilizes in order to go about what, for him, is routine business. Death can, it seems, create these imaginitive and complicated Rube Goldberg chain reactions that result in a demise out of left field, but cannot simply give someone a heart attack, or enlist a goon to shoot them in the face. I must admit, after only catching twenty minutes of the film, I was postulating some very imaginitive manners in which I might slay the filmmakers for the obscene amount of money they no doubt made creating something that would fetch a ""c"" in a Junior High film and video class.<br/><br/>The movies message seems to be: People shouldn't die. The writers, if they believe in what they wrote, must actually operate under the asinine notion that the world would be a better place if nobody died.<br/><br/>But, I must admit, that rarely have I laughed harder than the scene following the dentists office fiasco. That was gold."

The film doesn't generate the slightest hint of suspense or interest and is unbelievably predictable - you know they are going to die, you just dont know in what kind of sick manner.

","One year on from the events that followed the destruction of Flight 180, Kimberly Corman and her friends are on a trip. On the road Kimberley has a vision of a horrific pile up and stops her car, blocking the access road. When the accident occurs Kimberley survives and has saved many other drivers. However when the survivors start to die in mysterious circumstances, Kimberley contacts Clear Rivers who survived the 180 flight and finds that death is coming after each of them in turn.<br/><br/>I saw this with family and had no voice in the choice. I only semi-enjoyed the first film and couldn't see this being any better. The start of the film (i.e. the crash) is powerful and pretty well done - it is horrific, scary and very unsettling. However after this the film settles back into the rut it was in the second half of last time. In place of genuine scares the film goes for gore by killing each person in increasingly unlikely and gory ways. If this is your thing then you'll enjoy it, however I wanted more than just effects and gore. There is no tension and no scares - as a horror it works in terms of gore but nothing else.<br/><br/>The characters are simply meat and nothing more - the film could have been 15 minutes long by cutting out all the pointless plot and just having the death scenes together. I felt no interest in any of these people and the majority of them were just given enough presence to make an impact when they were killed. I find this type of laziness really annoying - the makers just wanted the cinematic equivalent of a slaughter house, no substance or meaning, just a production line of body parts. I usually write a little about the actors and their performances when i do reviews but here it would be a waste of my time as no-one actually gave a performance worth talking about. They stuck in my mind only because of how they died. Only the Candyman added interest in a minor role.<br/><br/>Even as a horror movie this is a messy failure. It has one good scene that is terrifying but after that nothing - just one more protracted list of red herrings leading to the eventual gory death scene. I found it offensive that someone felt I would want to spend 90 minutes watching people be cut up and killed in gory ways without having anything else to offer. No characters, no plot (other than a rehash of the last film), nothing new, no spark, no flair, no good performances, few real scares and basically a real lazy and unnecessary sequel. Like I said - I found this gory film to be offensive, dull and quite unpleasant to watch. Avoid it or you'll only be encouraging the producers to come back for a third one - and no one wants that."

","This movie wasn't scary. In order for a movie to be scary there needs to be suspense. When the movie gives the order of the deaths before they happen you know who gets it and when. Where's the suspense?<br/><br/>This movie was just an excuse for gore. Nothing scary, funny or intelligent in this one. The writers of this movie thought they were clever but were far from it. I hated this movie so much.<br/><br/>The plot was totally stupid. I got it after reading the box or hearing the characters say over and over that you can't cheat death. If you are supposed to die you are supposed to die no way to beat it. But even here they are inconsistent. So many plot holes in this one - the premise at least needs to work and it doesn't. Why was one character not able to comment suicide yet and another was? Answer: because it was convenient for the story.<br/><br/>This movie was just an excuse to show as much gore as possible. They would try to scare you that one gory thing would happen but another did. Very tasteless excuse to be as gory as possible. Why couldn't death just make someone stop breathing? No, they had to torture someone by having them go through hell at the dentist office then squash them like a tomato - a kid none the less. They had to totally drag out a decapitation. Even the crash scene at the beginning was way over done - everyone had to die a gross way in the crash.<br/><br/>My stepson said it best: I've seen this movie before. It was called Final Destination 1. I myself didn't see Final Destination 1 before, but believe it because nothing in this movie seemed clever even watching this sequel to an 'original' movie I hadn't seen.<br/><br/>At least in Friday the 13th there was Jason, in Night Mare on Elmstreet there was Freddy, in Halloween there was Michael Meyers, and even in Childs Play there was Chuckie - there was no visible bad guy in this one.<br/><br/>This movie was total garbage even by horror movie standards. I felt disgusted with myself for even watching this crap. A friend borrowed me this DVD - thank god it was his money not mine. If you want to see horror and be scared see Freddy vs Jason instead of this piece of garbage. Did I say I HATED this movie yet???"

This one sees a terrifying chain reaction, murder pile up on a highway, and you guessed it, the lucky survivors, a group of drug/sex crazed teens of today's generation, save for the head of the group, a much more responsible chick, Kimberly, plus others, are the ones who must pay for cheating death. This includes lotto winner, Evan, where his chain of events, leading to a gruesome demise are simply ironic. This is as much fun as the first film, if more, where again the franchise here, didn't know when to stop. Kimberly seeks answers from the only survivor, Crystal (Ali Larter) of the first, who's barricaded herself away in a cell in a mental facility, from which she should of stayed. Too here, we have a different path of death which made for an interesting twist. FD 2 doesn't let go of the fear factor either, the inescapable of the survivors who try to challenge it, instead of burrowing themselves away in a psycho cell, which as referring to the original, put a cruel and nasty spin on. And in a finale, again, you better keep your guard, up too. When will people learn too, never to light up at a servo."
"StevePulaski","8","1","2","10 August 2011"," Remains on the right track.
","Here we have sequel, that is essentially the same as the first film, but provides a lot more thrills and a lot more special effects than the first. Final Destination 2 has the same scheme as its predecessor - the hero of the film, this time a female named Kimberly (Cook), is on a road-trip with her best friend and her two pot smoking buddies. She has a premonition on the road that she is one of the many victims to a deadly traffic pileup. She blocks the on-ramp so no one can get by, the premonition comes true, various people survive, but are then killed off in the order they would've died if she hadn't blocked the road. There we have Final Destination 2.<br/><br/>It's safe to say we get more of a variety in our characters this time around. In the original, it was all students aboard a flight to Paris. This time, we have a student, a mother, a teacher, a lottery winner, a pregnant women, a drug-addict, a self-centered woman, and a police officer. Clear Rivers (Larter) from the original film returns here to pair up with Kimberly and police officer Thomas Burke (Landes) to try and stop death's design.<br/><br/>The idea is we all have a fate, but the flaw is we can cheat it. In this case, Kimberly and the crew's fate was to die in the pileup, but due to her lucky premonition everyone is saved. After you cheat death and save yours and many other lives the only way you can prevent the rest of the gang from dying is for the person who had the premonition to commit suicide or have a child being born, creating new life somehow saving the rest of the people. You're better off not to question the idea, and just go along for the ride.<br/><br/>The special effects in this are sub-par to the first film. The problem with the first film was that some of the death sequences were at night, and some, didn't involved many crafty designs, or twists and turns, most likely because it was the first of its kind. They didn't know their standard. But still, Final Destination had some memorable and quite impressive death scenes. Especially when you consider frequent hidden hints and ""180"" appearances.<br/><br/>Final Destination 2 offers a bit more build-up by showing something falling, shifting, sliding, moving, etc. The trigger effect that leads to these deaths is perfect, and reminds me why I love this franchise. It can go above and beyond everything if it just remains realistic and plausible.<br/><br/>There are a few problems sadly. For one thing, some scenes in the morgue and the mental-institute are poor build-ups to the main event. They last long, and tend to ramble. It's best to try and make the rule make sense to you, rather than listen to a bunch of people talk about it. My advice; watch the first film. Watch it again. Get an idea of how this design works, and then continue to watch the remaining films in the franchise. Eventually, it will come to you. Patience is a virtue.<br/><br/>One question I asked myself in the first film was ""Why Alex?"" Up until about halfway through, I asked ""Why Kimberly?"" The film provides logical information on why it's Kimberly's turn to have the premonition. But I still I have two questions; (1) Why does this premonition aspect exist if its purpose is to mess up Death's plan? Don't you think Death (I love how I'm using him as a real person right now) would try everything to stop this premonition? And the premonition sequence lasted about four minutes in this film. You couldn't tell me Kimberly sat stopped on the on-ramp, in utter silence with two talkative pot-buddies in the back seat and her annoying blonde friend without them shaking her or talking to her, and no one from other cars behind her came up to knock on her window. They took all the plausibility, pumped it into the death sequences in the film, but at the same time, drained it from the events leading up to the deaths. Never heard of that happening.<br/><br/>Clearly, I'm over-analyzing what is supposed to be an enjoyable horror flick. That it was. Final Destination still remains calm, and not cocky, and cartoonish like one would think. While some franchises get carried away, for now, Final Destination is on the right track.<br/><br/>Starring: Ali Larter, A. J. Cook, Michael Landes, and Tony Todd. Directed by: David R. Ellis."
"callanvass","5","1","2","24 April 2010"," Honestly? I found it to be a pretty stupid affair..
","Slight Spoilers so if you haven't seen the movie, don't read.<br/><br/>Final Destination 2 is a perfect example of how to tarnish a great original. I know plenty of people who actually loved this film, even more than the 1st, and while that's great and all, it can't even touch the 1st. For starters Final Destination 2 is clearly lacking in the Suspense department, and that's one of the reasons that made the original so great, here it's focused on making as many gruesome and creative death sequences as possible. I admit I had fun with the Death sequences, but most of the characters that got them, I was glad to see go due to them being unlikable. I completely disagreed with the killing of Clear's character, and the explanation for Alex's death was pretty lame if you ask me. The opening car accident scene is the reason to see this movie, it was by far the best part in the movie, it was extremely well done.<br/><br/>Performances. Ali Larter shows up to reprise her role as Clear. Despite top billing, she is NOT a main character, at least not like you may think. She's rocking the gorgeous blonde locks, and does what she can with the silly material, but the script pretty much wastes her. A.J. Cook is decent but overdid it at times in my opinion. She's cute no doubt about that, but I didn't buy her fully like I should have. Michael Landes is OK as the Cop heroine, but didn't really have much of a character, his character development was pretty crappy. Keegan Connor Tracy is alright as the snobby business executive. Terrence 'T.C.' Carson is funny and annoying at the same time as Eugene. Tony Todd makes another cameo in the same role as the 1st. Jonathan Cherry is a riot as the coke fiend, I got a kick out of him.<br/><br/>Bottom line. Final Destination 2 had its moments, but in the end I found it to be rather stupid and insulting. It's played for laughs a lot, and kinda ruins the original's reputation. I loved this movie when I was younger, but thankfully i've smartened up since then.

Cook.She's cute and I like her.And that's not because the way she acted.There is a big problem with filming the second movie because there aren't many movies who were better then first one.And that is a problem,you always expect better.I didn't like the whole movie and specially that scene with the birds.It is so obvious that it is taken from Hitchcock's ""Birds"".Also it's a shame that movie like this should even be mentioned in the same contest with brilliant ""Birds"".When you put all together you realize that you spend 90 minutes of your life on something that you could skip.Don't watch it and you won't regret it.Nothing new and nothing original to be seen."
"Juan_from_Bogota","2","1","2","2 March 2007"," The story of a female Nostradamus
","The story of a female Nostradamus version of the young one in final destination 1 is brought back here, the story is similar, only that the facts are quite different and the characters are new. Kimberly (aka female Nostradamus), has a lot of support with the people involved in the accident, this is different from the first movie; and when the things are ""easier"" for someone, the movie also lose some tension. The characters are all together supporting themselves trying to protect between them from their final destiny, with good visual effects and a lot of interesting and original deaths. (Sorry if this sound sadist!). Why i didn't like the movie?, well is just because in comparison with the first movie has very deficiencies (in my personal opinion): (1) This movie doesn't have the tension of the first, you see deaths but don't feel the level of drama of the first. (2) The story goes to a level at which you start to don't believe the events, are unreal and obvious at some moments. (3) You expect to see an even better movie when you already know the thematic, and you get disappointed when you watch an inferior movie. Well is my personal opinion but as always you have to see it for yourselves and make your own critic.<br/><br/>ABOUT THE MOVIE: This story is held one year after the plane crash of the first movie, where Kimberly Corman (A. J. Cook) predicts a deadly accident on a high speed road, where a lot of people will die, she then stops and avoid death, her friends die in the accident after she stepped out of the car and it was crashed by another car, but with her, some other people escaped from dead; as the first movie, death follow each one of them to fulfill its purpose, they held together in order to stay alive; the group followed by dead are: police officer Thomas Burke (Michael Landes), Eugene Dix (Terrence T.C. Carson), a black boy skeptic of dead, Rory Peters (Jonathan Cherry), a rock style guy, Kat Jennings (Keegan Connor Tracy), a beautiful girl, Nora Carpenter (Lynda Boyd) a mother and her son Tim Carpenter (James Kirk), Evan Lewis (David Paetkau), Isabella Hudson (Justina Machado) and Shaina (Sarah Carter). They are aware that death will follow them, so Kimberly looks for Clear Rivers (Ali Larter) one survival of the plane accident to help them to avoid death, they together start to find clues and answers to escape from destiny, but this show being a rather difficult task.<br/><br/>2/10!"

The death scenes are better in this one, but the freshness is slightly tainted as you would expect from a sequel.

"eemail-2","10","1","2","30 November 2006"," But even better than a teen age thriller
","There are three. Number 2 is the best. What I love about this movie is not the gore or the teenage thing. It is a brilliantly created screen play that shows us all how weak and fragile we really are . All these ways to get hurt (all un-natural too)<br/><br/>How we take life and the whole world for granted.? It shows HOW THINGS CAN STACK UP.<br/><br/>Watch closely how the blind, stand and stare as multiple stupid things happen and no own takes the proper action. ( I would have run ) It is typical in my experience. The gas station scene was classic. Stupid man on ladder next to cars. smoking around gas, and 5 or more dumb things happen all at once. There should have been more carnage at this moment, but God was forgiving the innocent, that day. (mostly) Are we really innocent when we walk through life not really looking? All this technology and sometimes it can stack up on you.<br/><br/>The kid , mouth open , no oxygen , now mouth is full of silly ceiling ornament. Unattendance is illegal i believe in real life.<br/><br/>I see cops beside the road with guns out , fingers in the trigger guard and I speed up , , others slow down. I distance my self from the sheep. Curiosity is more important then life.<br/><br/>The movie is brilliant , it reflects exactly how regular people behave.<br/><br/>It taught me to be more watching of other making mistakes, or myself!<br/><br/>Maybe the movie had 2 target audiences , teens and persons like me. reality: One day at cattlemen city Gas station in CAL. I-5, is saw a middle 35 yr? old Mexican pouring gasoline down a carburetor, air cleaner off , yelling , OK start it now (to other Mexican) , I ran I yelled Sir. please stop and he called me an Spanish cuss word (translates to male prostitute) ,then BOOM , huge fire ball . The man died even though I tried very hard to save him.<br/><br/>Things happen like this all the time, what if children were near or a gas truck fill the main tanks. I remember the Calacute tunnel in Oakland that had a huge fire caused by a gas truck, Carnage un-imaginable. The AIR PUMPS made it a blast furnace. I look for those trucks and I stay away, if I can. Things stack up."
"airjimmyshoes","2","1","2","20 November 2006"," ummmmmm, OK?
","I believe I may have to quote Derek Zoolander for this one: ""What is this?"" This is a horrendous concept. The concept is if you escape death, you will die. I know people who have ""escaped death"" and, trust me, they are fine. Nothing is believable. The most realistic thing is the man in the elevator with the hook for a hand.<br/><br/>Why was this movie even made? I mean, The Butterfly Effect was horrendous, can't Brees learn from his mistake? I mean seriously, who likes to see people get a ladder shoved through their eye because they were making dinner? This movie made me want to gouge my eyes out after what I saw. I was insulted by what theater has become and now, I feel like a new person for all the wrong reasons."
"mbl102","10","1","2","30 July 2006"," Better than the first!
","We ""finally"" have a yes answer to the age old movie buff question, ""is any sequel better than the original?"" In Final Destination 1 we were introduced to the concept that ""death has a plan."" In the first movie, students on their way to France get off their plane when one of the students has a premonition that the plane is going to explode. Flight 180 does in fact explode and death has to play a little catch-up. The grim reaper methodically and quite creatively tries to finish what he started and send each person to their grave.<br/><br/>In this installment of the Final Destination franchise, another premonition is had by a girl on her way to a cottage. This time a pile-up on the freeway which would have killed several more people, is avoided and death once again has to put his regularly scheduled plan into action. One by one he claims his victims and sends them to their eternal sleep. But after a visit to Clear Waters (Larter, yes that is the character's name), the only survivor still alive from the plane crash in the first film, we find out that all these people had been interfered with in their own death by the flight 180 survivors. So death was going to take care of all of them in one fell swoop.<br/><br/>This time death is not at all happy and decides to have a lot fun with this elusive bunch of death dodgers. The best part of this movie is the seemingly endless ways that these people almost die. With three people working on ""Characters, Story and Screenplay"" it seems as if the writers sat around and thought of all the coolest ways to have a death scene and then just decided to put all of them in the movie. Everyone is constantly narrowly avoiding their fate until BANG! Their goose gets cooked or crushed or splattered or chopped off. <br/><br/>The script itself is one that was definitely not taken lightly. This is a well thought out storyline and holes were looked for. It is cohesive and leads you down a believable path with a completely unbelievable concept. Even the ending is one that surprises without making you roll your eyes.<br/><br/>The most surprising thing in this movie is the wonderful cinematography. Normally not the kind of movie that most people would relate to great camera work, but Gary Capo (2nd unit DOP on The Last Samurai, Mission: Impossible II, The Thin Red Line) has a keen eye for camera angles to intensify suspense and surprise. And this movie is full of both.<br/><br/>Apart from an over-the-top cameo performance from Tony ""Candyman"" Todd, the actors do a great job presenting a complex and entertaining look at death and uncertainty. It's hard to tell who is going to make it to the end of this thriller, and compelling to see how each person deals with the events in their own way. It's easy to tell that the film makers actually cared about the characters they had created. Like comedies, the genre of horror films has been passed over as fluff in the history of cinema. But as more and more movie fans become film makers, horror films are becoming all around better films. Peter Jackson (Heavenly Creatures, Lord of the Rings) and Wes Craven (Music of the Heart, Red Eye) have proved that director's starting in the horror genre are quite capable of making big blockbusters. Maybe these great films will one day get the respect they deserve.<br/><br/>If it's my time to go I want my final destination to be a place that they show films as good as this one."

"emmarobertson92","2","1","2","3 March 2006"," More Gore, Less Entertaining
","I watched the original Final Destination and absolutely loved it, I though the whole idea was great, as was most of the acting, but not all. I decided to check out the second, thinking it would be just as good, maybe even better. But I was bitterly disappointed. I mean the beginning part plot being a highway pile-up is pretty cool. But the death's just seemed too full of gore. Of course if gore is your thing then you will probably disagree with me but for a non-gore fan it's just my opinion. Anyway, the deaths in number two aren't as realistic...OK so the first ones were imaginative too but the point is, they were a little more believable in the first than in the second. Like I said before, if gore isn't your thing, stay away from this movie."
"phantomemail","5","1","2","24 February 2006"," Yet another plot hole
","Again they mentioned about the order they will die. Well, they didn't die after the highway pile-up in the order they died during the highway pile-up. It was kinda random, actually. What gives? Why make that a major point when it's not observed all the way through? Nos. 2 and 3 are admittedly fun to watch, but they just contain way too many implausibilities and confusion and absence of logic in many cases. Still, better than Fried Green Tomatos....Now, the pick-a-part. Ladder through the eye kept going even though the ladder should have stopped after hitting the asphalt. Plate glass will not liquefy a human but will pound you into a smaller ball. Elevator inner doors prevent outer doors from closing on a person. Steering wheel airbags don't deploy when the force is from the side. Barbed wire, aside from a small barb every foot or so, is larger than 1/8"" and is round and will not cut through a body like razor wire, rather it will just slingshot you painfully (same error in Ghost Ship). The hospital room blowing up was just plain boring, what was so special? And I don't know of many barbecues, whether propane or briquettes or wood, that blow up like that. That's why the first movie was somewhat more believable. The second and third were just excuses to hype the deaths over the story. Regardless, they're still OK."

"Quicksand","4","1","2","11 February 2006"," Not Unlike Porn: No Logic, No Story, Just Money Shots
","This is not a good movie.<br/><br/>I went through other comments, and all that, and most of the ""pro"" comments seem to call it watchable, scary, gory, suspenseful... and the opening traffic accident is all of these things, but it fades away the instant this scene ends and the movie has to rely on its actors. It's not that they're bad, they're just under-directed, and stuck with a screenplay that has moments like, say, a character picks his jacket up, knocks a pool-ball to the floor, which rolls to a mousetrap, which snaps and flings the ball up into he air, knocking loose a suspended kayak, which swings loose and nearly kills someone. ""Should have seen that coming,"" says the movie's most experienced character... Is that supposed to be a funny line? Seen that coming HOW, exactly? By watching out for pool balls? Not unlike Friday the 13th Part... I dunno, say, VII: The New Blood, this is NOT a good movie.<br/><br/>I'm defining ""good movie"" as something with character, a plot, and a conflict which must be resolved. The first one had these things. But ""FD2"" is structured like a porno-- the writers clearly got together beforehand and came up with each 'action' sequence, then cobbled together some terrible talking-scenes to hold them together. What saved this movie from being straight-to-video, I'd wager, is that the action scenes come off pretty well. Only half of them are clever or original, all are well staged and photographed, but what comes between them pales in comparison to ""Mimic 2"" or ""Leprechaun 4: In Space."" Director David Ellis, who is about as competent as the director of ""The Fly II,"" must be the best liar in the world. ""In this scene,"" he must have told an actor, ""There's smoldering remains next to you, but don't show grief or horror, we'll work that out in editing."" At least in the first one Devon Sawa was a good enough actor to pass off his lack of grief as growing madness. Here the actors just say the lines and move from scene-to-scene making no sense or logic, just chess pieces (well, checkers pieces) awaiting the next gore scene. And by the way-- the first film? The emphasis was on suspense, not blood.<br/><br/>The first film was something interesting and clever (and cool) from writers of ""The X-Files."" Here, the writing is embarrassingly incompetent, there's as much tension as a trip to the mailbox, and the director blew 80% of his budget on two scenes, and suddenly he's A-List for ten minutes. It won't last; the final twenty seconds of the film were the only cheer-worthy moments. Something else it has in common with ""The Fly II"" ... which shows you the kind of raw talent we're working with here. Car crash-- 9/10. Rest of film-- 1/10. Subtract a point for completely wasting Tony Todd, leaves us with 4/10."

","This is a fantastic film. It has amazing depth which makes it exciting. Better than the first one,with many more signs for you to spot. This makes it a perfect horror movie. It's great to watch and keeps you on the edge of your seat. Me and my mates have seen this many times and every time we do we find something new. Granted the deaths are a little extreme and sick. However, you can't have everyone passing away quietly otherwise it wouldn't be a good horror. Highly recommended.The first film had amazing effects. The accident in this one is 30 times better. The only problem i had with this film was that Alex is not in it. You do however find out what happens to him. I can't wait till final destination three comes out in 2006. if it's anything like this one it's going to be brilliant."
"boyinflares","7","1","2","20 November 2005"," Entertaining Sequel, best watched on DVD
","Unlike some sequels which don't directly follow the original, Final Destination 2 has a clear link to the original, of which (the event) is mentioned many times, Ali Larter reprises her role as Clear Rivers, though she isn't as impressive as she was in the first, possibly because she is playing second to the classy A.J. Cook.<br/><br/>Following a fantastic opening sequence (the infamous high-way pile-up), the film moves at a steady pace, though resulting in a rather disappointing finale. While the film is not necessarily that scary, the deaths are very interesting, and most of the time take place just when you think everything is safe. Worthy of particular note is the death of Lynda Boyd's character who meets an untimely demise involving an elevator.<br/><br/>The cast are all competent, with Larter, Cook and hottie Michael Landes as Thomas the police officer carrying the film. Keegan Connor Tracy is always good, and Lynda Boyd is very sympathetic. The actor who plays her son Tim, James Kirk, is pretty good too, the others who are all destined to die are rather annoying. Justina Machido (from ""Six Feet Under"") is fabulous, once again playing a pregnant woman, who the group must somehow find.<br/><br/>So while the film isn't groundbreaking, it is an entertaining watch with a mostly likable cast, good pace and some inventive death scenes. The reason I believe it is better watched on DVD is for the fun facts the pop up across the screen during the course of the film, loaded with trivia and behind the scenes info."

","A movie that took the teenage splatter flick in new directions is put to rest here by a sequel which returns to the usual improbable setups and warped laws of physics to burn, slice, and squish teenagers in ways you've never seen.  <br/><br/>FD1 had immensely imaginative death traps, which could almost always be completely construed as freak accidents.  FD2 stretches credibility in that field - a man who's hand gets caught in a stopped garbage disposal while his apartment burns down around him?  (Has this EVER happened to ANYONE?) Barbed wire that can tear through human bone?  (By the way, that was from Cube.)  And has NO driver in this movie ever heard of using brakes??  By the end, ideas have run short and the movie breaks all the rules it has established to kill off the last character (Eugene).<br/><br/>Speaking of breaking rules, what is with the cop's gun which can now evade basic physics, because it isn't part of ""death's design""?  Since it suggests invincibility until ""your number is up"", then why wouldn't you go out and just have an all-out joyride until you became ""next"".<br/><br/>Splatter films only work because you can see and relate to the psyche of the characters.

","The battle between fate and free will has been explored in much of literature and film.  Whereas Minority Report, the best picture of last year, examined the idea through large plot twists and the human emotions of its main characters, Final Destination 2 strives to do so through the impaling of large intestines and main arteries.  What culminates is not a bad horror film-it is better than its predecessor-but its reliance on the genre of horror sequels leads to its inevitable demise.<br/><br/>With the exception of Willard, all of the horror movies released this year (Darkness Falls, Dreamcatcher, and now Final Destination 2) have had their strongest moments in the film's opening minutes.  Aside from obvious flaws in Ellis' direction, the sequence on the highway, from what most of the trailer is derived, stands out as the film's highlight.  The scenes after it should be renamed Final Destination Too, because the whole plot is the first movie.  The only exception is that it does not waste its time developing characters that we know will be killed off anyway.<br/><br/>It is not essential to have any knowledge of the happenings in Final Destination.  The screenplay's exposition takes place in between both films, and all the returning plot elements are exhaustingly expressed through cheesy dialogue.  Through an overdose of foreshadowing, the predictability factor is just as high as its elements of surprise.  This unevenness hints at yet another sequel in the film's resolution-if it can be called that.<br/><br/>**1/2 out of ****"

Why she receives top billing is a mystery?  I also concede the repetitious attempts to link it to the first one grated after a while. The film and story hold up perfectly well on their own.<br/><br/>Question! HOW did the cast and crew keep a straight face when Kimberly delivered the all time classic line, ""They're gonna be attacked by a flock of pigeons?"" <br/><br/>I'd knock a star off too for the inappropriate and unnecessarily comical ending!"

","Final Destination 2 follows 2000's hit film Final Destination. In the beginning scenes on the road, the film stooped down to the typical teen flick, with the unneeded, but really good nudity, and the teenager that sneaks in a bag of pot. That was one of the very few flaws that Final Destination 2 had. Like I said earlier, Final Destination 2 has tons of blood, guts, and mayhem, and that's what I liked about the movie. The beginning scene with all the car crashes seriously out-did the first films beginning scene with the plain exploding. Some parts of the beginning are a bit illogical, i.e. all the cars exploding fast like that. Another thing that has bogged down, is the acting. Ali Larter is a terrific actress, and she gave a good performance, but I was seriously disappointed with A.J. Cook's performance. Her last film before Final Destination 2 was Wishmaster 3, which was the absolute worst film of all time. Final Destination 2 surpasses the first film's death scenes. The deaths is Final Destination 2 were so creative, and so inventive, it was unbelievable. Final Destination 2 also has A LOT more blood, and gore than the first film, which I seriously liked. The story is basically the same thing, just with a few more differences. I didn't like the fact that there was a way to stop death from killing everyone, that was cliché, because every movie always has a way to stop everything. The first film was also more original, and the pacing was just right. Final Destination 2's pacing was a little off, because it was always one death after another, but I didn't really care. Overall, Final Destination 2 is better than the first film, because there is more mayhem, blood, and guts, and they did not waste time in the film with needless scenes. However, Final Destination 1 also had some elements that were better than the second film's. The acting was SO much better in the first film, and the story was more original, but the deaths were not as creative. I liked Final Destination 2, and from the looks of it when I was at the theater, it looks like it's gonna make some big bucks. 9 ½ out of 10."

Alex from part 1 could have (more like SHOULD have) died with Clear in some overly-complicated, sudden, and gory accident that these movies are known for. The movie was still very good.

","Death has a list. And if you're on the list, you're going to die in the order in which you appear on the list. Of course, if someone doesn't die on schedule that creates a ripple in death's plan and if a child is born to a mother who was scheduled to die then someone on the list may be allowed to live...I think. Anyhoo, that's probably all wrong but you're not going to care about the plot anyway as you watch this sequel to ""Final Destination 1"" in which a coed hooks up with a cop and a throwback from the original flick to thwart death's master plan. Though the film lacks in cohesion and sensibility, it is chock full of cause-effect chain reactions which result in a stuntfest and grisly actions sequences throughout. Probably a tad less than the original (which isn't bad for a sequel), FD2 is a worthwhile watch for anyone into gory horror action dramas made with the old teen and young adult crowd in mind. (C+)"

","The first movie took the time to follow teen horror flick conventions, to develop characters -as thin as they were - and to throw in some theories about why all these people were dying. In the second movie, all these time-fillers are skipped and the movie becomes a heaping helping of mind-boggling mayhem. Final Destination 2 asks why it should bother with the parsley of plot, dialogue, or characters, when people just want a plateful of death.<br/><br/>In many ways, tunneling all of the sequel's energies into a smorgasbord of imaginative deaths works better than the heavy-handed ""suspense"" of the original film. The acting is mediocre at best. Do they solve the riddle in time? Few will care, considering that there is no reason to like any of the characters and the main thrill of the movie comes from the elaborate nature of the deadly accidents. If this movie is supposed to be a scary thriller, then it flies far of the mark. If, however, Final Destination 2 seeks to take us no further than bloody spectacle, then it does a fine job indeed.
==
As a rewatch 12/10/18' Final Destination isn't completely as bad as remembered. Over five years since the original viewing, much remembered had been forgotten save for some scenes. Nothing too memorable about this film in comparison to the original. We can see as to why audiences preferred the original, with a main reason being the cast was more likable and easier to root for. Though this film,the death scenes and overall deaths are far more gruesome and violent.<br/><br/>There is a different atmosphere here, as the film seems more serious, though filled with more noticeable silly dialogue. Overall Final Destination 2 isn't bad for what's it worth, as there are still several scenes of suspense, thrills and overall excitement. Rating changed from 3 to 5. As another rewatch 03/11/20' opinions remain same. There are some clever and good moments but as a whole, the original is superior."

","Let's get one thing crystal clear: The Final Destination series is NOT HORROR! It's a comedy of errors. It's not Shakespeare's Comedy of errors because that would be giving this silly series of films way too much credit.<br/><br/>Basically, Death sets up a series of ridiculously complex series of traps to kill people. Now, these are traps so insanely complex that the clown from the Saw films would be in awe.<br/><br/>Now, don't get me wrong, I normally abhor blood and gore in horror films. But in this movie it's so over the top and unbelievably silly that in all likelihood this film will make you die... laughing. I'm serious man, when somebody is trying desperately to get out of a situation you may find yourself laughing and wondering ""wow, how can this get any more silly?"" And the funny part is that most of the time these people do something that leads to their own demise! You can't blame death for half of the things that happen. These people die because they are complete dumbasses! Anyways, at least it's got Ali Larter, she's pretty easy on the eyes. But the movie is impossible to take seriously. The gore factor is so over-the-top ludicrous that even for shock value it ends up(again) being silly instead of horrifying.<br/><br/>My advice? Skip it and watch something that's actually horrifying, like Disaster Movie. How Friedberg and Seltzer still have a career after that movie... now THAT is scary, mofos."

That belief is actually Religious: ie: Allah controls your destiny and you have nothing to say about it. Belief in a higher being that controls you is RELIGION.

","Final Destination 2 (2003) <br/><br/>** 1/2 (out of 4) <br/><br/>It's vacation time so Kimberly (A.J. Cook) decides to take a trip to Florida with three of her friends. While on the highway Kimberly has a premonition of a deadly car accident, which will kill several people including herself and her three friends. Thrown into a state of shock Kimberly refuses to drive any further and within the matter of seconds a chain reaction wreck takes place and the entire road is filled with fire and death.<br/><br/>Kimberly's friends are killed but she's saved due to Officer Burke (Michael Landes) who pulls her from death right before it would have taken place. Although her friends are dead Kimberly is a hero because she saved the life of everyone behind her on the road. However by doing this she has altered the plans of Death who will have to go back and fix things by killing those who were saved. Together Kimberly and Burke must find a way to save the others and destroy Death before it can take its toll.<br/><br/>As with the case of many cash-hungry sequels, if you've seen the first film then you pretty much know what to expect out of this one. The story lines are pretty much the exact same and the movie really doesn't try to hide the fact that it's very unoriginal due to it being basically a remake more than a sequel. However, like the first film this one here has a very intriguing story dealing with cheating death that at least makes it watchable throughout. Just because the story is interesting doesn't mean anything else works though.<br/><br/>What I really don't understand about this film is the graphic and over-the-top gore, which fills the screen every time it comes for someone to die. I'm a die-hard horror fan and gore has always played an important part in various slashers but Final Destination 2 isn't a mindless slasher but a wannabe intelligent film that tries to be a serious film. The director throws tender moments at us along with a lot a funny moments yet at the same time we get very graphic violence, which serves no purpose at all and comes off very mean and cold.<br/><br/>Within the short running time we get heads ripped off, eyes poked out, explosions, torture, bodies ripped in several pieces as well as young kids being killed. All of this leaves nothing to the imagination and at first its rather shocking but before long you'll be rolling your eyes and asking yourself what's the point to all of this. The further the movie goes the more gore is thrown at us, which eventually becomes laughable and takes away what the film was trying to accomplish. Gore is never scary and it's not a good idea to use it when trying to make suspense or fear.<br/><br/>Final Destination 2, outside the useless and tasteless violence is of course very stupid but in my opinion it's everything a Hollywood film is today. While watching the thing you might find yourself having a good time but three minutes after the credits role the movie is all but forgotten and you really can't remember too much about what you've just seen. I'm fairly certain had this film been made thirty-years ago some small time director would have made a very intelligent film about Death. This film however is too worried about being hip to a younger crowd that it's virtually pointless. As for the CGI, in case producers don't know, there's a guy named Tom Savini out there that could have done many of the death scenes a lot better and made them actually look real."

Without characters or a coherent plot, why bother? This Final Destination ends up in the same graveyard as the first. It's hard to guess which will cause more titters - the lame dialogue or the pasty performances. However, while none of the actors show anything in the nature of promise, I have to admit that there might be hope for director David Ellis.

","The first ""Final Destination"" movie from 2000 was a rather innovative 'Dead Teenager Movie' in that the killer was Death itself, the Grim Reaper, as an invisible spiritual presence. A group of people, mostly youths, escape a great tragedy due to a premonition of one of them and the rest of the movie involves the Grim Reaper systematically slaying those who cheated Death in various creative ways, usually involving an unlikely chain reaction. The opening tragedy in the first film was a plane crash; in this second film from 2003 it's a horrible highway pile-up; in the third it's a roller-coaster mishap and so on.<br/><br/>There are currently five films in the franchise and they all tell the same basic story with different characters and some nuances; they're all of the same high quality of technical filmmaking. Whether you prefer one or another depends on whether you like the cast and the death sequences (and the locations) because, other than these factors, they're all basically the same, although the fifth film throws in an interesting new twist (Death's victim can find a substitute).<br/><br/>Ali Larter returns as a secondary protagonist while A.J. Cook takes the reigns of the 'final girl.' Keegan Connor Tracy also has a considerable role in the female department while Sarah Carter has a smaller part. While this is a quality assortment of women, the creators coulda done more with them. On the opposite side of the gender spectrum Michael Landes stars as a state trooper. Jonathan Cherry, Terrence 'T.C.' Carson and James Kirk are also on hand. Their importance to the story is in that order. Meanwhile Tony Todd makes his second of four appearances in the series as a mortician who curiously knows more than he should.<br/><br/>I actually like this one a little better than the first one, but like that film, the second half isn't as strong as the first. Is the final scene supposed to be horrific?

","While it was not a great or perfect film (particularly in the dialogue, ending and some of the acting), the first 'Final Destination' was entertaining and effective (especially with its terrific opening plane sequence and the creative deaths) with a fascinating idea done well.<br/><br/>'Final Destination 2' gets my vote as the best of the four sequels and generally it's just as good as the first film. Like its predecessor it's patchy and uneven, but 'Final Destination 2' takes a bigger and bolder approach and executes it just as cleverly and effectively. Horror sequels have a patchy history, 'Final Destination 2' is one of the better examples. Structurally, the story is a re-tread basically except with cars rather than a plane but has enough freshness to stop it from being repetitive and the novelty from wearing off.<br/><br/>Visually, 'Final Destination 2' may not be quite as stylish as its predecessor. It is all the same still as slick and atmospheric, with the special effects still being pretty good in particularly the opening sequence. The music has a suitable haunting eeriness.<br/><br/>David R Ellis' direction shows a genuine understanding of the concept and the horror genre, breathing atmosphere, fun and freshness into a tried and tested formula. To me, he is second only to James Wong for the first film when it comes to ranking the 'Final Destination' films directors.<br/><br/>Although there is a little too much of an over-reliance on gore, not all of it necessary, the death scenes are bolder, more elaborate and more creative. The film is never dull and much of it is fun, suspenseful and creepy. The highlight is the terrific opening car pile up, which is as high in the terror stakes as the opening plane sequence in the first. Liked the irony in some of the dialogue.<br/><br/>The acting is very variable however. The best performances come from returning Ali Larter, providing a nifty link to the first, and a creepy Tony Todd. AJ Cook had her moments, but did overdo and underact some scenes, that she is so much better in 'Criminal Minds' is an understatement.<br/><br/>Michael Landes looks uncomfortable the entire time and Jonathan Cherry is irritating. Again the characters are generally one-dimensional and not developed much beyond that which doesn't always make it easy to care for them.<br/><br/>Excepting some nice irony and that the exposition isn't as clumsy, the dialogue doesn't flow particularly well and reeks of cheese. The ending is contrived and illogical.<br/><br/>Overall, enjoyable if imperfect. 7/10 Bethany Cox"

Of course, in films such as these, the death scenes make the film, and the emphasis is on gore and bloodshed here, so expect body parts to go flying (literally in some cases), sometimes ridiculously so.<br/><br/>The cast is generally sub par, delivering lame dialogue with little intelligence or wit. Of the original cast members, only Ali Larter returns, her character greatly improved here, and Tony Todd, making another sinister cameo appearance; his role the highlight of the entire movie. Otherwise this is derivative stuff, which nonetheless builds up the tension as it goes along. The viewer is asked to engage in a fun guessing game with the writers, trying to figure out who's going to bite it next. Things end with a contrived finale in which the final 'twist' scene is so obvious and overdone, the film as a whole is flawed. Only fans of gore, death, and SFX need apply, and if you're happy to sit back and enjoy that kind of thing, then FINAL DESTINATION 2 does enough to get by."

","When a vivid premonition stops here from participating in a massive accident, a woman tries to convince those she's saved that the strange accidents they're involved in are a matter of death insuring his plans are carried out and tries to stop them.<br/><br/>This one was an immensely enjoyable sequel that really rivals the original. Among the better qualities here is that this one manages to really portray a truer sense of dread and suspense about the situation as this one really gets a lot of great facts about the surroundings really affecting everyday life. This one really bridges that concept from the first one even further here by making the accidents seem so far out of of logical realms that they're simply, truly accidents brought about through actual, honest coincidences which makes for a rather tense time throughout the first half b building this through the repeated visions, the first few deaths and the call-backs to what happened in the original. This is compounded by the tendency here to showcase the warning signs rather well here as the suspenseful nature of these supposed encounters is some incredible foreshadowing on what's going to happen, and the fact that there's some rather creepy moments from these issues makes this quite fun. The film's best feature, though, is based off the most impressive part of the story here in it's really freaky action-packed encounters here starting with the film's high-point of the opening car crash. There's a fine piece of spectacle to be had here in seeing the kind of high-impact mangling of cars, vehicular stunt- work and continued continuations that not only provide this one with plenty of suspense building up to the crash, action with all the different spectacle encounters as well as the gory deaths along the way. Other big scenes here, from the insanely tense encounter in the doctor's office with several close calls here with the different traps with the electrified water almost getting here and the different false reactions here to the eventual death, the scenes in the apartment are really fun with the false scares followed by the actual kill in the lobby following the revelations found earlier and the absolutely fun encounter in the field makes for a great scene with the splendid set-up in the care beforehand which ties their fates into the original as well as showing another big crash and the fun, over-the-top kills that are present here makes this one incredibly fun. These here are the film's good points which manages to hold off the few flaws here. It's all in the finale here which really seems to meander around with numerous side-plots, rather middling suspense scenes and the rare occasions where the traps just seem contrived and the whole affair seems to be quite the letdown from what came before it. There's also the small factor of this one going for the same route the original in terms of how the story's paid off, but it's not as big a deal here. Otherwise, this one was quite the impressive enough sequel.<br/><br/>Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Brief Nudity and drug use."
"nitzanhavoc","6","0","2","18 June 2016"," Average film, good sequel, doesn't live up to the first.
","After finally getting to watching the first film, I've just watched this one last night, hoping it's as good as the first. Let's start off by saying it's not. I did have plenty of criticism for certain aspects of the first film (especially to do with the work of director James Wong), but unlike the first film - this one was never going to be as groundbreaking, original and inspiring.<br/><br/>Not unlike the first film, the story kicks off with a group of youngsters on their way to to party somehow somewhere. During the drive, Kimberly (the driver) has a vision which makes her pull over, ultimately saving the lives of the people stuck behind her on the highway. When the survivors begin dying, Kimberly seeks out Clear Rivers, one of the survivors of the famous plane explosion from the first film, in hopes that she could help her and her new friends ""break the pattern"" and ""beat death's design"". The only original addition is new information shared by the creepy mortician (always great to see Candyman Tony Todd, eerie and unnerving as ever).<br/><br/>Besides the obvious lack of originality or even the slightest attempt to offer something new plot and story-wise, Final Destination 2 suffers from two obvious shortcomings (in my opinion of course): First, any attempt to compensate for a lacking story with over-intensified gore scenes is low class in my book; and second, the deaths seem too supernatural, much more than in the first film. Where in the first film some water leak, causing the victim to slip - this time the amount of ""coincidents"" leading to each ""freak accident"" feel too much like divine (or unholy) intervention, too deliberate and too far fetched. Not as convincing, not as reasonable, not as good.<br/><br/>The small attempt at a plot twist towards the ending isn't successful, and the ending itself is far too comical (again, not unlike the first film). All in all, as a standalone film the film is average at best, and as a sequel - not more than good. It's still a lot of fun to watch after the first, and it definitely isn't a bad film or a reason to quit on the anthology, it just very obviously could have been better."
"colaof","6","0","1","23 April 2016"," A Worthy Successor to the First Film!
","Judging from the other reviews it seems most people either love this movie, or flat out hate it. I fall somewhere in between. I saw the first Final Destination in theaters, and at the time thought it was one of the better horror movies I'd seen. I no longer feel that way, although I do think it's one of the better ones to come out of the late 90's/early 2000's period. In the first one I felt like the lead Devon Sawa overdid it a little bit, in turn making the movie more unbelievable every time I watch it. While I wouldn't go so far as to say that Final Destination 2 is better, I will say that I think A.J. Cook played a better/more believable lead. Aside from her I liked Michael Landes as the cop, but the rest of the cast left a lot to be desired. Ali Larter, who played Clear in the first movie, returns for the sequel helping to bridge the two stories together. Clear was my favorite character in the first, so it was nice to see her return. The deaths are much more elaborate in this one, and quite gruesome. Which shouldn't come as a surprise considering that by that time all horror movies had become disgustingly brutal. A lot of people seem to think that that's the appeal of horror movies, but it's not. At least not for me. I've always been more interested in the plot/story aspect, and one thing I've always liked about the Final Destination series is that they make you think. I'm not saying the deaths aren't cool, because they are, and considering how lackluster I found this supporting cast to be I got much more enjoyment out of watching their untimely demise than I would have had the characters been more likable. If you liked the first Final Destination chances are you'll like the second. That's about all I can say without giving anything away. I'd recommend it to any horror fan though. Instead of some deranged psychopath tormenting the characters, it's death itself. Which is pretty cool if you stop and think about it. As a horror fan I'd like to rate it higher, but the supporting cast is so disappointing that I just can't bring myself to do it. Although Ali Larter, A.J. Cook, and Michael Landes carry the others as best they can, it's still not enough to justify a rating higher than a 6 for me. As far as early 2000's horror goes though, this is one of the best, and without question a worthy successor to the first film."

","It was inevitable after all. Considering there's so much to explore with the concept set up in the first installment, there was bound to be a sequel. But luckily, this movie is awesome!<br/><br/>A character once again has a premonition of a horrible accident, this time a disastrous car crash. A couple of people thankfully are saved... but for how long? There are slightly more survivors in this movie, partly because Clear from the first movie returns (this is only a spoiler if you haven't even seen THAT one). In terms of characters, they were really good. Kimberly and Thomas were very likable, Eugene is hilarious and of course it's also a plus that Clear is back. Speaking of her, she's different in this movie. She's more cold, sassy and doesn't manage to get along all that well. But considering what she has gone through, I think it's commendable character development. She has a lot of scars from previous events and so is not the same person she was before. Even so, I was completely rooting for her. Here, she plays the role of guiding the new survivors in order to help them escape Death. She and... Mr. Bludworth. It would have been stupid not to have him return, so I'm happy he makes another appearance here. He knows even MORE about Death this time, and the scene with him is perfectly uncomfortable. You won't BELIEVE what he's doing while talking to the teenagers!<br/><br/>David R. Ellis directed this movie, and with the over-the-top action in this movie, it's easy to see this is the guy who made Snakes On A Plane. He's clearly having fun, but also seems to know where the limit goes here. Sure the action is crazy, but it's FUNNY-crazy! The humor is even darker than the first movie, and I was laughing hard so many times I lost count. That's not a negative thing however, this movie knew what it was doing and so managed to highly entertain me. And there is still great tension, as it often is unpredictable where the movie will go.<br/><br/>New twists and turns, many quotable lines, a great cast and is just enough chilling to be interesting. Don't worry, this is a sequel worth batting an eye at."
"Screen_Blitz","5","0","1","19 July 2015"," Not too bad of a sequel
","Final Destination 2 is a sequel to the 2000 hit that left many people skeptical of going on a plane ride, set with a new set of characters. This time around involves Kimberly Corman (played by A.J Cook), who sets on a vacation with her friends to Daytona Beach. Like Devon Sawa's character in the first film, Kimberly has a terrifying premonition of her friends and everyone around dying in a horrific disaster, only this disaster a massive car pile-up that leads to a number of deaths. Kimberly intervenes and saves the lives of many (not all) people on the highway. However, she soon learns that Death still has the lives of the individuals she saved on it's agenda. She teams up with Thomas Burke (played by Michael Burke) and Clears Rivers (played by Ali Larter), who revives from the first film, in attempt to save them.<br/><br/>This film carries roughly the same story structure as the first film, with an opening disaster and the people getting killed in strange accidents. However, I didn't this one to be as realistic as the first one. Some of the deaths in this film were okay, others were a bit too laughable. The deaths that occur during the massive car crash scene at the beginning were quite good and surprisingly realistic. Secondly, the characters are a bit underdeveloped. Unlike the other films, each of the characters do not have any unique personalities. In the others films, you had the jock, the geek, the hot girl, and all the other character stereotypes. This film didn't have these and made the characters incomprehensible.<br/><br/>The good part of this film is the plot. The film moves a decent pace and has its moments of suspense. The climax towards the end was my favorite part of the movie. What I also liked how it connected with the first film, especially having Clear from the previous film return as the character who is incarcerated in a mental institution to protect herself from Death. Overall, this movie isn't a total letdown. It just not as good as the first."

","Spoiler Alert!!! I really did enjoy the first Final Destination and it did something nobody has ever thought of before. People are dying in a series of what appears to be accidental deaths because it is still their turn to die. I absolutely loved the first one so much that I caught this film on TV. Boy, was it the most miserable experience I've had with watching each character die in the most longest drawn out car crash in the opening. At least the first one the plane just blew up without being too drawn out.
It was also really lacking with need to know information. I didn't understand how Alex, the main character of the first was the one to die in between films. The end of the first one implied it was Clear's turn. Also, Alex was the only one who know what to do so did Alex just give up hiding from death? If not then how did Clear survive?
And finally, the main characters of this film aren't interesting at all and Clear comes to try and help end the high body count for this worthless characters. I'm serious at least 4 people we don't care about die in the first half of this movie. Most of the characters lack personalities and I truly don't like them at all. I give it a 4 out of 10 on account of the awesome death of Rory, the Cokehead."

","When I was a kid I used to play a game called The Incredible machine. Basically, you had to build what is called a Rube Goldberg machine, a device which carries out a simple task in an over-elaborate way. This is the way this movie works, the characters meet their ends in bizarre, creative and elaborate ways.<br/><br/>The plot pretty much follows the first part of the series. Criminal Minds-regular AJ Cook plays Kimberly Corman, who gets a premonition and saves a couple of people from certain death in the form of a huge highway pile-up. Of course it was their destiny to die and death will not be fooled.<br/><br/>Clear Rivers is kept from the first film, clearly for exposition purposes. She informs the main characters of basically what happened in the first movie, the death list and all. Her character is one of the more interesting in the movie. As is Tony Todd's undertaker character, and it is a waste that his part is so small.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the first movie because I felt the premise felt fresh, and though it had flaws it was pretty enjoyable. This movie is basically just more of the same. The horror elements are all but gone, the emphasis is instead placed on the impressive crash scene at the beginning and the elaborate deaths, which makes this more of a gore-action-comedy than a horror movie. The acting is also pretty bad, AJ Cook is decent enough but many other performances are way over-the-top."

Why did Tommy do something as stupid as to run out into a construction site to chase pigeons. How is it that the elevator moves despite the the doors being opened. Also, there are a lot of things that don't add up. Why is it that death is going backwards. Kimberly and her friends died last in the vision and died first in real life (except for Kimberly who was saved.) Did I miss it, I've seen this film like three times and I still don't understand how that works. And while the idea of the first movie character's deaths saving these new characters from dying and thus death wants to kill them again, it basically means that death is an idiot. He messed up his own plan. The sucide doesn't make a damn bit of sense. And the ending sucked. Unless Bryan had that bone disease Samuel L. Jackson had in Unbreakable, I don't see how he would have died from that newsfan hitting him.<br/><br/>But I don't hate this film, there are some deaths scenes that I really enjoyed such as the barb wire fence and the explosion in the hospital and even the fire escape was fun. The opening disaster was fantastic, I love the stuntwork and the effects. There are some funny moments. And it at least seemed like they were trying really hard to make this a good sequel.<br/><br/>I don't hate this movie, but there are too many things wrong with it for me.

Towards the end of the movie, the whole series manages to take a turning point, and they make some surprising discoveries, including how Alex and the others getting off the plane unknowingly saved the pileup survivors.<br/><br/>Overall, I'd have to say that despite having much more gory and intricate death scenes, this flick couldn't manage to live up to the original, perhaps that was because James Wong didn't direct it, but you'll be glad to know that Wong will be directing the third part of the series:)."

I can hardly find words that wouldn't be so harsh to this film, but I can't stop my mind and make it tell lies.<br/><br/>In the future I will feel pity for everyone who will waste time on The Final destination 2... well if you get to see it for free you'll probably be left with a laugh or terror of go watching ""the final destination 3"" which should be in the cinema's 2006."

","Read my review of the first FINAL DESTINATION, because this is the same movie. Same terrible dialog, same vacuous performances, same convoluted and illogical screenplay.

","If you thought it was over, then you were wrong, ""You can't cheat death twice"", pretty much exactly the same formula, where Death (The Grim Reaper) is stalking another bunch of victims, from director David R. Ellis (Cellular, Snakes on a Plane). Basically Kimberly Corman (A.J. Cook) has a horrific premonition of a highway pileup, with numerous victims driving killed in the incident, and believing that it will happen she stops the queue of cars getting onto the road, and the explosions and deaths indeed happen. After the survivors have left the police station, the first victim to face a bizarre death is recent lottery winner Evan Lewis (David Paetkau), when he escapes a house fire in his apartment, but he ends up slipping on some spaghetti and being impaled by the escape ladder. Police officer Thomas Burke (Michael Landes) does want to help Kimberly, so he leads her to the last survivor of Flight 180, Clear Rivers (Ali Larter) who is a voluntary inmate in a mental asylum, to isolate herself from danger. Clear does decide to leave the institute and help her find ways to cheat death, and they visit the seemingly knowledgeable mortician William Bludworth (Candyman's Tony Todd) to get answers about the death list order, as it is working backwards. Kimberly gets another vision of how the next victim will die, but they are too late to save young Tim Carpenter (James Kirk), who looks like he will die of suffocation, but he is actually crushed by a pane of glass. Eventually all the survivors of the highway crash are brought together and told about the situation, only a couple of them believe it, while Tim's mother Nora Carpenter (Lynda Boyd) walks out, and ends up being beheaded, getting her head trapped in a moving elevator. Now Kimberly, Thomas, Rory (Jonathan Cherry), Kat (Keegan Connor Tracy) and Eugene Dix (Terrence 'T.C.' Carson) are sticking together, and they have a plan to end the deaths, by making sure that fellow survivor Isabella Hudson (Justina Machado) gives birth to her baby, as ""new life defeats death"". Along the way there are still deaths though, as in a crashed car Kat is impaled by a sharp broken pipe when the airbag deploys, and Rory is trisected, i.e. sliced into three pieces, by an explosion sending barbed wire flying through him. Eugene goes to hospital with injuries to his chest, and the rest of the gang head for the hospital, the same one he is on, to make sure that Isabella's baby is born, and it is, and it seems it may be an end to the dying. However Kimberly has another vision where she is drowning in a white van, and at the same moment Clear and Eugene are blown up by a gas leak and spark, so Kimberly rushes to the nearest white van to plunge into the near lake to drown. They realise the ""new life"" was not the newborn baby, as Isabella wouldn't have died in the pileup, but it is Kimberly's revival, and she and Thomas happily enjoy a barbecue with the Gibbons, only for Death to strike one more time by exploding Brian Gibbons (Noel Fisher), with his arm landing in front of his mother. Also starring Sarah Carter as Shaina, Alejandro Rae as Dano, Shaun Sipos as Frankie and Andrew Airlie as Mr. Corman. Admittedly this isn't as clever technically as the first film, but it is really fun as you can try and guess how each victim will meet their doom, and often it isn't what you though, it also works with the irony in the dialogue, and again it is has inventive and very bloody deaths, a most worthwhile horror thriller.

"Coventry","5","0","3","30 January 2005"," Exactly the same...only a little grosser
","Final Destination 1 was one of the only films ever which basic plot-idea made me feel uncomfortable. Not that the film was so mesmerizing or outstanding but simply the idea of a higher force (= death) following you around because your time has come made me somewhat worried. The inevitable sequel to this unexpected little horror-hit has little ambition and practically re-tells the exact same story with different characters (duh!) and even filthier gore. This time, it's a girl (named after horror maestro Roger Corman) who receives a portentous premonition about a horrible road-accident and so saves the life of a group of people that were waiting at the traffic lights. Of course Mr. Grim Reaper isn't about to let them off this easily and the all start dying in ludicrously exaggerated ways (death by flying fence!!). The idiotic theories and added sub-plots are desperate attempts to make the wholesome look at least a little different than the first while the presence of Ali Larter (survivor of the original) is entirely unnecessary. I could also bring up that this film is offensive and contemptuous for portraying death as a simple special effect but I'm not going there because I don't want to give the impression that I totally disliked this film. The shock effects and visuals are astonishing and especially the initial car accident is horrific and very unsettling. The film is completely tensionless and it amazes me how cold and careless everyone's reactions are when yet another person horribly died right in front of their eyes. I can be brief about the acting performances since movies like this simply don't require skilled sense of dialogue. They all do their best, I guess, but it remains Tony ""Candyman"" Todd who steals the show with his 2 minutes guest appearance. Final Destination 2 is worthy horror viewing as long as you're not in a too demanding mood. Maybe the best way to look at it is picturing it as a morbid version of America's Funniest Home Videos."

","Final Destination 2 follows on from the first film - where yet another group of teenagers avoid ""Death's plan"" by avoiding a fatal road accident. Yet again - they get picked off one by one in even more gruesome horrific style.<br/><br/>I was a semi-fan of the first - it was original, fresh, sometimes shocking or scary... but it suffered from being too smart. Its conclusion was a bit of a let down (doesn't really answer how you avoid inevitability). You would think that the sequel would try and remedy this...!<br/><br/>Yes - the death scenes are just as outrageous as the first... but I found this movie to be quite annoying and uninteresting. All the characters were fairly bland - so you didn't care if they horribly die. The couple of survivors at the end of the film were the most boring characters (I was so disappointed they didn't get decapitated or something!). I also thought that Ali Larter's death was a bit cheap (I hate sequels that give characters from earlier films cheap deaths!).<br/><br/>Again - the film doesn't deal with the ending (or how to beat Death) satisfactory.

","The originality and creativity of this film are just outstanding! When I walked out of the theatre I had that tingly feeling you get when you know you've just seen something special. The ideas of how the people died were just amazing. My personal favourite would have to be the one where they've just had the car crash and that girl is sitting in the front seat of the car waiting for the fire man to get the door off so she can get out. From the crash there had been a big, sharp, metal poll sticking through the back of her seat which had just missed her head so she's thinking she's real lucky. But then when the fire man gets the door the air bag comes up and when they pull it down you just see the poll sticking through her head.

","As a director I would think you would have things made after the success of the original Final Destination directed by James Wong and written by Jeffrey Reddick.  You have a great story given to you and a good solid format to follow - horror, suspense, horror, suspense.<br/><br/>And the director of the sequel seemed to understand this, as David Ellis follows the footsteps of Wong.  He does a great job of shocking you and leaving you guessing as to who is going to die next and how.  However, what is most disappointing and horribly tragic about the sequel is that it does not deliver in its conclusion.  The first ended with the same suspense that drove the entire film.  In the second, it seems Reddick through together a cheap new twist and then had Director Ellis give a hack job of an ending, complete with all the cheesiness in the world.  You watch 3/4's of a great film to be left with putty of an ending.  <br/><br/>I saw that Final Destination 3 is in production for 2006 with James Wong back at the helm.  I feel sorry for the guy because now he has the challenge of luring viewers back to the series after Ellis screwed it up."

","The best thing about this movie is how a few moments consist of extremely improbable events twisted together resulting in, usually, someones death. It reminds you, to extreme extents, of the classic PC game ""The incredible machine"". You know, where the bowling ball falls on the string that pulls out the water that frightens the rat-in-the-cage that pulls the hook that... and so on. Who the hell has a deadly guillotine boat model thingy hanging from loosely fastened strings in the basement roof anyway? And elevators have emergency stop buttons for heaven's sake!!<br/><br/>The next best thing is the clichÃ© ratio, which is a lot higher than just about anything else I have ever seen. It is often far over the top and sometimes it falls down to just about laughable, but always more present than the plot.<br/><br/>The story is comfortably predictable, everything is about destiny and how everything is going to happen in a predestined order, so once you have understood the basic (but quite exotic) laws of time, logic and probability that propel the plot in this movie, you can just sit back, relax, and look for goofs and continuity errors.<br/><br/>The special effects in the first car crash are spectacular, and seem to go on forever, like a boring ballet show except the dancers are bouncing wrecks of burning metal and it is too noisy to fall asleep. Soon, however, the real deaths start to take place, and you are presented to much cheaper stuff, like dolls being crushed by glass plates, tomato-sauce-type blood sprayed all over, and computer rendered explosions. Gore and fire! Not enough to be fun, not little enough to be tasteful.<br/><br/>The cast doesn't stand out as bad, which doesn't say much at all, but basically the acting is quite good.<br/><br/>The worst thing about this movie is how it tries to be scary. Actually, in some parts in the beginning, it is, but soon the few scary moments that work serve only to put you off your good laughing mood. Had it been made properly like a Comedy/Horror movie and not only Horror, in the style of, for example, ""Braindead"", I would have been much less sarcastic.<br/><br/>It all comes down to one of these movies that almost are that enough-bad-to-be-good but simply are too boring or not enough overdone to actually entertain. 2/10.<br/><br/>I can't help but mention that I watched ""The Butterfly Effect"" just before I saw this movie, and not that the two movies have anything to do with each other, but if you are looking for anything good to watch, ""The Butterfly Effect"" is far more likely to please you. Watch it!"

","Having watched Final Destination 2, of which I was very impressed with, I have noticed that the plot isn't very well executed. <br/><br/>Prepare for some spoilers here.<br/><br/>The plot is basically just about death extracting revenge on the survivors of an absolutely HUGE pile up on a motorway. Obviously, they were supposed to die. Anyway, the crash scene has to be one of the most harrowing and action packed scenes of the film, and it was a great idea to have it at the beginning. So, the survivors die one by one in increasingly precarious circumstances. Forget about the plot, the deaths are the highlights. This is where the movie shines very brightly. The people don't just die, there are numerous actions that set the situation. Take the first death for example.<br/><br/><SPOILER>. A man get's a ladder through his eye, very gruesome, but beforehand all different things happen: the man is cooking some spaghetti, and drops something in the sink. As he puts his hand into the plug-hole, it gets caught, and so he is cooking and grappling with the sink at the same time. Then the microwave sets on fire, and his spaghetti goes out the window. He manages to free his hand so he jumps through the window, and the kitchen explodes just a second after. He then climbs down the ladder and slips on his spaghetti so he is lying face up on the floor, and then the ladder falls and he can't escape.<br/><br/>It is deadly timebombs like those that make the deaths all the more exciting to see. And that make this a brilliant film to watch.<br/><br/>Thankyou..."

","Anyone who knows me knows how much I loathed the first movie. It was truly wretched. Though this one was surprisingly good. It had better (or just less annoying) characters that you don't want to die (the first movie made the mistake of being populated with awful characters), more inventive death attacks and developed the idea of death having a design more interestingly.<br/><br/>Clear Rivers (Ali Larter) is the only remaining survivor of flight 180 and has now willingly committed herself to a rubber room to escape death's shadow. But lets herself out into the world when learning of a new disaster. A teenager (AJ Cook) on a trip with her pals has a premonition of an incredibly violent freeway pile-up (so more inventive than a distant boom in the sky; the first movie's disaster) and stalls traffic in her lane. Sure enough the pile up happens and all the drivers who she stalled should be dead too. So death begins to stalk them. But no one has any time for the warnings Clear Rivers has to offer and so death offs them in increasing gory fashion.<br/><br/>It's lowbrow and pure popcorn fun but you'll definitely enjoy it. If only the first one didn't exist then this would be more unique experience. Still, buying this DVD would be cool because the 1.85:1 anamorphic picture and the DTS 6.1 sound are incredible.

The second was not as good as the first and was funnier as opposed to scary, but also contained an awful lot of gore. The idea is that the 'survivors' in the original caused a ripple, in that because they didn't die, it prevented others from dying and now death is after those people. One of those people, Kimberly has a premonition similar to Alex's, but on Route 180 of a pileup one year after the plane crash. That is what gets the ball rolling as Kimberly saves the 'ripple' people from the pileup, but seemingly fails to save them from death. The only survivor left from the plane is Clear, as Alex died between movies. Kimberly enlists Clear's help in cheating death the second time, but by the end, Clear too is dead.

And soon enough they start dying, one by one, in some VERY implausible ways. All the death scenes are very well made, nicely built up and most of them pretty shocking. But this movie has so little else to offer. Performances are adequate at best (the heroine is pretty sympathetic though), the plot is almost non-existent and, worst, the film is pretty tedious when there are no deaths. We get a lot of mumbo-jumbo about ""death's design"" and ""list of death"", but those of us who saw the first FD will yawn and think about something else.

This movie is filled with instances that can really happen-that is what makes it so scary...if you are somewhat of a paranoid pessimist (who likes scary movies), you will definitely enjoy this."

","This film was near excellent.  It is definitely gory but who cares, that is what makes some films fun.  These have got to be the best jaw dropping death scenes I have scene in a film in a long time.  They even took time with the wreck to make sure you did not expect what was going to happen to each vehicle.  If you are a horror fan this movie is a must see.  Check this film out very soon."

","I know the first one had more suspense and it was a little bit scary...but this one was incredible too. The deaths were unbelievable...most of the deaths were as shocking as the one of the bus in Final Destination 1. I know the deaths were a little bit exagerated but they were awesome. The effects were AMAZING. The opening ""accident"" was also INCREDIBLE! It was MUCH BETTER than the crash accident in the first one.<br/><br/>I also loved the part where the connections with the first one were revealed. The end was very cool too. If you didn't liked this movie obvously is because you don't like violence and gore. This was an EXCELLENT horror movie. Well, for me it was excellent because I love horror movies and I love gore and all those things. Believe me...when I say a horror movie is good, it's because is good. The first one was awesome, but this one gets the prize."

","I eagerly awaited the arrival of this film on video so that I could see it for a low price( judging from the stupidity of the original, this installment could not be worth $8.75). Before the film came out on video I read through quite a few of the reviews written on this web site for Final Destination 2, and judging from the general consensus, one would be led to believe that this film is actually a worthwhile movie. When July 22nd came around, and the video stores were stocked full, I actually felt a sense of excitement while driving to get it. So I rented the DVD version, took it home, and 15 minutes into the film I could have SWORN that I was watching the original movie, except for the fact that the characters were dying on the freeway, and not in the sky. I mean give me a Goddamn break, absolutely no originality or variation from the original. The only, and I mean ONLY reason why I didnt go back to the store and demand my 4 dollars back was because of the interesting/gory yet highly unrealistic deaths that the characters are led to.<br/><br/>Anyone who took this movie seriously, or that felt any emotion other than simultaneous amusement and disgust should be hung naked by their eyelids with a laughing audience throwing rotten fruit at their backsides. I vaguely remember one reviewer's comment that any of these things could happen to any of us at anytime. This individual should be banned from this website for the rest of their life!! How could anyone in their right mind think that this movie is credible!?! The idea that some invisible force kills people and that death has a plan for all of us is absolutely moronic...... but I do realize that it was simply made for our entertainment.<br/><br/>
My overall recommendation: Rent it once, but try to convince somebody else to pay for it, i.e. a friend, parent, or significant other. Under no circumstances should anyone purchase this movie, and anyone who has the desire to watch this movie more than once had better have a good excuse, such as to simply watch the death sequences again, because if you watch this movie twice for enjoyment you will have to live the rest of your life knowing that your a complete idiot. I give it a .5 out of 10."
"jpintar","3","0","2","22 July 2003"," Bad, bad movie
","This has to be the worst sequel I have seen so far this year.  The opening car crash and the appearance of Clear and the mortician from the first film are the only things I can recommend about this film.  It is basically a rehash of the original.  The filmakers also decided to put more gore into this movie (which I am not a fan of). It has none of the original's cleverness or originality.  Try the original instead."
"danila_1","9","0","1","6 June 2003"," A solid thriller
","The film is good. Unlike the Final Destination, there is actually a story (and pretty decent one), nicely tied to the events in the first film. There isn't much character development, but then the film's point is different, it is to show the omnipresence of death and the characters' encounters with it. And it does that brilliantly. Especially the ""encounters"". Death scenes are very scary and very impressive. The opening episode is amazing. To imagine the quality and intensity of the action, think about action scenes in the Matrix: Reloaded (like Burly Brawl), only with people dying.<br/><br/>Even more impressive is tension build-up in several other episodes. The film frightens us most by showing how close are people to death in everyday life. The gas station episode shows it best. Cars narrowly miss each other, a man drops a gas-cylinder, dogs strain at leads. In that moment it is scary to see just a man fixing a lamp. Death is always around the corner, is always waiting for us to make a mistake. You can't help but think (half-seriously, but nevertheless) about miriads of small mistakes you make every day. Dropping a knife into the drawer, looking for the light-switch in the dark, holding a sharp object close to your face. Plain scary. And that even without mistakes made by others that can kill you just as well. Boo! :)<br/><br/>Most of the film is downright scary, but there are few darkly humorous scenes. These scenes(only a few, mind you) didn't improve the film, but didn't harm it either. One may like or dislike it, but this is a valid writer's/director's creative choice and we just have to accept it.<br/><br/>S P O I L E R: (Minor) I personally think that every lift (elevator) must have photoelectric cells in the doors (that prevent them from closing if something is there) and a big red stop button on the panel that immediately stops the lift when pressed. I nearly lost my dog once THAT way, but that red button saved it. If the lift that you need to use doesn't meet these standards of safety, you might be better off using the stairs."

","Now, this is a sequel to 2000's surprise hit, and one of my favorite movies, `Final Destination'. I want to add how much I was expecting this movie (since Final Destination) and now I am happy to report that the movie was not a letdown and the three year wait was very much worth it.<br/><br/>I will start off by mentioning what I did NOT like about this sizzle sequel, I know I shouldn't compare this with the prequel, but that way, you'll get better the idea. One of the many things I adored about the first movie was it's freaky and very scary atmosphere but where is it!? Not here! The movie is mostly shot in daytime, and that lowered a lot the sense of creepiness. One more thing I couldn't stand is that they turned this movie into another pop corn horror movie. It has way too many jokes I didn't appreciate all that much (the last frame comes to mind) and that mucho lowered the tension, which was another of the many things I adored about the prequel. The script had some flaws right there, maybe it is just me but maybe it didn't explain fully the idea of death's design, I didn't fully get it, but then again, maybe it was just me. The characters are much less developed as in the original, as being a bunch of strangers, you couldn't care less for most of them...they are all stereotyped and I was only waiting for most of them to die...(I kinda loved Nora actually) and add to that some extremely disposable side-characters (BBQ kid...lmao). As for the acting, I must say it's mostly convincing; if it's not the at times tacky dialogue pulling some characters down, it's mostly fine. I really didn't like Eugene I don't know what p***ed me off, if it washis characters or just HIM...I was waiting for the Angel of Death to do his thang on him.<br/><br/>And guess what mistake the sequel did? The same as in Final Destination.a scene where some of the characters visiting the same creepy mortician (Tony Todd) we saw before, again, his character is not explored in any level, the scene again slowens the pace big time and is much more useless than in the original.<br/><br/>Now, for the upside, this is by far the ballsiest R rated movie I have ever seen. I was extremely uncomfortable and was yelling like a maniac in the movie theater. I am not talking only about ball gripping tension, but the goriest, most 'out there' kill sequences I have ever seen. Remember how strong the run over kill was in the original Final Destination? That's nothing ok? Hear me out here. The kills are just amazingly strong and mind bending.awesome s***e. I also mucho enjoyed the fact of 'death' being again only a sadistic presence that we feel all around us. For some reason I felt it much more time than in the first one, there are thousands of accidents here. I also appreciated how they didn't just made 'another' Final Destination story, they also added a clear link between the events involving Flight 180 and this car pile up. Another great thing is that they also added some really cool new effect in death's design for this one, I will not give it away, but I really liked how it's not the same thing as Final Destination, the cool omens are still there, especially in the opening car pileup, which is definitely the harshest bit IMO. The Ellis man definitely knows his s***e, he has a great imagination and has BALLS, he also pulls tons of great enlarged shots, overhead shots, fluid camera movements, tension and silence. He has style!<br/><br/>Final Destination 2 is a sequel that succeeds and fails in some levels. I will grade it a `8.5/10' for it's great entertainment and freak out value; Maybe it's not better than the original, but definitely doesn't embarrass it."

","I just have one word to describe this movie GORY.This was one entertaining film from start to finish.The surprising ways in which the players in the film die off are classic and did I say gory.The script for the film was very well pieced together and went along well.I know this might sound a little sick to some people but I don't care,I found myself anticipating the next victim in how and what way the characters were going to be killed off one by one.I probably would have given this film a ten if it weren't for one of the characters dying unjustly.To close I can just say that I found myself laughing out loud in disbelief of how the death scenes were carried out and I must tell you that I loved this movie and it will definitively un jade you in a big hurry."
"Garand_EMT","7","0","1","25 March 2003"," Would have been better if it weren't for the boom mic..
","Final Destination 2 was in fact better then the previous.  More blood, thicker plot, and no cheap running gimmick.  They explained what happened to the 3 survivors of the first movie (when it went to black leaving everyone wondering).<br/><br/>The main fault with the movie was in the editing.  In no less than 4 scenes, the boom microphone is clearly visable. In 2 scenes, it's just poking down into the top of the frame. In one, it came down far enough to ruin what would have been a great scene. In the 4th, the mic was at nose level with the actors. Needless to say, there's probaly a cameraman, mic operator, and editor who'll never work in Hollywood again.<br/><br/>It'll be interesting to see if it is removed when it is put to video!"

","How often do you see a good film wrecked by a absolutely horrible sequel?? Too many to count. Usually the constant recycling of material, the same trademark lines and new characters that seem to replace characters that were brutally murdered in the last movie lead me to believe that it is impossible to up-stage an original. I stand corrected. I went and saw Final Destination 2 last Monday and I was shocked to see that it was just as good as, if not better than Final Destination 1. With a new plan, brand new characters (except Ali Larter) and new and exciting ways to kill people, Final Destination 2 stands as one of the most stable horror/thriller sequels that I have seen in a long time. As a 17 year old, I can be too critical, but I can safely say in this instance ""keep up the great work David R Ellis!!!""<br/><br/>The best bit(if you don't want to know what happens, look away now!!!) was when that pigeon chasing kid got absolutely pancaked by the falling glass and someone in the cinema yelled out ""GET THE MOP!!!"""
"daddysgrlie","9","0","1","21 March 2003"," A very clever sequal!
","It had the most clever way of tying into the first one. It was just as bloody, gory, and exciting as the original, plus a nice little twist. It was a WONDERFUL way to top off the story. Ali Larter delivered a spectacular performance as Clear Rivers, and AJ Cook was perfect for the part of Kimberly. The only thing that I would have liked to see was more sparks between Kimberly and Officer Thomas B."

","dull.<br/><br/>  I myself loved the first movie. The characters were fleshed out enough so you cared for them, and the death scenes were detailed and interesting. I admit I wasn't at the edge of my seat -- it just isn't comfortable there. Now, I went to the movie theater expecting a dull, boring sequel, and I wasn't surprised. Firstly, the characters were dull, and Kimberly came off as a dull and whiney priss. Burke was an interesting character, but they chose not to explore him. (Spoilerness ahead) There were some good parts to this movie. I *loved* that Clear Rivers (Ali Larter) got more screentime, but I was disappointed at her bitchyness. I suppose being locked up for so long and no one being able to say your name right struck a nerve. (it's pronounced claire, not clear.) But a lot of the deaths were lame. Tim (James N. Kirk)'s scenes were interesting, and the tension was really building up, then he gets smashed by a falling sheet of glass. Big whoop, I'm so scared. Another thing, the way Alex was killed was horrible. The mentally strong, lovable character from the first movie is crushed by a falling brick. How creative. Also, the way Clear was killed really p*ssed me off.<br/><br/>    Overall, I give this a 3/10. I truly don't know how ANYONE could find this film decent. WAY too much gore, horrible acting, no character development, and no one can even say Clear's name right for god's sake xx;"

","In the time of Ancient Rome, one could pay a small amount to sit in a coliseum, enjoy a loaf of bread, and watch a human body be ripped apart by a pair of jungle beasts.  After seeing Final Destination Two, I can only conclude that the level of entertainment has actually declined since then.<br/><br/>Director David R. Ellis took over where James Wong, who also directed The One, left off with the sequel to the 2000 film Final Destination.   The film centers around the same idea as the first;  a teen sees the future, saving the lives of several people, and p***ing the hell out of Death, so Death goes out of its way to claim those who had been saved, as it was their time to go.  The teen, Kimberly Corman (A.J. Cook) has a vision of a tremendous and wholly unrealistic two-dozen-car pile-up, caused by falling logs.  The premonition comes to her on the one-year memorial of the plane crash of the Final Destination, so it is the one-year memorial of teen premonitions. The survivors of the crash don't believe there is any connection between themselves and the people who started mysteriously dying after they were saved by a forewarning, until, of course, they start dying.  Kimberly then goes to Clear Rivers (Ali Larter), the sole survivor of Final Destination, and tries to figure out how to cheat and beat death.  Though the title `Final Destination 2' is rather oxymoronic, if not just moronic, the film was made to tie the loose ends of it's predecessor.  The only question I begged to have answered was, `Why?'<br/><br/>If there was somehow a way for one to act one's self out of a paper bag, everyone in the cast would've had to spend eternity with someone's lunch. Somehow they were just unable to handle their jobs of screaming and burying their faces into the person next to them at the sight of someone being crushed by a large glass pain or cut into three pieces by a barbed-wire fence.  I have not seen acting this poor since Queen of the Damned, in which actors went in and out of random lisps and accents as if they knew no one was going to see the film anyway.  The dialogue was exceedingly inane, and it could strongly be felt that writers Jeffrey Reddick, who worked on the original, and J. Mackye Gruber really tried hard to work the word `premonition' into lines, as it had covered all of the commercials.  The writers also tried to work in post-death jokes, as if to lighten the film up for the sub-human audience, reminiscent of the jokes in the film Stir of Echoes, used to break the tension.  The only difference being, of course, the jokes weren't funny.<br/><br/>The visual effects, meant for horror purposes, were both wildly comedic and painfully nauseating.  Deaths that could've been alluded to by leaving the camera in the dying character's point of vision, were shown in all their mindlessness, complete with sound effects, much more disgusting than Alfred Hitchcock's stabbing of a watermelon for the film Psycho, and ruby blood droplets flying high into the air from the improbable ends of characters. Even the car pile-up was designed for blood-hungry viewers, with cars flipping into the air, completely defying the laws of physics, instead of making an attempt to stop at the sight of the blatant pile-up, and two shots of a man screaming while he burns to death, one from a distance and then a close-up.  I will give some credit to Ellis, though, as in one scene, when four of the characters were killed in a field, one did get the feeling that Death was rubbing them out.  However, the death sequence started out with a woman being impaled by a white tube, so the credit given is miniscule.<br/><br/>
This film astounded me.  I had no idea movies were made so poorly.  And it's the number 5 movie at the box office this week.  Way to go, humanity."

","I have to say that this was one of the most entertaining movies I've ever seen.  All of the deaths were very original and gorie, which is refreshing since most of the horror movies that come out today don't have many interesting deaths (with the exception of Jason X, but that's another story).  The plot was very predicatable and after the first 10 minutes or so I knew who was going to live and who was going to die.  ***SPOILER*** I gave it a 1 instead of a 0 though because I thought it was kinda interesting how all of the deaths were connected to the ones in the first movie.  That was kinda unexpected.   ***END SPOILER***  I didn't think the acting was all that bad.  As usual, Tony Todd gave a wonderful performance, but I didn't enjoy Ali Larter very much.  She seemed very wooden and unlikable. ***SPOILER*** I was actually glad when she died.  ***END SPOILER***  All and all it was a very entertaining movie and when I left the theatre I felt a sense of satistfaction that I had not felt in a long time after seeing a movie.  If you're looking for a great plot and story STAY AWAY.  But if you love gore and want a really entertaining and generally enjoyable movie you MUST see this movie."

","There is 2 elements that clash with this film.  One the horror gore element, and 2nd the philosophy part.  Yes there is a philosophy in this madness. The horror gore element will evolve into the modern Friday the 13th sequals. I can see Final destination 12 years form now with young people dieing in more dramatic fashions with each film.  Instead of a Goalie mask, and the woods as the fear stimulus, we got death and fate against us.  The first film was wimpy, especially the lead character, the new film picks up speed, and believe me the momentum will pick up with each film.  The pilosophy part of the film is about fate or absolutism verses free will and choice.  I believe if Death has a design and people out living there fate makes a time ripple against its own ends there would be no way to stop it, and the characters efforts would be useless.  The film makers create chaos theory were random event can create an order that has great effects on individuals. The plate of pasta, and the gas turn off would be 2 examples of this.  The film has its usual gross outs, and sick humor.  In the end, I give it a 7/10"
